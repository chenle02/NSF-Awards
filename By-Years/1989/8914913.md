5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the first committed intermediate in the
biosynthesis of the hemes, chlorophylls, corrins and other naturally-occurring
cyclic and linear tetrapyrrolic compounds. In animals, yeast and some bacteria,
ALA is synthesized from glycine and succinyl CoA (C4 pathway). In higher plants,
algae and cyanobacteria it is synthesized from glutamate (C5 pathway). It had
been assumed that E. coli followed the C4 pathway, but it has been shown
conclusively, using radiolabelling experiments, that E. coli uses the C5
pathway, although it can use a foreign C4 pathway gene when it is introduced on
a plasmid. This project will (1) isolate and characterize mutants in ALA
biosynthesis, (2) use them to clone the C5 pathway genes, (3) identify and
characterize the gene products, (4) reconstitute and characterize the C5
enzymatic pathway, and (5) use in vivo and in vitro techniques to study levels
of control (transcriptional, translational and enzymatic) of ALA biosynthesis in
E. coli. Heme is a necessary component of a number of important biological
compounds. Chlorophyll and hemoglobin are two examples of heme proteins. This
research will examine the early steps of heme biosynthesis in order to better
understand the components of the pathway and its regulation. These studies are
important agriculturally because of the potential for improved crop yields
through greater protosynthetic efficiency. It will also be of value in the
medical field where an understanding of heme biosynthesis is necessary to the
understanding of genetic disorders which are associated with the pathway.
