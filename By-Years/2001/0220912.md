This dissertation investigates how the social ties created by students in
university settings affect their values and are, in turn, affected by those
changing values. 512 entering students were surveyed about their values using
questions from the World Values Survey and the General Social Survey.
Information about their social networks was also collected based on questions
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AdHealth).
Approximately 100 of these students were followed up with a more detailed
e-survey about how networks are formed and change. A second wave of data
collection will be undertaken to document changes in networks and values. These
data will be supplemented by 30 in-depth interviews to explore the subjective
aspects of network formation and change. Foreign students are a particular focus
in these data since their values are expected to undergo the most change. The
principal hypotheses specify a relationship between increased network diversity
and changes towards more individualistic and relativistic norms, especially on
topics such as gender and tolerance.
