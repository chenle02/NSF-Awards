This award supports cooperative research in surface engineering and tribology
between Dr. Leon M. Keer of Northwestern University and Drs. K.L. Johnson and
J.E. Field of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. The objectives are to
develop a methodology for measuring adhesion of hard coatings on substrates for
optimum resistance against wear and delamination, and to develop a theoretical
model for predicting failure of soft thin films, such as aluminum on silica. Dr.
Keer's recent research on hard coatings suggests quantitative methods for
measuring their bond strength on substrates. He proposes to conduct further
experimental measurements to determine their mechanical properties and further
his theoretical analysis in partnership with Dr. Field's group at Cambridge's
Cavendish Laboratory. This group's research on stress distribution, residual
stresses and mechanical properties of hard coatings fits in well with Keer's
research. In collaboration with Dr. Johnson, Keer proposes to develop a failure
model for soft thin film and fracture mechanics using elastic- plastic analysis.
He is a leading exponent of the elastic approach while Johnson has dealt with
the plastic deformation of materials. This project effectively combines the
complementary expertise and different scientific approaches of leading
researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom. The results of their joint efforts
will have substantial impact on microelectronic stress analysis and design and
will advance understanding of surface engineering.
