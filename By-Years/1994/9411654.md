ABSTRACT K. C. Liddell This is a study of the electrodeposition of
compositionally modulated alloys. Electrochemical and electron microprobe
measurements provide complementary data on composition gradients in the
multilayer copper-nickel system, a model for commercial magnetic data-storage
systems. Rotating ring disk electrode techniques enable in-situ measurements of
deposition rate and purity of an alloy in real time; however, such measurements
are radially integrated. Microprobe measurements show of composition as a
function of radial position for a given layer and deposit thickness. The
experimental results are used to validate models of electrodeposition.
Electrodeposition shows great promise as a flexible and inexpensive means of
producing nanostructured compositionally modulated alloys. This is of especial
current interest for production of high-quality magnetic recording heads and
related data-storage applications. However, the relationships between process
variables and product properties are not understood well enough to permit
optimization of electrodeposition processes based on first principles. This
study is intended to make such optimization less empirical.
