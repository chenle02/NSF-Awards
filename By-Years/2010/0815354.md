Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the
sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds. In certain other
animals, however, sex is determined by environmental temperature (TSD). Among
turtle species, however, examples of both types of sex determination can be
found. It remains unclear, however, how and why different sex determining
mechanisms exist. This collaborative project will help fill this gap by
comparing the chromosomes and sex-related genes of turtles using XX/XY, ZZ/ZW,
or TSD mechanisms for sex determination. Particularly, this research will test
whether (1) all sex chromosomes in turtles derive from a common ancestral pair
of non-sex chromosomes (or "autosomes"), and whether (2) the molecular evolution
of genes located on turtle sex chromosomes differs from that of the same genes
in TSD turtles, in which there are no sex chromosomes- i.e., whether the
sequences of genes located on sex chromosomes change differently over
evolutionary time than do the sequences of the same genes when they are located
on autosomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate undergraduate
discovery-based learning for undergraduates into the field and lab modules of
this project and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in
biology by providing direct training opportunities for students and their
mentors, by engaging women and minorities through outreach activities, and by
providing further opportunities for both the investigators to serve as role
models for minorities.
