9222487 Reisman The Solid State Division of the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University, the Center for
Microelectronics at the MCNC, and the British Oxygen Company will conduct a
coordinated research program dealing with the science assciated with the
deposition of germanoborophosphosilicate glass (or oxides) to form nanostructure
composites using LPCVD and PECVD. ***
