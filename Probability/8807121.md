The principal investigator will continue his study of the upper and lower tail
behavior of vector valued Brownian motion. Results in this direction can be used
for estimating the behavior of other Gaussian processes such as a two parameter
Kiefer process. The oscillatory behavior of these processes is studied via the
discrepancy between collections of sample paths and certain non-random set
functions. The non-random set functions are metric entropy of balls in the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Brownian motion. Error rates for the
convergence of the processes to their cluster sets and the approximate density
of sample path collections is established. The research will contribute to the
observable regularities within a widely-studied framework involving long-time
chaos.
