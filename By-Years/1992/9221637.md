The objective of this project is to build an instrument that will allow rapid
evolution of sharp and special purpose tips for scanning probe microscopes. This
new instrument integrates a scanning probe microscope with a scanning electron
microscope and ion mill for preparing, imaging and using probe tips. Of special
interest are processes involving decomposition of gases and liquid films to form
hard tips, ferroelectric tips, and magnetic tips. The significance is that
almost all scanning probe measurements, expecially with the atomic force
microscope, are limited now by the tip. For the atomic force microscope, there
is no instrument presently available that allows researchers to do rapid tip
development. The system proposed here will allow super tips to be optimized
rapidly, a benefit to many users of the atomic force microscope.
