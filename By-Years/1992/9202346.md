Spatial heterogeneity has been shown to exert a strong influence on population
and evolutionary dynamics. The nature of the spatial structure as well as
intrinsic characteristics of the population affects the dynamics. Using
techniques from population genetics and ecological theory, the effects of
spatial structure on host-pest interactions, specifically plant-herbivore or
plant-pathogen systems, will be modeled. Questions of the evolution of
resistance of plants and the potential for the spread of pests will also be
addressed. The P.I. will incorporate into these models the nature of spatial
structure; characteristics of the plant population such as the mating system,
local adaptation, and dispersal ability; and characteristics of the pest such as
host specificity and dispersal patterns. In addition, these models will be
applied using the well studied system of Brassica campestris to obtain realistic
bounds on parameter values and make quantitative predictions. These models will
also be used to develop qualitative predictions for managed plant systems.
