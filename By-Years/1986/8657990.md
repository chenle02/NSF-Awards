Research will be conducted in aerodynamics as applied to aeronautical vehicles.
The work will encompass transonic, steady/unsteady aerodynamics of high-speed
aircraft, helicopters, and turbomachinery, as well as low-speed aerodynamics of
small remotely-piloted vehicles and human-powered aircraft. The research will
also examine computational fluid dynamics and its impact on the design
methodology of flight vehicles.
