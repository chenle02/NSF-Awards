The 2012 Contemporary Combinatorics conference will be held on the 17th and 18th
of May at the University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. The Institute of
Combinatorics at the University of Memphis will again host the event in honor of
Paul Erdos's past work and relationship with the founding members of the
Institute. In bringing together a group of accomplished researchers loosely
connected to Combinatorics, the PI hopes to continue to extend the rare
opportunity to interactively experience the power and richness of mathematical
inquiry to the Mid South community and surrounding areas. This region now has
access to a high class conference, much like those which are plentiful (and
expensive) on the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast. The formula
whereby personal contacts between the lecturers and the other participants is
greatly encouraged has been very successful will continue to be an important
element of the 2012 meeting. This year's conference features three major
segments: The foundational lecture about the Paul Erdos and his work, two Paul
Erdos Lectures, and a Combinatorics Conference with excellent invited speakers.

The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding
mathematicians who work on topics related to combinatorics, understood in the
widest sense. There will be two main speakers: Vaughan Jones and Avi Wigderson.
Jones is a distinguished professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University who
is best known for his work on von Neumann algebras, knot polynomials and
conformal field theory, in particular, for the 'Jones polynomial' of a knot. He
was awarded a Fields Medal in 1990. Jones will give a talk on the connection
between combinatorics and knot theory. The second major speaker, Wigderson, is
not only an excellent pure mathematician, but also one of the best practitioners
of theoretical computer science. Wigderson received the Nevanlinna Prize in 1994
for his work on computational complexity. He will give a lecture on the intimate
connection between combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The speakers
at this conference have been chosen because they are excellent mathematicians,
enjoyable lecturers, and very approachable people. In addition to Jones and
Wigderson, the speakers include Maria Chudnovsky, Henry Cohn, Eyal Lubetsky,
Alan Frieze, and Jacob Fox. The audience will be composed of people from a
variety of backgrounds with varying levels of expertise: postdocs, graduate
students to senior level academics, and industry researchers from all over the
world.
