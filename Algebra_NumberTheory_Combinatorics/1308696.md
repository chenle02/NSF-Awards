A workshop on "Cohen-Lenstra Heuristics" will take place April 3-5, 2013 at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. This is part of the annual Oliver Atkin
Memorial Lecture and Workshop at UIC. The theme of the workshop is the Cohen-
Lenstra heuristics for class groups of quadratic fields, and their recent
connections to other areas of mathematics, most notably topology. The organizers
of this workshop are Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at Chicago)
and Akshay Venkatesh (Stanford). The invited speakers are Thomas Church
(Stanford), Jordan Ellenberg (University of Wisconsin), Wei Ho (Columbia), Andy
Putman (Rice), Arul Shankar (IAS), Frank Thorne (South Carolina), Jacob
Tsimerman (Harvard), Akshay Venkatesh (Stanford), Craig Westerland (Melbourne),
and Melanie Matchett Wood (University of Wisconsin).

Class groups and class numbers are of fundamental importance in number theory
and have been the subject of intense research since 19th century starting with
the foundational works of Gauss. Cohen-Lenstra Heuristics are a series of
surprising conjectures that predict the finer behaviors of these objects in the
quadratic field setting. Bringing together experts working in the area will
create an environment in which to exchange ideas and to start new projects,
leading to a better understanding of these fundamental objects.
