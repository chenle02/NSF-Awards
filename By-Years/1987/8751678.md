The main goals of the project are to offer intensive instruction in computing
and algorithmic mathematics to sixty secondary school teachers and to help them
in extending the ideas and knowledge obtained in the project to many more
teachers in their respective school districts. This is to take place over a
period of two summer sessions along with an individualized guided home study
program during the intervening academic year when the participants are to extend
the subject matter presented in the first summer session. The participants are
to maintain close written and telephone contact with the project faculty and
staff to help the participants implement the new ideas in their schools.
Additional follow-up activity during the year includes a two day miniconference
to discuss the teaching of computer science and algorithmic mathematics and to
provide the participants with intensive supervised hands-on instruction. There
is to be widespread dissemination activities of the project activities to reach
a wider audience extending the direct contact with the 60 initial participants.
There is to be academic credit at the undergraduate level as well as the post
graduate level equivalent to 20 upper division quarter hours.
