This project investigates novel computational methods and interventions that
might alleviate the suffering caused by complex diseases. Our disease model is
the selective killing of cancer cells, but the algorithms developed might also
have more general uses for the therapy of other complex
diseases.&lt;br/&gt;Emerging biological computing paradigms require control of
highly non-linear complex networks that remain incompletely characterized. In
particular, drug intervention can be seen as control of signaling in cellular
networks and thus as information processing. Identification of control
parameters presents an extreme challenge due to the combinatorial explosion of
control possibilities in combination therapy and to incomplete knowledge of the
systems biology of cells. In this project, we design algorithms that identify
optimal control parameters in cellular networks based on a quantitative
characterization of control landscapes, maximizing utilization of incomplete
knowledge of the state and structure of intracellular networks. We apply our
methods to the control of signal processing that leads to the life/death
decision of a cell. In many applications, this control has to be selective. For
example, the response to a cytotoxic therapy targeted at cancer cells should
ideally occur with minimal response in the normal cells. We define this desired
response as selective cell death. The use of new technology for high-throughput
measurements, which only recently has become available to academic researchers,
is key to this research and essential for the characterization of control
landscapes and implementation of the algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
