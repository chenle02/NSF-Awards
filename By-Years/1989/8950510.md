This equipment grant provides six computer science scholar workstations, three
SUN and three Macintosh A/UX, each equipped with the UNIX operating system and
linked to an existing faculty research computing network. This project supports
primarily the Senior Thesis Option of the newly enhanced curriculum for the
computer science major, and is intended to motivate students toward graduate
work in the field. The institution is providing matching funds in an amount
equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
