Jennifer L.Mandel Ohio State University The doctoral dissertation research will
examine the ways in which African women cope with economic stress through a
multiple enterprise economic strategy (MEES). Multiple jobs will be undertaken
to meet the individual's own needs and those of her family. The main question to
be addressed is: under what conditions and what configuration of economic
activities will MEES be used for accumulation rather than survival? It is
hypothesized that this depends on opportunity structures, access to resources,
and the degree of mobility. The methodology includes an initial gathering of
secondary materials in Paris and Cotonou, Benin. In addition a census of small
traders in the main and daily markets in Porto Novo, Benin will be undertaken to
obtain economic characteristics and demographic information. Focus groups and in
depth interviews will be gathered from a smaller sample of the population of
traders to gather economic and life history data. The results will shed new
light on the way in which women cope in difficult economic environments and
situations.
