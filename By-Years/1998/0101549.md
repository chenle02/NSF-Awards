&lt;br/&gt;To date, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has certified
aircraft technicians under its Federal Aviation Regulations. These regulations
dictate curriculum and testing procedures for schools that prepare Airframe
(aircraft structure) and Powerplant (engines) Technicians. Advancements in
aircraft systems, structures and engines without regulatory updates and the
current shortage of technicians, demand aggressive measures to improve and
expand the current system of preparing aircraft
technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is serving as a catalyst for
systemic change in the preparation of aircraft technicians by bringing together
many organizations that have the capacity to influence change on a national
basis. As a major step to involve partners, the project is organizing a national
conference whose focus is to develop a plan for aircraft technician reform,
addressing the basic mathematics and science requirements as well as the
specific skills and curriculum for avionics, airframe, and other related
aviation specialties. In particular, the topics to be considered include
certification standards and procedures, curricula including both core and
technical courses, internship programs, access to instructional technology,
student recruitment, and faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second goal
of this project is the development and testing of three courses -- electrical
connectors, communication, and navigation. The initial testing of these courses
is with incumbent technicians. After the initial trouble shooting, the courses
are being introduced as credit courses setting the foundation for new aircraft
electronics certification programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
