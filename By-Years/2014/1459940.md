This project studies the long-term causal effects of early childhood economic
circumstances on adult economic well-being. It examines whether children born
into economically distressed areas of the U.S. have persistently worse outcomes
in adulthood relative to others, and whether access to the safety net as a child
ameliorates or exacerbates some of these disadvantages. In doing so, this
project hopes to shed light on the degree to which public programs (including
the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC), Head Start, and Food Stamps) play the role of a social safety net in
terms of protecting individuals against the long-term consequences of economic
disadvantages in early childhood. To answer these questions, this project uses
newly available administrative data on a large fraction of the United States
workforce that combines information on individuals' dates and places of birth
together with information on their annual earnings and employment observed well
into their 30s and 40s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research attempts to uncover
some of the long-run consequences of growing up in an economically distressed
location in the U.S. These results may have important implications for the
recent cohorts of children affected by the Great Recession and contribute to the
understanding of the persistence in inequality as well as intergenerational
transmission of economic well-being in the U.S. Moreover, this project may help
improve the understanding of the benefits and relative efficacy of some of the
largest social safety net programs in the United States, which target a large
and vulnerable population. The results from this project will be disseminated
through forums linking policymakers, the public, and the academic community. The
data and programs generated from this research will be available to other
researchers, enabling further research on the long-run consequences of early-
life disadvantages in the U.S.
