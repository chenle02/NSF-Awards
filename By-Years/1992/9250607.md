This project offers a new hands-on laboratory course in Advanced Ceramics
Processing, to complement the lecture course that is now required. The
laboratory offers a distinctly hands-on course as an elective to be taken by
over 40 students each year. To accomplish this, three high-quality, durable,
user-friendly items of equipment are being acquired. A zeta potential analyzer
quantitatively characterizes the interactions between particles. A spray dryer
provides experiments in various powder preparation methods and for the
preparation of special powders. An injection molding apparatus enables students
to explore the variables and fabricate small items using the injection molding
process. These experiments are combined with others that can be performed with
presently available equipment. This project has two major pedagogical effects:
(1) the students are able to extend classroom ideas to a hands-on laboratory
experience; and (2) a stronger processing-properties relationship is
established.These equipment items bring to a critical mass the amount of
equipment needed to offer this important laboratory course in advanced ceramics
processing.
