This project enhances the aeronautical instructional capability at this
institution. Students are exposed to the phenomena associated with aeronautical
design and analysis through experiments using a highly instrumented wind tunnel.
The wind tunnel is sufficiently large to produce flow conditions that allow
wings which utilize modern airfoil sections (e.g., NASA General Aviation
section) to behave properly and instrumentation of the wind tunnel that causes
minimal interference with flow over the models. Students in the aeronautical
option who utilize this lab are prepared for industrial careers in the field of
aeronautical engineering. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
