The summer research projects which these undergraduates will undertake will
involve library, field and laboratory investigation. Emphasis will be on
independent work by the student under the guidance and in the direct field of
interest of the research supervisor. Each student will have his or her own
research project to work on, and each students accomplishments will be presented
in a formal written report, as well as at a professional meeting if possible.
This is a continuation of a successful REU-Site program held last year at
William and Mary, and as then reserch projects will be on the geology of the
Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Valley and Ridge provinces of Virginia.
