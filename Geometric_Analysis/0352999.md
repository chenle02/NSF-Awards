This proposal is in the spirit of Hilbert's Eighteenth problem, to study the
symmetries of the optimally dense packings, by spheres or polyhedra, of
Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of general dimension. Very few particular such
packing problems have ever been solved, but our goal is more directed to study
such problems as a class, to specify them so that they are well-posed, with
reasonable conditions for existence and uniqueness, and in particular to then
study the symmetries of the solutions. This work is motivated in part by the
discovery of aperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tilings of the plane by the
kite and dart polygons, tilings which can be understood as solutions of such a
packing problem. The symmetries of aperiodic tilings have long been connected
with the mathematics of ergodic theory, using either the translation group or
the full congruence group of the space being tiled as the dynamics. The symmetry
of the tilings has then been related to the conjugacy class of the associated
dynamical system. Several questions are proposed here about the symmetry of
packing problems, some directed at general qualitative behavior and some
directed at important special cases. For instance, it is proposed to show that
the symmetry of the densest packings of a hyperbolic space by spheres of fixed
radius is different for different radii. (It is already known that for most
radii the densest packings are aperiodic - they cannot have crystallographic
symmetry.) And more generally it is proposed to show that a "generic" packing
problem, in Euclidean or hyperbolic space, only has optimal solutions which are
not crystallographic.

Anyone who has tried to squeeze as many pennies as possible onto a tabletop has
seen that the most efficient arangement is also very symmetrical, with six
pennies surrounding each. The similar problem for efficient packings of spheres
in space also leads to high symmetry. But there is almost nothing known about
precisely why, in general, efficiency leads to symmetry, and what kinds of
symmetry are possible. Twenty years ago a new metallic alloy was discovered, a
physical solution to a closely related optimization problem, and the alloy was
found to possess a symmetry the nature of which is much less obvious, or, put
another way, in which the mathematics of the symmetry is less well developed.
This proposal concerns the study of the symmetries of efficient arrangements in
space of spheres and polyhedra and in particular the development of a
mathematical formalism in which such symmetries can be usefully analyzed.
Particular questions about the nature of efficient packings of spheres are also
specified.
