The objective of this project is to investigate the development of nonlinear
baroclinic waves and three-dimensional frontogenesis in situations where a basic
jet and a conditionally moistured zone coexist. The semi-Lagrangian coordinate
transformation and the finite element method will be used to solve the three-
dimensional moist semi-geostrophic equations. The results are expected to shed
light on the formation of stratiform precipitation and frontal rainbands, and
their effects on the evolution of the frontal zone.
