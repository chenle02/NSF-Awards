The project will investigate the dynamical mechanisms maintaining tropopause
height and its permeability in the extratropical latitudes. Understanding the
formation, maintenance, and kinematics of the midlatitude tropopause remains a
core, challenging problem in dynamic meteorology. Recent interest in its dynamic
permeability stems from its considerable impact on transport of chemical
constituents, including ozone and water vapor, between the troposphere and
stratosphere. Dr. Nakamura (U of Chicago) will investigate the problem both
theoretically and numerically. Numerical calculations with quasi-geostrophic and
general circulation models will expand the theoretical analysis of the
advection-diffusion equation to more realistic scenarios, including one
involving penetration of the tropopause by the eddy potential vorticity fluxes.
The project will advance theoretical understanding of the dynamical interaction
of the troposphere and stratosphere, and should provide separate estimates of
the stratosphere-to-troposphere, and troposphere-to-stratosphere mass transfers,
which will improve modeling and prediction of cross-tropopause transports of
trace gases and substances.
