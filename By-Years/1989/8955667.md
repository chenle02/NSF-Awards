multidisciplinary, Young Scholars project for 60 students in grades 10,11,12.
This program features hands-on scientific and mathematical investigations,
including overnight field trips to science-related facilities and locations.

teaching methods are utilized. The Magnet School provides study in the fields of
chemistry, physics, mathematics, microbiology, geology, environmental science,
and computer science. Students select one of three programs of study. Follow-up
activities include classroom presentations by participants, development of
science fair projects, telecommunication presentations and a newsletter.
