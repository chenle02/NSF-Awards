The long term objective is to develop integrated software systems for
automation of design, engineering, and manufacturing tasks--a technology that is
needed for the computer integrated factory of the future. This requires the
development of product databases that contain the totality of information
related to all aspects of the product. The proposed Expert Solid Modeling Shell
will provide a high level environment for developing and documenting such a
database. The shell concept and object-centered programming technique are
borrowed from expert system technology to provide a system that can be
customized to user needs. This will allow designers to define properties of
features they wish to work with, to instantiate these from a library and to
manipulate them as desired. "Intelligence" will be imparted by three sets of
rules: Cognition, Inheritance, and Interpretation. Cognition rules will be used
for detecting invalid operations; Inheritance rules for deriving feature
parameter values from parents: Interpretation rules for decoding information
required by an interface while building its own multi-layered database
incorporating feature relationships and descriptions. Feature taxonomy codes
will be used by a post- processing program to convert design features to
manufacturing features so that product data can be used to drive automated
process planning, group technology classification and manufacturability
evaluation programs, etc.
