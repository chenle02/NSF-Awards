This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the
research of Drs. Gust and Moore at Arizona State University. The research deals
with the design, synthesis and study of the photochemistry of multicomponent
molecular systems which mimic natural photosynthetic electron and energy
transfer processes. The systems which will be studied consist of porphyrins(P),
carotenoid polyenes(C), quinones(Q) and electron donor molecules(D) joined
together by chemical linkages which control the relative separation and
orientation of the various moeities. The choice of moeity and linkages
determines the function of the system. One of the proposed systems, of the form
C-P-P-Q, is expected to undergo photoinitiated electron transfer which should
ultimately lead to a long-lived energetic charge separated species. Another
molecule of the type D-C-P-P-Q may be capable of demonstrating a stepwise two-
electron charge separation. The broad objectives of the research are to help us
understand how natural photosynthetic energy and electron transfer occur, to
apply the basic chemistry and physics of photosynthesis to the design of
artificial solar energy harvesting systems, and to develop methods for the
design and synthesis of molecular electronic devices.
