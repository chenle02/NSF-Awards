This research is intended to provide a detailed case study of the social
processes involved in community and household recovery from the October 1987
earthquake in Southern California. The research is longitudinal in design and
will obtain data at two points, 20 and 30 months post- impact. In addition
reconstruction issues and actions will be monitored continuously for the
duration of the project. The project has 5 major objectives: (l) To provide a
description and analysis of the recovery process for both community and
households. (2) To analyze the interrelationships among agencies and
organizations involved in the reconstruction process. (3) To examine recovery
issues and actions at the household level through a longitudinal survey of
heavily damaged households, including aid and insurance utilization. (4) To
describe and analyze the reconstruction process in Whittier in terms of
political processes involved in promoting recovery and mitigation plans, with a
particular focus on interest groups and emergent organizations. (5) To provide a
set of policy recommendations based on the project's findings and to summarize
in a monograph all recent research on the Whittier earthquake. Data will be
gathered using detailed surveys of households, interviews with agency personnel,
political leaders, citizens groups and other community influentials. Interview
data will be supplemented with reports, records and other documentary materials.
