The principal investigators will continue their studies of various mathematical
models of propagating cracks in linear and nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic
materials. For the models of linear materials interest will focus upon dynamic
crack growth in viscoelastic materials and interfacial fractures in both elastic
and viscoelastic materials. For the models of nonlinear materials interest will
focus upon the development and implementation of finite element methods for the
numerical simulation of growing cracks in viscoelastic materials. Crack
propagation phenomena appear in a variety of technologically important areas.
For example, due to the increased use of polymers and polymer-based composites
there is a genuine need for understanding the nature of fracture processes in
viscoelastic materials. In this project the principal investigators will apply
analytical and numerical methods to study the propagation of cracks in
mathematical models of elastic and viscoelastic materials.
