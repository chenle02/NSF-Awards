The PI proposes purchasing a Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer (RDA) for the
measurement of fluids mechanical properties such as steady and oscillatory
viscosity under carefully controlled conditions, and a Rheometries Solids
Analyzer (RSA) for the measurement of solid mechanical properties such as static
and oscillatory elastic and dilatational moduli. The instrument will be used in
several research programs. With the RSA, the coupling between the mechanical and
transport properties of hollow fiber membranes will be investigated, the
mechanical strengths of hydrogels will be characterized as a function of
initiator and crosslinking, and the effect of sorbed gas as a polymer
plasticizer will be investigated. The RDA will be used for studying the effect
of ionic aggregation on the dynamic viscosity of liquid crystalline polymers and
in measuring viscosities in resin cure. The purchase of the rheometers will have
a significant impact on several research groups. The research on hydrogels for
controlled drug delivery is a particularly novel and promising idea. The RSA
will instrument will certainly be necessary for characterizing the strength of
the hydrogels, and this information will be necessary for further technological
development.
