It is generally held that proteins and nucleic acids are the two principle
classes of naturally occurring biomolecules capable of acting as enzymes in
living systems. However, it has also been demonstrated that some cyclic
oligosaccharides can act as catalysts in very simple non-biological in vitro
systems. The goal of this project is to expand upon these observations.
Specifically, this project seeks to demonstrate that cyclic oligosaccharides (in
some organisms under certain circumstances) may not only act as catalysts in
biological systems, but also, as a direct consequence of their enzyme-like
activities, play important and unexpected physiological roles for the organisms
that synthesize them. The observation that naturally occurring oligosaccharides
possess catalytic activities in biological circumstances may have broad and
profound implications for our current understanding of biological chemistry,
cellular enzymology, and evolutionary biology. Moreover, they may enable the
design and exploitation of directed evolutionary or other schemes to generate
families of oligo- and polysaccharide catalysts with novel and useful
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
