This research project examines problems which demand a better understanding of
and analysis of certain reversible and nonreversible Markov chains. In
particular, applying Markov chain techniques to develop approximate algorithms
which solve such problems as: (1) Counting Euler tours, using Monte Carlo
methods; (2) Counting tournaments, using Markov chain techniques. Another aspect
of the project is the step by step proof of a `conjectured` optimal bound for
the expected time for n random walks on a graph to coalesce to a single walk.
The final part of this project focuses on extensions of results on rapidly
mixing reversible Markov chains to nonreversible chains.
