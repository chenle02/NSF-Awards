With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Andrew
Duncan and colleagues Sarah Kirk and Joseph Williamson from Willamette
University will acquire a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
The proposed research spans the disciplines of organic, bioorganic, physical,
and organometallic chemistry. Some examples are the synthesis and
characterization of neomycin/amino acid and tetracaine/cGMP conjugates and
studies of the mechanism of ene-allene ring closing metathesis
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is one
of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This award will also contribute to
the advancement of women in science.
