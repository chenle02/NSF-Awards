This grant is in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program. In this study
an experimental technique will be employed that will deposit transient molecules
at very low temperatures in close proximity to other unstable species so that
novel types of reactivity can be discovered and studied. This is an important
area of research because it will increase our understanding of how the various
electronic properties of highly strained and very reactive organic molecules
influence their reactivity and physical characteristics. Professor Staley has
judicially chosen his series of model compounds so that they are small enough to
be amenable to theoretical study employing high level quantum calculations.
Specifically, he will extend his newly developed gas phase vacuum
dehydrohalgenation synthetic techniques to the preparation of highly unstable
transient molecules at low temperature (-196C) and study their physical
properties with a variety of spectroscopic techniques. He will continue his
interesting studies of molecules that display Mobius delocalization such as the
cycloheptatrienyl anion. His experimental studies will be augmented by advanced
level ab initio molecular orbital calculations.
