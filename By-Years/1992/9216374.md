This support will allow the Field Museum of Natural History to curate,
computerize and incorporate a recent acquisition of an important research
collection of molluscs, the 43,000-lot Hubricht collection. The mullusc
collection at the FMNH, with 4 million specimens in 296,000 lots, is one of teh
largest in the U.S. and is particularly strong in land snails. The project will
have an important impact on research on land snails nationally and
internationally.
