This research involves both theoretical and experimental studies of the effects
of source geometry on free-jet expansions and on kinetic processes in these
expansions. Studies of translational and rotational relaxation of pure and mixed
gases (argon, helium, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide)
determine off-axis properties of the free-jet. Emphasis is placed on the energy
exchange and kinetics of small cluster formation in expansions of sodium and
carbon disulfide including the effect of photo-excited species. Further,
attention is focused on clustering and photo-induced nucleation. Internal energy
relaxation has an important application in laser stability as well as in high-
speed gas dynamics.
