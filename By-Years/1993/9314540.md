Henkart 9314540 This proposal requests continued support for the PI's activities
developing a computer-based seismic processing system (SIOSEIS). The system is
widely used throughout the community, who provide an informal advisory
committee. The proposal describes improvements in display and printing programs
to be done in response to recommendations by the committee. Modifications will
also be made to existing systems in response to specific requests. A feature of
the proposal is testimonials by users at nine institutions, who state that the
system is superior to commercially-available packages.
