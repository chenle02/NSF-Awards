The Agency for Instructional Technology, in partnership with a consortium or
more than 25 state education agencies, is in the process of developing
Mathematics for the '80s, a collection of high-quality video and print materials
that support mathematics teaching in grades 4-6. Materials for grades 4 and 5
have already been developed. This grant will provide partial support for the
development of the grade 6 materials. The project will develop a series of
eighteen 15-minute instructional television programs, together with a teacher's
guide that will include worksheets for students. The series will emphasize
problem-solving and applications. Consortium agencies will distribute the
materials within their states, via public and non-commercial cable television
transmission, for example, and they may authorize off-air recording of the
television programs and duplication of print materials for educational use
within their legal jurisdictions. Nonconsortium agencies will offered an
opportunity to contract with the Agency for similar rights.
