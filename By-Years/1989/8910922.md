This facility will be used for research that necessitates growing higher plants
under controlled environmental conditions in sunlight. A large component of the
usage consists of maintaining transformed plants under conditions in which they
can flower and produce seed as rapidly as possible. This research involves
understanding gene regulation by developmental factors and by environmental
factors. A second major component of the usage is to maintain and propagate
mutant lines used in research on gibberellin metabolism and light regulation of
gene expression. The final major usage is to produce large quantities of normal
plant material from many different species for use in research into tissue
specific gene expression in tobacco, developmentally regulated gene expression
in soybean and in Arabidopsis, the light-harvesting components of photosynthesis
in a number of different species, gibberellin metabolism in maize and sunflower,
and assessing the nitrogen fixing ability of alfalfa and fast-growing nitrogen
fixing trees like Casuarina. Other usage includes the study of gene expression
in response to ethylene and wounding, electrophysiological controls of plant
cell plasma membranes, particularly in regulation of stomata, and the study of
the phytoalexin response in rice.
