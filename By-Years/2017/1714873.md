The outer region of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, contains a few dozen
satellite galaxies. This is surprising because hundreds are predicted by the
prevailing theory of galaxy formation. The smallest satellite galaxies are also
the best places to study the mysterious dark matter. The team will use cutting-
edge observations at optical wavelengths to examine the satellite galaxies. The
observations will help us understand galaxy formation and dark matter. Senior
team members will train junior team members. The research will be featured in
modern exhibits at the historic Mount Wilson Observatory in California. The
exhibits will target elementary and high-school students from underrepresented
groups in low-income areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will obtain spectra
and imaging of the recently-enlarged population of candidate satellite galaxies
of the Milky Way. Their goals are to investigate (1) how many satellites are
dwarf galaxies, (2) their masses and metallicities, (3) the best targets for
indirect detection of dark matter, (4) the differences between dwarf galaxies
originating near the Magellanic Clouds versus those formed closer to the Milky
Way, (5) their orbits around the Milky Way, and (6) their chemical abundance
patterns.
