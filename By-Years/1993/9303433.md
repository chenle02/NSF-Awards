9303433 DeFanti This award is for the establishment of a laboratory for research
on the design, implementation, dissemination, and use of highly interactive
computing technologies for the benefit of computational, biomedical and
engineering sciences. The application areas share the need for very high-speed
data capture and presentation facilities, very high bandwidth communication, and
very large information stores. The research topics to be explored by this
laboratory include the design and implementation of virtual reality
environments; the storage, retrieval, and navigation of very large information
stores; the design and evaluation of user- centered domain-specific, multi-media
applications; and the remote, shared access to specialized instrumentation
resources. The researchers come from the Computer Science Department, the School
of Art and Design, the Department of Electrical Engineering, the Department of
Bioengineering, and the Laboratory for Biomedical visualization. Extensive
collaborations are in place with the National Laboratories. The award provides
for the acquisition of instrumentation to match this research. The laboratory
will consist of the CAVE Virtual Reality Theater, a Database Computing Facility,
an Interactive Multimedia laboratory, and a Networked Remote User Facility. The
instrumentation provided consists of high performance visualization computers,
mass storage devices, and high speed communications equipment.
