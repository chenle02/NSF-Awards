This project addresses advanced materials known as polyphosphazenes, and their
design and synthesis. These electrically conductive polymers could be used in
energy storage devices and lightweight rechargeable batteries. Material
characterization (glass transition temperature, adhesion to metals and
dimensional stability) as well as ionic conductivities will be evaluated. In
addition, molecular characterization, including gel permation chromotography,
and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy will be conducted to identify
molecular weights and distributions and side groups respectively. To examine the
interaction of a polymeric electrolyte and an electrode metal, and between the
traces of water in electrolyte and the electrode, preliminary experiments will
be conducted using electron microscopy techniques. These interactions are a
deciding factor in limiting the lifetimes of batteries over many cycles of
charge and discharge.
