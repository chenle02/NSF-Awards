The PI has described a new technique for the automated analysis of strain in
analog&lt;br/&gt;experiments. Using this technique, he propose to test a series
of published analytical&lt;br/&gt;and numerical models for the behavior of
critical wedges, both Coulomb and viscous,&lt;br/&gt;focusing upon three broad
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-
the conditions for the formation of a double retrowedge,&lt;br/&gt;- the
rheological and geometric constraints on the occurrence of extension in
critical&lt;br/&gt;wedges&lt;br/&gt;- the strain and rotational signatures of a
suite of proposed mechanisms for the formation&lt;br/&gt;of lobate mountain
ranges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this modeling, he will emphasize:&lt;br/&gt;- the
testing of specific predictions for critical wedge behavior based upon numerical
and&lt;br/&gt;analog modeling, and&lt;br/&gt;- relating alternative models for
the creation of arcuate mountain belts to specific&lt;br/&gt;geological
observables (finite strains, slip vectors, geodetic strain rate
patterns,&lt;br/&gt;structural traces) by which models might be discriminated
from each other.
