The goal is to continue the development of advanced numerical methods for
solving particle transport problems. The new methods will be more accurate and
more computationally efficient than current methods. These advances will be
accomplished by employing new mathematical algorithms for the discretization and
iterative solution of deterministic transport problems and new variance -
reduction strategies for Monte Carlo problems, for both scalar and advanced
parallel-architecture computers. For deterministic transport problems,
asymptotic expansions will be used to predict the accuracy of transport
differencing schemes for problems with optically thick spatial cells and to use
these asymptotic results explicitly in a diffusion synthetic acceleration
algorithm so that iterative transport solutions can be obtained very rapidly.
For Monte Carlo problems, a generalization of the exponential transform method
will be developed. This will significantly reduce the computational cost of
Monte Carlo calculations, making these calculations more accurate and less
expensive.
