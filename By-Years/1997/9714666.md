Investigators continue characterizing the composition and dynamics of the upper
thermosphere, exosphere, and topside ionosphere at mid-latitude. The methodology
uses optical, infrared, and radar frequency remotes sensing techniques, in close
association with radiative transport, photoelectron, neutral atmosphere, and
ionospheric modeling. In particular, they hope to improve understanding of ion-
neutral coupling in the topside F-region. Experimental and modeling efforts have
led to new capabilities in measuring the concentrations of all major neutral and
ion species in the topside ionosphere using the clustered instrumentation at the
Arecibo Observatory. This project brings the techniques together, producing a
comprehensive description of the upper thermosphere and lower exosphere.
Scientifically, their focus is (1) the relation between hydrogen abundance in
the topside ionosphere and increased methane in the troposphere, (2) the
relation between hydrogen abundance and magnetic storms, (3) the effects of
charge exchange on neutral hydrogen and oxygen abundances, and (4) the
evaluation of new techniques to determine winds and temperatures in the topside
ionosphere. During six observational campaigns, investigators measurements are
utilizing Fabry-Perot interferometers, photometers, all-sky imagers, and the
incoherent scatter radars at Arecibo and Jicamarca.
