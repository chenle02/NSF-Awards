This is a three year project for 28 exemplary high school biology teachers from
a region within a 200-mile radius of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.
It is designed to implement the following goals: (1) identify and recognize
these teachers for inservice training in research methodology and application of
the inquiry process to teaching high school biology; (2) improve the quality of
education by enhancing the professional competence of biology teachers and to
engage these teachers in all phases of laboratory research, allowing them to
become more confident in practicing science and inquiry approach; (3) offer
these teachers pedagogical training in science teaching strategies to support
the content in teaching high school biology; and (4) honor those teachers in a
socially significant and tangible manner. Fourteen professors of science with
active research programs will serve as mentors and will work with 2 teachers
each for the duration of the project. In this three phase program, teachers will
be given a thorough preparation and background for conducting their research,
will actively work on their research project under the tutelage of their mentor,
and will develop materials that will enable them to carry the results and the
methodology of their research to their students. Rural clusters of experienced
teachers will provide inservice for their peers and the National Association of
Biology Teachers (NABT) electronic bulletin board network will facilitate
dissemination among the teachers and between the teachers and their University
mentors. In addition, coursework of the participant's own choosing is offered
tuition-free by the University.
