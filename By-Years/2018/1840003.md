Science gateways are web-based portals for scientists, educators, and students
to easily access advanced computing infrastructure, perform reproducible
research, and share scientific data. Science gateways are used by tens of
thousands of researchers worldwide; thus, gateways are an increasingly
attractive target for a wide range of cybersecurity attacks. In cybersecurity
terms, science gateways are a collection and integration of a rich set of
assets, including user identities, access to a wide range of third party
computing and storage resources, sensitive data, licensed or otherwise
restricted software, and generated scientific results. The consequences of
compromises to science gateways are wide ranging, including unauthorized access
to computing resources and data as well as more subtle attacks such as
alterations of computed results that may require retraction of publications and
otherwise undermine the integrity of the scientific enterprise.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the integration and extension of best-of-breed
software, the Custos project provides a single, open source software solution
that improves science gateways' management of users identities, secrets such as
security tokens used to access a wide range of resources needed for scientific
research, and groups and sharing permissions on digital research objects created
by science gateway users. Custos software is used to operate a secure, online
service with a language-independent programming interface for the science
gateway community, providing both an operational platform and a proving ground
for research into multi-tenanted, science-focused cyberinfrastructure. The
entire Custos environment, including provisioning and operations tools, is
openly governed following the meritocracy and diversity principles of the Apache
Software Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
