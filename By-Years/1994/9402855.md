9402855 Etter PROJECT ABSTRACT The deep sea is an environment that covers more
than two-thirds of the earth's surface, yet little is known about the processes
that have generated the rich and endemic deep- sea fauna. Molecular techniques
offer a unique method for addressing fundamental ecological and evolutionary
questions that would otherwise by intractable in this remote and alien
environment. This study will quantify geographic variation from existing
collections of deep-sea mollusks using contemporary molecular genetic tools,
document patterns of genetic variation, and test specific hypotheses related to
those patterns. In addition, the research will quantify the population genetic
structure of several species from two important deep-sea taxa (gastropods and
bivalves) arrayed along a depth gradient in the western north Atlantic. Using
patterns of genetic variation, the Principal Investigator will determine if
genetic divergence among conspecific populations decreases with depth
paralleling observed patterns of phenotypic distance. The research will also
provide estimates of gene flow, identify the structure of deep-sea populations
and provide new molluscan-specific primers for use in genetic studies.
