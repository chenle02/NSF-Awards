9412016 Sniderman This project continues research on behalf of a study aimed at
identifying and overcoming barriers to electing African American candidates for
Congress in majority-white districts. The principal portion of the study
concentrates on the reactions of voters to African American candidates for
Congress in white-majority districts and this continuing project provides for
interviews with approximately 250 African Americans to add to the 500 already in
the study. Combining the two provides a sample of sufficient size to permit the
analysis of the views, concerns, aspirations and values of African Americans,
not simply as a convenient contrast with those of white Americans, but in their
own right and in detail. The study thus enables the investigators to explore
issues of race not only from the perspective of whites but from that of African
Americans.
