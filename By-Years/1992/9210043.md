The principal investigator will develop numerical wavelet methods for
multidimensional combustion applications. The aim will be to determine the
feasibility of using the advantages of wavelet methods--data compression,
multiresolution analysis and orthogonality--to effectively address the numerical
difficulties of combustion applications, including significant features on
multiple scales, strong nonlinearity, and moving boundaries or internal layers.
In particular, a preliminary study of the effectiveness of numerical wavelet
methods for one dimensional deflagrations will be carried out as well as the
design of numerical experiments to compare the effectiveness of wavelet methods
to current discretization methods for significant multidimensionsal combustion
applications. The necessity of limiting combustion caused environmental
pollution and the transportation of combustible materials, for example, require
an improved understanding of the combustion process. These new numerical
techniques offer new promise for such improved understanding.
