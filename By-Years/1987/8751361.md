The objective of this research is to explore a few of the key cognitive
science, educational, and software engineering issues surrounding the
development of effective, computer-based, instructional systems. This
exploration will take place in the context of building and evaluating a
specific, computer-based, instructional system-DEBUG-ASSISTANT. It will provide
high-school students with instant, on-line feedback on the non- syntactic bugs
in their Pascal programs. In order to build a system capable of coping with (1)
a semester's worth of assignments, and (2) the significant variability found in
students' programs, a key question in cognitive science will be explored: can
bugs and variability be predicted for a domain as complex as programming? In
classroom tests of the DEBUG-ASSISTANT the educational utility of providing
students with this type of on-line assistance will be examined. Finally, issues
of interface design for educational software and software engineering practices
as they relate to building modifiable, expert systems will be explored. While
preliminary research suggests that bugs and variability can be predicted, and
that providing feedback is educationally beneficial, the use of the DEBUG-
ASSISTANT will enable an investigation of these issues in a more systematic and
rigorous fashion. This effort will be conducted in cooperation with
administrators, teachers and students of the New Haven School System.
