This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. This
project is entitled "The Role of HSP 70 Homologues in Protein Translocation into
and Within Higher Plant Chloroplasts". The research Fellowships in Plant Biology
are granted to applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish
to extend their training in new techniques and to those trained in molecular or
cellular techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants. These
fellowships are designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists
in plant biology.
