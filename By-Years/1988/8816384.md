Dr. Ho continues to study the molecular basis of transport processes in cell
membranes by characterizing the molecular structures of and intermolecular
interactions between individual membrane-associated components. The active
transport of L- glutamine in membrane vesicles of E. Coli will be used as a
model for investigating the essential processes in active transport, namely
recognition, translocation, recovery and energy coupling. Techniques to be used
include molecular genetics, X-ray crystallography and NMR. Cell membranes are
the site of a large number of biological processes. Thus, knowledge of their
molecular biology is one of the most important and active areas of research at
the present time. An understanding of the molecular organization and dynamic
interactions of the protein and lipid components of membranes is essential for a
detailed description of a wide variety of normal and pathological cellular
processes.
