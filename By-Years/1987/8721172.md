There are two main thrusts to the research. The first is to support
collaboration between the Principal Investigator and Professor Claude Allegre,
University of Paris, on the interpretation of isotopic and other geochemical
data in terms of mantle convection and related processes. The object is to
understand how mantle dynamics leads to the geochemical signatures of mid ocean
ridge basalt, ocean island basalts, island arc volcanism, and continental
volcanism. Important questions include: Is mantle convection layered? Is there
significant recycling of continental crust into the mantle? Is the layered,
subducted oceanic lithosphere remixed into the upper mantle reservoir? The
hypothesis that high-temperature peridotites are examples of a "marble-cake"
mantle will be studied with a combination field, laboratory, and theoretical
studies. A second major thrust of the proposed research is to support
collaboration between the Principal Investigator and Professor David Spence,
Imperial College, on the mechanics of magma fracture. Magma fracture is a major
mechanism for the transport of magma as well as the origin of dikes and sills.
It is also the mechanism responsible for maars and kimberlite eruptions.
Buoyancy driven magma fractures will be studied as will the thermal aspects of
magma migration in propagating fractures.
