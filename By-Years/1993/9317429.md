9317429 Garrison This project is in the area of surface science and focusses on
the development of a firm theoretical understanding of chemical reactions at
surfaces induced by energetic particle bombardment. During the tenure of this
three-year continuing grant, Professor Garrison and her students will model keV
particle bombardment of small organic molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces which
are of catalytic interest, surface induced dissociation processes in which a
30-200 eV organic molecule strikes a surface, and finally the keV particle
bombardment of thin films including self assembled monolayers and polymers. The
emphasis will be on examining reactions that occur during each of these events
and then relating the fundamental processes to experimental observations. %%%
This research brings modern surface theory and computational chemistry to bear
on understanding of how particle bombardment causes chemical reactions at
surfaces. Models derived in the course of this work will be important to
progress in the study of complex materials as diverse as catalysts, organic thin
films, and biological cells. ***
