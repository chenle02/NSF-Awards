This action provides support of a workshop that brings together industry,
government and academia to develop a "blueprint" for an "economic engine" that
will focus and drive this Nation's technological advances for the development of
the resources of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. To date, the potentially
great rewards from development of EEZ resources by the private sector have been
greatly inhibited by the scale of risks of such candidate projects. This
workshop will consider a wide range of incubator mechanisms that would promote
such ventures or enterprises by combining the resources and efforts of
government, industry, academic, and public interest groups.
