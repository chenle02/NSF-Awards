The development of a pattern of differentiated cell types from a group of
equivalent cells is a fundamental paradigm in biology. In bacteria, the
differentiation of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts from a filament of vegetative
cells by some cyanobacteria represents one of the few examples of a
developmental pattern that can be maintained indefinitely given the appropriate
environmental conditions. It represents a simple model system for elucidation of
the minimal set of genetic elements that are necessary for pattern generation
and maintenance by an organism. Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is a filamentous
cyanobacterium that can be induced to differentiate a pattern of nitrogen-fixing
heterocysts from a chain of undifferentiated vegetative cells. Heterocysts
occur, on average, at 10 cell intervals, are terminally differentiated, and
differ from vegetative cells morphologically, metabolically, and genetically.
The first objective of the project is the identification and characterization of
genetic elements that are involved in development. A mutagenic approach will be
pursued using a genetically engineered strain of Anabaena 7120 that can be
induced to form close to 100% heterocysts under conditions that do not require
differentiation for growth. The second objective of the project is to test two
hypotheses that relate to inhibition of differentiation by the gene hetN. The
third objective is the identification and characterization of additional genes
that are necessary for inhibition of differentiation by hetN. This project is
narrowly focused on the genetics of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria,
but the broader biological impact will be on differentiation and pattern
formation in general.
