Chemistry (12) Problem based experiments utilizing High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) are being implemented
in the Whittier College chemistry department curriculum in courses ranging from
organic chemistry and quantitative analysis to biochemistry, instrumental
analysis, and our capstone course, the integrated laboratory. In these
experiments, students are provided with an appropriate amount of background
information and then given a particular problem to solve. They are expected to
develop an experimental design, collect and interpret data, and troubleshoot
their procedures as necessary. In the highest-level course, the integrated
laboratory, students are expected to be more self sufficient and independent.
Here they develop a project starting with the conception and background research
of the problem to be solved and then implement a self designed project. In these
multi-week experiments, students are gaining experience with key separations
techniques, HPLC and CE, which are so important to many areas of chemistry.
These laboratory experiments are helping students get a better sense of the
scientific method, developing their research and problem solving skills, and
improving their conceptual understanding of separations methods and
applications.
