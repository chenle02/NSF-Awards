This research will - by the use of a combined analytical, computational and
experimental (ACE) study - investigate the initiation of cracks along bimaterial
interfaces with increasing shear. The relative importance of potential
mechanisms in the toughening of a glass/epoxy interface will be examined,
employing a single specimen subjected to biaxial loads. Measurements of applied
displacements, corresponding reactions, and normal crack opening displacements
will be made. This work is expected to increase our understanding of the various
mechanisms of toughening that are associated with mixed- mode interfacial crack
initiation. Such an understanding could lead to a rational design or tailoring
of interfaces in composite materials, microelectronic devices, coatings and
adhesively bonded joints.***//
