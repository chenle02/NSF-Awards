Recent results around the 'sum-product' and 'product-phenomena' in various
fields, rings and groups lead to progress on an amazing number of issues,
ranging from computer science to representation theory. The purpose of the
proposal is to explore further several types of questions that underlie these
applications, in particular the 'product-phenomena' in matrix spaces and the
'expanding properties' of algebraic functions on finite fields. The problems in
the proposal are mainly continuing a line of research (in particular by the PI)
that turned out to have rather unexpected applications besides their intrinsic
interest from the combinatorial point of view. Indeed, purely combinatorial (and
basically elementary) techniques brought progress on issues that had stalled for
quite some time, such as on the expander properties of certain 'thin' SL2 Caley
graphs, and the 'expanding properties' of algebraic functions on finite fields.
