A joint program of work is proposed between Florida Atlantic University and
Carnegie-Mellon University to develop an underwater three dimensional vision
system for intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles. The main thrust of the
work will be in the development of algorithms for the processing of the signal
from a multiple element SONAR array to generate a grid representation of the
ocean bottom terrain and the development of map building algorithms to generate
a coherent map of the terrain and use the representation for navigation, object
recognition and classification, and path planning. The present types of SONAR
systems in general generate two dimensional information or if three dimensional
information is generated, the resolution is rather poor. Thus, an innovative
SONAR system is to be developed that differs from other SONAR systems its in its
mode of operation, relying more on data processing which will allow the
extraction of three dimensional information with high resolution and with a
refresh rate controlled only by the speed of the processing unit. The basic
approach of the signal processing consists of multi-dimensional discrete Fourier
transforms, in time and space, of the acoustic signals received by the multi-
element receiver array of the SONAR system. The processing will first generate
angle-angle-range data which is then converted to a discrete representation of
the ocean bottom terrain. The main tasks of the map building process will be the
data handling and the matching of data structures acquired from different
vehicle locations and orientations relative to the terrain and the extraction of
high level features such as object location, object type an topographical
information. The result is a high level three dimensional world model image
required to support underwater surveying and sensor based navigation.
