This purpose of this project is to hold two conferences on the state of
empirical economics organized around chapters written for Volume V of the
Handbook of Econometrics, the empirical and applied complement to the recently-
published Volume IV. The goal of the volume is to provide an up-to-date account
of views of best practice empirical research in economics. The target audience
is the applied econometrics community. The first function of this targeting is
to improve the practice of econometrics by demonstrating to this wider audience
how advanced methods of econometrics can be used to advantage to address real
problems. The second function is to improve the theory of econometrics by
communicating to theorists what is working out in practice, what is not, and
what needs to be done. These two conferences are a very important step in
achieving these goals. Issues of judgment and interpretation always characterize
empirical research, and it is essential to have a dialogue that will improve the
quality of the papers in the published volume, and that will allow dissenting
views both at the conference and in the published volume.
