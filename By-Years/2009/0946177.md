This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop low cost,
high-temperature materials which are lighter than titanium, with added corrosion
and other functional benefits for targeted industrial applications. This program
will utilize a combination of new nanostructured materials with spark plasma
sintering (SPS) processing techniques to provide lightweight, multifunctional
composite materials with highly tailorable properties (modulus, corrosion
resistance, coefficient of thermal expansion, conductivity, etc.) for various
specialized industrial components and applications. For oil and gas exploration,
as the drilling depths become greater and greater, weight is more important than
ever. A reduction in the weight of key components provides important cost and
performance advantages when considering the energy required to move and rotate
materials at extreme depths. The new techniques which will be developed will
allow the synthesis of advanced materials into useful net shape parts with
engineered properties. The creation of these materials will enable end users to
obtain higher strength and modulus to weight ratios than ever before.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from a market-
driven opportunity for manufacturing of specialized materials. The ability to
design low-cost materials with unique properties for demanding applications will
create market pull from industries where high-performance materials are critical
to success. The resulting materials will allow a combination of strength-to-
weight ratio, thermal performance, and wear/corrosion resistance which is not
currently available. This will create value in the oil and gas, aerospace,
defense/military, and energy industries. In a larger sense, the new technology
will provide a new technology platform for manufacturing, a sector which has
been in decline in the United States. This will enable new and improved products
to get to market, creating US manufacturing jobs and worldwide opportunities for
these products.
