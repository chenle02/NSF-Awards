9706329 Karato The PI proposes to provide new experimental constraints on the
geodynamical interpretation of seismic anisotropy in upper mantle minerals. The
focus will be on the role of water and of dynamic recrystallization. Simple
shear deformation techniques developed in the PI's laboratory will be used in
the experiments and electron backscatter pattern analysis (EBSP) will be
utilized to investigate lattice preferred orientation. Synthetic polycrystalline
specimens of upper mantle minerals will be prepared and deformed to large
strains (~100-300 %) at high temperature and pressure in simple shear under
water-rich and water-poor conditions. The microstructural development including
the lattice preferred orientation will be investigated by the EBSP technique and
seismic anisotropy corresponding to specific deformation mechanisms and
deformation geometry will be predicted. The results will be compared with
seismological observations to place new constraints on the flow pattern in the
upper mantle. ***
