Agboola 9700937 This award will fund research on two topics in arithmetic
algebraic geometry. The first is concerned with Iwasawa theory and L-functions.
The PI will study new approaches to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and
the theory of p-adic L-functions. These approaches have their origins in the
theory of arithmetic Galois module structure, and they lead to new ways of
studying the Iwasawa theory of abelian varieties and p-adic representations. The
second topic deals with equivariant algebraic geometry and the K-theory of
higher dimensional varieties over finite fields. The PI will study reduced
Grothendieck groups of equivariant vector bundles on varieties. He will develop
the geometry of locally free class groups in positive characteristic, and he
will explore connections with higher-dimensional class field theory and
crystalline cohomology. The research described in this proposal lies in the
field of arithmetic algebraic geometry. This is a subject that blends two of the
oldest branches of mathematics---number theory and geometry---and which has
blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for
centuries. It finds applications in fields as diverse as physics, robotics, data
processing and information theory.
