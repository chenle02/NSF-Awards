This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the "Conference in Harmonic Analysis at the International Centre for
Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)" that will be held July 17-21, 2017, in Edinburgh,
Scotland. The support is directed at graduate students, psotdocs, and other
early-career mathematicians. For additional information see the conference
website:

http://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/harmonicanalysis .

This conference is timed to take maximum advantage of recent progress in the
field of harmonic analysis and to harness the momentum generated by those major
developments (e.g., advances in multilinear inequalities and Fourier restriction
theory; the introduction of algebro-geometric methods, such as the "polynomial
method" of Dvir, Guth, and others). The list of speakers includes virtually all
of the world's most prominent researchers in harmonic analysis. The program
allows ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.
