The proposed research involves three projects. The first is to make an accurate
numerical computation of the heavy quark potential string tension and other
quantitative measures of the vacuum structure above and below the deconfinement
transition using Lattice Gauge Theory. The goal is to better understand
confinement. The second area is to explore new chiral fermion formulations and
compare numerical and analytical methods. These new formulations will then be
applied to understanding chiral symmetry breaking and restoration at finite
temperature. The third area of research is to look at possible Lorentz symmetry
violating extensions of the Standard model using the idea of gravitons as Nambu
Goldstone bosons. This idea was first suggested by Bjorken.
