9529958 KENNICUTT Increasing public awareness of human impacts on the
surrounding environment have intensified the call for appropriate monitoring of
these effects to provide for sound resource management decisions. As one of the
perceived last pristine regions on Earth, Antarctica has attracted substantial
interest from the public in preserving and protecting its innate values and
natural resources. The primary international mechanism for addressing
environmental issues in Antarctica is through the Antarctic Treaty System. In
1994, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting requested that the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research and the Council of Operations Managers of
National Antarctic Programs jointly convene technical workshops to provide
expert advice on the design and implementation of environmental monitoring
programs. In response to this, an organizing committee was formed and two
workshops will be held; the first in Oslo, Norway and the second in College
Station, Texas. These international workshops will address a wide range of
issues related to the development, design and implementation of a simple,
realistic and effective continent-wide network of monitoring programs to gauge
resource deterioration. To ensure the success of the deliberations a broad
cross-section of experienced Antarctic practitioners (scientists, technologists,
national operators, and policy makers) are being encouraged to attend. This
award provides partial support for travel to both workshops and partial support
to support the second workshop to be held at Texas A&amp;M University.
