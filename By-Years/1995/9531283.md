9531283 Chu This project addresses the critical substrate issue in the
development of ZnSe based blue-green LEDs and laser diodes. Recently, there has
been much interest in the development of ZnSe based LEDs and laser diodes due to
the tremendous market potential for their applications in displays, electronics,
communications and information storage. Among all the semiconductors, ZnSe is
the only one which has been used to produce blue-green lasers. However, the
lifetime of the blue lasers has become a critical issue. It is believed that the
cause of the insufficient lifetime is the lack of device quality, lattice-
matched ZnSe substrates. An innovative technique (PPCVPT) to grow ZnSe crystals
will be used. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate that p-type ZnSe can
be produced by minimizing the native defects. Two inch ZnSe for producing ZnSe
lasers will be commercialized. ZnSe laser diodes will also be produced in this
project with the assistance of MBE capability at Columbia University. The
reliability of ZnSe lasers grown on ZnSe substrates will be tested. Testing
results will be used to improve the quality of the ZnSe substrates.
