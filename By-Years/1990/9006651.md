Dr. Schurr plans to study the rapid deformational Brownian motions of particular
DNAs, DNA/Ligand complexes, and filamentous viruses by modern optical
techniques, namely time- resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy,
transient photodichroism and dynamic light scattering. Most of the studies are
focussed on studying the effects of temperature, salt concentrations and base
composition on the dynamics of DNA in the presence of Small molecules that bind
to DNA, e.g., ethidium chloroquine and methylene blue. Some specific examples of
these studies are: 1) to assess the local motions of intercalated ethidium as a
function of temperature and viscosity; 2) to investigate the relative
populations of different kinds of dye binding sites as a function of
temperature, salt concentration and base composition; 3) to determine whether
the structural transition induced in DNA by chloroquine at low salt
concentration is local or long-range and to study its dependence on salt
concentration; 4) to construct DNAs that are oligomers of the wild-type and
mutant operators, to measure their twisting and bending rigidities, and to
examine the effect of saturation binding on their tertiary structure; 5) to
examine the effect of crystallization solvent on the twisting and bending
rigidities of DNA; and 6) to measure the dynamic bending rigidities of
filamentous viruses with similar radii but different internal structures.
