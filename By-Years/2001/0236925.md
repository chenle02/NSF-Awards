Renne&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0236925&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Small Grant
for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to provide rock-magnetic and
analytical transmission electron microscope data for crystallographically
oriented magnetite inclusions in silicates (COMIS) in order to explore the
conditions of origin of COMIS, and the fidelity with which they record magnetic
fields under those conditions. The research plan involves analyzing a number of
COMIS in diverse samples in order to evaluate if the results obtained are robust
enough to use them as paleomagnetic indicators. If this SGER is successful, the
techniques developed for COMIS will then be used for a variety of paleomagnetic
applications, including measurement of geomagnetic paleointensity and tectonic
applications of paleomagnetic data. The results will also be useful for
evaluating the possibility that stable magnetization of the oceanic crust, and
of magnetic anomalies on other planets, is due to COMIS.&lt;br/&gt;
