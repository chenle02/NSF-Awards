9616818 Gray The principal thrust of this research project is a broad-based
study of the basic structure, structure changes and dynamics of the inner core
of hurricanes and typhoons. In addition, the principal investigator, Dr. Gray,
will explore improved methods for predicting cyclone intensity changes,
processes affecting the strength and evolution of the outer region of tropical
cyclones, and the relationship between the inner and outer regions of these
storms. The research will employ a wide variety of observational data, from
research aircraft observations to satellite and rawinsonde data, in the
analyses. This project can be separated into four major topics: (1) the
structure of the inner core, (2) maximum potential intensity (MPI), (3) cyclone
intensity prediction, and (4) processes regulating outer core intensity and
cyclone size. The second topic is one of the most hotly contested areas in
tropical cyclone research today. Dr. Gray, a long time leader in this field, can
be expected to make important contributions regarding the issues. Tropical
cyclones represent one of the most devastating types of severe weather
phenomena. Improved understanding of their evolution is key to better forecasts
that would be of enormous benefit to society. ***
