This proposal from Syracuse University requests planning grant funds to enhance
the planning of a Science and Technology Research Center in Molecular
Electronics. Four institutions will be involved in the proposed center: Syracuse
University, Carnegie Mellon University, Johns Hopkins University, and Wayne
State University. The planning grant funds will enable an executive committee to
coordinate research goals, collaborations and shared facilities; coordinate
educational goals, university educational and fiscal support, industrial
sponsorship and collaboration; and to establish strong links to other groups and
the industrial sector. The goal of the Molecular Electronics Center is to
coordinate fundamental and applied research projects in the field of molecular
electronics. Since no single research center or university has the breadth of
expertise required for a major effort in all of the subspecialties of molecular
electronics, coordination and collaboration via this center will significantly
advance knowledge in this field.
