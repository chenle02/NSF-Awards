This award provides continued partial support for the collection of protozoa
and algae housed at the American Type Culture Collections. The collection
maintains mostly free living and some parasitic protozoa and those algae that
can be cryopreserved. The Collection distributes the organisms as well as
information associated with them to the world research community. The goals of
the Collection during this funding period include: (1) maintain the high level
of quality control of the Collection, (2) where necessary, apply state-of-the-
art methodologies to improve the authentication of certain strains; (3) apply
improved preservation methodologies to lower costs and facilitate distribution,
(4) diversify the holdings to include members of major groups of fee-living
protozoa not currently held and expand holdings of groups that are poorly
represented, (5) organize the strain information into computer databases that
are accessible to the user community, and (6) to optimize quality control of its
holdings.
