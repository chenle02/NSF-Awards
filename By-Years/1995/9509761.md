9509761 Kensley The objectives of this project are to manage and maintain the
biological collections (and their associated systematic, geographic and
ecological data) generated through past and current research activities in the
World's polar regions, and to facilitate the collections-based research
activities of systematic biologists studying the biota of the polar regions. The
collection will be curated and maintained according to collection management
standards. Specimen-lots will be identified with unique lot numbers and will be
cataloged. The cataloged specimens will be accessioned and incorporated into the
department's permanent collections. The specimen records will be maintained in
appropriate departmental computerized catalogs. Sorting and identifications will
be done as time and staff expertise allow. Collection related data will be
maintained in appropriate automated or paper-based files. Computerized specimen
and station databases will continue to be developed and maintained. Work will
continue on the development of automated acquisition and loan databases. All
database development will conform to departmental data standards and procedures.
Collection-based research activities will be facilitated through the
administration of a modest research grant program and through the improved
availability of collection-related data. Station data, polar type specimen data,
and identified polar specimen catalog records will be made available to the
scientific community through the Internet. The project will insure the long term
care of the polar biological collections and their associated data. The
specimens that comprise the polar collections are an irreplaceable biological
resource. By providing an historical community baseline, they serve a
fundamental role in documenting the current biodiversity of the polar marine
environment. Their study provides significant insights into the phylogenetics,
evolution and systematics of all of the major groups of marine organisms.
Several hundred new taxa have been described from the polar environment. It is
reasonable to expect that many more undescribed taxa will be discovered as
researchers continue to study the polar specimens.
