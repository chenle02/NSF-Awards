This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide a technical
foundation for the improvement of bioremediation efforts through the use of
innovative electrochemical enhancement of the soil microenvironment. In situ
engineered bioremediation can be used to reduce or destroy organic contaminants
in subsoils quickly, more economically, and with less disruption of operation of
the environment than other decontamination methods currently available. The
great concern in engineered bioremediation is the absence of contaminant
degrading microbes. This proposal describes research that will demonstrate the
feasibility of a new in situ electrochemical system that will enhance the soil
microbial population thus promoting the more efficient degradation of organic
contaminants. Advantages offered by this approach include: (1) contaminant
degradation occurs in the subsurface environment; (2) the chemical additives are
low cost and environmentally benign; and (3) relatively low capital cost for
decontamination of site. Phase I experiments will be conducted using bench scale
systems, containing natural soils of varying compositions and characteristics.
