The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing
through democratization of design and simulation technologies. Geometric design
systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-
based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high
cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural
simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to
both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires
no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a
disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to
communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic
improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings.
Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM
education and workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the
project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation
service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed
approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that
enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by
novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration
of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation
results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating
improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where
automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered
seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications,
such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.
