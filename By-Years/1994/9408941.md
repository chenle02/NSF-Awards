9408941 Hobbs With this award, Dr. Hobbs will attempt to quantify the effects of
aerosols on climate through their effects on clouds through a series of airborne
observations. Measurements will be obtained of key parameters for a variety of
aerosols, for various cloud types, and in several climatological regimes. The
measurements include cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) efficiencies (i.e., the
number of CCN produced by unit mass of a chemical species) of various types of
atmospheric aerosols, the effects of these aerosols on cloud droplet
concentrations and size distributions and the radiative properties of clouds
(particularly near cloud tops). The measurements will be made in strongly
polluted air in the northeastern United States, in the smoke produced by biomass
burning in the Amazon Basin, and in moderately polluted as well as quite clear
air in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. This project will contribute to a
better understanding of climate processes and the potential for global climate
change. It is being funded under the Role of Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global
Climate Change Research Opportunity. ***
