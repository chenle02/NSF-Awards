The Department of Biology is upgrading its basic Animal Physiology course with
the acquisition of sophisticated, state-of-the-art equipment. The new equipment
includes such electrophysiological instrumentation as microcomputers to
interface with dual channel oscilloscopes, pressure transducers, polygraphs, and
accessory equipment -- all of which have a wide range of applicability and
flexibility. Students taught on this new equipment will be prepared to enter the
upper level courses in the Department in such diverse subdisciplines as
Physiological Ecology, Endocrinology, Advanced Cellular Physiology and
Neurophysiology. The high percentage of students who pursue graduate education
in Biomedical fields and the historically high demand for training in Physiology
indicate that this equipment is being used productively.
