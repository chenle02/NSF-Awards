The NSF- AWM Travel/Mentor Grant Program supports the travel of women
mathematicians who wish to participate in research conferences, as well as,
longer term visits to work with a mentor. This program enhances the research
activities and visibility and advances the careers of women
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All awards will be determined on a
competitive basis by selection panels consisting of distinguished mathematicians
appointed by AWM . An assessment of the results of these travel/mentor grants
will be done annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWM will administer these regular
and mentoring travel grants and will continue to attract strong women
mathematicians to be involved in all aspects of the program . The NSF-AWM
Travel/Mentor Program will promote a strong support and recognition for
outstanding young women mathematicians, and hence it will increase the chance of
establishing their research program and getting tenure .
