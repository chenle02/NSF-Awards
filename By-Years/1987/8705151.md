When groups or individuals do tasks under time limits that are either very short
or very long with respect to the task load, they modify their work rate in later
work periods even when those time limits no longer hold. These "carry over"
effects on work rate are called entrainment effects. Experiments in earlier
phases of this research suggest that these entrainment effects differ for tasks
of different types (e.g., for problem.solving vs planning tasks vs creativity
tasks vs decision making tasks). Those differences seem to arise because groups
experience different forms of task difficulty. Under some task type and time
pressure conditions, groups experience "quantitative difficulty", a problem of
capacity, and speed up their rate of work in later trials. Under other task and
time conditions, groups experience "qualitative difficulty", a problem of
capability, and slow their rate of work on later trials. These differences seem
to be reflected in task product quality as well as in rate, but quality
differences are not always in a direction opposite to rate. Furthermore,
evidence for differences in these task difficulty experiences are reflected in
the group's pattern ofinteraction during task performance. The next phase of
this research program will carry out two sets of studies to confirm, clarify,
and elaborate those entrainment findings. The first set will be a series of
experiments: (a)to confirm these task type and time limit differences; (b) to
clarify the role of capability and capacity experiences in these entrainment
patterns; (c) to assess the entrainment effects on task product quality for
parallel sets of conditions; and (d) to explore how these entrainment effects
get manifested in the group's interaction during task performance. The second
set of studies will try to explore those same hypotheses with natural groups
doing their "normal" tasks and/or with experimentally created but relatively
long term groups doing whole work projects of larger scope. Both sets of
studies, together with past research, will provide a detailed picture of the
task, group, and work conditions that will predictably produce various patterns
of work rate and quality and the task experiences and interaction patterns
underlying them. The Principal Investigator is a senior researcher, well-known
for the high quality of his prior research.
