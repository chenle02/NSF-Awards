Prof. Baxter and his colleagues have proposed (in a group of separate proposals)
to construct a Low Energy Neutron Scattering (LENS) facility at Indiana
University. If constructed, this facility would have the potential for
significant impact on neutron scattering in the United States: (1) It would help
train the next generation of scientists who will use the Spallation Neutron
Source. (2) It would provide a test facility for the development of neutron-
scattering instrumentation. (3) It would provide an exploratory research tool
for new scientific problems in soft condensed matter and biology that are
inappropriate for tightly scheduled, large user
facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the present proposal is to
provide the Principal Investigators with support for continuing design and
engineering studies while they are awaiting the review of the final proposal
needed to begin the construction of LENS. &lt;br/&gt;
