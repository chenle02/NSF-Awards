This project consists of a study of differential and difference equations and
their generalizations through the lens of model theory in the sense of
mathematical logic, attacks on difficult problems in arithmetic dynamics using
multiple model theoretic ideas, and a fundamental investigation into
decidability in geometry and arithmetic. In their many applications,
differential and difference equations describe the evolution and dynamics of
complex systems. Various methods, computational and analytic, for example, are
commonly employed to understand and solve these equations. With this project,
ideas from algebra and logic, especially related to the principles of
definability and tameness of structure, will be used to understand differential
and difference equations. This basic research should have consequences in
mathematics and the sciences broadly due to the importance of differential and
difference equations in the applications of mathematics to the sciences.

Concretely, with regards to differential equations, this project will extend the
fundamental model theoretic results about differential fields to the class of
D-fields in a more expansive sense. Secondly, the project involves a study of
the fine structure of definability and dependence in D-fields. In particular,
the project will extend the Zilber trichotomy (or, at least, results of a
similar flavor) to infinite dimensional types, and, thus, specializing to
classical theories, to underdetermined difference-differential, partial
differential, and Hasse differential equations. Moreover, a goal of the project
is an explicit characterization the induced structure on sets with trivial
forking geometry. Thirdly, the project will develop a theory of specializations
of D-rings through a model theory of valued D-fields. Fourthly, the project
includes a development of general D-Galois theories based on multiple model
theoretic perspectives. Finally in connection to D-fields, the project includes
an ambitious application of the theory of D-fields which may have transformative
consequences; that is, to realize Borger's F-1-geometry as the study of finite
dimensional definable sets relative to a certain theory of D-rings. With regards
to diophantine geometry, the project will address Zhang's dense orbit conjecture
and the dynamical Mordell-Lang through the model theory of difference fields and
methods from o-minimality. The project includes a program establish the
decidability of complicated fragments of the theory of C(t), the field of
rational functions over the complex numbers.
