The problem of model building is of fundamental importance to science and
engineering. Although modeling, especially linear modeling, has been extensively
investigated and applied, most of the existing frameworks are based on
stochastic approximation of the modeling error, an assumption that cannot be
justified on physical ground in many applications. A general, deterministic,
modeling framework for linear systems has recently been put forward by Willems.
Parallel to this, Antoulas developed a detailed and explicit recursive
realization theory, i.e. a theory of recursiveness of exact modeling based on
impulse response time series. Preliminary results have shown that the above two
research projects overlap and complement each other in significant ways. This
motivates investigations into the recursiveness structure of exact and
approximate modeling. These investigations, and in particular the recursiveness
results, complemented with the necessary software in the form of a hard disc,
will be used at a later stage to develop a new framework for deterministic
adaptive control. We propose to develop a whole class of alternative
(deterministic) ways of approaching linear recursive modeling. It has the
potential of significant impact in areas where model building is needed for
predictive purposes, as well as in areas where modeling is needed for control
applications, especially so, for the control of plants in dynamically changing
environments.
