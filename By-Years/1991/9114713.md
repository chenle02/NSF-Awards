Ceramic matrix composites ar a new class of advanced materials intended for high
temperature engineering applications. They exhibit enhanced strength and
fracture toughness over monolithic ceramics due to the interaction of a
propagating crack with the second phase reinforcing material. Theories for the
mechanisms of toughening in brittle matrix composites, based on crack bridging
and a fracture process zone, have been developed over the past few years. While
these mechanisms have been studied in detail for both continuous fiber and
whisker reinforced ceramics at room temperature, their fracture behaviors at
elevated temperature are not well characterized. The first goal of this research
is the development of a new experimental approach which will provide a
quantitative measure of fracture processes at high temperature. The approach
involves a simple experimental technique which permits simultaneous measurement
of crack growth resistance curves and direct observation of microscopic fracture
processes during controlled loading over a temperature range of 20-1,7500C. The
second goal is to study the behaviors of three important and well characterized
materials, representing a range of properties: SiC whisker reinforced alumina,
Nicalon fiber/LAS glass ceramic, and carbon/carbon composite. The primary
significance of the research is that it will provide the tools to determine the
fundamental mechanisms of fracture and deformation of ceramics at high
temperature. With these tools, materials developers can design ceramic matrix
composites with improved fracture behavior and application designers will be
able to predict the reliability of their structural components under high
temperature conditions.
