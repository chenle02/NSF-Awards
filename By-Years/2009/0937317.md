The investigators will conduct a series of experiments on atmospherically
important processes involving oxygen atoms in the singlet D state [O(1D)].
First, they will measure the rate coefficient for the collisional removal of
O(1D) by oxygen atoms in the triple D state [O(3D)] and its temperature
dependence in the range 300 to 1000 K. Recent laboratory studies at room
temperature have indicated that relaxation by oxygen atoms is the most
significant process controlling the intensity of the 630 nm red line emission at
altitudes 200-300 km. The study will yield the first set of laboratory
measurements at the relevant high temperatures. The investigators will also
investigate the temperature dependence of other reaction rates important for
understanding atmospheric oxygen emissions. These laboratory experiments are
essential for improving the currently incomplete understanding of ionospheric
red-line emission, allowing for better modeling and quantification of molecular
oxygen Atmospheric Band emissions, and elucidating the role of oxygen atom
energy transfer in the altitude range 120-400 km. Also, knowledge of the rate
coefficient for the collisional removal of O(1D) by O(3P) allows the correct
interpretation and analysis of the O(1D) emissions. These results will enhance
the scientific return of ionospheric heating experiments by enabling a correct
interpretation and quantification of the 630-nm red line emission. The rate
coefficients to be measured are relevant to both calm and perturbed atmospheric
conditions. This work should also help improve understanding of satellite drag
and the interpretation of results from incoherent scatter radar measurements.
Energy balance in the upper atmosphere is key to modeling the Earth as a system.
Application of basic chemistry and physics to the study of collisional energy
transfer processes on a fundamental level is also critical for understanding the
operation of lasers, especially high-power chemical lasers. Finally, the study
will contribute to training, mentoring, and research experiences of postdoctoral
fellows and summer undergraduate students.
