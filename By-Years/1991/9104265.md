The principal investigator will investigate geometric structures on spaces but
will focus much of the research on Mobius structures. A Mobius structure on a
space is a group action which acts on the space and comes from the standard
structure of conformal transformations of the sphere. In the two dimensional
case a Mobius structure is equivalent to a one dimensional complex projective
structure. Professor Kulkarni will study three classes of spaces with Mobius
structure and attempt to understand the underlying geometry of these spaces. The
theme of this research is to understand an abstract space by placing additional
structure on the space. One simple way of understanding this mathematical tool
is to think of a simple closed curve - perhaps twisted in some way. Now if one
marks off equal distances on the curve thus creating a metric space, one can
talk about the relationship between points on the curve. Thus the curve has been
endowed with "additional structure". The principal investigator will attempt to
do something like this but with a much more complicated structure.
