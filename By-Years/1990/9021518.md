Recent NSF-sponsored experiments indicate that when people talk or write about
upsetting experiences in their lives, they become physically and mentally
healthier. For example, individuals who write about personal traumas for four
consecutive days for twenty minutes a day evidence improved immune system
activity, reduced physician visits over a 2-4 month interval, and report being
happier and healthier than those who are asked to write about superficial
topics. The purpose of the present grant is to understand why writing or talking
produces such beneficial effects. Over the three years of research, a series of
experiments will explore which dimensions of writing promote health. Writing
about traumas, for example, may be beneficial because it organizes the events in
people's minds, changes the ways that people think about the traumas, or perhaps
fulfills basic human needs for self-expression. By pinpointing the health-
promoting dimensions of writing, researchers will better understand the mental
processes underlying stressful events and coping. The results also have
important implications for studying psychotherapy and interpersonal
relationships.
