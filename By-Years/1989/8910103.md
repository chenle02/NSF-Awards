Planar and vesicular membranes formed by archaebacteria ether lipids will be
characterized and assessed as potential biomimetic membranes. Archaebacteria are
a recently discovered life-form living in extreme environments including pH
values less than 2.0 or greater than 9.0 in saturated salt solutions at
temperatures greater than the normal boiling point of water. Polar lipids
isolated from plasma membranes of the archaebacteria contain an ether linkage,
rather than the ester linkages usually found in membrane lipids. Ester linkages
are less susceptible to oxidation and hydrolysis; thus, more stable membrane
mimetics can be constructed from them. Since the ether lipids contain polar
groups like those in normal cell membranes, but are more stable than normal cell
lipids, they seem to be ideal candidates for constructing synthetic analogues of
cell membranes. The project will attempt: (1) to construct ultra thin separation
membranes with outstanding selectivity and fluxes and (2) to make electrode
coating to immobilize enzymes that catalyze hydroxylation of lipophiles.
