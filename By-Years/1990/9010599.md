The proposed research is related to an experimental and theoretical study of the
effects of cross-phase modulation (XPM) in optical fibers and how such effects
can be used for influencing the behavior of one optical pulse by copropagating
it together with another ultrashort pulse. The project is divided into three
parts. The first part is concerned with the XPM interaction between the pump
pulse and the Stokes pulse that is generated internally through the process of
stimulated Raman scattering. The second part is related to the XPM interaction
between the pump and signal pulses launched simultaneously at the fiber input.
The pump and signal pulses are allowed to have different carrier wavelengths,
different pulse widths, and a relative time delay between them. The third part
is related to the XPM interaction when the pump and signal pulses have the same
carrier wavelength but excite the orthogonally polarized modes of a single-mode
fiber. The objective is to study how the XPM interaction can be used to modify
the propagation characteristics of a signal pulse (such as its phase, frequency,
shape, or spectrum) through an intense pump pulse. The study is useful for many
engineering applications in the fields of photonic switching and high- speed
optical communications.
