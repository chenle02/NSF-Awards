The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCUs)
funds workshops as a means of discussing and disseminating best practices in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at HBCUs. The
conference by Morehouse college seeks to examine the contributions of HBCUs to
STEM undergraduate education and facilitate knowledge transfer that is essential
to promote the use of best assessment practices to understand and expand an
effective model for STEM education at HBCUs. The conference will be attended by
sixty faculty members and researchers from forty HBCUs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will accomplish the planning and knowledge
transfer agenda by: 1) presenting hands-on workshops on implementing and
researching new educational strategies, such as course-based undergraduate
research experiences, utilitarian Scientific Literacy curriculum, and best
practices for assessment and evaluation; 2) building faculty capacity through
proposal development training; 3) keynote presentations about center-wide
research activities and defining student success; 4) poster sessions for
networking and sharing ideas; 5) discovering and disseminating ways that HBCUs
can use data to inform and strengthen STEM education; and 6) providing a venue
for planning future activities, knowledge transfer and
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
