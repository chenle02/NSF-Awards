The bright coloration of birds has always intrigued ornithologists, yet
relatively few studies have specifically addressed the adaptive value of bright
breeding plumage. This study examines two aspects of plumage coloration in male
and female Purple Martins: why do older birds have a brightly colored plumage,
and why do young birds have a dull, subadult breeding plumage? This will be the
first intensive study of Purple Martins in a natural habitat. Plumage dyeing
experiments will determine the role that plumage color plays in a birds ability
to defend its nesting site from competitors. The intensity of competition for
nesting cavities and young birds' use of specific behavioral tactics to compete
with older birds for opportunities to breed will be evaluated. Observations of
aggressive interactions between subadult and adult birds will determine whether
young birds are subject to less aggression because of their non-threatening,
subadult plumage.
