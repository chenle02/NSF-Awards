The University of Michigan (UM) requests funding for shipboard technician
activities associated with the research vessel LAURENTIAN, an 80-foot vessel.
The LAURENTIAN is owned and operated by UM. It is the only UNOLS vessel
conducting NSF-funded research in the Great Lakes. In most years, the LAURENTIAN
supports between 30 to 100 days of NSF-funded research. The UM technician will
be responsible for operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining
instruments onshore and assisting with scientific operations necessary before
and after cruises.
