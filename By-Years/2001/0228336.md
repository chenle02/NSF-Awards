0228336&lt;br/&gt;Prose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award will allow the PIs
to film the commencement, this summer, of drilling activities for the San
Andreas Fault Drilling Project, near Parkfield , California. The 2 km deep hole
adjacent to the San Andreas Fault (SAF), is a pilot hole for an eventual 4.5 km
hole to be drilled through the SAF as part of the EarthScope initiative now
being considered as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. This deep hole project (SAFOD
- San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth) would be the first underground
earthquake observatory to penetrate a seismically active fault zone at such an
extreme depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth Images Foundation will film the
commencement of the SAFOD pilot hole project to generate crucial footage for an
educational television documentary about the value of scientific drilling. The
visual appeal, scientific importance, and societal urgency of the SAFOD project
makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a major educational television
documentary. Television programs about earthquakes draw large audiences on PBS
and Discovery Channel, and a documentary that highlights the SAFOD project will
show how scientists are using the unusual technique of deep drilling to study
this phenomenon. It promises viewers an insider's look at the improvement of
theories about how earthquakes work and insight on earthquake hazards, a factor
that has been shown to contribute to an increase in public safety in earthquake-
prone regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the initial filming of the pilot hole
commencement, the film footage will be processed and transferred to digital
video format, then stored for later use in a planned television documentary
about scientific drilling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
