Understanding symmetry is a very profitable endeavor. For instance, if
reflective symmetry is available, then computations can be cut in half: only
half of the object is needed to understand it fully. Conversely, a lack of
symmetry can also limit whether a material or object can possess a certain
property. The overall theme of this project is to better understand certain
groups of symmetries by studying how they transform a one, two, three, or higher
dimensional space. This is well-understood when working with algebraic spaces
based on the real numbers, but much more complicated when working in the modular
case, that is, when real numbers are replaced by a finite number system that
depends on a fixed prime number. Modular arithmetic is computationally easy and
very useful; for instance, it forms the basis of modern algorithms in coding
theory and cryptography. However, the problem of understanding and classifying
how symmetries transform algebraic spaces in the modular case is more difficult
than for real numbers and is not as well-understood. Broadly speaking, this
project will study symmetries of algebraic spaces in the modular case.

More precisely, much of the representation theory of a reductive, connected
algebraic groups is encoded in affine Hecke algebras. Affine Hecke algebras have
two geometric interpretations: equivariant constructible sheaves on the affine
flag variety and equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety. These
two interpretations are known to be equivalent when working with characteristic
zero sheaves. In the modular case, this is not yet known. However, if it does
hold, one would expect certain structures on the coherent side that have yet to
be defined. The PI will define exotic t-structures on derived categories of
coherent sheaves for varieties similar to the Springer resolution and extend the
powerful theory developed for intersection cohomology sheaves to the coherent
setting. The PI will also define an Iwahori--Whittaker model for the Satake
category. Finally, the PI will explicitly construct some central sheaves (those
associated to tilting representations) in the mixed affine Hecke category. This
project will strengthen the current categorical understanding of the affine
Hecke algebra which, will aid its application to modular representation theory.
