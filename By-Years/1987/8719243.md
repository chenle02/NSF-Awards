An "International Cloud Modelling Workshop" will be held in Toulouse, France on
August 8-12, 1988. This is the second workshop in a series with the primary goal
being to promote constructive interaction between scientists working on theory,
numerical models and those working with observations. The focus of this workshop
will be on cloud microphysics and participation will involve two phases. First
of all, participants will carry out numerical experimentation at their home
institutions using data provided by the workshop organizers. During the Workshop
in Toulouse, participants will meet to compare model results against
observations and against other modeling efforts. The purpose of this award is to
ensure participation of a strong contingent of US scientists at the meeting.
Selection of recipients of travel support will be made upon the recommendation
of a panel of experts including representatives of the American Meteorological
Society Committees on Weather Modification and Cloud Physics as well as members
of the United States Workshop Organizing Committee.
