The proposed 2-day workshop focuses on research issues lying at the interface of
the mathematical sciences and the geosciences. Many of these issues relate
strongly to the themes of the National Science Foundation (NSF) program on
Collabotation in Mathematical Geosciences (CMG), including mathematical and
statistical modeling of large, complex geosystems, representing uncertainty in
geosystems, and analyzing large geoscience data sets. The workshop will also be
used as a forum to assess the effectiveness of the CMG program and identify new
frontiers in mathematical geociences.

The anticipated outcomes of the workshop include sharper identification of
current research and training issues at the interface between the mathematical
sciences and the geosciences, and new collaborations to address those issues.
The workshop will attract more than 100 participants to represent the broad
research communities in mathematics, statistics, and the geosciences. Young
researchers, women and other under-represented groups will be encouged to
participate. A workshop report will be prepared for the benefit of the NSF and
the scientific communities.
