The goal of this project is to study a broad set of upper atmospheric science
topics that are all manifestations of highly coupled systems within and
connected to the Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) regions. The
contributions to these studies arise from in-house development and deployment of
eight low-light-level all-sky-imagers (ASIs). The project has eight areas of
activity: (a) the global magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions that create
stable auroral red (SAR) arcs, (b) the electrodynamical-ITM processes that
create Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), (c) the
geomagnetic conjugate point controlled aspects of the severe ionospheric
irregularities known as equatorial spread-F (ESF), (d) the day-to-day
variability of the ionosphere during periods of extended solar and geomagnetic
quiescence, (e) dynamical processes in the Mesosphere, (f) experiments of
opportunity, (g) comparative aeronomy, and (h) running the CEDAR optical
calibration lab. Of particular focus is determining if symmetries or asymmetries
exist with longitude and/or hemisphere for the features observed. These include
how the tilted geomagnetic dipole creates a mix of processes controlled by
geographic latitude (e.g., solar production) versus geomagnetic latitude (e.g.,
magnetospheric input) within and between the hemispheres.
