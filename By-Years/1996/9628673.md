ABSTRACT Tien 9628673 The proposal is to partially support an international
conference on molecular and microscale transport processes. This research area
has recently developed very rapidly because of the possibilities for significant
advances in microelectronics and biotechnology. The conference will bring
together participants from industry and university both from the United States
and from Japan.
