Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds that crystallize as conglomerate mixtures
may be optically resolved using the technique of direct preferential
crystallization. The method is based on the selective deposition of enantiomers
from supersaturated solution onto optically pure seed crystals provided for this
purpose. The technique has inherent advantages in its avoidance of the chiral
auxiliaries and additional process chemistry that are characteristic of other
methods for producing optically pure drugs. While preferential crystallization
has been applied successfully to produce several important chiral compounds, it
would undoubtedly be more widely used were it not for the fact that selective
crystallization can be a difficult process to control on the large scale. It is
proposed to examine the feasibility and potential benefits of membrane-
stabilized preferential crystallization for stereoisomer separations. In the
novel process, selective membranes are used to confine individual enantiomers
and seed in such away as to enhance the stability of crystallization and thereby
to improve process reliability and efficiency.
