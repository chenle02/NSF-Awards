The overall goal of this project is to investigate joint influences of genetic
propensities and social-control on delinquent behavior. Previous sociological
work has demonstrated the critical importance of social structural conditions,
family processes, school structure, and peer networks. These serve as informal
social controls that bond individuals to social norms and ultimately may reduce
delinquency. The project draws data sources from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address the question of why some
individuals become serious and violent delinquents while others do not, despite
growing up in a similar social context and participating in similar social
processes. Dr. Guo and his research teams will investigate the role of genetic
propensities, especially as they interact with social control factors, in
delinquency. Specifically, they will use genotype data focusing on the genes
that are known to be involved in aggressive behavior in mice to explore how
genetic factors might influence delinquency and how those influences may depend
on social control processes measured at the levels of friends, peers, family,
school, and neighborhood. This research is based on the premise that genetic
effects on delinquency are best understood within a social science theoretical
framework, which provides the basis for understanding delinquent behavior as
socially produced and socially organized human activity. The newly created
molecular genotype data will be merged with the rich social and behavioral
longitudinal data in Add Health for other researchers to use. The results of
this study would contribute to the understanding of aggression and delinquency
across the life course and could inform intervention efforts.
