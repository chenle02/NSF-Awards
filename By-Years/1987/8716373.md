The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) is a component of the
National Academy of Sciences. The Institute's major goal is to provide
information that will help to improve the availability, quality, care, and
humane and scientifically valid use of laboratory animals. More specifically,
ILAR is responsible for developing and making available guidelines for animal
care, use and breeding; for describing animal models for human diseases and
physiological processes; for providing source data on commercial and non-
commercial stock colonies; and for conducting surveys of animal facilities and
resources. During its 35-year history, ILAR has established itself worldwide as
a key advisory group in the labotory animal field. This project will provide
partial funding for ILAR for the next three years. The funds will be used as
partial support for the Animal Models and Genetic Stocks Information Exchange
Program, for the publication of ILAR News, for the meetings of two standing
committees (the ILAR Council and the Committee on Animal Models and Genetic
Stocks) composed of noted experts in the field of animal care, and for other
general operating expenses of the Institute.
