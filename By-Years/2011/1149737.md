With the popularity of real-time 3D/4D data capturing capabilities, there is an
emerging need to compute the deformable models over the networks. Traditional
model-driven deformable models have their bottlenecks since the spatial
information for large-scale datasets cannot be efficiently solved and adaptively
minimized over different network conditions. This project centers on the concept
of spectrum-driven deformable models. Analogous to Fourier analysis being
applied to image processing, the spectral deformable models employ manifold
harmonics to efficiently and effectively perform segmentation, registration,
physics-based simulation, compression, and streaming of 3D deformable surfaces
and volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, manifold harmonics are used
to transform arbitrary scanned datasets into a reduced diffusion subspace, in
which real-time segmentation, registration, and physics-based simulation can be
performed. Besides the stretching deformations, the rotational and tensor fields
are encoded with manifold harmonics, which provides a "spectral multiresolution"
structure to compress and stream deformable models over different network
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI works with the medical imaging experts
at UT Southwestern Medical Center, to build a tele-diagnosis system for
evaluating each component in the spectral deformable models. The test-bed on
tele-medicine has impacts on the next-generation diagnosis and treatment
services, as well as on clinical education. The theoretical and technical
breakthrough can benefit our society at large, from tele-immersion, remote
sensing, to speech training, through the PI?s further outreach activities. The
research and education are integrated by taking research advances into existing
and future courses; developing the visualization software for education; and
attracting more undergraduate students into research.
