The problem of heat transfer in a single blood vessel is well understood because
of its similarity to the case of duct flow. But the collective effects of the
entire vasculature are not easily modeled. The primary difficulties arise from
the large number of vessels, their wide range of sizes, their complicated, tree-
like geometry and the time dependence of the blood flow due to thermoregulation.
Most existing models are based on some sort of volume average of the energy
equation that yields an effective medium theory. Typically, the blood is assumed
to act as a distributed heat sink or an enhancement to the thermal conductivity
of the tissue. But there has been considerable debate over the proper form of
such models with the earlier work of the author suggesting that no single model
is valid under all circumstances. In fact, effective medium theories may need to
be discarded entirely in some cases. The aim of this research is to explore new
ways of modeling heat transfer in tissue. As one approach to this problem,
concepts from fractal geometry will be used to represent various vascular
architectures. Another approach will be based on a recent proof of the author
that blood vessels often act like conductive fibers. A new concept of bioheat
transfer results: the tissue and vasculature may be viewed as a composite of
conductive materials. The implications of this model have yet to be fully
explored. Finally, a control systems approach will be used to investigate the
role of thermoregulation on tissue-level heat transfer. This will extend
existing studies of thermoregulation that emphasize the whole body or regional
response. An experimental program is also planned to supplement the analytical
and numerical studies. The outcome of this research will be immediately valuable
to the designers of clinical equipment. A reliable underlying theory is
essential to the intelligent design of heating applicators and thermal sensors.
New technologies that improve safety and comfort in thermally stressful
environments may also result.
