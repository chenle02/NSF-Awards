9409551 Vassiolos Papadopoulos Steroid hormones, derived from cholesterol, are
responsible for the maintenance of the organism's homeostasis, adaptability to
the environment and developmental and reproductive functions. The brain is one
target tissue of steroids, where they regulate neuronal function. Most of the
steroids present in the brain originate from gonads and adrenals. However,
recent studies, including those of Dr. Papadopoulos, demonstrated that some
brain structures have the ability to synthesize specific steroids which could
directly and locally regulate brain function. These studies are to: 1)
investigate where and when steroid synthesis occurs in the brain, 2) find out
which steroids are synthesized by different brain structures, and 3) examine how
brain steroid synthesis is regulated. For these studies rats of different ages,
from fetus to adult will be used. Once the most active steroid producing brain
cell populations are localized, various factors known to control brain function
will be examined to determine whether these factors could also regulate neuro-
steroid synthesis.
