This proposal is for a research program that investigates key issues in the
design of knowledge based systems for use in Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV)
systems. It defines an effort to understand some of the problems associated with
utilizing knowledge based systems in real time systems. The purpose of this
research is to implement a framework for further development of real time
knowledge based systems. this framework will be realized with the development of
an operating system and system architecture applicable to time constrained
symbolic systems. The main product of this effort will be a new symbolic
processing operating system which will be used as the foundation for current and
future development in intelligent time constrained systems. The proposed
research addressed the underlying issues which lead to capable real time
systems. Knowledge based techniques will be advanced by first addressing the
design from the vantage of operating systems and system architecture. The
proposed work will take advantage of current real time operating system
technology. Once the architecture a and application is chosen it will be
implemented on the MSEL integrated symbolic numeric system residing on the
Ironics IV 3204 32 bit CPU board for VME bus. The testing phase will include the
determination and measurement of key real time system parameters as well as
benchmarks. At this point there are no clear measures of performance other than
simplistic cycle rate determinations. For this reason a task is included to
determine useful metrics for evaluating time constrained knowledge-based
systems. In the final phase of this work we will evaluate the results to
determine performance limitations and propose enhancements to the system.
