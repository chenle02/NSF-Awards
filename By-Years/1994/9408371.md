9408371 Wilmsen The major objectives of this research are to: a) Demonstrate
that VCSEL-based smart pixel arrays can be used in high performance parallel
optoelectronic processing systems. b) Isolate the barrier technologies to the
development of a practical parallel processing system. c) Develop the
design/fabrication methodology for these VCSEL-based systems. d) Demonstrate the
potential of optical computing for database processing. e) Investigate the
interface between optical parallel memories and optical processing arrays. ***
