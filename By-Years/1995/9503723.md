9503723 Gupta A laser spallation technique for the measurement of interfacial
strength is modified for in-situ measurements at elevated temperatures. To
establish the basic principles and the experimental procedures to facilitate
future studies, planar interfaces between 1 to 3 micron thick coatings of Nb and
substrates of sapphire are used as model systems. The tensile strength of
interfaces is measured up to 1300C and the interface chemistry and atomic
structure determined by using a high resolution transmission electron
microscope. Transmission microscopy observations at ambient temperature relate
the influence of interface interdiffusion, void formation, coating grain size,
new phases, thickness of the amorphous layer, etc. to the measured interface
strength at elevated temperatures, since the microstructure is likely to be
retained when the samples are cooled in air. The tensile strengths of some
representative systems chosen from the tribology are determined up to 1300C. %%%
The work is not only interdisciplinary in its approach but also in its impact as
it serves a particular need in the composites, tribology, thermal spray,
microelectronics and other thin film industries. ***
