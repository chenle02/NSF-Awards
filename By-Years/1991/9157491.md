This Presidential Young Investigator Award will be aimed at understanding the
evolution of bulk physical properties from those of isolated molecules, with the
goal of discovering novel chemical and physical properties of materials.
Materials to be investigated will include pure compound semiconductor clusters,
and clusters doped with magnetic substitutional impurities to yield diluted
magnetic semiconductor clusters. A parallel synthetic program to prepare
clusters of new materials will also be implemented.
