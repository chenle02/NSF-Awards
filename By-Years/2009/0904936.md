This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our interdisciplinary e
ort between computational scientists, physicists, engineers and applied
mathematicians is to build an all{scales unified simulation system that can
exploit the next generation of petascale systems and beyond. The advances
proposed herein hold the potential of greatly enhanc-ing possible breakthroughs
in various research disciplines involved with continuum mechanics. Specifically,
the novelties will include: high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods with
simultaneous adaptive h-p unstructured non-conforming meshes, multi-methods for
time integration including multirate, implicit-explicit(IMEX), strong-stability
preserving (SSP), exponential integrators, Parareal time-integration, adjoint-
based error estimates, and new optimal iterative solvers. These ideas will
ultimately be targeted for use on a deep atmosphere and ocean model.
