This proposal is a request for a renewal of funding for the collaborative
effort between F. S. Spear (RPI) and T. M. Harrison (UCLA) to investigate the
pressure-temperature-time evolution of central New England through detailed
petrological, structural and geochronologic studies. This is an ongoing research
project, the ultimate goal of which is to understand better the tectonic and
therm evolution of the New England orogenies. Work completed and in progress
under the current grant has delineated several projects where additional,
detailed research will provide needed constraints on the evolution of the
Acadian orogen. Proposed studies include: (1) detailed petrology, kinematic
analysis and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology along the Bronson Hill anticlinorium; (2)
detailed petrology, kinematic analysis and geochronology and in the vicinity of
the Strafford dome, Vermont; (3) geochronologic and petrologic study of
amphibolites that display anomalously old (415-440 Ma) hornblende 40Ar/39Ar ages
in eastern Vermont; (4) additional 40Ar/39Ar data throughout New England to
delineate better the axis of hinged uplift between New Hampshire and Vermont;
and, (5) theoretical analysis of cooling histories based on a novel treatment of
40Ar/39Ar release spectra from K- feldspars. We will integrate our findings with
stratigraphic, structural, paleontological and geophysical constraints and
attempt to reconcile these data into a coherent and consistent interpretation.
