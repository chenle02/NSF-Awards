9707680 McLendon The aims of this research are to examine structure function
relationships in the protein cytochrome C1. Genetic and molecular biological
procedures will be used to systematically alter cytochrome c1 (Cc1) in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cc1 mutants will be generated by three procedures:
conventional oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, transformation of yeast
directly with synthetic oligonucleotides, and PCR-generated random mutagenesis.
The Cc1 mutants will be tested for functionality by growth on nonfermentable
media (Nfs+ or Nfs-) , Cc1 levels by spectral analysis, and preservation of the
over-all structure of Nfs- mutants by dominate-negative genetic analysis. The
altered forms will be used to investigate structure-function relationships of
Cc1 and the interactions between Cc1 and cytochrome c (Cc), both in vivo and in
vitro. The sites of interaction between Cc1 and Cc, as well as between the
cytochromes and Qcr6p, will be investigated with genetic approaches using
suppressor mutations. Reactivity in vitro will be studied by steady state and
single turnover methods, including highly exergonic (G( reactions using
photoinduced electron transfer from Cc. The objective of this research is to
examine structure function relationships in the protein cytochrome c1 (Cc1).
This protein plays a critical role in mitochodrial electron transport, and
thereby helps control energy production within cells. This research will probe
factors which influence the redox potentials of Cc1, and thereby affect both
thermodynamic and kinetic reactivity of this system. The work will employ
genetic, molecular biological and biophysical procedures. ***
