Ecologists have hypothesized that regulation of plankton communities by
planktivores varies with lake trophic state, suggesting that an interaction
effect exists between fish effects and lake trophic state effects on plankton
communities. A fish x lake trophic state interaction effect is one that cannot
be predicted by considering fish effects independently of lake trophic state
effects. To date, there have been no tests of this fish x lake trophic state
interaction hypothesis. In the proposed study, there are two principle parts:
(1) a test of the fish x lake trophic state interaction hypothesis using outdoor
tank experiments to examine the effects of five different densities of a
planktivore, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), on the biomass and species
composition of picoplankton, nanoplankton, microplankton, mesoplankton, and
macroplankton from six lake communities representing the range of trophic states
of southwestern reservoirs, and (2) the development of regression models for
predicting biomass of picoplankton, nanoplankton, microplankton, mesoplankton,
and macroplankton across gradients of fish density and lake trophic state. The
study will provide the first view of how the impacts of different densities of
fish on plankton biomass change with lake trophic state.
