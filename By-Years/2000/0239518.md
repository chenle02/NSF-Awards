Proposal ID: AST-0239518 Institution: Clemson University PI: King, Jeremy

Dr. Jeremy King will use his CAREER award at Clemson University to determine
high precision chemical abundances for the stars in a sample of open clusters.
He will consistently determine the abundances of Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K,
Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni; these elements have varied nucleosynthetic origins,
circumstellar condensation temperatures, and contributions to
interior/atmospheric stellar opacities. Dr. King will use the magnitude and
variations of these derived abundances to address several fundamental
astrophysical issues, including the efficacy of standard stellar models, the
relationship between age and metallicity in the galactic disk, the relationship
between age and chromospheric emission in stars, and the absolute ages of star
clusters. He will also study the chemical homogeneity in several kinematically-
defined "stellar moving groups" as a test of their existence.

In addition to his research, Dr. King will enable the growth of observational
astronomy at Clemson University through education and outreach. He will involve
undergraduate students in his research, and develop astronomy-related Java
applets containing self-assessment and conceptual extension exercises. The
development of a dedicated astronomy server, Tiger Premier Astronomy Web Server
(TigerPAWS), will not only meet the increased needs of the undergraduate
students but also provide educational materials for K-12 classrooms. He will
also deliver astronomy outreach programs to several different groups in South
Carolina: TigerTailgate Astronomy at football games, Tigers Towards Astronomy In
the Life of Seniors (TigerTAILS) for senior citizens, Tiger Rural Observational
Astronomy Resource (TigerROAR) for rural K-12 students populating special
education classrooms, and Tiger STudents Routinely In Precarious Educational
Settings (TigerSTRIPES), aimed at youth under the care of the juvenile detention
system.
