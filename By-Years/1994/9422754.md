Affect and emotion have been actively studied in psychology for more than a
century, yet few studies have examined the role of affect in technological risk
assessment. This research develops and tests a theory that portrays affect and
cognitive worldviews as functionally similar, working in parallel to help
experts and laypersons cope with complexity and uncertainty in the face of risk.
Quantitative measures of affect will be developed and used in empirical studies
of expert and lay judgments about technological risks. The theoretical and
empirical insights obtained from this work should lead to a better appreciation
of how laypersons and experts derive meaning from risk information and
experience.
