0445392&lt;br/&gt;Yuen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this grant will support
development of a collection of computational, analysis and visualization web
services that interact with user clients using an intelligent middleware fabric
based on the publish/subscribe paradigm. Java Applets and PhP-based interfaces
will serve as front end graphical user interfaces. The developed system, WEB-IS,
will facilitate collaborative scientific visualization, wavelet and statistical
analysis of massive geoscience sets. Examples of large data set generating
technologies and techniques applied in Earth science research include synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric analysis (InSAR), multispectral remote
sensing, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), global and regional continuously
operated seismic and GPS networks, very high resolution petrographic studies
using field emission electron microscopy, and large-scale 3-D numerical
simulations in geodynamics. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain
practical experience in the art of developing frameworks and have the
opportunity use them in geophysical applications through direct association with
the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
