9511737 Liao This project is on research to develop a new framework for
metabolic modeling. The modeling approach treats the system at two levels: a
component (molecular) level and a systems level. The component level consists of
mechanistic or hybrid/fuzzy models. The systems level is the differential
equations that result from the mass balances on the components, according to the
metabolic, regulatory, or signal transduction pathways. This modeling strategy
will be developed and applied to metabolic and global regulation pathways in
Escherichia coli. Specific problems to be examined which suggest hitherto
unknown regulatory mechanisms include: (1) the regulation of glucose uptake by
enzymes; (2) the interaction of central metabolism with nitrogen regulation; and
(3) the interaction of central metabolism with the heat shock response. ***
