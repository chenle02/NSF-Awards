9318602 Brody This research investigates the combined roles of pollinators and a
seed predator on the origins of flowering times of two Rocky Mountain
wildflowers: Polemonium foliosissimum and Ipomopsis aggregata. Because these two
plant species have a common seed predator but utilize different pollinators, the
flowering time of one species may affect seed production in the other by
attracting the seed predator. The investigators are also examining how the seed
predators (an anthomyiid fly) select and/or manipulate flowers to increase their
own offspring's survival. %%% This research is novel in addressing the potential
indirect interaction between two plants species that share seed predators. Most
previous research has been limited to studying a single interaction between
organisms at a time. This project is important in that it addresses multiple
plant-plant and plant-insect interactions simultaneously, allowing the detection
of complex relationships that may be common in nature but usually ignored in
standard ecological studies. The results of this research may have applications
in agriculture and conservation biology: seed-production by valuable plants is
often simultaneously reduced by seed predators and increased by pollinators.
Understanding the dynamics of these conflicts may help us learn how to optimize
flowering schedules to increase seed yields. ***
