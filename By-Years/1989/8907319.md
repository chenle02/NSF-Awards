A superminicomputer capable of the throughput of a CRAY X-MP is proposed for the
Structural Biology group at the University of California, San Francisco. This
computer will play a critical role in the scientific projects of over 100
faculty, postdocs and graduate students at UCSF. The focus of use of the
computer will be in the design of bioactive molecules. Such a design process
will couple large-scale numerical computations with protein and DNA production
and three dimensional structural determination using NMR and X-ray
crystallography. The proposed computer is an essential link in this design
process.
