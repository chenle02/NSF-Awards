IBN 94-03719 McSweeney Abstract Responding is not constant within experimental
sessions when animals respond on operant-conditioning procedures. Instead,
responding often begins slowly, increases to a peak and then decreases
throughout the rest of the session. Dr. McSweeney will try to determine why
these changes occur. In particular, her experiments are designed to separate the
contribution of factors related to reinforcement, such as arousal followed by
satiation, from the contribution of central factors, such as the focusing and
waning of attention. These experiments are important for both theory and method
for two reasons. (1) Many experiments in operant psychology are not designed so
that their data can be interpreted if such within-session changes in responding
occur. (2) Rate of responding averaged over the session is one of the primary
dependent variables in operant psychology. Finding systematic changes in
responding within sessions suggests that this measure ignores important changes
in behavior at a more detailed level. Improving theory and methods in operant
psychology has important practical benefits. Operant techniques are used as
methods for determining the effects of physiological variables (for example, in
the pharmaceutical industry) and as the basis for some forms of therapy for
human behavioral problems.
