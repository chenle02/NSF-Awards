The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project may significantly improve the quality of end-of-
life care through Advanced Care Planning (ACP). It is not always possible to
align patients' end-of-life wishes with the care they receive. The proposed
project develops a digital platform for ACP. This system will use a machine-
learning guided dialogue to deliver personalized audiovisual content adapted to
individual and cultural preferences. This system may improve palliative end-of-
life care for many. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge of providing a
personalized platform that performs digital motivational interviewing and adapts
audiovisual content and input queries to patientsâ€™ personae. A major hurdle of
applying machine learning to ACP is the variability in personal and cultural
factors, as well as validation of the integrity of the responses. The project
centers on the collection and analysis of psychometric data from two patient
surveys combined with other health information. The project objectives are: (a)
Execute a benchmark training patient survey for the machine-learning algorithm
for a study on the influence of gender, ethnicity, and health status on ACP; (b)
Develop a reliable persona detection tool using machine learning algorithms
guided by the data, avoiding the introduction of unconscious bias; (c)
Demonstrate that the platform improves completion rates and patient satisfaction
compared to ACP administered by human health workers and static online platforms
without machine learning; and (d) Demonstrate the alignment of the digital
process with patient wishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
