To increase the representation of minorities in science, engineering, and
mathematics (SEM) careers, the University of Pennsylvania proposes a
undergraduate Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) program designed to
retain in SEM disciplines high- potential minority student enrollees. Because it
builds on existing strategies at Penn, particularly those designed to encourage
and prepare students for SEM careers, the RCMS program will have economies of
cost and scale. The faculty mentor group will be comprised of seven faculty from
Penn, and three from our cooperating institutions. Lincoln and Cheyney
Universities. Minority undergraduate SEM majors from all three schools will be
eligible to participate in RCMS program.
