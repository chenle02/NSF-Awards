This award provides funding for 5 graduate student positions in a new training
program in the identification, recovery and use of plant genetic resources. The
18 participating faculty come from two institutions (Washington University, the
Missouri Botanical Garden) and the Monsanto Corporation, which is providing
additional funding for the project. The faculty bring expertise in three main
areas (plant and evolutionary biology, conservation and systematic biology, and
plant biotechnology) to the program which will emphasize the identification of
useful plants, the analysis of plant compounds and the genetic engineering of
useful traits. Training will include two new courses, one a course in natural
products chemistry, the other a seminar series in plant genetics resources and
biotechnology. A new internship program at Monsanto will provide trainees with
additional training in an industrial setting.
