This grant is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award.
During the SBIR Phase I award, pyrolytic reaction in a concurrent flame of
hydrogen and chlorine was demonstrated to be a new processing route for the
preparation of ultra-fine ceramic (silicon nitride) and refractory metal
(niobium and tantalum) powders. Phase II activities include improved
understanding of diffusion flame processing in order to increase powder output.
Quantities of powders sufficient for extensive characterization and evaluation
are being produced. Of particular interest is the compaction, hot pressing and
sintering behavior. Fabricated test specimens are being used for evaluation of
mechanical strength, fracture toughness, and resistance to thermal shock.
