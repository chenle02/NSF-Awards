This award will provide support for a 2-day in-person workshop for NSF/AST
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site directors to discuss and
share best practices, identify new and existing challenges, coordinate the
recruitment, selection, and professional development of student interns, as well
as that of assessment and evaluation across sites. Given that the last REU Site
workshop was held in 2020, an in-person workshop in 2023 that brings together
managers or representatives from all 35 sites that include astronomy-based
research will foster needed discussions to improve the implementation of all
programs and would be particularly beneficial for new site
directors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help the participants set
future agendas for the study of issues of concern for astronomy REU sites in the
future and disseminate relevant resources. A document will be developed and
disseminated using the experiences of the participants as part of this project
that will serve as a resource for current and future site
directors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
