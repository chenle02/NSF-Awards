The objectives of this research are to advance the understanding of cloud
development and precipitation formation and to provide observations that can be
used for evaluating large-eddy simulations of air flow and mixing processes in
clouds. The work is based on observations using ground-based remote sensing
instruments consisting of a vertically-pointing 94 GHz (3.2 mm wavelength)
radar, a UHF wind-profiling radar, and a newly built vertically-pointing X-band
(3.2 cm wavelength) radar. Together, these radars enable the measurement of
vertical motions of both the air and the raindrops in clouds. The fall speed of
the drops relative to the air can be determined, enabling the estimation of the
drop-size distribution. The main site of the experiments is a field station at
Virginia Key, although the equipment will be installed on a 20-ft trailer to
enable observations from other locations. Observations will be used to document
the structure of fair-weather cumulus clouds as well as the relations between
precipitation development and vertical air motions in clouds producing heavy
rain. The work contributes to precipitation physics by direct observation and to
cloud modeling by providing the data needed for validating numerical
simulations.
