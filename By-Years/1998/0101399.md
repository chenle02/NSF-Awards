Frederick MacDonnell of the University of Texas, Arlington is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, and by the
Nanoscience and Engineering Initiative, for a program of research on tertiary
and quaternary structures in rigid supramolecular assemblies. Rigid dendrimers
(previously prepared by the PI) will be used in synthesis and self-assembly of
rigid, spatially well-defined, macromolecular assemblies. Enantiomerically pure
complexes of the trisphenanthroline ruthenium(II) type will serve as the the
fundamental building blocks for these assemblies. The resulting structures will
be spatially well defined, since the components are conformationally inflexible.
This project will examine the 'quartenary structure' and behavior of larger
aggregations of these macromolecular species -- that is the structure and
properties of 'assemblies of assemblies'. Those rigid, spatially well-defined
nano-scale composites will be examined as colloidal aggregates in solutions and
on surfaces, using several techniques, including microscopy (STM and
AFM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves preparing small molecular
complexes containing ruthenium atoms surrounded by organic ligands arranged in a
known, regular and rigid structure and linking these units, in a controlled way,
into larger aggregates that also have known, rigid, and regular spatial
arrangements. These macromolecular assemblies will then be combined to form
nano-scale aggregates, in solution, in colloidal suspension and as particles
adsorbed on surfaces. This effort will examine how the properties and behavior
(both physical and chemical) of the nano-scale aggregates is related to the
known characteristics of the component fundamental units that comprise each
system. This multilevel approach has high probability of generating
understanding and technical experience that will be of considerable benefit to
the progress of nanoscience and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
