Project SAMPLE, Science and Methodology in Pre-College Learning Experiences,
will involve twenty-five rising high school seniors working with five members of
the College of Science and Engineering Technology faculty for a period of three
weeks in summer, 1989. All twenty-five will participate in research methodology
in the fields of chemistry, microbiology, geology and field biology. Experiences
will include learning scientific techniques as well as participating in research
data collection. Each student will select a discipline and thesis to explore
working with one of the faculty as a mentor. A literature search and preparation
of a proposal paper will occur before the end of the project. Mini-grants will
be available to help support the students individual research during the
academic year. Mentors will not only advise these students in their projects but
will also involve these students in activities such as professional meetings,
field trips, science competitions, and guest lecturer programs.
