This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a virtual Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site led by a team of faculty from the
Hormel Institute at the University of Minnesota, the State University of New
York College at Cortland, and Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York. This REU site
supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of
2022-2024. The objective of this program is to provide a positive, authentic
research experience to a diverse group of students, early in their academic
careers. This is a fully online, REU program, where students take part in guided
independent research, as part of an online community of peers, to analyze and
predict the relationship between structure and function in biomolecules. The
inherent flexibility of this virtual format makes this program broadly
accessible to a wide variety of students, including those who would not
otherwise be able to access on-site REU programs. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this program will learn about molecular interactions
and explore structure-function relationships in a learning environment that is
supportive and flexible, guided by a team of faculty and peer mentors. To foster
community and to strengthen communication skills, participants will participate
in weekly, informal social events, professional development activities, and
multiple, guided research meetings. The summer experience culminates in an
online, capstone research symposium where students present a research poster
they have created to their peers and research mentors. The independent research
conducted by the students will result in advances in understanding of enzyme
function, primary and secondary metabolism, and will provide training and
insight into the the structural basis for enzyme
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
