This grant is to support a week-long international conference in Approximation
Theory. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together researchers from around
the world to present their latest work in this field, and to discuss future
directions for the field. Approximation theory impacts many areas of
mathematics, engineering, and science. Some of its many applications include
computer-aided design (especially important in the automobile, aircraft, and
movie industries), computer-aided imaging (important in the medical sciences),
and computational methods for modeling and analyzing engineering structures
(useful for solving a variety of problems of military and security importance).
The conference will bring leading senior people together with graduate students
and young researchers just entering the field, with the aim of assisting in the
development of young talent to bolster U.S. mathematical and scientific
capabilities for the future.
