The Worcester Pipeline Collaborative ASCEND Initiative will offer Worcester
youth long-term, academic research projects/partnerships, summer research
projections for high school students and self-directed research projects for
middle and high school students and a summer science camp and after schools
science club for middle school students. The long-term project goal is to
enhance scientific literacy in Central Massachusetts by preparing students
interested in science skills with the necessary skills. This is especially
important in an urban community whose traditional manufacturing base is being
replaced by technological and health industries.
