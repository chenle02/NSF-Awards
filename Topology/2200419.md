The interaction and interplay between geometric and algebraic techniques have
fueled many exciting developments throughout mathematics and theoretical
physics. Inherent within many of these deep connections is the notion of
symmetry. As we push the boundaries of mathematics to unexplored frontiers, it
is becoming increasingly clear that a more refined notion of symmetry is
required for the next generation of theories. This project leverages cutting-
edge developments in geometry to uncover new algebraic structures governing
these new "higher" symmetries. The project will also provide research training
opportunities for students.

Leveraging new insights gained through the interplay between low-dimensional
topology and representation theory, this project details a program to achieve
results not apparent through one specialization alone. The PI will introduce
fundamentally new tools in higher representation theory inspired by advances in
emerging areas of topology, including bordered Heegaard-Floer theory, odd link
homologies, non-semisimple TQFT, and spectrafication (or stable homotopy
refinements of link homologies). Transporting and reinterpreting these recent
advances through a representation-theoretic lens will illuminate new connections
and allow for extensions that are not only useful in advancing the field of
representation theory but can also be back-fed into the study of low-dimensional
topology and surrounding fields.
