EIA- 0240689&lt;br/&gt;Edwin Rood&lt;br/&gt;West Virginia
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Workshop for a Biometric Research
Agenda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to develop a
consensus for a biometric research agenda by bringing together the national
experts in various disciplines converging to the field of biometrics. The
disciplines include natural science and engineering, social science, political
science, economics, and other disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will address the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What biometric
technologies are currently deployed, currently available but not yet deployed,
and in development that could be deployed in the foreseeable
future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What measures of effectiveness are required to
ensure that these technologies help to provide
security?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the economic verses effectiveness trade-
offs of implementing these technologies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the
implications of biometric technologies for personal security and preservation of
individual liberties, and for lifestyle within our
society?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
