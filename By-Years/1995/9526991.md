9526991 DeCelles The Sevier fold-thrust belt offers an appropriate place to
develop the nature of the linkage between the hinterland and frontal parts of
the orogenic belt, and to estimate such parameters as regional paleoelevation
and paleotopographic relief. The problem will be approached using combined
structural and sedimentological tools including data collected by standard
methods of basin analysis, seismic and borehole data, surface mapping and
integration of these data into incrementally retrodeformable, regional cross
sections. The resulting restoration will provide information needed to
understand depositional events in the western interior foreland basin and will
applicable to the evolution of fold-thrust orogenic wedges in general.
