This project addresses how the sense of touch might be used to understand
speech. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop tactile aids for the
deaf and deaf-blind, to substitute for auditory communication. The research will
increase knowledge about tactile sensory capabilities, about speech perception,
and about sensory substitution, in addition to the technological contribution to
communication aids. This laboratory has already demonstrated the usefulness of a
tactile method for understanding speech, called Tadoma, in which the "listener"
places a hand on the speaker's face to monitor movements, vibrations, and
airflow. In the present project, two additional techniques will be studied. One
is the improvement in performance when using "Augmented Tadoma," which adds an
auxiliary tactile display of information on tongue position. The other is
"Synthetic Tadoma," which uses an artificial mechanical talking face as a
research tool to analyze Tadoma and evaluate its components.
