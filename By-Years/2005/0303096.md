REVISED ABSTRACT, Building a Pipeline for Diversity, GEO-0303096, Furman,
Tanya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide initial funding for efforts
by the Department of Geosciences at the Pennsylvania State University to
increase diversity in the geosciences. Key components of this award are the
development of two new undergraduate courses (Geo-Resource Development and
Sustainable Livelihoods in Africa; Appropriate Technology for Africa) at the
University Park campus, the adaptation of these courses for implementation at
the University's two year campus in Delaware County, the export of a third
general education course (Environments of Africa) to the branch campus, and the
addition of minority students to an existing summer research experience for
talented undergraduates. Support will be provided for faculty summer salary,
program development supplies and travel, as well as for the initial set-up of
the program website and participant support for the summer research experiences.
