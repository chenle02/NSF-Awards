This project is concerned with the study of linear groups over fields of
fractions of enveloping algebras and polycyclic groups rings. The principal
investigator will extend known results from ordinary linear group theory to
linear groups over the noncommutative division rings which arise from enveloping
algebras of Lie algebras and from group rings of polycyclic groups. Certain
related ring theoretic problems such as what are the finite dimensional algebras
will also be considered. This research focuses on the study of matrix rings over
fields of fractions. Little is known about the structure of algebraic objects
over skew fields and the principal investigator is one of the few researchers
who is trying to improve this situation.
