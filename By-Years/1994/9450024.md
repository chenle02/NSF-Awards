9450024 George This EPWG Project, Collaboration for Equity will make equity for
girls and women, of all colors, abilities, and backgrounds, a central rather
than a marginal consideration in the efforts to reform math and science
education. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, Girls
Incorporated, the Education Development Center, and others will use their
collective resources to work in partnership with organizations that can act as
advocates for equity and influence the reform efforts and the formal education
system. The objective of the initiative are to (1) strategies with the
initiators of systemic reform efforts to determine how to make equity both a
driving force an a measure of success; (2) to collaborate with the initiators
and implementors of systemic reform to translate hate equity means into concrete
strategies and activities; (3) to provide support and assistance for systemic
reform organizations and equity- based organizations to advocate effectively for
equity in mathematics and science education reform; and (4) to strengthen the
equity community by building a common language for equity in mathematics and
science and addressing the issues that separate advocates for gender equity,
racial/ethnic equity, and disability equity. ***
