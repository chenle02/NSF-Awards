This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funding to replace
existing biological research labs with 11 modern wet laboratories designed to
support faculty and student research and research training at the undergraduate
and master levels. The renovated biology lab complex will support research
projects with an emphasis on environmental biology questions. The laboratories
include facilities focused on research in population ecology, plant ecology,
comparative physiology, anatomy, microbiology, and science education. The
renovated laboratories will be used to advance knowledge and understanding of
prairie and woodland restorations with emphasis on natural and controlled fire
regimes; polyphasic DNA-based molecular analyses of diversity, structure,
function, and population dynamics of microbial communities; comparative
physiology and environmental toxicology; conservation biology and vertebrate
ecology focused on population structure, community composition, and ecotoxicity;
functional morphology of mammalian jaw mechanisms; and modeling hydrological and
ecophysiological processes in forest ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
institution serves a diverse student body of mainly adult learners, averaging 34
years of age, with the majority attending school part-time (74%). The total
student population includes a high proportion of students from groups that are
under-represented in science and engineering. In the Academic Year 2007-2008,
roughly one-third of undergraduates were low-income students and over half were
first-generation college students. Amongst other impacts on the integration of
research and education, will be the inclusion of research experiences into the
preparation of secondary school science teachers.
