This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports research focusing on the study of the
classical and quantum mechanical properties of black holes and black-hole-like
entities. The structure of special types of black holes will be investigated in
detail using a variety of recently developed techniques. These black holes will
serve as theoretical laboratories to develop understanding of how to unify
gravity and quantum mechanics. The search for a consistent theory of quantum
gravity is one of the outstanding open problems in theoretical physics. It is
likely that understanding the classical and quantum properties of black holes in
all dimensions will play an important role in the development of a successful
theory of quantum gravity. Undergraduate students will be fully engaged in all
aspects of research. Significant learning outcomes for the students will be
available, thus facilitating a successful transition to graduate school or
future career. An extensive outreach program to middle grade and high school
students will be developed, including the construction of a webpage on black
hole physics aimed at high school students, and undergraduates.
