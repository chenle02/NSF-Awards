9624832 Prausnitz This career development plan contains both research and
education activities. The objective of the research is to develop a mechanistic
understanding of the effects of ultrasound on molecular transport cross lipid
bilayer membranes, with particular regard to drug delivery applications. Flow
cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and impedance microscopy will be used to
assess transport rates and test for the presence of various transport
mechanisms. This research will also investigate the effect of ultrasound on
increasing molecular transport rates across skin. The goal of the educational
plan is to broaden the community in which students interact with other
scientists in various disciplines. Some aspects of this include the use of
nontraditional problems in standard chemical engineering courses, and the
development of a new bioengineering course which emphasizes cross- disciplinary
thinking and interaction with people outside the university. ***
