This research is in the area of combinatorics. Specifically problems in
enumerative combinatorics, including symmetric functions and their
generalizations, the theory of P- recursiveness, lattice path enumeration,
permutation enumeration, and hypergeometric series will be studied. This
research covers a broad front in combinatorics, the mathematics associated with
combinations of finite sets. Much attention will be spent in various "counting
problems", one of the most important and difficult areas of combinatorics.
Moreover the potential applications to other areas such as computer science are
very important. Thus this research holds much promise for excellent
contributions.
