Chip multiprocessors (i.e., multicores) are rapidly emerging as the dominant
platform for computing. This computing environment features parallel computing
with shared-memory and a hierarchy of caches. This research project will develop
a theory of multicore computing, which will include (but is not limited to) the
following aspects: Developing and refining abstract theoretical models for
multicore computing; designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for multicores
for important problems, including cache-oblivious and processor-oblivious
algorithms; designing schedulers for efficient execution of parallel algorithms
on multicores; and developing lower bounds to delineate the inherent limitations
of multicore computing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the project will be
a new set of methods for the efficient use of multicores. Since multicores are
widely expected to be the dominant compute platform for the foreseeable future,
these results are likely to have broad applicability to all fields that rely on
compute-intensive tasks.&lt;br/&gt;
