The investigator develops analytical and numerical reconstruction techniques to
recover quantities important in theoretical biophysics. The systems considered
all include stochastic effects, and the measurements to be considered are
distributions of first passage times. Developing physical, statistical
mechanical models, he uses the first passage time distribution function to
construct parameters or functions in the physical model. Of particular interest
is the reconstruction of macromolecular potentials from bond-breaking times. An
analysis of bounds and how measurement errors affect the stability of
reconstructed quantities is undertaken.

The investigator develops mathematical tools, theoretical and computational,
that allow quantitative reconstruction of unknown quantities from measured data
in fluctuating, random systems. This class of problems is called stochastic
inverse problems. Two examples are how molecular bonds break, and how chemical
reactions progress. Typically, for the bond-breaking problem, the detailed
molecular interactions are assumed known, from which the behavior of the bond
(e.g. how likely it is to break) is theoretically predicted. Similarly, in
chemical reactions, specific reaction rates and chemical networks are assumed.
One then solves the rate equations with these "given" parameters to find, say,
the concentration of a chemical species as a function of time after the start of
a reaction. In the formulation of the inverse problem, we do not know the
intermolecular forces, or the rates of chemical reactions. Rather, we measure
the lifetime of a bond before it breaks, and from these data, infer the
microscopic molecular interactions. In chemical reactions, we attempt to use the
measured concentrations to deduce the chemical reaction rates. These and related
inverse problems have wide applicability in numerous disciplines, and can
potentially optimize and simplify industrial processes such as drug design and
drug delivery. Moreover, the techniques can provide valuable theoretical tools
with which to probe fundamental genetic regulation processes inside cells.
