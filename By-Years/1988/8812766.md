We are investigating the molecular mechanisms controlling initiation of DNA
replication in eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. Our approach makes use of new
techniques and findings established in this laboratory, these include: 1)
Development of a technique which permits injection of materials into eggs
without activating them; 2) Discovery that injected Type 1 Bovine Papilloma
Virus (BPV1) DNA is only replicated after eggs are activated, but replication is
made more efficient by injection prior to activation; 3) Observation that
vectors which lack the BPV1 origin of replication do not display the same
improvement in replication efficiency. These results provide the first clear
indication that Xenopus eggs initiate DNA replication via use of a known
eukaryotic origin. Experiments aimed at further characterizing the egg-plasmid
interactions are proposed: A) Determination of the optimal amount of DNA/egg
which yields synchronous initiation of 1st round replication of the maximum
number of molecules: B) Confirmation that double stranded DNA is replicated in
activated eggs via a semiconservative mechanism; C) Determination, of the role
of RNA transcription in the initiation of DNA replication. D) Determination of
whether plasmids which lack origins of replication inhibit the efficient
replication of those which contain functional origins. Experiments along these
lines will help to test our working model which postulates that the protein
factors in the cytoplasm of the unactivated egg interact with origin containing
DNA sequences. The successful completion of these experiments will allow greater
insight into the mechanisms and cellular factors necessary for the faithful
initiation and replication of eukaryotic DNA in in vivo conditions.
