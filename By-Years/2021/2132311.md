This award will contribute to national prosperity and economic welfare by
advancing data science methods for improving manufacturing systems combining
automated machines and human workers using data from in-situ sensors. This will
allow the operational uncertainties arising from human operations to be
quantified and integrated into models for performance evaluation and operations
planning. The award will also prepare the next generation of scientists by
providing multidisciplinary research, training, and international collaboration
opportunities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Our team will
broadly disseminate their research findings and share data and the resulting
software packages to the data science and operations engineering
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant scientific
advances in data science and smart manufacturing, going beyond current methods
focused on human action recognition by incorporating a contextual understanding
of human motions analysis in operational analysis. The use of wrapped Gaussian
distributions will introduce new mathematical and probability spaces related to
human operations and novel computational approaches to related inference
problems. These methods will complement current smart manufacturing research by
supporting digital twins of manufacturing systems with human operational data,
contributing to the body of scientific and engineering knowledge and improved
industrial productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
