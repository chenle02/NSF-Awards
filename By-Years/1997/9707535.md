ATM-9707535 Saltzman, Eric S. University of Miami Title: Extraction and Analysis
of Methyl Bromide in Greenland Ice Cores Polar ice cores represent a potential
archive for paleo-atmospheric methyl bromide. Such data will be useful in
constraining the biogeochemical cycle of methyl bromide and in understanding its
climatic sensitivity. Polar ice core measurements will also help explain recent
observations regarding the distribution of methyl bromide in air extracted from
polar firn. This project will consist of the extraction of air from shallow and
deep Greenland ice core samples and the development techniques for the analysis
of methyl bromide using gas chromatography with electron capture detection and
gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Developing historical
records of atmospheric methyl bromide over time scales of 102-103 years would
lead to new insight in to the range of natural variability in atmospheric methyl
bromide concentrations and its relationship to climate change.
