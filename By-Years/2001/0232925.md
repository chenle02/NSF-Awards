This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel nanoparticle-fluoropolymer (NP-FP) material that fills an immediate
commercial need and represents a prototype for a family of compositions that
should spawn new products, businesses, and industries. Desirable optical
properties of materials often come mixed with undesirable properties. An example
is the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) which will be employed in an all-fiber optical
circulator. While it provides strong Faraday rotation and optical transparency,
these come with a high refractive index and an inconvenient crystalline
structure that makes incorporation in coatings or molded components difficult.
Deposition limitations have been overcome by incorporating YIG nanoparticles
into a polymer matrix, but hydrocarbon polymer matrices also have moderately
high refractive indices and strong optical absorption beyond 700 nm. The project
will develop solvent-cast amorphous fluoropolymers films impregnated with YIG
nanoparticles. The porosity, inertness, and low refractive index characteristics
of amorphous fluoropolymer materials offer great hope that a variety of
nanoparticle-impregnated materials will be developed based upon nanoparticle
modification techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications for
this technology will be to the telecommunications, photonics, and sensor
technologies. The networking market alone will benefit greatly from this
technology.&lt;br/&gt;
