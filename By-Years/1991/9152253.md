The aim of this project is to provide the undergraduate students in mechanical
engineering the highest quality laboratory experience by exposing them to the
latest in non- contact laser transducer technology. This will be accomplished by
the acquisition of a laser vibrometer (LV) system for use in the existing
vibrations laboratory. This will directly support the undergraduate engineering
vibrations and laser engineering courses, as well as being used by undergraduate
students in various design projects and other laboratories.
