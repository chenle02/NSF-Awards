9512210 Oden This proposal requests the acquisition of a mid-scale parallel
computing system consisting of 32 to 64 processing elements with high bandwidth
interprocessor communication to insure scalability into the teraflop regime. The
system will have parallel I/O to a disk system of around 100 gigabytes capacity.
The facility will provide for the development of new computational algorithms,
new software tools and mathematical techniques which will have a broad impact
across a multitude of scientific and engineering disciplines. The proposed
facility supports broad research activities across a variety of disciplines in
engineering and sciences, in such tasks parallel computing play an important
role. These research activities span the entire spectrum of computational
modeling, ranging from computational chemistry to engineering mechanics, and to
astrophysics. ***
