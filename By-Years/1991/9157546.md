The investigator will study computational fluid dynamics problems centering on
shock wave propagation and transonic flow, and also the partial differential
equations that describe semiconductor devices. These equations are similar to
the equations of fluid dynamics and many of the numerical techniques useful in
one case carry over to the other. Numerical calculations and the development of
algorithms are a major part of these studies. Computational fluid dynamics
undertakes to determine numerically the solution of the differential equations
that describe the motion of a fluid, particularly in cases where the solution
cannot be written down explicitly. Such difficult cases are the rule for the
fluid dynamics problems that arise in practice. Applications in which shocks
occur are common. Transonic flow problems arise in aerospace design. In the area
of semiconductors, the project work has applications in resolving several
different semiconductor models and in the fabrication of semiconductors.
