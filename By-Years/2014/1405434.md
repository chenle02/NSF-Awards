The Documenting Endangered Languages program supports innovation and excellence
in language documentation methodology with a view to better understand the
linguistic and cognitive abilities of humans and the linguistic characteristics
of individual languages. To this end, the Documenting Endangered Languages
program will support the Master Classes and Special Sessions at the
International Conference on Language Documentation & Conservation. This
conference brings together leading world experts in language documentation to
share, critique, and perfect methods in documenting endangered languages. The
conference has quickly become the leading venue for ideas exchange and
initiative creation for the language documentation field.

A series of twelve Master Classes on eliciting and documenting various topics in
grammar will be held each day of the conference. The topics will range from
general treatments of first and second language acquisition in the context of
endangered languages to advanced typological goals such as the elicitation and
documentation of verb alignment/argument structure; tense and aspect; deixis;
tone and intonation; valence changing constructions/processes; definiteness and
quantification; evidentiality; and topic and focus Constructions. Each two-hour
class will be taught by a leading expert in that area.

The greater societal impact of the conference will come in the exploration of
links between language documentation (practice), deep understanding of
grammatical structure (theory), and methods for teaching endangered languages
(application). Through Master Classes and Special Sessions on Pedagogy in
Language Conservation, the conference will foster discipline-wide discussion on
the relationship between linguistic structure and language pedagogy, based on
the premise that language revitalization is the key to keeping data alive and
available for scientific study.
