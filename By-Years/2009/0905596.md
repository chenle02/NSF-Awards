This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on understanding
the principles and methods for the design of green networks at the edge of the
Internet. The total power consumption of edge networks is estimated to be quite
significant, so even moderate improvements in energy-usage in an individual
device can result in non-trivial savings overall. Obtaining these moderate
improvements in the energy-efficiency of edge networks is challenging for two
reasons: the diversity of edge networks and the dynamics in their
workload.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Leveraging the researchers'
combined expertise in low-power electronics, link-layer technologies, and
energy-efficient network subsystem design and architecture, the project will: a)
devise a deep energy-inspection architecture that encompasses a broad range of
edge devices and networking technologies, and incorporates innovative hardware
designs for subsystem-level monitoring and control of energy usage; b) explore
run-time energy adaptation at various levels of the network, enabled by this
inspection architecture; c) examine coordination mechanisms for controlling edge
network energy usage which will allow coordinated energy management across
components and devices, enabling more aggressive energy
savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts. The project can have significant
societal benefit, targeted as it is on sustainable technologies. Moreover, the
techniques it develops for energy efficiency can be broadly applied to other
areas of computing: large server systems, mobile devices, and consumer
appliances. Beyond its impact on technology, the project will also contribute to
workforce development by training EE and CS students in
sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
