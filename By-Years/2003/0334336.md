This proposal seeks to develop a regional research and education network,
initially among six private institutions in Puerto Rico, and to, ultimately,
connect them to the Abilene/Internet2 advanced network. Telecommunications costs
are extremely high in Puerto Rico and often prohibitive for a small, private
college. By creating infrastructure of their own, the intention is to build and
jointly manage a network which will enhance the educational, collaborative and
technological opportunities currently available to researchers and students in
small, poorly funded colleges and universities in Puerto Rico. &lt;br/&gt;The
Puerto Rico Educational Network (PREN) will initially be composed of the
following universities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of the Sacred Heart
(USH) in San Juan&lt;br/&gt;Universidad Central del Caribe (UCC) in
Bayamon&lt;br/&gt;Catholic University of Ponce (PUCPR) - Ponce
campus&lt;br/&gt;Catholic University of Ponce (PUCPR) - Mayaguez
campus&lt;br/&gt;Catholic University of Ponce (PUCPR) - Arecibo
campus&lt;br/&gt;Politechnical University of Puerto Rico (PUPR) in San
Juan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional proposed connectors will be added in the
second year of the project and may include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carlos Albizu
University - Old San Juan&lt;br/&gt;American University -
Bayamon&lt;br/&gt;Universidad Central de Bayamon - Bayamon&lt;br/&gt;
