Title: Designer Gene Networks for Biocomputing Applications

Many fundamental cellular processes are governed by genetic networks which
employ protein-DNA interactions in regulating function. The biochemistry of the
feedback loops associated with protein-DNA interactions leads to nonlinear
effects, and the tools of nonlinear analysis become invaluable. This project
involves the use of techniques from nonlinear dynamics and molecular biology to
model, design and construct synthetic gene networks for biocomputing
applications. Here biocomputing is defined as representing the ability of cells
to make decisions based on external stimuli, and in this context, synthetic gene
networks can be viewed as "controllers" for living cells. In this project, a
rapidly switching genetic toggle switch is being modeled and constructed in
bacterial cells. The genetic toggle switch, which is a fundamental unit of
biocomputing memory storage, can be flipped between two stable expression states
using transient chemical or thermal stimuli. In addition, as part of this
project, synthetic gene networks based on more complicated logic gates (i.e.,
AND and OR gates) are being designed, modeled and constructed in bacterial
cells. These circuits can function as sensors of multiple transient signals, and
form the basis for general control schemes requiring an "if/then" structure.

Synthetic gene networks represent a first step towards logical cellular control,
whereby biological processes can be manipulated or monitored at the DNA level.
Ultimately, synthetic gene circuits encoded into DNA, might be "downloaded" into
cells creating, in effect, a "wet" nano-robot. These cellular robots could be
utilized for a variety of functions, including in vivo biosensing, autonomously
synthesizing complex biomaterials, executing programmed cell death, and
interfacing with microelectronic circuits by transducing biochemical events to
and from the electronics.
