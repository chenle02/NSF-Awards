This effort explores the feasibility of extending the dilution limit of an
engine during cold-start conditions by using reformer gas and characterizes
experimentally the chemical interactions of reformer gas with large-carbon-
number hydrocarbon fuels representative of gasoline over a range of pressures,
temperatures, and equivalence ratios. The investigation includes determination
of flame speed with digital particle-imaging velocitmetry (DPIV) using a
counterflow burner, and characterization of oxidation scattering, and planar
laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) using a piston reactor. Engine experiments are
conducted to determine the effect from the use of reformer gas on cold-start
hydrocarbon emissions.

Under the education plan, research findings are integrated into course
development. The program also includes outreach efforts at the precollege level
including science project advising, classroom visits, hands on laboratory
sessions, and laboratory demonstrations.
