Because Earth is a complex coupled interacting system, where no one element is
independent of any other, there are both pressing scientific and societal needs
to improve our understanding how various physical, biological, and hydrological
processes interact in surface Earth systems. This requires the development of
new and increasingly more sophisticated ways of mathematically describing these
systems and improvements in software and user interfaces that will dramatically
enhance our ability to simulate these systems to improve the accuracy and
reliability of model predictions of weather, floods, droughts, and climate
variability. Such improved models will allow researchers to make better use of
available data across disciplines and improve theory and algorithms that are
essential to understanding Earth system behavior. Unfortunately, at present
there is significant overhead of time and effort needed for discovering,
accessing, understanding, and preparing data required to populate these models,
as well as long learning lead times on how to use presently available models,
owing to their complexity. This research overcomes some of these limitations by
developing an innovative open modeling framework that can integrate data and
models easily and is easy to use so that not only the research community and
operational professionals can use it, but also policy makers and other
interested parties. This EAGER award allows the construction of a prototype open
meta-modeling framework that significantly reduces the time and effort on the
part of users in the preparatory work for data and model comparisons, model
testing and validations, for making fundamental knowledge discoveries in surface
and ground water hydrological systems. In this framework, components/modules
interact via user-configured open interfaces that allow the addition and
integration of hydrological models and data sources using a common meta-level
architecture and scientific workflows. The proposed prototype is based on a
recently completed modeling framework, HS-NWSRFS (Hydro-information System for
improving the National Weather Service River Forecast System). It represents a
collaboration between investigators from three institutions, NASA, and NWS Ohio
River Forecast Center (OHRFC). The funded effort will significantly expand the
present code into an open community framework prototype. Broader impacts of the
work include interagency collaboration, improved hydrological forecasting for
rivers, and support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.
