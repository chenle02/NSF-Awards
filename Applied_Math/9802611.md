Abstract --------

We propose to extend work on variational bounds for bulk dissipation in
boundary driven Navier-Stokes turbulence, with particular attention to Rayleigh-
Benard convection. We intend to investigate the effect of rotation and of change
in Prandtl number on high Rayleigh number turbulence. We propose to investigate
analytically and numerically the scaling of generalized structure functions in
Navier-Stokes turbulence and compare the results with those of simple stochastic
models. We propose to study analytically and numerically the formation of
singularities and dynamics of compressible dissipative active scalars and of
quasi-geostrophic incompressible active scalars. We also propose to investigate
models of granular dynamics and their relation to experimental data. The present
proposal is aimed at the understanding of nonlinear phenomena in fluids.
Understanding these phenomena is essential to areas that range from weather
prediction, climate and environmental studies, turbulent combustion (as for
instance in engines) to the cosmological question of mass distribution in the
universe. The objects of study in this proposal represent areas that challenge
or lie beyond the capabilities of the most powerful computing systems available
today; the proposal aim is to develop physical mathematics theory and numerical
models that will yield progress in our ability to perform computer simulations.
