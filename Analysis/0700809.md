The principal investigator intends to study the irreducible unitary
representations of the universal covering of the symplectic group. The
classification of irreducible unitary representations of higher rank symplectic
groups is an important open problem in mathematics and it has a wide range of
applications in number theory, geometric quantization and harmonic analysis. In
this project, the P.I. intends to construct and study irreducible unitary
representations using invariant tensor product. The motivation comes from the
theta correspondence. Due to the work of R. Howe and J-S Li, a large class of
small unitary representations of the symplectic groups can be realized as
invariant tensor products of the oscillator representation with unitary
representations of the orthogonal groups. The proposed research deals with the
invariant tensor products associated with elementary representations---
unitarizable subquotients of representations on the Shilov boundary. Due to the
work of Sahi and many others, elementary representations fall into four classes:
unitary principal series, complementary series, small constituents and large
constituents. The principal investigator will study the behavior of the four
types of invariant tensor functors associated to four classes of elementary
representations and relate these invariant tensor functors to the unitary
parabolic induction, complementary induction, Howe's correspondence and
cohomological induction, respectively. This unified approach should shed lights
on the structure of the unitary dual of the universal covering of the symplectic
group. Other classical groups will be treated as time allows.

A Lie group is a fundamental object used in mathematics to describe continuous
symmetries. The theory of Lie group representations provides a mathematical
foundation for quantum mechanics. The sympletic group, in particular, plays a
central role in mechanics, optics and other area of physics. Many important
problems in analysis, mathematical physics and number theory are closely related
to irreducible unitary representations of the symplectic groups. The proposed
research will improve the general understanding of the irreducible unitary
representations of the symplectic groups and other classical groups.
