9601499 Chowdhuri The Center for Electric Power at the Tennessee Technological
University (TTU) all purchase (i) three 750-MHz opto-electronic voltage probes,
and three optical transmission lines, including ancillary equipment and (ii) a
4-channel, 500-MHz digital oscilloscope with peripheral equipment. The equipment
will be used to measure very fast voltage transients for research on
electromagnetic transients in power systems . This equipment will be of
immediate benefit to two projects: 1. Breakdown Mechanisms of Air Gaps under
Lightning Voltages; and 2. Laboratory Simulation of Lightning Stroke Channel. In
addition, the proposed equipment could also be used in a third project, "Effects
of Transient Voltages on Power Semiconductor Devices". The ongoing projects at
the Center for Electric Power require simultaneous measurement of several very
fast transient phenomena. The proposed equipment will make it possible to
perform these measurements without electromagnetic interferences. An
understanding of the breakdown mechanisms of air gaps will result in reliable
and cost effective insulation coordination of the electric power systems. A
successful laboratory simulation of the lightning stroke channel will be a
powerful tool to verify theories on the response of power systems to lightning
strokes, thus minimizing the need for time consuming and uncertain field tests.
