ABSTRACT -- CTS-9408947 Chan A request has been made for funding to help offset
organizational costs of an International Symposium aimed at bringing together
active researchers from the transport phenomena and combustion communities in
order to exchange the state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in both fields and
to delineate the joint work towards the optimal design of low emission, high
efficiency energy systems. Participation especially from the Pacific Rim
countries will be strongly encouraged. There is a definite need to provide an
appropriate forum which can bring together both communities and this
International Symposium on Transport Phenomena in Combustion represents a good
start. The symposium will be held in San Francisco, CA on July 16-20, 1995.
Attendance is expected to be comprised of approximately 40% from the U. S., 40%
from the Pacific Rim countries and 20% from the rest of the world.
