Species are populations of interbreeding individuals that are reproductively
incompatible with other populations. Therefore, the genes that cause
reproductive incompatibility, so-called 'speciation genes', provide the genetic
basis of the origin of new species. The aim of this project is to map and
identify speciation genes involved in reproductive incompatibility between three
fruitfly species that diverged from one another ~250,000 years ago: Drosophila
simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana. The work focuses on mapping and
characterizing two incompatible speciation genes: a factor on the D. mauritiana
X chromosome, called hlx, kills hybrids when combined with an incompatible
autosomal factor from D. simulans and D. sechellia, called Suppressor of hlx.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification and molecular characterization of
speciation genes will answer long-standing questions about the genetic forces
involved in the early stages of species diversification. This project includes
training and participation of undergraduate students, as well as the continuing
participation of the investigators in public outreach in their local community.
