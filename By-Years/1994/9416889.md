9416889 Peterson This project proposes analysis of data from bottom pressure
gauges deployed across chokepoints for the Southern ocean flow. The deployment
of the instruments was funded under a previous grant. Bottom pressure gauges
were deployed between South Africa and the Antarctic coast close to the
Greenwich Meridian and at two locations spanning the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC) south of Tasmania. Simultaneously, the British deployed similar
instruments in the drake Passage. The main scientific goal of these deployments
was to determine the fluctuations in transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current, relate it to those in the subtropical and subpolar gyres and to the
wind field over the southern oceans.
