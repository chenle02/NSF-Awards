The primary goal of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the
influence of basal hydrology on glacier sliding and sediment transport. The
project will develop quantitative, predictive models for the hydrological
networks that underlie soft-bedded glaciers, and examine the implications for
glacier sliding and erosion, with a view to incorporation into larger scale
glacier and ice sheet simulations. The theoretical work will be complemented by
laboratory studies that will inform choices for model parameters, and enable
testing of key model predictions. In the laboratory, a 'Hele-Shaw cell' will be
used to conduct freezing, solidification and saturation experiments on till at
different temperatures and loads. The Broader Impacts include the involvement of
a graduate student and several undergraduate students, and the incorporation of
the research into 'Geomechanics' and 'Computational Earth Sciences' courses
taught by the PI.
