The PI proposes to carry out systematic investigations for obtaining precursors
to the enigmatic occurrence of the Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) using daytime
thermospheric optical emission measurements from the South American longitude
using high-resolution optical spectrographs built at Boston University. ESF
refers to the presence of irregularities in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere.
Unlike substorms and geomagnetic storms, ESF is a form of space weather not
controlled exclusively by the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). ESF
irregularities have a severe impact on radio communications and navigational
systems at a wide range of frequencies that adversely affect commercial and
defense applications. The development of these irregularities is highly
unpredictable. Even during the 'ESF' season when various onset parameters are
nearly identical, ESF occurs on one night and is completely absent on the other.
Scientifically, this is a missing element in our understanding of plasma
instabilities at low latitudes. Hence, it is very important to study and attempt
to predict ESF and its adverse effects.
