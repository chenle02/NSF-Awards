9354010 Smith Georgia State University (GSU) and the Georgia Institute of
Technology (GIT) will present an Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project in
chemistry in which the major activities of the proposed project are one-week
workshops, 3-day mini-courses, and annual reunions of the previous year's
participants. Workshop topics are: (1) Advanced Materials Chemistry, (2)
Chemistry of Nucleic Acids, (3) Environmental Chemistry, (4) Molecular Modeling,
(5) Molecular Orbital Theory, (6) Multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,
(7) Multimedia Techniques in Chemistry, and (8) Optimal Experimental Design and
Statistical Analysis. The mini-courses are: (1) Oxygen Chemistry, (2)
Organometallic Chemistry or Biocatalysis. Recruitment of participants is to be
on a national basis. The project is designed to improve the ability of faculty
at two- and four-year, public and private, institutions to develop and teach a
modern program in chemistry. ***
