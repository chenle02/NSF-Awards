The goal of the Seasonal Equatorial Atlantic Experiment (SEQUAL) was to explain
the response of the Equatorial Atlantic ocean to the forcing winds. A set of
models was developed and a very complete set of data (winds, currents,
temperature) was obtained in 1983-1984. The purpose of this proposal is to study
the propagation and growth of errors in a dynamical model of the Equatorial
Atlantic from initial conditions set by observations and subsequent data
assimilation olf new observations in space and time. This is an important task
for the TOGA program and fundatmental issue for model validation in general.
