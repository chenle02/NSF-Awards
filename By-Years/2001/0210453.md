It is proposed to conduct experimental research to investigate the relationship
between Brownian motion and shear induced migration in biomedical microdevices.
And to use the Brownian motion to characterize the temperature of the system. It
is also planned to develop an interdiscidplinary course with the co-PI who is a
faculty member of the English Department to help educate non-science students on
nanoscale technologies.
