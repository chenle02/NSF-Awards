IBN: 9634405 PI: Abarbanel The last ten years has seen a huge increase in the
number of computational studies aimed at understanding the brain. This is
largely the result of an enormous expansion of computer power as well as
promising new programs which are useful in studying neural-like phenomena such
as pattern recognition and memory formation. During this period there has also
been a parallel increase in our knowledge of small nervous systems at the
cellular and circuit level. Because the brain is so complex in terms of the
number of cells and connections between them, smaller invertebrate nervous
systems, which operate in exactly the same manner as larger ones, can serve as
models for understanding fundamental properties of information processing. There
are now many small circuits which have been completely described in terms of
synaptic connectivity. While such circuits can be modeled phenomenologically,
there is a lack of deep understanding of the fundamental principles by which
they operate. Our approach will be to look for such general principles in the
thirty celled stomatogastric nervous system of the lobster. We will use new
mathematical techniques which have been so successful in physics, to provide a
dynamical, nonlinear analysis of the rhythmic motor output patterns generated by
the ganglion. These methods have not yet been applied to studies of the nervous
system at the level of single identified neurons and small neural circuits. This
project is both special and timely because it has the ability to move back and
forth between theory and experiment at a level of resolution not possible in
other systems. Using this approach, we hope to provide a new and generalizable
description of how neural networks produce and process information so as to
achieve reliable, robust and adaptive behavior for the animal. We believe a
cross-disciplinary synergy such as we describe here, holds the key for future
developments in robotics and artificial intelligence as well as providin g basic
information about neural processing.
