This project aims to develop new algorithms that will help enable large-scale
eigenvalue-related modeling and simulations in many scientific and engineering
areas, including linear stability analysis of dynamical systems, mechanics of
materials, optimization of acoustic emissions, study of superconductivity,
vibrations under conditions of uncertainty, and many more. Certain methods are
also of significance to other areas; for example, a fast exponential matrix-
vector product is essential to the exponential integrator for solving stiff
time-dependent differential equations that are difficult to tackle by
traditional methods. New textbook writing and graduate student mentoring will
help cultivate qualified researchers and industrial professionals to generate
further impact in future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eigenvalues and closely related
mathematical tools (e.g., pseudospectra) are fundamentally descriptive in many
areas of applied mathematics and scientific computing. This project concerns
systematic development and analysis of innovative preconditioned solvers for
several important classes of large-scale and complex eigenvalue-related
problems. For large linear symmetric eigenproblems, variants of preconditioned
eigensolvers have been thoroughly investigated and widely used with great
success in many applications. The plan is to show that the preconditioning and
the solver framework can both be generalized significantly and integrated with
great flexibility to solve a much broader class of challenging eigenvalue-
related problems. The methods to be developed will be reliable, efficient and
flexible. The specific research topics include (i) preconditioning (spectral
filtering) with matrix functions, (ii) solving nonlinear eigenproblems, and
(iii) computing spectra and pseudospectra of large structured
matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
