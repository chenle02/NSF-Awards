This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop and
demonstrate flame-resistant, polymer-composite materials based on novel
benzoxazine resin chemistries. Recent work by Composite Technology Development,
Inc. (CTD) has shown that thermosetting polymer resins based on these materials
offer significantly improved flame and moisture resistance as compared to other
resins commonly used in composite manufacture (e.g., epoxy and cyanate-ester
chemistries). Despite these encouraging preliminary results, significant
impediments exist to the widespread application of benzoxazine resins. In
particular, most potential markets and customers are adverse to the introduction
of "non-heritage" material systems, due to lack of familiarity and potential
changes to processing and manufacturing techniques dictated by the new
materials. Hence, and in order to overcome this barrier to market entry, a more
fundamental understanding of the material design and synthesis is needed with
which to tailor commercially-viable versions. Therefore, the focus of this
project is to design and synthesize benzoxazine-based polymers with suitable
processing characteristics and mechanical performance for large-scale commercial
composite applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts/commercial
potential of this project is the develoment of viable, flame resistant
benzoxazine-based polymers with suitable processing characteristics and
mechanical performance (especially improvements in strength and toughness) for
large-scale commercial composite applications. Assuming the barriers to market
entry can be overcome, benzoxazines could revolutionize a variety of markets.
Most immediately, there is opportunity to dramatically improve the flame
resistance of composite materials in civilian and military aircraft, as well as
naval vessels. Similarly, there is great potential to improve the safety of
composite consumer goods (e.g., furniture, electronics, etc.), and products
being employed by homeland security, and law enforcement agencies.
