Modern microscopy techniques (phase contrast and epifluorescence microscopy)
will enhance laboratory training and research in microbiology. Laboratory
exercises will emphasize both techniques and application. Applications of phase
contrast include identification of morphologically distinct groups of
microorganisms in environmental samples, observations of microbial motility, and
direct counts of microorganisms. Applications of epifluorescence microscopy
include use of fluorescently labeled antibodies for identification and
quantification of specific groups of microorganisms, and direct counts of
microorganisms in environmental samples by acridene orange and fluorescein
diacetate staining. The microscopy equipment and training gained by students
will facilitate new experimentation in ongoing undergraduate research projects
involving soil microbiology, chemolithotropic bacteria, and biological ice
nucleation. The school will provide 50% matching funds.
