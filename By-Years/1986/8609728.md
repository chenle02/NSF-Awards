The purpose of the research program is to develop and test a new method for the
measurement of instantaneous reictional torque in reciprocating internal
combustion engines. The method will allow for the measurement of time-dependent
torque under transient conditions, as well as under constant speed conditions.
The method utilizes the instaneous gas pressure and the instaneous angular
velocity. The research will be extended to evaluate the method for single
cylinder gasoline engines, as well as diesel engines, under various operating
conditions. A mathematical model will be developed to relate theory and
experiments.
