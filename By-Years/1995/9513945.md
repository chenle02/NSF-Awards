9513945 Wu This is a two-year award proposed by Dr. Francis Wu, SUNY at
Binghamton and Professor Yih-Hsiung Yeh, Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia
Sinica in Taiwan. This proposal requests funds for travel to Taiwan and for
supporting one graduate student to analyze the data collected by the R/V Ewing.
The goal of this study is to understand mountain buildup in the Taiwan arc-
continent collision. The information collected both from the R/V Ewing and from
the Chinese Petroleum Company can provide useful insights regarding deep crustal
structures. This project also provides opportunities for a U.S. graduate student
to work with a unique set of data and to gain international research experience
at a top research institute in Taiwan. The project is jointly supported by the
Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.
