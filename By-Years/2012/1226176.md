This project proposes to make significant improvements to WeBWorK's NPL, and
build a community of faculty around the country to maintain and curate the
future role of the NPL (National Public Library), which is a collection of over
25,000 homework problems that are distributed with WeBWorK. WeBWorK, a web-based
homework system used by over 300 schools, is an open-source system, developed
and maintained by mathematicians. It is supported by the Mathematics Association
of America (MAA). Additional outcomes of the project are improving the
organization of NPL problems and developing software tools to facilitate easy
access to the NPL. Upon completion, mathematics instructors will be able to
search the library more easily for problems of the type they want. Both the NPL
and the accompanying software promote the improvement of teaching and enhance
the infrastructure for education in mathematics. Moreover, the project fosters
mathematics faculty development by making a new tool accessible for effective
mathematics teaching.
