Variational problems arise as a natural consequence of modeling the physical
world. Stretching an elastic membrane or bending a piece of metal can be
mathematically described as a minimization problem. Perhaps the simplest example
of this idea is the "spline." Originally, a spline was a drafting tool
consisting of a long, thin piece of wood that could be clamped to drafting table
at certain fixed points. Since the deformed wood naturally assumed a minimum
energy state, tracing its length produced a smooth curve. In the 1950's,
mathematicians redefined a spline as the mathematical solution to the following
problem: Find a smooth function F(t) such that the "bending energy" of F(t) is
minimized subject to the constraint that F(t) interpolates user-specified values
at the integers (the spline's knots). The space of functions that minimizes this
problem is the natural cubic splines. In the 1970's, Lane and Riesenfeld
discovered that cubic splines can also be expressed as the limit of a sequence
of functions, each related by a simple averaging rule. This averaging process,
known as subdivision, is an increasingly popular modeling technique in geometric
design. In recent work, the PI has shown that the solution process to a wide
range of variational problems can be expressed concisely as a subdivision
scheme. This project investigates application of this approach to three
important topics: - Subdivision rules for thin-plate splines - Fast numerical
solution of variational problems - Creation of splines with local knot insertion
