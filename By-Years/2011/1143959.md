The main objectives of this project are as follows (i) to improve the
understanding of natural variability and trends in tropical cyclone (TC)
activity since the beginning of the 20th century; (ii) to quantify projected
changes in the characteristics of tropical cyclones under a warming climate. The
multi-model dataset generated by the recently established U.S. Climate
Predictability and Variability program working group on hurricanes and climate,
will be analyzed. The common set of diagnostics will include cyclone tracks and
intensities, analysis of key tropical TC statistics, analysis of environmental
conditions associated with TC genesis and intensification in the models.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work aims at better understanding of the relationship
between TC in the present, as well as more robust and quantitative projects of
TC activity in the future, based on the analysis of a unique high-resolution
multi-model dataset. This data set will advance the understanding of the
relationship between climate and TC; in addition international and national
collaboration will be enhances as a result of interactions between several
modeling groups. It will promote training through mentoring of post-doctoral
scientists as well through outreach activities in the New York area.
