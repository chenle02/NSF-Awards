This is an exploration of a new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for
nanocrystalline metals and ceramic coatings based on the vapor-phase reaction
between elemental sodium and metal chlorides or other halogenated species. The
relationship between vapor-phase chemistry and the resulting thin films are
studied using ex-situ analysis of film properties and use of a CVD model,
developed as part of this effort, incorporating chemical kinetics, vapor flow,
transport, and nucleation. The effects, and possible control, of salt
supersaturations on film morphology are studied. The relationship between gas-
phase chemistry and film microstructure for processes involving simultaneous
deposition of a metal and ceramic to form a nanocrystalline/amorphous structure
is also studied; these products may have properties necessary for a superhard
coating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new approach studied in this project offers
the prospect of new industrial coatings with superior properties and/or a new
route to known coatings that is more sound environmentally than current
technology.&lt;br/&gt;
