Mathematicians from 25 cooperating liberal arts colleges in the Midwest will
plan to develop a one year main stream calculus course. These colleges are
members of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Associated Colleges of
the Midwest. Their curriculum will stress: basic concepts; numeric and graphic
experiments to better understand the power and limitations of technology; role
that calculus played in changing people's world view; art of writing a deductive
argument; applied mathematics as a creative modelling process. Outlines of
teaching resources to create a lean and lively one year calculus courses will
include: sequences of laboratory style problems; textbook type problems for
computers/calculators; application modules; open ended problems; and historical
vignettes.
