I/UCRC for Surveillance Research

The Center for Surveillance Research (CSR) will develop a mature theory and
advanced body-of-knowledge for modern surveillance systems. Ohio State
University (OSU) and Wright State University (WSU) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with OSU as the lead institution.

Surveillance and situational awareness are critical technologies needed to
address societal needs of safety and security. Surveillance is used to provide
our nation with both international and homeland security, and situational
awareness for disaster mitigation and management (e.g. Hurricane Katrina). The
main motivation behind the proposed center is to address the theory behind the
complex surveillance systems mostly based on sensors and sensor systems. The
proposed Center is expected to generate research that significantly advances
current surveillance theory and technology and to become a focal point within
the surveillance community.

The research advances in surveillance technology developed by CSR will be
transitioned to applications of significant societal and national interest. The
Center plans to develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific
community in surveillance theory, including short courses, cross departmental
and cross-university graduate course offerings, and internships with member
organizations. CSR will recruit underrepresented groups, and plans to leverage
existing programs such as the Ohio STEM Ability Alliance, the ADVANCE program at
OSU, and through collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors
Directorate's Minority Leaders Program.
