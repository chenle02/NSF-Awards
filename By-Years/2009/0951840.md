This is a proposal to provide travel support for the Midwest Topology Seminar, a
regional algebraic topology conference that has met approximately three times a
year for more than forty years. This conference series brings together
topologists from across the Midwest and from across the various subfields of
topology, providing a forum for new results and trends in the field. In the
lifetime of the seminar, algebraic topology has developed links with geometric
topology, algebraic geometry, number theory and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this grant is to provide travel
funding for graduate students and active researchers so that they may attend the
Midwest Topology Seminar. By inviting speakers from outside the region, and by
providing a forum for Midwestern researchers to speak about their new results as
soon as they occur, the Seminar allows regional topologists and geometers to
stay abreast of the latest work in the field. The frequency with which the
Seminar meets gives it an important role in both research and graduate
education, since it allows teaching and collaboration among researchers and
graduate students in the entire Midwest. It is open to everyone who wishes to
attend and to any Midwestern institution carrying out topological
research.&lt;br/&gt;
