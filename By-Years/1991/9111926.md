The object of this research project is to adapt a dynamic programming model of
retirement behavior developed by the author of this study and a computational
strategy developed by others to address a number of important questions
regarding the Social Security System. Among the questions to be addressed are:
(1) How will changes in the 1983 Social Security amendments affect retirement
behavior? How much will it affect the labor supply of older workers? (2) What
kinds of individuals will self select delayed retirement credit because of
increases in these credits? (3) Are the new rules fair in actuarial sense? What
will be the net impact on total Social Security outlays? (4) More generally,
what is the form of an efficient Social Security policy? These questions will be
addressed by estimating utility functions with a data set of male workers taken
from the Retirement History Survey. This research is important because it will
answer questions about the impact of changes in the Social Security System on
the viability of the system and on the benefits to recipient.
