9415889 Holbrow This project will solicit, prepare, and publish a new category
of physics problems for intermediate-level undergraduate physics courses. These
problems are to be derived from current or recent work of physicists and
engineers actively engaged in research. The purpose of these problems is to
exhibit new, interesting, or particularly insightful applications of
undergraduate physics to the phenomena or results of contemporary physics
research. The problems are being published in the American Journal of Physics in
a special section called "New Problems", and will be made available via
Internet. ***
