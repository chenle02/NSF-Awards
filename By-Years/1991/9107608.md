This proposal concerns the motion of an interface between two fluids of
different densities when the heavier fluid initially rests on the lighter fluid
(Rayleigh-Taylor flow). A combination of analytical and numerical techniques
will be employed to follow the motion of a highly convoluted interface for late
times when traditional numerical methods have difficulty because of resolution
problems. The method relies on actually following the motion of singularities in
the unphysical domain that on their approach to the physical domain correspond
to interfacial features such as spikes. By subtracting such singularities from a
basis representation in the physical domain, it is proposed to calculate a
continually distorting Rayleigh-Taylor interface numerically. Interest in the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability stems from its disruptive presence in inertial
confinement devices where attempt is made to confine a hot plasma through a
magnetic field and achieve controlled nuclear fusion for energy needs. Because
an accelerating field and a gravitational field are equivalent, the radial
acceleration of a plasma as it turns around makes it susceptible to this
instability. It is clear that for plasma confinement to succeed, one should be
able to control this instability. A first step is to understand the detailed
nature of a Rayleigh-Taylor flow. The method of attack is novel and is an
attempt to overcome the shortcomings of some other traditional numerical
methods.
