Intellectual Merit: In order to increase the number of disadvantaged students
from the Cumberland Valley Area Development District and surrounding counties,
the project is establishing math and science scholarships. Scholarships are
awarded to academically-talented but financially-challenged students recruited
from southeastern Kentucky, one of the nation's poorest and most educationally-
disenfranchised regions. Approximately 15 scholarships are being awarded over
the duration of the funding period. The program includes deliberate activities
and support structures to increase matriculation, retention, and graduation
rates by creating a collaborative learning community. Participants form cohesive
learning cohorts by: being assigned academic advisors and peer mentors; being
enrolled in designated sections of key courses; participating in field trips and
service-learning opportunities; participating in research and internship
opportunities; and being assisted in the career planning and placement process.
Program networks established with area high schools and managers in STEM-related
businesses function in future efforts to recruit, graduate, and place in
employment, area students after the expiration of the grant.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Seventy-three percent (73%) of students at
the college are first generation or come from low income families. The
scholarship program is serving these students primarily.
