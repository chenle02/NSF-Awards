Dr. Scalo's research follows both empirical and theoretical approaches to study
structural features in interstellar gas complexes and the relation of these
features to turbulence and the process of star formation. The empirical work is
directed toward a quantitative understanding of the existence and nature of the
hierarchical structure in cloud complexes. The theoretical work includes the
temporal behavior of star formation and numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic
cloud fluid equations to study the ability of star formation bursts to deplete
and expel gas from galaxies. Star formation is a phenomenon which involves the
coupling of processes over a large range of spatial scales, from individual
protostars to coherent star formation on scales of 200 to 1000 parsecs. The
interstellar gas complexes in which stars form exhibit substructure on all
scales from 100 parsecs down to less than 0.1 parsec, and the structure often
appears to be hierarchically arranged. This coupling between the local and
global aspects of star formation manifests itself in the fact that our
understanding of galaxy evolution depends crucially on the largely unknown
dependence of the star formation rate and initial mass function of forming stars
on both local and global physical conditions.
