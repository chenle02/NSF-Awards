This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study a novel
specular low magnetic field Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) composite thin film
material which uses a GMR sandwich film and two specular reflecting layers at
the outer boundaries. Currently, in layered GMR materials, high GMR ratio is
accompanied by a high required driving field. The proposed new GMR material will
have the relatively large resistance change of a multilayer GMR film and yet
will require low magnetic driving fields to effect the change, as in GMR spin
valve films. Candidate electron specular reflecting materials will be explored
to test their compatibility with sputtered GMR sandwich films. Annealing
techniques for achieving electron specular reflecting outer boundaries will be
explored. In Phase I, a prototype material will demonstrate the feasibility of
the concept. It will show at least a 20% change in resistance for an applied
field of 10 Oe or less
