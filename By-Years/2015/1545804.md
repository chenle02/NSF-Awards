Title: EAGER: Dynamic Characteristics of Electrically Pumped PT Symmetric Lasers

Abstract:

Non-Technical: Microlasers are critical components that play an ever increasing
role in science and technology. Their applications range from laser printers and
optical storage to optical communications and medical instruments. Stable, high
quality emission from microlasers is very important for almost all applications.
The work proposed in this project will provide for the first time full
comprehensive information on the characteristics of a newly proposed PT symmetry
lasers. The findings will provide valuable and detailed understanding for these
structures and identify any shortcomings compared to other single mode
microlasers.

Technical: The proposed research will provide a systematic evaluation of the
properties of PT symmetric lasers and provide a comprehensive characterization
of their static and dynamic properties. These studies are essential for painting
a full picture of the future research activities in this direction.
Particularly, the results of our studies can either transform the research
landscape in the field of microlasers by confirming the potential future of PT
lasing structures or identify the limitations of these new lasers over current
microlasers.The proposed research includes accurate numerical evaluation of the
combined supermodes modes of PT symmetric photonic molecules, nonlinear laser
rate equation to study the temporal dynamics of the laser emission as a function
of the design parameters and the pump current levels, and investigating effects
such as carrier diffusion, heating and filamentation.
