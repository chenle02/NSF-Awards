The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technologies capable of increasing the crop yield and growth
efficiency of certain high-value commodity crops. By capitalizing on the high
price of arable land and the inherent inefficiencies in producing certain
strains of crops at the genetic level, this technology enables farmers to
produce larger volumes of valuable foodstuffs by optimizing the quality of the
materials they plant. Markedly increasing the production efficiency of certain
crops, such as corn, avocados, and peanuts, increases the sellable volume of
these products, and their derivatives, including high value edible oils, edible
matter, and biomass for biofuel conversion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is based on the development of biological toolkits that enable
agriculturalists to selectively screen planting materials for qualities that are
most compatible with the environment in which they are grown. Crucial to this
technology is the development of accurate and fast-acting tools for the
identification of pertinent genetic features that dictate crop-environment
compatibility. Such features include drought resistance, diseases resistance,
pest-resilience, crop height, and future crop yield. Research into the roles
that individual and/or groups of genes play in the manifestation of these
macroscopic traits has enabled the development of plant-specific assays
identifying those qualities most relevant for the productive cultivation of
crops and produce. Efficacy testing has proven promising in the lab and plans to
expand to larger field trials are on the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
