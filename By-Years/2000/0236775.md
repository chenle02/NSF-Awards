In many of the world most exceptional fossil deposits, extraction of fossils
from the matrix is difficult, and fossils are often so small that serial
sectioning is uniformative. Nowhere is this more true than in the
Neoproterozoic, where much of the fossil record is soft-bodied, microscopic,
preserved in 3D, and/or entombed in a manner inimical to mechanical or chemical
extraction techniques. Microfocus X-ray computed tomography (microCT) enables
nondestructive visualization of the three-dimensional internal structure of
geological and biological samples, and offers a new manner in which to examine
such fossils. This grant will support purchase of a 100 kV Skyscan 1072 microCT
instrument, allowing visualization and creation of models of structures as small
as 500nm. This instrument will contribute substantially to undergraduate and
faculty research at Amherst College, as well as at other five-College Consortium
institutions. ***
