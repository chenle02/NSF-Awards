9451211 Erdmann This project exposes undergraduates to the fundamentals of
manipulation robotics. We will build a teaching laboratory for undergraduates
interested in robotics. The laboratory will be at an intermediate stage of
advancement situated between the basics taught in an undergraduate robotics
course and the advanced topics taught in first year graduate courses. The
laboratory will provide hands-on experience for undergraduates. Our goal is to
strengthen the manufacturing base by educating students in the fundamentals of
industrial manipulation and by exposing them to the practical research results
of the last two decades. We envision that the laboratory will contain a series
of robots, geometric modeling systems, and small-scale factory work cells. The
robots will be Zebra Zero force-controlled robots, controlled from workstations
running planning and geometric modeling systems. Each robot will be given a
camera and frame grabber for use in hand-eye tasks. Undergraduates will be
expected to enroll in this laboratory course for academic credit. The curriculum
will consist of a structured sequence of robot manipulation tasks, ranging from
parts orienting, to parts assembly, to the planning and execution of cooperative
robot strategies among several robots.
