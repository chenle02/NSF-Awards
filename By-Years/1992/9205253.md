We have developed an assay that permits the in vivo monitoring of steroid
receptor protein nuclear export. In this assay co-cultured heterologous cells
are fused using polyethylene glycol to generate multi-nucleated heterokaryon
with shared cytoplasm. Since only one of the two cell types used to generate a
heterokaryon will contain receptor protein within its nucleus (i.e. the donor
cell), any receptor detected within the heterologous nucleus of the original
receptor cell type (i.e. recipient cell) must derive from protein that exported
from the donor cell nucleus. This assay will be used to determine whether the
glucocorticoid, progesterone, and thyroid hormone receptors possess the capacity
to export in isolation when fused to heterologous proteins that do not normally
have this capacity. We anticipate that this system of analysis will provide
novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate bi-directional movement of
proteins across the nuclear envelope.
