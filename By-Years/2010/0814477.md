The rhizosphere is the critical interface for initiating both beneficial and
harmful interactions between plants and microbes and it has become apparent that
plants use root exudates to manipulate these interactions. This project will
investigate root-secreted signals that serve as specific chemoattractants for
Bacillus subtilis in the rhizosphere. The genus Bacillus has great potential use
in agriculture, as its members are able to synthesize antimicrobial metabolites
to ward off plant pathogens. While plant-associated bacterial chemical signals
have been identified as activators of plant defences, plant metabolites that
elicit rhizobacterial responses have yet to be characterized. The biochemical
and genetic links identified and techniques developed in the course of this
project should uncover new aspects of rhizosphere interactions and form a
foundation for the further development of our understanding of both symbiotic
and non-symbiotic plant-microbe associations. An outreach component will enrich
the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) initiative in the
Christina School District. A collaboration with science facilitators at Glasgow
High School to strengthen the ecology components in the K-12 Delaware statewide
recommended curricula, by creating an interactive environment between the
classroom and the laboratory for K-12 students and science teachers.
