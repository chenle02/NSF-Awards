This research is to examine free-choice leisure behavior of African Americans
as it relates to the utilization of science museums. Hard statistics for African
American museum visitors are not available; but preliminary data based on
visitor profile studies undertaken by individual organizations suggest that of
the three categories of visitor frequency, most African American visitors fall
into the lower two: infrequent (one or two times per year) or not at all. (The
vast majority of frequent visitors are non African Americans.) The purpose of
this research is to dig deeper into the question of the utilization of science
museums by African Americans. Not only will the relationships between variables
identified in previous studies (socio-economic, cultural/ethnic, institutional,
and regional factors) be examined but others such as how individuals learn about
museum programs and the structure of the African American family (household)
will also be included. The research will begin by collecting base line visitor
profiles at a zoo, aquarium, natural history museum, and a science center.
Detailed information relating to the past history of museum-going will be
collected by means of interviews of randomly selected African American and White
family visitors at several science museums. Finally, indepth interviews
regarding leisure time activities and preferences will be conducted in six
African American and racially mixed communities representing different socio-
economic levels. The ultimate goal is to analyse the attitudes of African
Americans toward museums and to provide an understanding of the variables
involved that will be of use to museum program planners and educators as they
design their activities. The desired result is for this segment of our society
to have a better opportunity to benefit from the rich resources of these
informal science education institutions.
