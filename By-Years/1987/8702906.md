The first problem this research will consider is that of limit theorems for
empirical processes. Considerable progress has been made in recent years towards
solving the problem of necessary and sufficient conditions on probability
measures and classes of functions for which the corresponding empirical process
satisfies the central limit theorem. Some of these advances were made by the
investigator himself. He will continue to look for the final solution of the
problem. The second problem concerns the law of iterated logarithms for Banach
space valued random variables. A set of three conditions is found to be both
necessary and sufficient but one of these conditions amounts to proving a weaker
version of the original problem. The investigator will attack this reduced
problem. The third and smaller part of the research will deal with percolation
theory. Among the topics to be considered will be continuity of the percolation
probability, bounds on critical exponents and finiteness of the expected size of
cluster containing zero.
