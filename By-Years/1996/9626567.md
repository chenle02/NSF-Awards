Bramble 9626567 The main objectives of this project are the construction and
study of finite element approximations to steady-state and transient problems of
mechanics and engineering, including convection-diffusion-reaction problems,
Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, equations of linear elasticity, plate
bending problems, and the construction, analysis, and testing of fast methods
for solving the resulting algebraic systems. The emphasis is on the development
of new accurate, robust and efficient computational techniques. Approximation
strategies involving standard Galerkin finite element methods, novel least-
squares methods, and mixed finite element methods are studied especially from
the standpoint of their accuracy and stability. The solution techniques that are
developed emphasize preconditioning via domain decomposition or
multigrid/multilevel methods. The broad objective of this program is to use the
full power of rigorous mathematics both to analyze the behavior of numerical
methods currently used in scientific computation and to develop new algorithms
exhibiting improved accuracy, stability and performance. More efficient and
scalable algorithms can have a significant impact on the development of
effective simulators for understanding physical processes of national
importance. For example, computer modeling of ground water processes involve the
solution of large complex systems of nonlinear partial differential equations.
The results of these simulations provide important predictive information that
can influence decisions with regard to ground water remediation strategies and
national conservation programs. Due to the complexity in the geometry and the
physical processes, meaningful simulations overwhelm today's most powerful
parallel computers and hence the need for more effective numerical techniques.
The techniques developed are applicable as well to problems such as simulation
of smart materials, heat and mass transfer, and high performance computing.
