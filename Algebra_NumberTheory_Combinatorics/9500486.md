This award supports research on enveloping algebras, differential operators and
quantum groups. The principal investigator will study primitive ideals in the
enveloping algebra of a classical Lie superalgebra. He will also study links in
multiparameter quantum function algebras and the coradical filtration for the
corresponding enveloping algebras. The goal is to understand the structure of
certain Hopf algebras arising in the theory of quantum groups. Finally, the
principal investigator will study the K-theory of differential operators of
toric varieties. This research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is
an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it.
Although the additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the
multiplicative operation is not required to do so. An example of a ring for
which multiplication in not commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over
the integers. The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of
algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of mathematics
and physics.
