EAR-0447305&lt;br/&gt;Baldwin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide two
years of support from NSF Instrumentation and Facilities to share the costs of a
technician's position in the Syracuse University Noble Gas Isotope Research
Laboratory (SUNGIRL). The position will be cost shared with contributions from
Syracuse University. SUNGIRL consists of 1) a Micromass 5400 noble gas mass
spectrometer and automated extraction line used for 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology,
and 2) a quadrupole mass spectrometer and automated extraction line used for He
analysis in conjunction with (U-Th)/He dating of apatite. Each extraction line
utilizes a double-vacuum resistance furnace and a CO2 laser system for
outgassing minerals and rocks. An excimer laser system is under construction for
use with the 5400 noble gas mass spectrometer. Once fully commissioned it will
expand SUNGIRL's analytical capabilities to include in situ 40Ar/39Ar analysis
of minerals in thick sections. Under the general direction of the PIs, the
technician is responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of the
laboratory including maintenance of equipment, design modifications, and
development of noble gas mass spectrometric
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
