This is a research planning grant for women. During the duration of the research
planning grant, several activities will be completed in preparation for
submitting a regular proposal to NSF. Improving the throughput of hardware which
requires high communication bandwidth, and to identify the focus of future
research. A senior consultant will provide guidance throughout the planning
period. A detailed plan for performing future research in this area will be
developed. This plan, with the background resulting from the other planning
activities, will form the core of a proposal to be submitted to NSF.
