This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to James Madison University will integrate instruction in sustainability
into design courses across three years of the undergraduate engineering
curriculum. The project will develop methods for evaluating sustainability
projects to better measure students' design competencies, cognitive processes
and life long learning skills. The goal is to provide hands-on learning
experiences that develop students' abilities to deal with sustainability,
including the environmental, social, economic and technical contexts of the
problems to be solved. The overall goal is to better prepare students for the
practice of engineering through developing their understanding of environmental
sustainability. These techniques are expected to increase students' interest in
engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are
ready to fill engineering jobs.
