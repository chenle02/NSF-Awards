A 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and computer system will be acquired for use in
structural biology. New software will be developed for analyzing NMR data and
utilizing that data to determine the structure of proteins in solution.
Additional studies concern the relationship between the linear or primary
sequence of proteins and the secondary and tertiary fording of proteins in three
dimensional space. NMR data will be used to evaluate schemes for understanding
the potential conformations of identical sequences of amino acids contained in
different larger amino acid sequences. The structure and dynamics of short DNA
oligomeric chains and of small molecules that interact with DNA and protein will
also be studied. The information derived from the NMR experiments will be used
in conjunction with distance geometry calculations, energy refinement
calculations and computer graphics to generate molecular structures in solution
in greater detail than is presently known. The information will be compared to
our knowledge of the static structure of proteins and DNA known from X-ray
diffraction data, and will lead to a better understanding of the relationship
between architecture and the functional role of these macromolecules.
