This project develops a new strategy for scene interpretation, especially for
annotating cluttered scenes with instances from many object categories (e.g., a
kitchen scene) and videos of people interacting with objects in everyday life
(e.g., cooking). The research team develops a statistical model for scene
interpretations and image measurements. One component of the model is a prior
distribution on a huge interpretation vector. Each bit of this vector represents
a high-level scene attribute with widely varying degrees of specificity and
resolution ? some are very coarse (general hypotheses) and some are very fine
(specific hypotheses). The other component is a simple conditional data model
for a corresponding family of learned binary classifiers, one per bit. The scene
interpretation is then computed by assessing hypotheses in a highly coarse-to-
fine manner, using an image parsing algorithm called ?entropy pursuit? based on
stepwise uncertainty reduction, and classifiers for detecting events in
spatiotemporal volumes which leverage on recent advances at the intersection of
machine learning and dynamical systems. The computational models and scene
parsing algorithms developed in this project are broadly applicable to scene
interpretation problems arising in many areas of science and engineering.
Specific applications include home surveillance and security, assisted home
living, infant and elderly care, etc. The project also provides research
opportunities for graduate students in underrepresented minorities and even high
school students.
