Cost-effectiveness analysis can illustrate society's best opportunities for
optimizing health benefits in the face of limited resources. But while recent
years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the performance and publication of
cost-effectiveness analyses, the methods used have varied widely, raising
questions about the usefulness of the information to policy makers. The primary
objectives of the research are to investigate variations in methods used to
estimate the cost-effectiveness of a broad range of interventions, and to
compare the cost-effectiveness of the interventions, after standardizing the
ratios. The research calls for: 1) the development of a comprehensive database
of lifesaving interventions that have used costs per quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs) to measure health benefits; 2) comparisons of the methods used to
estimate cost-effectiveness across studies; 3) comparisons of unadjusted and
adjusted, standardized ratios; 4) the construction of a league table of
cost/QALY ratios that adhere to the recommendations of the U.S. Panel on Cost-
Effectiveness in Health and Medicine; and 5) analyses investigating the impact
of using different methods in estimating costs and quality-adjusted survival.
The findings should help public and private policy makers better understand the
relative benefits of diverse interventions and aid in resource allocation
decisions. It should also help move the field toward consistency in estimation
techniques. Given the well-documented lack of standards in the field, and the
need for a common metric for purposes of comparison, the research should prove
important to future policy makers in a wide range of disciplines.
