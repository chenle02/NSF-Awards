Dr. Batterman is investigating the connections between classical and quantum
mechanics,in light of the fact that classical systems appear to allow generic
chaotic behavior while quantum systems do not. One question he is asking is that
of a definition of chaos for quantum systems. While there is at least some
consensus on how to define chaos in classical physics,the question of a
definition for chaos in quantum mechanics is completely open. One approach to a
quantum definition for chaos is to adopt an algorithmic complexity definition.
The virtue of this view is that it seems to be "theory neutral." On this
definition, quantum mechanics is completely inhospitable to chaos. Dr. Batterman
argues that this definition is to be resisted, since to a certain degree it
divorces the issue of chaos from the dynamics. Instead, Dr. Batterman argues
that a proper understanding of the correspondence principle resolves the problem
of defining quantum chaos. The correspondence principle, when properly
interpreted already supplies a unified account of chaos--for both classical and
quantum mechanics. Dr. Batterman argues that the interpretation of the
correspondence principle which he advocates has historical support which can be
found in Niels Bohr's early writing on the quantum theory.
