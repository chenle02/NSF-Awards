This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is a
series of investigations of the detailed mechanisms of redox reactions that
occur at electrode surfaces. These studies will include a detailed analysis of
multielectron transfer reactions, a study of the derivatives of the fullerenes,
and an inquiry into the nucleation processes involved in electrochemical
polymerization reactions. The latter study will involve the use of atomic force
microscopy to detect and characterize the particles formed in the early stages
of the electrodeposition of organic compounds. The results of the research will
have direct applications in such technologically significant areas as
electrosynthesis, electropolymerization, and homogeneous redox catalysis. This
research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
increase our understanding of the fundamental aspects of the oxidation and
reduction reactions of organic compounds at electrode surfaces. Novel features
of the research include the use of atomic force microscopy to image the surface
of the electrode during the electrodeposition of organic compounds, a study of
the electrochemistry of the recently discovered fullerenes, as well as the
investigation of electrode processes involving multiple electron transfer
reactions. The results of the research will have direct applications in such
technologically significant areas as electrosynthesis, electropolymerization,
and homogeneous redox catalysis.
