This research is to determine the kinematics of relative motion within
deforming Central and East Asia using a new method. By fitting a polynomial
function to observed, average blocks of strain rate, the analysis can determine
both relative velocities and rotations within specified reference frames. Strain
rates are determined from a moment tensor summation of large earthquakes in this
century, and from Quaternary slip rates on major faults. This method allows
scientists to directly relate the often complicated styles of faulting over
broad regions of continental deformation to the relative motion of the plates.
Importantly, it also allows the investigation of the role the faults are playing
in accommodating that relative motion. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
