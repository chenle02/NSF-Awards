The project examines the feasibility of performing multichannel seismic
profiling along navigable inland waterways. The seismic survey line is along the
Hudson River and the waterway on the north side of Long Island, New York. The
project is an important test of the MCS methodology in this unique environment;
development of target specific profiling techniques will be necessary if the
concept is to be applied elsewhere. The profile will cross structurally the
Appalachian transition zone, and could provide improved understanding of
Paleozoic and Mesozoic structure.
