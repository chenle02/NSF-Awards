Dr. Scott will employ 1) correlative scanning-transmission electron microscopy;
2) immunocytochemistry; and, 3) microangiography to address three basic
questions that deal with the underlying mechanisms of cellular interactions that
occur between normal neuropeptide-producing fetal hypothalamic transplants and
adult host rats of the Brattleboro strain with homozygous autosomal diabetes
insipidus. The brains of host rats with viable indwelling fetal neurografts will
be examined to determine the neuroanatomical patterns of neuronal and
neurovascular integration that develop between the fetal hypothalamic
transplants and surrounding host tissue and will confront the three following
basic questions: 1) What are the underlying mechanisms of formation of vascular
patterns and neurovascular interrelationships that develop between the host
brain and the graft which serve to maintain the viability of extrinsic fetal
neurografts? 2) What are the ultrastructural correlates underlying the
mechanisms of synptogenesis and neuronal plasticity between the transplant and
the host? 3) What are the fine structural correlates and major neuroanatomical
routes for the delivery of centrally acting peptides? Data garnered from such
experiments designs depicted below can serve as a model to establish a set of
fine structural correlates that may apply to future neural transplantation.
