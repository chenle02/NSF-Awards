Cooper Union for the Advance of Science and Art will initiate a six-week,
commuter, Young Scholars project in engineering for 180 students entering the
11th and 12th grades. This summer program will emphasize the study of urban
engineering problems. A creative integration of classroom demonstrations, video
instruction, lectures, field trips, and team-based, "hands-on" laboratory
exploration of problems with Cooper Union faculty and advanced engineering
undergraduates, will challenge high ability and high potential students to
maintain a competitive edge in science learning, a process sustained by after-
school follow-up science enhancement activities in the academic year.
