Gas-liquid drop interactions are usually not viewed as surface chemical
reactions but considered as a sequence of mass transport processes followed by
aqueous-phase homogeneous reactions. The mechanisms and rate equations used to
describe the aqueous reactions are those obtained from bulk solution
measurements that are assumed to assumed to be directly applicable to dispersed
systems such as clouds and fogs. This project addresses the question of bulk vs.
dispersed state chemistry in aqueous reactions of nitrogen dioxide in laboratory
clouds. Its objective is to evaluate experimentally two working hypotheses
formulated to explain our previous results, which are inconsistent with the
conventional picture of nitrogen dioxide chemistry. Our main findings are: (1)
Nitrate forms rapidly when nitrogen dioxide reacts with a laboratory cloud. (2)
The nitrate concentrations associated with subsaturated sodium chloride aerosol
and especially with cloud drops substantially exceeds the maximum level expected
from scavenging the nitric acid impurity present in the nitrogen dioxide supply,
i.e. there is a net production of aerosol or cloud water nitrate. (3) The
composition of cloud drops exposed to nitrogen dioxide is radically different
from bulk water exposed to nitrogen dioxide from the same source. The first of
our two hypotheses is that the observed vs. bulk differences are due to an
intrinsic, possibly surface chemical, property of high surface-to-volume aqueous
systems. The second is that the uptake of nitrogen dioxide and its conversion to
nitrate ion in a dispersed aqueous system is strongly enhanced by trace amounts
of nitric acid adsorbed on subsaturated aerosols, cloud drops, or aerosol
particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei.
