This project will support collaborative research by American and European
researchers on the foundations of object-oriented programming languages by
providing funding for a joint NSF/ESPRIT workshop to be held in Williamstown,
Massachusetts, USA, in the summer of 1993. Topics to be covered in the workshop
include the design, semantics, type systems, and verification of object-oriented
programming languages.
