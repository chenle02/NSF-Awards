This mathematics research project is in the general area of partial differential
equations. The focus is on the study of the regularity properties of elliptic
and parabolic partial differential equations, and their connections with the
well posedness of such problems; parts of the project concern non local
diffusions. The partial differential equations investigated in this project
arise from stochastic models dealing with discontinuous processes. A number of
models from finance, physics, population dynamics, chemistry and biology involve
non local diffusions. Another related direction of research concerns the
interaction between local or non local diffusion with advection. There are a
number of advection-diffusion models from physics that are not currently well
understood mathematically. Typical examples of such phenomena arise in the study
of equations that model fluids dynamics. The principal investigator Luis
Silvestre will study estimates for advection-diffusion equations geared towards
an improved understanding of the active scalar equations arising from models in
fluid dynamics. Silvestre will also investigate a number of questions related to
fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations that occur in the study
of zero-sum stochastic games.

This mathematics research projects studies the behavior of so-called non-local
equations. Such equations arise in any physical model with long range
interactions. They also arise naturally as the equations governing any
probabilistic model whose values may take long jumps. A common example is the
modeling of stock prices in financial mathematics, which could sporadically take
sudden changes. Non local equations appear in myriad of models from physics,
finance, social sciences and biology. Their applications may range from the
valuation of financial options, to the effective computation of protein docking,
which is useful in the design of medicinal drugs, and even in the modeling of
the flight of birds. The development of a general theory of non local partial
differential equations has seen great progress in recent years, which goes side
to side with an increasing number of applications. The equations describing the
dynamics of fluids present very difficult mathematical questions. Luis Silvestre
(the principal investigator in this project) will also study certain diffusion
equations, local and non local, in moving fluids. For the educational part of
this proposal, Silvestre will organize summer schools, design an improved
partial differential equations class for undergraduates, as well as teaching a
graduate class; Silvestre will also organize conferences, and will mentor
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
