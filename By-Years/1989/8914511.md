This award will support the participation of a group of US mathematicians to
attend a joint US-French seminar on the topic of representation theory and
harmonic analysis of p-adics group, to be held in Marseilles, France in June
1990. The US organizer is Dr. Phillip Kutzko, University of Iowa. The French
organizer is Professor Guy Henniart, University of Paris XI. The representation
theory and harmonic analysis of reductive p- adic groups has gained great
significance over the past two decades, both because of its intrinsic interest
to non-abelian harmonic analysts and because of its relationship to number
theory and the study of automorphic forms through what has become to be known as
the Langlands program. Work in this area has been marked in particular by close
collaboration between US and French mathematicians. The proposed seminar will
bring together leading US and French specialists and will focus on the following
topics: 1) the admissable dual 2) Howe duality 3) local harmonic analysis with
applications to the trace formula and 4) local factors. This seminar will
provide a timely opportunity to review recent developments in this area and to
further future cooperative research.
