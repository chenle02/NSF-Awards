9521265 Krause This project is based on recent work by the PIs showing that
electric fields can be used to produce phase-separated polymer alloys with
unique morphologies. Film casting in electric fields has allowed the production
of samples containing spherical and ellipsoidal minor phases that form "pearl
chains" in the electric field direction, unique morphologies in mixtures of
block copolymers with homopolymers, and oriented threads of semicrystalline
minor phases. The PIs will now study: deformations of ionic block copolymer
materials (electromechanical materials); theoretical treatments that include the
effects of small ion migration between the coexisting phases and the time
dependence of phase distortion with associated breakup in an electric field;
observation of phase distortions obtained when a solution of a polymer in the
monomer of another polymer is allowed to polymerize in an electric field;
elongated solid particles in solution as a function of frequency in an AC field
in an attempt to observe abrupt changes in orientation; the anisotropy of
dielectric constant in some anisotropic blends. %%% These studies should result
in fundamental knowledge concerning the interaction of heterogeneous systems
with an electric field, both DC and AC, and in some potentially useful materials
which utilize heterogeneous polymeric materials and electric fields. ***
