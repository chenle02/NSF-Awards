The post-doctoral fellow supported by this award will work on the general
problem of assessing the impact of data collected in the upper ocean to climate
model predictions The efficacy of assimilating upper ocean velocity data as part
of an Ocean Analysis System (OAS) and their impact on coupled model based
predictions of seasonal to interannual climate variabilitywill be investigated
This work will provide the needed guidance and justification for transferring
the TOGA observing system in the Pacific from a research to an operational mode.
