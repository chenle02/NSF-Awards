This proposal is to provide support for the annual Mid-Atlantic Regional
Developmental Biology Conference to be held at Thomas Jefferson University,
Philadelphia, on April 17-19, 1988. The topic of the meeting is "100 Years of
Experimental Embryology: Modern Approaches to Classical Questions". The meeting
will consist of full-length presentations by invited speakers, as well as freely
contributed platform and poster presentations. Contributed papers and posters
will be solicited especially from postdoctoral and graduate students. Adequate
time will be available for junior and senior investigators to meet informally
and discuss each other's work. The meeting's main objective is to provide a
forum for scientific interchange between scientists and students in the middle
Atlantic states whose research interests are in the field of developmental
biology.
