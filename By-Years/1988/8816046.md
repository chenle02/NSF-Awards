The Division of Research Initiation and Improvement is responsible for
monitoring and recommending policies affecting the participation of
underrepresented groups in science and engineering. The Planning Conference on
Research as a Tool for Increasing the Participation of Minority Women in Science
and Engineering was held in Atlanta on March 25-26, 1987. It was the first
conference to examine in depth the special problems faced by minority women
scientists and engineers and the meeting provided guidance for the Foundation in
its efforts to increase the number of minority women who apply to its programs.
Putting together the proceedings of this meeting and publishing them is an
important means of communicating information gained to minority women scientists
and engineers.
