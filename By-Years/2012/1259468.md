Core science departments at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), including
Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics, are partnering to
implement a spectrum of programs to increase the quantity, quality, and
diversity of students earning degrees in the life, physical, and mathematical
sciences, and who pursue further education and careers in these fields. The
program emphasizes a strong peer support system for students through a community
of STEM scholars, emphasizing collaboration and teamwork; engages faculty, with
project goals tied to departmental goals; provides a multidisciplinary
experience for students, including connections to faculty and students in other
STEM disciplines and to professionals outside of academia; engages multiple
service units of the university to mentor students at appropriate stages in
their learning; assists departments to develop research-based pedagogies that
enhance retention; and partners with high-tech employers in the Bloomington area
to provide internships. A key component of the program is an estimated 120
scholarships provided to participating students. Both formative and summative
evaluations of the impact and effectiveness of the program guide program
implementation to meet the program's goals to retain and graduate STEM majors.
Lessons learned from this program are being shared with other IUB programs and
through presentation at national and disciplinary meetings. By retaining college
STEM majors and by increasing the pool of students who choose to start in a STEM
major, this project is contributing to the numbers, diversity, and preparedness
of the nation's science workforce.
