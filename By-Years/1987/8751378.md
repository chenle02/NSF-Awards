Scientist and technical professionals of the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia and science educators from West
Virginia University in Morgantown are jointly proposing a Secondary Science
Teachers' Institute for 150 selected high school teachers. The summer institute
(a two week session the first year and two three weeks in subsequent years) will
include lectures in basic astronomy and demonstrations to give teachers
resources they can use in their classrooms, including the use of an instrumented
40-foot telescope where participants can make observations of their own. Over
the three years of the project the system will be automated to the extent that
electronic communication between the classroom and the telescope will permit
observations to be made from the classroom. The overall goal of the project is
to bring classroom teachers into direct contact with research scientists in
order to foster a greater appreciation as to how science is conducted and
glimpse the acquisition of knowledge at its boundary with the unknown.
