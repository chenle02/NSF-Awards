With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Ziegler
is developing and using novel Raman spectroscopic techniques to investigate the
dynamics of photodissociation processes in small polyatomic molecules at a
resolution sufficient to examine individual rotational- vibrational levels.
Previously developed rotational resonance Raman techniques are being used to
measure rovibrational quantum specific lifetimes of short-lived (20 femtoseconds
to 5 picoseconds) quasi-bound excited state levels. Resonance hyper-Raman is
extending the work to dissociative molecular excited states in the vuv
accessible via two-photon processes with near-uv photons. Planned work also
includes the use of resonant Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) to
achieve greater rotational quantum resolution and allow the study of larger
molecules. %%% In order to control and predict the course of chemical reactions,
one must understand the dynamics of reactions on a molecular level as a function
of both space and time. This experimental and theoretical study will focus on
expanding our detailed understanding of the process of photodissociation, that
is, the breaking apart of a molecule after the absorption of light. In this work
the photodissociation process will be examined in several cases for the
dependence of the outcome on the initial energy state of the absorbing species.
