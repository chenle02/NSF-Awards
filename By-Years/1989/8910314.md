ABSTRACT This grant will support planning and preparation for a two- year study
on Persian and English second language acquisition. The empirically based study
will examine headedness effects in two complementary situations: the learning of
English by native speakers of Persian, and the learning of Persian by native
English speakers. The approach will be based on Government-and- Binding Theory,
because it seems the most promising and active direction in recent work. The
focus is on the headedness parameter, because its value differs in Persian and
English, because the parameter is itself complex, bearing relation to other
issues, and because it has received significant attention in recent research.
The research problem is an interesting and timely one, exploring the
implications of a highly topical issue in linguis- tic theory in the realm of
second language acquisition. The theoretical issue is the consistency of
"headedness" of phrases: in most languages, if verbs precede their objects, then
preposi- tions will precede their objects, or conversely both will follow. Some
languages are exceptions to this pattern, however, and Persian is an especially
notable example. The exceptions raise the problem of devising a coherent
theoretical account which fits all cases. A theory of parametric variation of
languages seems promising. The theory has certain theoretical implications for
second language acquisition by adults across the theoretical barrier between the
regular and the exceptional languages. The project being planned will test these
implications. The planning grant will enable fuller development of the
theoretical framework and the hypotheses to be tested, and establishing the
logistical arrangements for the rather complex testing (based in university
classrooms) which will be required.
