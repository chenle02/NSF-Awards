9553330 Bartlett This proposal is to build a global patchwork of students to be
involved in compiling data for use in monitoring global land cover and use
patterns in "Earth Day: Forest Watch". This activity is part of the GLOBE
(Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) Program, a
developing international program, housed in an office in the White House. Goals
of GLOBE are to link scientists and school children in a global information
network, with the shared goal of better understanding the Earth's environment
and changes that take place within. The New Hampshire team will develop teacher
enhancement materials, provide training to teachers and other instructors, and
develop data integration and program assessment materials following the initial
April, 1995 sampling activities. Data collected by students and evaluated by
scientists will be part of a study of the health of the white pine trees, a
known bioindicator for tropospheric ozone damage. This data will be linked to
the international effort of the GLOBE Program.
