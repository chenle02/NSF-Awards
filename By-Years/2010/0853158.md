This award provides partial support for the ?Workshop on Fe-Pnictide and Related
Superconductors.? The recent discovery in Japan of high-temperature
superconductivity in the iron pnictide materials (compounds of iron plus
arsenic, nitrogen, phosphorus, antimony, or bismuth) has led to a dramatic surge
of worldwide research on these novel superconducting materials; the first new
class of transition metal based high-Tc superconductors since the discovery of
the copper oxide (cuprate) superconductors in 1987. The fact that they contain
iron as the active electronic element is a great surprise to most
superconductivity experts, since the magnetism of iron has traditionally been
thought to be the complete antithesis of superconductivity. The work on these
new materials is proceeding at an almost unprecedented pace. This workshop will
allow U.S. researchers to rapidly and efficiently get up to speed on these new
and technologically significant materials. Graduate and undergraduate students
will be strongly encouraged to attend. A tutorial session will be held just
before the conference begins, geared towards educating young scientists in this
new field. The NSF funds will be used predominantly to support a diverse group
of U.S. students, postdocs and junior faculty who would not otherwise be able to
attend the workshop.
