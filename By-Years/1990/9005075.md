The PIs will investigate the relationships between Late Paleozoic
remagnetization deformation, and diagenesis, by studying the rock magnetic
properties and deformation microstructures in Paleozoic carbonates from a number
of localities in eastern North America. The principal goals will be to: 1) more
completely characterize the magnetic mineralogy and remanence carriers in
remagnetized carbonate strata; 2) investigate possible quantitative correlations
between diagenetic illite and diagenetic/authigenic magnetite content; 3)
compare the orientations and magnitudes of magnetic and calcite twinning strain
fabrics; and 4) evaluate the connections between Late Paleozoic fluid migration,
calcite twinning, and magnetite authigenesis, and the evolution of the
Appalachian-Ouachita fold- and-thrust belt.
