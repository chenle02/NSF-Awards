With this new award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Margarita
Ortiz of University of Puerto Rico at Humacao in a project investigating the
development of new borate based catalysts for the selective preparation of a
variety of important chemical substances. Existing catalysts used for these
purposes are often expensive, difficult to purify, highly sensitive to air and
moisture, and harmful to the environment. This project will design and prepare
catalysts that are readily and inexpensively available, easy to handle and
environmentally friendly. Since the research will be carried out by
undergraduates, it will be an excellent way to train a new generation of Puerto
Rican scientists.

This project will investigate the preparation of new chiral spiroamino borate
esters to be used for the chemo- and stereoselective asymmetric reduction of
ketones and their derivatives. These studies are designed to provide fundamental
knowledge of the enantioselective catalytic reduction of these substrates and to
establish new protocols for the chiral synthesis of amino acids and alcohols.
