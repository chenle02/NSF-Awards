0078361&lt;br/&gt;Thorpe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This senior and distinguished PI
works on properties of glasses but in the framework of a network model. In this
view, which focuses on the geometric details such as network connectivity, the
network is derived by putting the most important forces in the model to be
infinite and the rest are set equal to zero. The resulting model is
computationally manageable with a large number of particles. In this model, at a
critical (as a function of) average coordination number (generally covalent
glasses have large coordination number while the polymeric glasses in general
have smaller coordination number), the states evolve in to a rigid and stressed
state. However the numerical results show the existence if an intermediate state
which is rigid but not stressed. This grant supports further work on this
intermediate phase of a network glass. Recent experiments in chalcogenide
glasses give preliminary evidence for an intermediate phase of this
nature.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This senior and distinguished PI is a leader in
the broad field of study involving glasses. In particular, guided by his belief
that many properties of glasses can be studied using a geometric model, i.e. one
made from sticks and balls, he has noticed the presence of curious phase of
glass which may have been seen experimentally. Looking at glasses from their
dependence on an average coordination number (number of atoms that a given atom
may be connected to) there are two phases, one where the glass has a small
coordination number, no rigidity and no accumulated stress while at large
coordination number, the glass is rigid and it has accumulated stress. Near the
transition, and a range of coordination number around the critical value, there
is an intermediate phase corresponds to a rigid but unstressed glass. He plans
to look at the observable properties of
state.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
