When points of fixed separation are marked off on a closed planear curve, the
points rapidly converge to a set of definite locations on that curve; the chords
between these points produce an equilateral polygon. The goal of this research
is to explore whether polygons so produced are useful for characterizing shape
features of particles in terms of a few descriptors. This new method of shape
characterization will be compared with other techniques of shape description.
The research also will attempt to link particle shape characterization with
other performance properties of particles including packing, granular flow, and
rollability. New techniques for automatically, efficiently, and succinctly
characterizing particle shape are needed urgently for analysis and/or control of
engineering processes involving particles of irregular shape.
