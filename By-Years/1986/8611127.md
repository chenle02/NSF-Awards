LDV measurements are underway for sediment-laden flows over bottom geometries
simulating stream bed forms. Sedimenting flows are of great importance in
sediment and flood control, yet measurement difficulties so far have not
permitted a clear picture of how turbulent flow characteristics are modified by
high sediment loads. These measurements will provide crucially needed data on
mean and turbulent velocities in realistically simulated flows. The experiments
will focus on non-equilibrium sediment concentrations, which preclude the
existence of a stable bed.
