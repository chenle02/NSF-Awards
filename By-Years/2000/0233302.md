The source of the highly energetic electrons in the out radiation belt has
remained a mystery. A model explaining the origin of the electrons through
inward radial diffusion has been utilized to successfully explain many features
of the radiation belt but the model requires a source of electrons with a high
phase space density which must lie outside the radiation belt region. The radial
transport model assumes that the first and (usually) the second adiabatic
invariants are conserved, but the third is not. This implies that electrons must
be transported inward from a region of higher phase space density. This project
will utilize data from the Polar, Wind, SAMPEX and Los Alamos satellites to
determine where that source region is and how it varies with solar wind
conditions. The radial transport model will then be utilized to quantify the
electron energization and compare the process with other competing processes
such as localized heating by waves and recirculation.
