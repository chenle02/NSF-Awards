9301318 Meachan This proposal is for a modeling study of the Black Sea. The main
goal is to study the general circulation and synoptic scale eddy field of the
basin. The selected area is relative small enclosed basin which facilitates good
resolution at eddy- resolving length scales and minimizes the use of open
boundary conditions. At the same time, the Black sea is considered large enough
to exhibit many of the circulation features found in larger basins. There is a
reasonable data base against which the model performance may be checked and,
several of the oceanographic research centers located on the shores of the Black
sea have already indicated their interest in collaborate in the project. This
presents a good opportunity for scientific international cooperation.
