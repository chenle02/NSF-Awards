A grant has been awarded to Dr. Vicki Wysocki at the University of Arizona to
&lt;br/&gt;design and construct an improved quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF)
tandem mass spectrometer (MS-MS) designed to include two complementary
activation methods, surface-induced dissociation (SID; surface target) and
collision-induced dissociation (CID; gaseous target). Two biological measurement
challenges that will be addressed by the proposed instrument are (1) protein
identification from complex mixtures with improvements in numbers of total
correct identifications and (2) analysis of glycoconjugates, specifically
glycosphingolipids, from complex mixtures without prior deglycosylation. The
proposed instrument will consist of the following components: a combination ion
source (atmospheric MALDI and micro/nanoESI); a quadrupole mass analyzer to
select ions of interest for activation; a surface for surface-induced
dissociation; a hexapole for collision-induced dissociation or for trapping of
surface-activated ions; and an orthogonal TOF chamber for analysis of product
ions produced by CID or SID. This project will result in an instrument with
several enhanced capabilities and in an excellent training experience for
project members. The instrument will provide high sensitivity, flexibility in
ion activation, a high duty cycle, high resolution and high mass accuracy for
product ions, and fast acquisition of spectra (compatible with microcapillary LC
introduction into the ESI source). Successful development of this instrument
will have a significant impact on proteomics research.&lt;br/&gt;
