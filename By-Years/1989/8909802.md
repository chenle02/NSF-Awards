Corrugated thin-film waveguides have played a significant role in the
development of optical devices, including distributed feedback lasers (DFB),
waveguide couplers, and optical filters. The objective of the proposed research
is to develop and test a new design technique for aperiodic corrugated waveguide
(CWG) filters. This technique will be based on second order Fourier synthesis
methods, which have been recently applied to the design of multilayer dielectric
stacks. Using these methods, aperiodic CWG filters will be designed to satisfy
specified spectral transmittance and reflectance characteristics. The devices
will be subsequently fabricated in glass waveguides, and their characteristics
will be measured using a tunable dye laser. The fabrication of some of the
proposed filters is unique in that attempts will be made to vary both the
corrugation depth and the period along the guide. The proposed research will
also permit the accuracy of several important propagation analysis techniques
(for aperiodic structures) to be experimentally compared. This comparison will
be based on the measured spectral transmittance of the fabricated devices.
