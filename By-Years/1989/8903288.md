Classical information theory is concerned primarily with random sequences.
Recently, researchers have directed attention to random fields over rectangular
grids in two and higher dimensions. This project involves a study of information
fields over other types of regular structure, in particular over binary trees.
Coding theorems for tree fields are likely to find application in data structure
theory in computer science and in genetics. Another part of the project is a
study of some aspects of communication topologies. One aspect is the design of
communication networks using hierarchical techniques for optimally agglomerating
individual nodes via concentrators and interconnection of concentrators in a
robust manner so that the network can sustain the failure of any single link.
Another aspect concerns the optimal embedding of a graph into a rectangular
grid, with applications to the design of efficient VLSI planar and multilayer
layouts; such as in switched processor networks or programmable gate arrays.
