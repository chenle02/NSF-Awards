An undesired consequence of the growing parallelism of modern processors is that
it is dramatically more difficult to separate the events that limit execution
speed from the >events whose latencies are tolerated. A method for focusing
design effort is critical-path analysis. This research proposes to apply
critical-path analysis at the micro-architectural level, with the goal of
detecting and eliminating execution bottlenecks. This research will explore the
potential of the critical path in four interrelated efforts: (1) Modeling the
micro-architectural critical path. The main task is to define a model of the
critical path, i.e., the set of events and dependences in a micro-execution that
will be exposed in the dependence graph on which the critical path will be
computed. (2) Efficient tracing of the critical path. This effort will develop
an on-line algorithm that will use a last-arrival edge at each node to calculate
the critical path in one pass in a simulator. (3) Hardware critical-path
predictors. This research will explore the use of approximation methods in
avoiding the analysis of the entire dependence graph. (4) Criticality-aware
processor policies. This research will use hardware critical-path predictors to
focus hardware policies on events likely to be on the critical path.
