This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the application of a novel tissue engineering approach to the fabrication of
animal products, in particular leather. The approach relies on the automated
deposition of conveniently prepared multicellular units into a three dimensional
arrangement. Biological structure formation takes place post deposition of the
discrete units through the mobilization of shape-forming, morphogenetic
processes akin to those in embryonic development, such as tissue fusion and cell
sorting. A distinguishing feature of the technology is that it is fully
biological; it uses only cells and cell-secreted substances. It has successfully
been used for applications in regenerative medicine. This project takes the
technology beyond regenerative medicine to produce animal products in an
environmentally sustainable, resource-conscious and ethically acceptable way
without slaughtering animals. The end product of this proof of concept Phase I
project will be an engineered leather sample of about 10 cm by 10 cm and 0.5-1
mm thickness.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has far-reaching
implications for the public and society broadly. It represents a fundamental
innovation in agriculturally-related manufacturing. The approach is a safe,
economical, environmentally conscious and ethically acceptable alternative to
present industrial leather production practices. It does not require the
slaughtering of animals or their unethical treatment, as it uses cells harvested
via biopsy. It enables reduction in livestock raised specifically for leather or
meat (leather being a byproduct) and consequently in demand for resources. As
the technology eliminates a number of leather production steps (e.g. de-hairing,
de-fleshing, splitting, curing, bating), it also eliminates many of the most
toxic stages thereby reducing environmental pollution. Since it allows for
better control of composition and shape, it enables dramatic reduction in waste.
Production can be largely local with all phases under the same roof, leading to
savings in transportation, fuel, etc. The commercial applications of the
proposed technology are broad with leather being an initial product and with
other materials to follow. Given the unprecedented control over every processing
step, the final products can be optimized in an application-dependent way.
