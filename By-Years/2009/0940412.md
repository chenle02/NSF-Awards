Carnegie Mellon University proposes a project, called Robot Diaries, that aims
to attract and engage a new group of middle school students in computing. With
Robot Diaries, students use familiar materials along with motors, lights, and
computation to design affective, programmable, tangible communication devices.
They animate their creations with emotional expression in the context of
collaborative storytelling. Robot Diaries motivates middle-school aged children
to engage with technology as creators and authors rather than simply as
consumers, and it increases students? confidence in their ability to be creative
with technology. This proposal builds on three years of pilot Robot Diaries
projects that included multiple rounds of participatory design with students and
teachers, and a preliminary analysis of the impact of this program on learning
and self-confidence. With this proposal, the audience for Robot Diaries will be
significantly expanded ? with an emphasis on girls and underrepresented
minorities ? through collaboration with the Pittsburgh public school system and
schools in the suburban and rural regions of southwestern Pennsylvania. The
project will create and deploy its new curriculum through co-design with local
teachers.
