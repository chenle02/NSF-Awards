The Computing Research Associationâ€™s Committees on Education (CRA-E) and
Widening Participation (CRA-WP) will collaboratively design and implement a
mentoring program for recipients of the NSF CSGrad4US Graduate Fellowships
targeted at recent computer &amp; information science &amp; engineering (CISE)
bachelor's degree graduates currently in the workforce and returning to graduate
school for a PhD in a CISE discipline. The goals of the CSGrad4US Mentoring
Program are (1) to guide returning students through the application process
towards a successful CISE PhD admission and school selection, and (2) mentor
them through the transition to PhD graduate study in the first year towards high
retention. The program evaluation will shed light on the retention rate of
students taking this pathway and the potential impact of the program on domestic
CS PhD production. The resulting mentoring program model and professional
development model for mentors and coaches will inform other efforts to increase
domestic PhD production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mentoring needs of students
returning from the workforce is different from those applying to graduate school
as undergrads. Key differences include the lack of a natural peer group,
diminished access to faculty who can provide graduate application guidance as
well as a perspective on their academic strengths and weaknesses, and the lack
of role models in the form of other graduate students and Teaching Assistants.
The CSGrad4US Mentoring Program will provide not only general graduate
application advice and guidance, but also provide missing larger context and
network. These goals are achieved through group mentoring sessions followed by
individual coaching during the application and decision making process and the
first year in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
