This research focuses on improving simulation and test methodologies through the
use of Concurrent Simulation (CS) and Multiple Domain Concurrent Simulation
(MDCS) algorithms. This project develops an efficient behavioral fault
simulation architecture that integrates well with structural and RTL models. The
inherent ability of CS to represent and store only unique behaviors from the
fault free experiment allows for excellent internal observation and comparative
experimentation. Furthermore, the use of MDCS algorithms provides compression
techniques for large simulations, overcoming memory bottlenecks while supporting
the creation of multiple experiment scenarios. This allows a designer to vary
parameters within any model and simulate it against other model configurations
in a single simulation. Activities being explored under this grant include: (a)
Developing algorithms for behavioral fault simulation, observability and
signature traces using CS and MDCS; (b) Reduction of memory requirements through
enhanced erratic experiment (infinite loop) detection, experiment compression
using MDCS algorithms and fault dropping. (c) Evaluation of algorithms that
allow the seamless integration of multilevel models.
