9632978 Kirkpatrick Theoretical research will be done on low temperature
disordered electronic systems. The four specific topics of emphasis are: (1)
disordered (and clean) itinerant quantum ferromagnets; (2) disordered itinerant
quantum antiferromagnets; (3) the metal-insulator transition as a random field
problem; (4) general aspects of field theories for disordered interacting
electrons. The methodologies include the construction of effective field
theories, renormalization group techniques, and many-body perturbation theory.
%%% The problem of strongly interacting electron systems is a major one in
modern condensed matter physics. Researchers have discovered over the past few
years that such fundamental issues as magnetism in metals are not really
understood at a fundamental level and that existing theoretical methods are not
sufficient to gain a deep understanding of the problem. This grant will look at
a number of problems related to the central one of strongly interacting electron
systems and use, and develop, a variety of powerful mathematical techniques in
order to do this. ***
