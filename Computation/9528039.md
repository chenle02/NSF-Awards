Manteuffel 9528039 The researcher and his colleagues organize a conference
devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of
equations. Particular themes are nonsymmetric linear systems, globally
convergent algorithms for nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of
work, and applications on multiprocessor computer architectures. The
mathematical description of real-world problems leads inevitably to equations to
solve. Many times the equations are nonlinear ones, arising because the
underlying problem is nonlinear. Often, however, the original problem is linear
and the mathematical equations are too. Such problems arise in all areas of
science and technology, and are of special interest in biology, materials,
environmental studies, and manufacturing. Progress in these areas requires
solution of more comprehensive modeling equations, or more accurate solution of
existing models. In either case, these needs increase the size of the equations
or their nonlinearity. The conference addresses advances in algorithms to deal
with the bigger size of the equations, nonlinearities, the amount of time and
work needed to get a solution, and the possible use of multiprocessor computers.
