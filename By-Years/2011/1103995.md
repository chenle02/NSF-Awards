The Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute is partnering with
secondary and post-secondary schools, resource centers, industry, government,
and workforce development organizations to develop a model bio-energy workforce
education program based on the bioconversion of organic material into methane.
The project is (1) creating bio-energy certificate and associate degree
education programs to serve at least 40 traditional and non-traditional students
recruited through a marketing and recruitment plan, (2) developing alternative
educational and career pathways for students from high school to technical
college to university, (3) offering professional development about bio-energy to
120 high school and college teachers, and (4) disseminating project findings and
resources throughout Ohio and the nation. The project will address Ohio's
growing need for bio-energy technicians.
