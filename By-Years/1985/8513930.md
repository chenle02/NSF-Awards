The objective of this effort is to develop a set of economic models that will
allow a determination of the most cost-effective manufacturing approach for
discrete part fabrication and assembly. the models have two parts. The first
part will define the levels of automation and flexibility applicable to specific
process technologies, and develop a corresponding economic model for each level.
Focus will be on three specific process technologies: assembly, fabrication, and
material handling between different process facilities. The second part involves
design for manufacturing and group technology for assembly. At the minimum, the
project will consider an electronic assembly, a sheet metal assembly, and three
electromechanical assemblies that have cast, machined, forged, and/or injection
molded components. Industrial components and data will be employed in this
project.
