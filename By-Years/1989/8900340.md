This award provides logistics-only support for the installation, maintenance and
operation of IRIS seismic equipment at Amundsen- Scott Station, South Pole,
Antarctica. The Incorporated Research Institution for Seismology (IRIS) is a
consortium of research institutions created to implement critically needed
national facilities for support of seismological research on the Earth's
interior in the coming quarter century. IRIS has a membership of 57 universities
and includes nearly all U.S. universities with seismological research programs.
IRIS has developed a 10 year plan for the implementation of a Global
Seismographic Network (GSN) of about 100 broadband, digital, wide dynamic range
stations, with data transmitted via satellite in a broadcast mode whereby any
site on earth can access the complete global data set, if desired, in real time.
The installation of a state-of-the-art, broad-band, digital seismic observation
for the South Pole is part of an effort by the National Science Foundation to
improve seismic instrumentation globally. A modern seismic station at the South
Pole will provide a crucial link in the global seismic network and is essential
for seismic studies of the Antarctic continent.
