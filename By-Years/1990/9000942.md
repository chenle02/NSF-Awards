A workshop on the physics of the negative ion of atomic hydrogen will be held
at the University of New Mexico January 9-11, 1990. It will emphasize
experimental and theoretical results generated in the period since 1980, when a
successful workshop on this same general topic was held at New Mexico. The
workshop has attracted a field of outstanding participants, and a preliminary
program received 12/12/89 confirms that the scientific agenda is broad and
significant. Support at a reduced level is recommended to provide needed travel
and subsistence for several participants.
