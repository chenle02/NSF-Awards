Tidal variability in the mesosphere-thermosphere region is investigated using
existing models, and the extant model versions will be expanded to include a
high spatial resolution, nonlinear, time-dependent 3-D dynamical model. The
specific research focus is to untangle the causes of observed longitudinal,
intra-seasonal, and inter-annual tidal variations. The processes to be
scrutinized by model comparison to data include tropospheric tidal sources and
the mesosphere-thermosphere response (particularly the monthly mean and inter-
annual variations), the effect of tidal dissipation in the mesosphere-
thermosphere region, wave-wave interactions, the effect of the Mt. Pinatubo
eruption on density and temperature in the mesosphere-thermosphere, and inter-
seasonal variations.
