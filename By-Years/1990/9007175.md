This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative
in support of the collaborative research of Professors Schrock, Cohen and Silbey
at MIT. Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials
Research. The thrust of the research is the synthesis and study of semiconductor
clusters of uniform size. These clusters are expected to have properties
markedly different from the same bulk materials. Ring-opening metathesis
polymerization by well-characterized molybdenum catalysts will be used to
prepare block copolymers with morphologies consisting of uniform sized spheres
within a host polymer matrix. The spherical regions will contain main group
metals covalently attached to each monomeric unit in the region. The host
polymer will be a hydrocarbon. Block copolymer films will be treated with
hydrogen sulfide in order to generate uniform sized clusters within the spheres.
Optical spectra will be acquired and evaluated using theoretical techniques.
Selenides, tellurides, phosphides and arsenides of a variety of main group
elements should be preparable using similar approaches. Lead sulfide clusters
with an average size of 30 angstroms have been prepared in a polynorbornene
film.
