The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to transform the analog design landscape,
eliminating the analog design bottleneck by creating a new way to do analog
layout using digital place and route technology. The potential impact is broad
and encompasses most, if not all, semiconductor companies and design houses, who
will be able to gain reductions in cost and design schedule by utilizing the
technology that will begin to be developed in this proposal. The clear analogy
is with digital Place and Route (P and R) technology which has now almost
completely replaced custom digital design and layout. Except for few very
specialized niches, digital P and R is the standard tool used by everyone on
nearly every chip. The company's stem cells and flow can become the equivalent
of this technology for analog and mixed signal designs.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project targets several
facets of the flow to prove that analog layout productivity can be increased by
orders of magnitude. A continuous time linear equalizer circuit layout will be
created using our stem-cell Place and Route flow, and compared to a hand-crafted
layout. By increasing the stem-cell layout active density, expanding the stem-
cell library to minimize mapping errors, and creating macros hierarchically, the
company will reduce layout-induced parasitics such that area, power and
performance will match or exceed the handcrafted version. A layout will be
generated with the company's flow to prove compatibility with analog circuits
other than amplifiers or linear equalizers. Also, the project will prove
portability from one foundry process to another to show that post-extraction
simulated performance is maintained in the new process.
