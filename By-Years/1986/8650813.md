With the recent acquisition of a process control trainer, the Department of
Chemical Engineering at North Carolina A&amp;T University is adding completely
instrumented laboratory experiments to its process control laboratory. The
trainer provides for the control of flow rate, level, temperature and pressure,
and interfacing to an IBM-PC provides computer control capability. Advanced
control strategies such as cascade control, feedforward control, flow ratio
control and dead time compensation can be studied. All juniors will study
computer control as part of their required laboratory experience in process
control. In addition, seniors will be able to develop and test control
strategies on the trainer as part of the required Plant Design course and the
elective Independent Study course. The enhanced education will provide chemical
engineers with better preparation for work in industry.
