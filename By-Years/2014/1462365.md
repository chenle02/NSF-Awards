Computer systems that combine traditional processors with powerful graphics
processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in all platforms ranging from
cloud servers, to laptops and tablets, and even cell phones. GPUs can yield
performance or energy savings of up to 300x through their unique design.
However, developing applications to exploit these systems is a difficult
challenge, requiring specialized hardware expertise and tedious performance
optimizations that make them unusable by a large fraction of software
developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome this challenge, this project will
explore the commercialization opportunities for a source-to-source optimization
system that transparently generates high performance software for heterogeneous
computer systems. This I-CORPS team has developed an automatic parallelization
tool called Mistos that can help programmers write code for these high
performance systems. With Mistos, programmers need to only focus on
functionality, rather than hardware details and performance tuning. Mistos will
enable users of all kinds of computing platforms, including mobile application
developers, cloud services, and members of the scientific community, the ability
to harness the computing power of heterogeneous GPU systems in a seamless and
efficient manner.
