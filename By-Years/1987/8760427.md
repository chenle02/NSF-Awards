Concrete structures are being repaired in order to extend their service life.
This project will investigate innovative methods and materials which will
improve the chemical bond at the interface of the repair material and the
original concrete. Four polymers will be evaluated, in conjunction with the
required treatment of the repair surfaces in order to determine the best
combination.
