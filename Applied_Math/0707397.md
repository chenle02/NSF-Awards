The investigator studies the stability and instability of equilibria in fluids
and plasmas, focusing on the two-dimensional Euler equation in fluids and on
Vlasov systems in plasma physics and stellar dynamics. He aims to develop
general methods of finding linearly growing modes (especially for asymmetric
modes and boundary modes), to investigate nonlinear stability under sharp linear
stability criteria and for non-monotonic equilibria that cannot be handled by
the usual energy-Casimir method, and to establish nonlinear instability from
linear instability when the particle trajectory is non-integrable.

A plasma is a gas composed of particles, each carrying a positive or negative
electrical charge, with approximately equal concentrations of each charge. Most
of the universe is plasma; examples include the solar wind, the ionosphere,
galactic nebulae, and comet tails. Plasmas also arise in physics and
engineering, for instance in nuclear fusion. The investigator studies the
stability and instability of equilibria in fluids and plasmas. Mathematical
advances here enhance our understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern
stability and instability, and so can lead to better numerical methods for
simulations of these complex phenomena. Fluid stability is important in
understanding the mechanisms of ocean waves and the movements of the atmosphere
as well as in engineering applications. Questions of plasma stability arise in
areas as diverse as sunspots, fundamental plasma physics, the design of fusion
machines, and plasma display devices.
