CMS 0442380&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this grant is to facilitate the mission of the National
Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation by hosting a workshop dedicated to understanding
the future needs of industry&lt;br/&gt;in matters related to the discipline of
tribology.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Tribology is considered an
enabling science in that its lessons contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;development of
new products and processes in all industrial sectors. It is envisioned
that&lt;br/&gt;the proposed workshop will bring together visionaries from
industry, academia, and&lt;br/&gt;government agencies in order to i) identify
research opportunities that can be applied to&lt;br/&gt;encourage sustainable,
societal and environmentally-responsible economic growth; ii)&lt;br/&gt;develop
a network for channeling useful information towards industrialists, policy
makers&lt;br/&gt;and the public; and iii) stimulate research in new fields of
tribology (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;nano-structured materials, molecular dynamics
modeling, smart materials and surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;etc.)&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Research in the discipline of tribology has promoted the
modernization of industry, and&lt;br/&gt;has a strong impact on resource (energy
and materials) consumption through quality&lt;br/&gt;improvements and
efficiencies. This workshop will provide knowledge of value to continuing this
trend.&lt;br/&gt;
