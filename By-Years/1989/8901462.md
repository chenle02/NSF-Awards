8901462 Berkovitz This research will be concerned primarily with the
determination of optimal strategies - and numerical approximations to them - in
cases where optimal strategies exist and with the determination of near-optimal
strategies in other cases. In previous work it was shown that in games with
Lipschitz continuous value, the directional derivates satisfy certain
inequalities. In the proposed research it will be shown that given a Lipschitz
continuous function that satisfies these inequalities and the same boundary
conditions as the value, one can obtain optimal strategies, in cases where they
exist, by considering the values of the control variable at which the
inequalities are achieved. In cases where optimal strategies do not exist, near-
optimal strategies will be obtained. A method for constructing such a function
in many cases will be given. A method for determining the value function by a
backward recursive solution of the inequalities will also be developed.
Computational feasibility, proof of convergence and estimates of the rate of
convergence will also be considered. Since the value function is a viscosity
solution of the Isaacs equation, the adaptability to the problem at hand of
numerical techniques for finding approximate viscosity solutions of first order
partial differential equations will be investigated. Another method of
approximating solutions that will be investigated is that of approximating the
continuous time game by a sequence of infinite multi-move games corresponding to
discretization of the time interval. The convergence of the solutions of these
multi-move games to the solutions of the continous time game will be established
and estimates of the rate of convergence will be obtained. A theory of
differential games in which a time lag in 1nformation is present will also be
developed.
