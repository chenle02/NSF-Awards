The goal of this research is to define the roles of separate components of the
yeast transcriptional silencer at HMR E. Two components of the silencer at HMR E
are binding sites for proteins that act else where as gene activators. A third
components exhibits properties of an origin of DNA replication. This research
will address the issue of how these components combine to create a silencer by
answering the following question. Are gene activator function and DNA
replication directly involved in silencing, or are these properties of the parts
of the silencer incidental to its function as a whole? The approach taken in
this proposal is aimed at systematically identifying the minimum constituents
needed to generate a silencing effect on test minichromosomes defining the
interactions of these constituents using primarily genetic techniques. The
experiments described here will help characterize classes of protein and
protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions generally employed to create
compound regulatory elements. Due to the nature of the structure of the silencer
the proposed experiments will not only yield information on mechanisms of
transcriptional repression and hierarchies of chromosome organization, but will
also open new avenues for addressing the function of gene activators and origins
of DNA replication. Investigations of these issues in yeast will have general
applicability and will accelerate the analysis of these same problems in higher
eukaryotes
