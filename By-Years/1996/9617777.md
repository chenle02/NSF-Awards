9617777 Trayanova Biomedical engineering represents an area of extreme interest
to both the medical and engineering communities. Significant interaction is
required to generate the synergism required to merge the engineering disciplines
with physiological constraints. This grant provides funds for travel to a
technical conference that brings together the researchers in both medicine and
engineering to merge their efforts. It also provides an opportunity to allow
practitioners to interface with researchers. ***
