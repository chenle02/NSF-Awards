Ten undergraduate students are involved in four active areas of structural and
geotechnical engineering research: soil testing, structural testing,
microcomputer programming and computer-aided analysis and design methods, and
probabilistic methods. The exposure to testing numerical and analytical
techniques assists the students in selecting a future research direction. Once
the students leave or complete their term, their interest is maintained through
a quarterly newsletter, mailed to them for a period of 2 years. The newsletter
is prepared by all faculty involved in the projects. The newsletter will include
the following information: o Latest developments in the research projects that
students worked on. o New research potentials in their field of interest or in
related fields. o Information on upcoming relevant conferences and seminars. o
Information of new publications in the field.
