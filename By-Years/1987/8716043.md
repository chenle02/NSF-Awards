The aim of their program is to carefully prepare, characterize and investigate
novel magnetic materials and epitaxial, ultra- thin (1-20 atomic layers) films
which are expected to exhibit unusual magnetic properties such as super-
ferromagnetism, altered Curie temperatures and altered critical exponents that
contrast strikingly with bulk behavior. They will use electron capture
spectroscopy (ECS), which has developed into a very sensitive spin-sensitive
method, to probe the long-ranged and short-ranged magnetic order at the topmost
layer of a surface. Further magnetic studies will be performed using the
magneto-optic Kerr effect and ion-induced emission of polarized secondary
electrons. The latter is a new, very surface sensitive technique that is being
designed in their lab. They also plan to advance their magnetic microscope
towards atomic resolution. The materials studied will include artificial
magnetic systems composed of elements such as iron, chromium, manganese,
palladium and terbium that exhibit unusual electric and magnetic properties if
deposited on adequate substrates. Their program includes spin glasses, Heusler
alloys and rare-earth/transition metal heterostructures.
