Broadcast and Multicast are paradigms that are central to many state- of-the-art
fault-tolerant distributed systems. Despite their fundamental importance, these
paradigms are not yet completely understood. Many of their aspects are still
unexplored and many crucial issues remain to be solved. The goal of this
research is to develop a deeper understanding of the foundations of fault-
tolerant broadcasts and multicasts. The work will focus on Reliable Broadcast,
Causal Broadcast and Atomic Broadcast and the corresponding multicast
formulations. The investigation will include the following problems in the
context of several types of failure models and communication networks: (1)
development of specifications, algorithms, and lower bounds for the new problem
of preventing inconsistency and contamination via broadcasts and multicasts
initiated by faulty processes. (2) development of algorithms and lower bounds
for Causal Broadcasts and Multicasts. (3) development of Reliable and Atomic
Broadcast protocols that are simultaneously time-efficient and message-
efficient, with a performance that gracefully degrades as the number of failures
that actually occur increases.
