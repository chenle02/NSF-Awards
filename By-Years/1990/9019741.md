This is a statistical study of abyssal hill morphology on the East Pacific Rise
at 7.7 to 9.3S. Two days of ship time will be added to a cruise to gather
abyssal hill bathymetric and sub-bathymetric data along flow lines west of the
ridge axis. The data will be analyzed to investigate correlations between the
variation in abyssal hill characteristics and the variation in morphology and
associated geophysical processes. The Principal Investigator has generated a
two-dimensional model for seafloor characterization and a method for estimating
model parameters from multibeam bathymetric data. The model parameters provide
quantitative physical information regarding abyssal hills, describing their rms
height, characteristic width and length, aspect ratio.asimuth of lineation, and
fractral height, dimension.
