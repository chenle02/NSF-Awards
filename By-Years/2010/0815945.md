This work involves a new training approach to help adults learn to quickly and
accurately solve multi-digit addition and subtraction problems (e.g., 34 + 29).
We will use behavioral measures of skill to demonstrate that the training
program improves the ability to solve addition and subtraction problems, and to
determine whether the benefits extend to other types of mathematical tasks
(e.g., solving an algebra problem, or comparing the magnitude of two numbers).
Measures of brain function will be used to test the idea that our training
approach leads to adaptive changes in a core brain region involved in "basic
number sense."
