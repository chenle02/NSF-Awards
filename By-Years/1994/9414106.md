9414106 Etzler This award renews support for a Research Training Group (RTG) at
the University of California at Davis. The faculty group includes 13 members
drawn from the Sections on Molecular and Cellular Biology, Microbiology, and
Plant Biology in the Division of Biological Sciences, and the Department of
Vegetable Crops. The RTG emphasizes training at the undergraduate and graduate
levels with a focus on plant cell biology. Research areas include biogenesis of
subcellular compartments, signal transduction and intercellular communication,
membrane biology, and post-translational modification and protein assembly.
Organisms studied by the faculty include yeast, unicellular algae, and a variety
of higher plants. Funds provided by the award are used to provide stipends for
graduate students; support for individual students is limited to a maximum of
four years. Funds for support of undergraduate training include stipends for
summer research activities and for continued research during the academic year.
The undergraduate program targets upper division students and complements an
institutionally-supported program for lower division students. About 10 students
each at the undergraduate and graduate level are supported in each year. In
addition to providing stipends for students, the award has provided support for
workshops on methodology, seminars and an annual retreat, and has provided
partial support for equipping and operating a centralized training facility. The
facility both trains and assists students in the use of advanced microscopic and
microchemical instrumentation. Besides those who are directly supported by the
award, other students and, in addition, postdoctoral fellows are able to
participate in the training activities sponsored by the group and are able to
use the training facility. Though not supported by the grant, these students and
postdocs are otherwise full participants in the RTG. ***
