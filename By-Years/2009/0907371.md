This award provides funds to support a joint workshop (Stevens Institute of
Technology and New Mexico State University) in high frequency data modeling. The
main purpose of this workshop is a synergy between Econophysics and high
frequency data modeling. Specifically, the focus of the conference is on models
for high frequency data and in particular applications of statistics and
statistical mechanics to this modeling problem. Furthermore, we are interested
in complex systems and system of systems as applying to this
problem.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific motivation for the conference arises from the
fact that organizing a conference in the trade capital of the world has the
potential of bringing together the best mathematicians, practitioners and
regulators to help develop and better the modeling aspect of the
marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this meeting is to expose today's
economic and modeling problems to mathematicians and current graduate students
in the hope that this will improve the quality of the research problems studied
at the moment of the conference.
