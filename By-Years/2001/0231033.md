Our project is an effort by a multidisciplinary team of engineering faculty
members at Rowan University to integrate digital imaging technology (DIT) into
their undergraduate engineering curriculum. It builds upon the experience and
interest of faculty to promote new topics and innovative methods of teaching.
Our work is an effort to provide students with the skills directly relevant to
the evolving needs of the industry and the marketplace. Our project involves the
development of digital imaging curriculum and focuses on the creation of a
leading edge digital imaging laboratory/studio to facilitate the use of
nontraditional learning approaches that encourage interactive learning, team
building, and creative problem solving among students and instructors. There are
nine modules adapted, implemented and used to introduce students to the
multidisciplinary engineering principles and use of DIT. Though our
dissemination efforts we will encourage other schools to adopt our curriculum
and modules to enhance their undergraduate curriculum and to promote engineering
education outreach opportunities.
