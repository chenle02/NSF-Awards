0929943&lt;br/&gt;Platt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support acquisition of an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) camera
and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for a recently acquired variable
pressure field emission source scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the Earth
Sciences Department at the University of Southern California. The EBSD camera
will permit determination of the crystallographic preferred orientation patterns
(CPOs) in mantle and crustal rocks that record lattice dislocations caused by
physical conditions under which deformation occurred (e.g., flow stress, strain-
rate, vorticity, and temperature). The EDS will permit simultaneous
characterization of phase composition in the sample. PI and student research
with a focus on the determination of the tectonic history of exhumed rocks will
immediately benefit from the EBSD as will materials research on synthetically
produced ultrafine grained nanostructured materials that have emerging
commercial applications where extremely high strength materials are
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
