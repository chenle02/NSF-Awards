Although tropical cyclone intensification is driven by energy sources local to
the storm, evidence is growing that external forcing, particularly at upper
tropospheric levels, can trigger the internal intensification process. In
previous work, the principal investigator developed hypotheses for how upper
tropospheric forcing at outer radii vertically couples to produce lower
tropospheric inner core intensification of hurricanes. The principal
investigator plans to test his hypotheses with both diagnostic calculations with
observational data and numerical modeling studies. He will then apply his
concepts of storm formation and intensification to other atmospheric
disturbances, namely, explosively growing oceanic cyclones in the middle
latitudes and a long-lasting mesoscale vortex over land.
