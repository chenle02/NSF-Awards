As the Internet grows larger and more complex, it becomes exceedingly difficult
to reason about its structural properties because there exists no scalable
method to map the Internet's crucial structural properties such as connectivity,
delay and bandwidth. The lack of such structural information in efficiently
accessible form leads to poorly functioning and excessively complex network
software and protocols. The Internet Geometry project aims to develop geometric
models of the Internet's crucial structural properties, much like their
geometric longitudes and latitudes can represent distances between locations on
the Earth. Geometric models are inherently simple and scalable, and thus can
enable a wide variety of scalable performance-aware protocols and applications.
The expected contributions of this CAREER research project include new
fundamental understanding of the geometric properties of the Internet by
studying extensive Internet structural data and new methods to generate accurate
network geometric models. The PI will work towards a public global-scale
distributed system that enables all Internet nodes to independently compute
their network geometric properties, and simple and scalable protocols and
systems for network routing and distributed system self-organization enabled by
network geometric models.
