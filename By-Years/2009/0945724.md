This SBIR Phase I project will develop a unique material constructed from
processed dairy manure for the replacement of peat moss in horticultural media.
The new material will also incorporate beneficial microbes for improving plant
growth. This product will solve two problems at once, eliminate environmental
damage caused by the harvesting of peat moss and provide a new use for millions
of pounds of animal waste produced in the U.S. each year.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be a new use for
dairy waste in the U.S. The product would be a major improvement in support
material presently used to grow turf for lawns and golf courses and lead to
reduced use of peat moss. Formulations containing beneficial microbes would
improve the performance and stress tolerance of plants and reduce the use of
fertilizer containing chemicals. The technology is also carbon neutral and
environmentally green.
