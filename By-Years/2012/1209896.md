This action funds Patrick Callier of Georgetown University to conduct a research
project, entitled "What perceptions do listeners form from the way others
speak?" during the summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing,
China. The host scientist is Professor Diao Yanbin.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore how users of
language unconsciously construct a picture of the people around them as they
hear others speak. This project examines how hearing someone speak with a
creaky-sounding voice impacts the impressions of the speaker formed by native
listeners of Mandarin Chinese and asks whether these impressions are affected by
other aspects of the linguistic context, such as where in a sentence the creaky
voice appears.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
