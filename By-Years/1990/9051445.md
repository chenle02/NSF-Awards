This project supports an undergraduate laboratory for information visualization.
It equips the laboratory with 6 workstations and high-speed high-resolution
graphics subsystems as a part of a larger undertaking. It also provides for the
development of courseware for a new course in static and dynamic information
visualization techniques under an integrated multi-media format. Static
information visualization is devoted to topics on color discourse, texture-,
lightening-, shading-, volume-, and shape-visualization. Dynamic information is
devoted to the time/space relationship of processes such as algorithm
visualization, event simulation, study of motion, and process animation. Media
integration addresses the integration of computer graphics, imagery graphics,
and the video/compact disc media. Also addressed are applications of computer
aided visual technology, visual communication, visual ergonomics, animation, and
scene production. The award is being matched with a greater amount (216 percent)
by the principal investigator's institution.
