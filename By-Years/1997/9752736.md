Mathematics faculty in New York State have formed the New York State Coalition
to integrate the teaching and learning of mathematics and its applications in
science and quantitative subjects. The project will enable the coalition to:
modify for local implementation curricular materials and approaches being
developed nationally; demonstrate how faculty in mathematics and science can
cooperate to develop interdisciplinary courses; continue to attract and retain
students from underrepresented groups; and spur interdisciplinary innovations at
participating institutions. The project includes workshops and follow-up
activities.
