This project will support the creation of a classroom which will provide an
interactive/tutorial environment for students in introductory mathematics
courses. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
(ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the quality of the undergraduate
curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based
undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or
engineering. In particular, the project will allow students in algebra,
precalculus, discrete mathematics, and calculus to have hands-on experience in
order to learn the material effectively. Predesigned lessons will be made
available for use in the classroom either in the form of tutorials (with
interaction only between the student and the computer) or interactively under
the guidance of an instructor.
