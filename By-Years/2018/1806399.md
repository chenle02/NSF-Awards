This award will fund the participation of US-based junior researchers in the
"TQFT and Categorification" conference to be held at the Institut d'Etudes
Scientifiques de Cargese on April 15-20, 2018. The subject of Topological
Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) has provided a critical testing ground where ideas
from theoretical physics inform rigorous mathematical frameworks that lay the
foundation for a quantum theory of gravity. TQFTs have been particularly well
studied in 3-dimensions, bringing about unprecedented interaction between
mathematics and theoretical physics. Since the world we live in is 4-dimensional
(including time), truly understand it requires an extension of the techniques of
3-dimensional TQFTs into 4-dimensions. This enhancement of mathematical
structures has come to be called "Categorification". This conference will
advance this ambitious program to understand 4-dimensional TQFTs, while proving
important opportunities for the establishment of new collaborations and the
scientific development of young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "TQFT and
Categorification" conference aims to bring together researchers from different
horizons around the central question of lifting the techniques from the study of
3-dimensional TQFTs to 4-dimensions. The conference will be organized around
three central themes: Heegaard-Floer homologies and symplectic geometry,
Algebraic categorification (including Khovanov homology, categorified quantum
groups, and categorification at roots of the unity), and TQFT (including
connections to physics, super homologies, and non-semisimple invariants). The
organizers expect this conference to be a catalyst for establishing lasting
collaborations and new avenues of research. More information about this
conference can be found at

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
