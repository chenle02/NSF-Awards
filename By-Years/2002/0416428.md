This project develops a computer/network forensics curriculum that tightly
integrates new courses, practical experience with partner organizations, and
computer science research. The new courses educate computer science
undergraduates in both academic computer science and in the
practical/legal/social issues encountered in computer/network forensics.
Versions of these courses will also be taught to practitioners in the URI
Continuing Education Program. The project includes a Forensics Science Minor for
computer science majors and minors, a track in the computer science Master's
degree program, and a professional certificate program, as well as internships
at partner that practice computer/network forensics. It also establishes a
teaching and research lab where students and faculty address unsolved problems
in computer/network forensics. The information assurance professionals
graduating from this program bring much-needed breadth in technical
understanding to the field. The project includes dissemination of the novel
computer/network forensics curriculum model and course materials from this
project to other schools so they can include forensics in their IA program.
