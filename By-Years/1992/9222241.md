This research explores connections between initial value constraints and gauge
transformations in classical field theories. Initial value analyses of standard
examples indicate that (i) the Euler-Lagrange equations are simultaneously
underdetermined and overdetermined; (ii) the (first class) constraints are given
by the vanishing of the energy-momentum map associated to the gauge group; and
(iii) the evolution equations can be written in adjoint form. Noether's theorem
and the Dirac- Bergmann analysis of constraints help to predict and explain
these features. The key tool in the analysis is the "energy- momentum map." The
general goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the mathematical
structure of physical theories underlying physical entities such as gravitation,
electromagnetism and the nuclear forces. Recent work has shown that all basic
physical processes can be described in a very similar manner mathematically, and
this observation has led to the discovery of several striking features and
phenomena which yield new insights into these processes. These insights, in
turn, have generated applications in fields far from removed their source, such
as robotics, optimal control and laser optics. The proposed research will
endeavor to unify and extend current approaches, based on geometric and symmetry
considerations, thereby obtaining a fundamentally new understanding of the
structure of physical theories.
