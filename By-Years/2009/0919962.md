Sexual traits such as courtship displays are often the most diverse features
among closely related species. Understanding the origin and maintenance of
diversity in nature thus requires understanding sexual selection (competition
for mates and their gametes). Its basic mechanism hinges on the genetics of
sexual traits, and recent findings about their genetic architecture are
revolutionizing the field. This project will provide the most comprehensive
information to date on the reaction norms of sexual traits (reaction norms are
curves that show the forms that individuals of the same genotype can take in
different environments). Different patterns in the reaction norms of male and
females may have different consequences for sexual selection, all the way from
hindering the process to initiating and promoting divergence. But we do not have
enough data to assess which outcomes are common. This project will provide the
foundation for making this assessment. This requires a study group in which
sexual selection and environmental variation are known to influence divergence.
This is the case in Enchenopa treehoppers, which are plant-feeding insects that
communicate with vibrational signals (sounds that travel through plant stems.)
Research methods involve quantitative genetics (in which breeding designs are
used to estimate genetic parameters, as for example with cattle), and state-of-
the-art laser vibrometry to monitor vibrational communication. This project will
broaden the participation of under-represented minorities in science, and
integrate research, teaching and outreach activities. Junior participants will
be exposed to positive role models while more senior participants train in
providing mentorship. The project will take advantage of Milwaukee's Urban
Ecology Center to present core findings to the public in lectures and field
activities.
