This NSF award provides funding for a project to develop new methods for working
with objects with complicated geometry at many different scales. Coastlines,
clouds, and leaves are examples of such objects that occur in nature. The famous
coastline paradox states that since a coastline is so rough at so many different
scales, it has no defined length. The PI plans to develop and study new methods
to build such multiscale objects and to break them down into easily handled
pieces. New ways to decompose objects often lead to great advances in
mathematics, where simple problems can have complicated, multiscale solutions.
The project?s three-prong approach includes studying ways to break down complex
objects, build complex objects out of simple pieces, and to measure multiscale
complexity. In addition to the research, the PI will train graduate students and
postdocs in the techniques developed by this project through advising, seminars,
minicourses, and reading groups and disseminate material on his webpage for
public access.

The project aims to study problems in metric geometry, geometric measure theory,
and harmonic analysis related to maps and surfaces with multiscale structure,
that is, objects like Lipschitz and Holder maps or fractals, that are hard to
approximate by affine maps or by planes. One focus is the study of geometric
problems that have non-smooth solutions but no smooth solutions, such as the
Nash Embedding Theorem. Solutions to these problems often use multiscale or
self-similar structure to break rules that smooth maps have to satisfy, and one
aim of this project is to understand when and why this phenomenon occurs.
Another focus is quantitative and uniform rectifiability. Uniform rectifiability
has been a powerful tool for studying singular integrals and geometric measure
theory in Euclidean space. Recent work has made it possible to find sharp bounds
on the quantitative rectifiability of surfaces in the Heisenberg group, and this
project will explore the possibility of extending notions of uniform
rectifiability to the Heisenberg group and using them to solve problems in the
geometry of Euclidean space and the Heisenberg group.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
