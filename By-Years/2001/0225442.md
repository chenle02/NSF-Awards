Wireless communication is essential for coordination of emergency response
efforts. However, the various kinds of unit (fire, police, FBI and unattended
sensors) do not necessarily have access to common radio architectures. To
achieve high levels of flexibility and scalability for wireless communication,
the processing of the wireless waveforms must be performed in software: i.e.,
"software radio". Migrating algorithms from hardware to software can increase
the level of functionality but only if the communication protocols are
established at run time. We propose an approach to establishing communication by
explicitly maintaining self-awareness and communication of knowledge about the
operation of the communication nodes. The self-awareness and communication of
knowledge is based on the maintenance of an explicit, declarative knowledge base
or "ontology" of communication. Hence, we refer to the concept as "Ontology
Based Radio" (OBR). An ontology captures the basic terminology (concepts) of the
domain of interest and the relationships among the concepts. Ontologies can be
expressed in the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML), and processed either off-
line using a theorem prover or in real time using an expert system engine. The
main idea of OBR is that the communication nodes ``understand'' the contents of
information to be transferred, their own capabilities and capabilities of the
destination units. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a proof of
concept that demonstrates optimized dynamic interoperability between different
kinds of communication node, especially unattended sensors as well as radios
used by emergency response teams.
