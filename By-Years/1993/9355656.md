9355656 Wolf Lebanon Valley College and twelve school districts in South-central
Pennsylvania have initiated a science education partnership affecting nearly 600
teachers and 20,000 students in grades 4-8. The partnership goal is to
strengthen science teaching by increasing teachers' knowledge of science,
understanding of hands-on and inquiry- learning pedagogies, and improving their
skills to use hands-on classroom materials. Training is achieved through summer
institutes organizing teachers, science faculty and students into collaborative
teams and by in-service workshops which integrate approaches to science content,
pedagogy, and development of practical and useful classroom science materials. A
cadre of teachers serve as Peer Leaders in their districts, conducting workshops
and institutes and catalyzing their colleagues' long-term interest and
confidence in learning new science content and instructional strategies. A
Resource Center is housed at the College.
