The construction of ring compounds occupies an important position in synthetic
organic chemistry. Under the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, this
project is studying a novel reaction which very efficiently constructs six-
membered rings containing an important functional group. This methodology will
be employed to synthesize a series of natually occurring compounds. The
participation of alpha, beta-unsaturated isocyanates in ı4+2! cycloaddition-like
reactions with a variety of dienophilic partners including: enamines, vinyl
ethers, silyl enol ethers, and benzynes is under study. The basic validity of
the proposition has been established with the successful cycloaddition of
several functionalized cyclohexenyl isocyanates and certain enamines, enolates
and benzyne. The fundamental methodology is expanded to include the construction
of a number of potentially useful functionalized octahydrophenanthridine
species. In addition, further exploitation of the chemistry for the elaboration
of several examples of the amaryllidaceae alkaloids is planned. The fundamental
strategy exploits the potential for construction of the phenanthridine nucleus
of the alkaloids in essentially one operation using appropriately functionalized
vinyl isocyanates in ı4+2! cycloaddition type reactions. The strategy will also
be used to construct several pyridone containing fungal metabolites.
