Boston University's Noyce Urban Science Scholarships (BoNUSS) program is
providing 29 new scholarships to academically talented science majors. The
departments within the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education and
several local high-needs school districts (including Boston, Chelsea, Everett,
Malden, Quincy Revere and Somerville) are partnering to provide scholarships for
24 recent graduates with science degrees to return to BU and undertake the
Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT). In addition, 5 new undergraduate scholars are
being funded to complete their licensure program in one year and teach in
surrounding high-needs districts. The program follows the previously established
model at BU shown to be successful with students majoring in mathematics. Pre-
service teachers are exposed to a curriculum enriched with information and guest
lecturers that address challenges faced by in-service teachers serving in urban
settings. In addition, following their practicum year, project personnel are
offering continuing support for the new teachers including access to a Master
Teacher who offers monthly seminars intended to address issues of classroom
management, and conducts regular online sessions to provide support, advice,
mentoring and help with curricular challenges encountered by new teachers. The
evaluation of the Noyce BoNUSS program also is identifying strategies that lead
to the creation of an effective science preparation program to attract, prepare
and retain high-quality secondary STEM teachers.
