Dawes 9503017 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
result in a new method for detecting and classifying acoustic emissions (AE)
resulting from crack growth in complex metal structures. To perform this
research, a prototype acoustic emission sensor-processor system will be used to
collect AE data in situ from the wing skin of a flight training aircraft in the
vicinity of a landing gear assembly where fatigue cracking of the skin is a
known problem. The proposed innovation, whose feasibility for this application
was demonstrated in the Phase I project, is based on the use of the Parametric
Avalanche Stochastic Filter (PASF), and on the similarity of the acoustic
emission classification problem to certain problems of continuous speech
recognition. In particular, the PASF is able to directly distinguish between
crack events and other classes of acoustic signatures imbedded in a continuous,
noisy data stream. It is anticipated that the results of this Phase II research
will advance the use of AE technology to perform non-destructive evaluation
(NDE) in a variety of applications, at a considerable cost savings over current
methods. Phase II research will demonstpate a successful AE-based NDE technology
which can be marketed to the commercial and military aircraft manufacturing
industry, commercial airlines, and aerospace maintenance and refurbishment
firms. Technology developed in Phase II will also be used to pursue other NDE
applications, including monitoring of pipelines, pressure vessels for the
petrochemical and nuclear power industries, and testing of load-bearing
structures. p:\sbir\yhashimi\9503017c.doc
