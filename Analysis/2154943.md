This project investigates the geometry and analysis of energy-minimizing
deformations with applications to the study of nonlinear elasticity. The latter
field, which studies the deformation of physical materials and bodies in
response to stress and strain, is informed by developments in materials science
and physics. A common challenge faced in the development of mathematical models
of nonlinear elasticity is how to account for the physical impossibility of
compressing a portion of an elastic body of positive volume into a space of zero
volume. From a mathematical point of view, serious difficulties arise when
trying to overcome the lack of injectivity as postulated by the physical
principle of non-interpenetration of matter. While homeomorphic solutions would
be ideal models, mathematical constraints linked to the necessity of complying
with the aforementioned physical principle lead naturally to the conclusion that
limits of homeomorphic solutions must be allowed as legitimate competitors. New
analytic and geometric tools have been developed to accommodate these
difficulties, and those tools will be developed further and in greater detail in
this project. The project will also afford research opportunities for early
career mathematicians, including graduate students.

Weak limits of energy-minimizing sequences of Sobolev homeomorphisms are natural
candidates of energy-minimizers. In two dimensions, weak and strong limits
coincide and characterize the class of monotone Sobolev mappings. Non-injective
energy-minimal solutions, being monotone, may squeeze two-dimensional plates or
thin films, but may not fold them. Serious challenges arise in the investigation
of energy-minimal solutions solely based on inner-variational equations. This
project is largely concerned with questions similar in spirit to the Riemann
conformal mapping problem. Such variational questions also lead to associated
Sobolev mapping problems and, in the case of prescribed boundary values, require
a preliminary investigation of Sobolev variants of the Jordan-Schoenflies
theorem. A further goal of the project is to deepen the connections between
geometric function theory and relevant areas within physics and engineering, by
fostering the exchange of ideas among practitioners of these various subjects.
