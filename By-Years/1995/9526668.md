9526668 Bodnar Results of two pilot studies offer encouragement that fluid
inclusion reequilibration behavior is NOT a random process but, rather occurs
systematically and reflects the changing physical and chemical environment of
the inclusions. As such, fluid inclusion reequilibration characteristics may
supplement other techniques used to infer P-T histories of samples which have
experienced complex tectonic histories. The present project will continue and
expand pilot studies to compare laboratory-reequilibrated samples with natural
samples from well-characterized environments. The work will include more
detailed study of samples from the two pilot studies as well as samples
representing other P-T-paths. The effects of time, fluid composition, loading
rates, inclusion size, shape, etc. on the reequilibration process will be
examined in a systematic manner to develop a predictive tool that may be used to
complement other commonly used techniques. ; Oh +' 0 $ H l S u m m a r y I n f o
