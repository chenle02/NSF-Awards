The control systems that regulate gas exchange in water-breathing and air-
breathing fishes are not well understood. The purpose of these studies is to
identify the role of the major groups of sensory receptors that influence gas
exchange, and to begin to assess the central integration of this information
which in turn controls the complex branchial and aerial respiration patterns in
these fishes. The proposed studies will test specific hypothesis about the
anatomical location and sensitivity of putative internally and externally
oriented branchial chemoreceptors and the significance of their diffuse and
apparently redundant arrangement in both water-and air-breathing fishes. Further
studies will assess the role of air-breathing organ mechanorecptors in
respiratory control and ventilation perfusion matching. The proposed work will
also test the hypothesis that air breathing in gar is not the result of a
centrally generated rhythm, but is reflex in origin. These studies should not
only help us to better understand the control of bimodal gas exchange, but
should help us to understand the changing roles of the brain and peripheral
nervous system during the evolution of vertebrates that colonized the land
environment.
