HDCCSR Proposal 0234651 Improving test suites via generated behavioral
abstractions Michael Ernst

Testing is a key to detecting bugs and increasing software reliability, but
generating good test suites is difficult. This project investigates a novel
technique for using behavioral differences to improve test suites. The technique
compares dynamically generated behavioral abstractions of executions and selects
the more complete one -- that is, the test suite that exercises more of the
program's semantic behavior. Whereas previous automatic techniques compare
dynamic (run-time) behavior to the static structure and text of the program,
this new technique considers behavior, which complements structural techniques
and is arguably more important.

The technique is applied to generating, augmenting, and minimizing test suites.
Users provide the program to be tested and a technique for generating test cases
(via a grammar, random generation, traces collected from users, or otherwise).
Users never need to provide a specification. However, the technique generates a
behavioral abstraction that is syntactically identical to a formal specification
and that, after being checked and perhaps augmented by a human, can be used as a
specification. The efficacy of these techniques is investigated and improved,
and they are applied in substantial case studies.
