The proposed U.S.-Brazil planning visit will allow the U.S. PIs Drs. Lisa
Campbell and Damon Little (New York Botanical Garden) to plan an
interdisciplinary, collaborative research program on the systematics of
Xyridaceae with Brazilian collaborator Dr. Maria Das Gracas Lapa Wanderley from
the Instituto de Botanica de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Xyridaceae are a small
family of flowering plants, common in wetlands in many parts of the world. They
have never been studied thoroughly; current knowledge is based on fragmentary
and local studies. Meeting in person will provide a venue for effectively
communicating details regarding responsibilities for data gathering and
analysis, research expenses, and dissemination of anticipated results. The
planning visit aims to propose research that will produce a classification based
on evolutionary relationships and on sound taxonomy. These are essential for
meaningful studies on the biology and ecology of Xyridaceae. Furthermore insight
into the diversity of this lineage will be critical in formulating conservation
priorities.
