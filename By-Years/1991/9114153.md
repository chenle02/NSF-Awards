Sensory transduction is the process by which a receptor cell becomes activated
physiologically in response to a particular stimulus. In the olfactory system,
some stimuli trigger the generation inside the cell of a class of molecule
called a second messenger, in this case a compound called inositol triphosphate,
IP3. Recent experiments suggest this IP3 in turn binds to a protein in the cell
membrane, and that protein then functions to change the flow of ions through the
membrane, and activate the cell by depolarizing it. This IP3 receptor protein is
thus a key component of olfactory transduction, but relatively little is
currently known about it. This pilot Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER) project will utilize molecular biological techniques, instead of the more
usual biochemical approach, to isolate clones of the receptor, for further
biochemical and physiological analyses of the protein and its role. The
molecular approach promises a high yield of characterized protein. If successful
with this novel approach, the impact will be on cell biology in general, since
IP3 is important in several membrane functions in addition to its central role
in olfactory sensory transduction.
