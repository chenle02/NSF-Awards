This project addresses the design and analysis of algorithms for the
identification of dynamical models of image sequences for the purpose of
detection, classification and recognition of spatio-temporal events from video.
In particular, we concentrate on (segments of) image sequences that satisfy
certain statistical regularity conditions, such as second-order stationarity, or
certain physical constraints, such as Lambertian reflection. While this does not
cover the most general video sequences, generality will follow from
compositionality, by segmenting each sequence into portions that do satisfy the
assumptions. The purpose of our models is to enable the detection,
classification and recognition of dynamic events, such as the presence of smoke,
moving foliage, fire, walking humans etc. in live video.
