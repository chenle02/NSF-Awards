Many cellular processes, including motility, are controlled by the calcium ion
concentration within the cell. In muscle cells, the calcium ions used to
regulate the state of contraction are stored within a membranous reservoir, the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of calcium from the SR results in cellular
contraction; resequestration of the calcium within the SR results in relaxation.
The uptake of calcium is due to a calcium ATPase which pumps calcium ions across
the membrane. During pumping, the enzyme passes through two intermediate forms
which involve phosphorylation of the protein. This laboratory is interested in
how this calcium pump functions, and has been employing as a model system a
preparation of SR from scallop muscle, which has a uniquely paracrystalline
arrangement of the calcium ATPase which makes possible electron microscopic
diffraction analysis and other biophysical approaches. This laboratory has
recently found that, in scallop muscle SR, the two intermediate forms show a
different crystalline arrangement in the SR membrane. One of the implications of
this finding is that the enzyme molecules may rotate in the membrane during the
pumping cycle. The laboratory has also found that the lipid composition of the
scallop SR is strikingly different from rabbit muscle SR, which is the common
biological material for studies of the calcium pump. Further exploitation of
this unique model system will be pursued. Transport of calcium across membranes
is of universal physiological importance in all cells, and results from this
work will have relevance to many aspects of cell biology and organismal
physiology.
