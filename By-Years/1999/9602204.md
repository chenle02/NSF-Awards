Plant science research at Colorado State University is emerging with a strong
interdisciplinary focus on molecular biology. A diversity of research projects
targeted at both exploring fundamental biology and improvement of crops is
integrated with graduate student training. The Plant Biotechnology Program,
which includes faculty from six departments and three colleges, and also
interdisciplinary in scope and mission oriented in function, has generated a
need for high quality greenhouse facilities with good control of environmental
parameters that can meet NIH containment guidelines. In order to produce a
facility dedicated to support the needs of plant biotechnology research, funding
provided by the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with
resources from the University, will be used to renovate a 30 year old greenhouse
and adjoining headerhouse. The physical condition of the fiberglass cover has
deteriorated and considerable upgrading of electrical, ventilation, shading,
insect exclusion and watering systems is needed. Capability for much improved
control of environmental conditions, with the use of computer driven
environmental monitoring and control systems, will be provided. Once completed,
the facility will have space for transgenic plants, with modern equipment for
environmental controls and pest management. Research personnel benefiting from
the renovation will include: 11 faculty members, 6 postdocs, 22 graduate
students, 15 undergraduates, and visiting scientists. This project will markedly
improve the Program's ability to conduct reliable research and to train students
interested in learning molecular techniques required for modern plant science
research.
