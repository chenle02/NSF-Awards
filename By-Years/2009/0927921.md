Proposal Number: 08927921 PI: Austin, Martha Institution: Dartmouth College
Proposal Title: Secure Systems Engineering Grand Challenge Problem Workshop

The overall goal of this project is to run a workshop that will set the stage
for a competition in secure systems design. Drawing on the very successful DARPA
Vehicle Grand Challenges, which enabled significant advances in artificial
intelligence applied to autonomous vehicle control in a setting replete with
road hazards and then in a urban setting, the PI wants so set up a competition
where system designs will be tested against attempts to show that they contain
vulnerabilities that threaten their security. Through the workshop, new paths
leading towards sustainable improvement in information assurance practices will
investigated. The primary results from the workshop will be the definition of
one or more open multidisciplinary competitions to identify and demonstrate
practical, effective approaches to improving the overall level of information
assurance for the public and private sectors in specific application domains.
Since these kind of competitions are new to the field of computer security, it
is necessary to hold a workshop to energize the community and to define just
what would constitute effective competitions.
