This scholarship program increases the size and diversity of the pool of
qualified engineers by making an engineering education accessible to students
from underrepresented groups with limited financial resources. Specifically,
scholarship funds provide needed financial assistance to African-American,
Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islanders and female students. Scholars
receive funding for four years to ensure successful degree completion. The
project develops an interdisciplinary cohort of engineering majors and involves
them in activities of the AT&amp;T Minority Engineering Program (MEP), which
provides peer tutoring, collaborative learning, an interactive learning lab, and
a student life skills component. These MEP program efforts have dramatically
increased retention rates of minority engineering students at Auburn University.
The MEP activities are enhanced in the proposed project with career development
workshops, support for technical society participation and advanced level
tutoring. Approximately 73 students benefit from the activities of this
scholarship program.
