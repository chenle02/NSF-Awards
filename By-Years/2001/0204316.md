Title: APSIT: Alternate Pathways to success in Information Technology

This ITWF award provides support for the Alternate Pathways to Success in
Information Technology (APSIT) program which seeks to explore the nature of the
IT and engineering educational and career pathways used by successful female and
minority Georgia Tech alumni. The objectives of the project are:

1. To determine, through the use of paper and telephone surveys, face-to-face
interviews, and institute records of Georgia Tech alumni, whether the
educational and career strategies used by white women and by men and women from
underrepresented ethnic groups differ from the strategies used by white men in
their successful pursuit of IT and engineering degrees and careers.

2. To explore correlations between high school and college educational success
(as measured by grade point average, and standardized test scores) with indices
of later success in the IT and engineering work force, and to analyze these
correlations by gender and ethnicity.

3. To explore IT and engineering field-specific differences in educational and
career success for women and minorities.
