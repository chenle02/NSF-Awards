Since the introduction of quantum invariants of three dimensional manifolds the
fact that these invariants are only defined at roots of unity has been an
obstruction to analyzing their properties. However, there is ample evidence that
quantum invariants of three manifolds exist as holomorphic functions on the unit
disk that diverge everywhere on the unit circle but at roots of unity. The
investigator uses the results of her previous research to study further quantum
invariants and to find additional applications of that research to classical
3-manifold topology. Specifically, she works on the problem of extending the
parametric domain of the quantum 3-manifold invariants beyond roots of unity.
She also studies the application of quantum topology to detecting symmetries of
3--manifolds and to answering questions relating to Dehn surgery on knots.

Quantum topology is a rapidly developing area of mathematics that brings
together ideas from physics, algebra, geometry and topology. This theory has
produced a wealth of new invariants for three dimensional manifolds. Three-
manifolds are objects which locally look like the common 3-dimensional space we
live in, and "topological invariants" are numbers which can be associated to
manifolds that encode some information about their structure and help to
classify them. The investigator works on one of the fundamental problems in this
area, namely that of finding topological interpretations for these new
invariants.
