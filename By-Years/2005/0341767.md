Daily activity almost always includes doing two things at once, such as walking
and talking or driving and finding a place to go. Two very basic activities that
need continuous and precise tuning are locomotion and breathing. In most
animals, mechanical constraints on breathing lead to strong coupling or
synchronization with locomotion. Lizards, for example can only run and breathe
in alternation. In human locomotion, there is more flexibility in how breathing
and locomotion are coordinated. However, many of the muscles involved in
breathing also control the stability of the torso and the torso plays its own
role in stability during locomotion. Interconnections run in all directions and
the problem of coordination is complex to say the least.

With NSF support Dr. Richard Van Emmerik, Dr. Joseph Hamill and Dr. Patty
Freedson, together with postdoctoral fellow Dr. William McDermott, will
investigate how people coordinate respiration and locomotion under a variety of
circumstances. A focus of the research is to assess how people adapt
coordination in different movement tasks. The tasks manipulate the degree of
difficulty for walking and examine the impact on coordination between locomotion
and respiration. A very important question for this research is how this
coordination affects the stability of locomotion. Broader impacts of the
research are in the areas of learning strategies for physical activity across
the lifespan, prevention of falls in older individuals, and rehabilitation from
accidents and for people afflicted with movement and respiratory disorders.
