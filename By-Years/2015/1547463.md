This award will provide support to post-doctoral fellows and junior scientists
to attend a symposium on Neuroecology at the 2016 Annual meeting of the Society
for Integrative and Comparative Biology. The goal of this symposium is to bring
together leading researchers across career stages to discuss the challenges and
next steps in understanding how to link neural bases of behavior in natural
settings and to natural stimuli. The topics will cover multiple scales of
analysis, from molecular and cellular levels up to behavior and ecology.
Eighteen invited speakers, chosen based on their creative contributions to the
field and their ability to promote fruitful discussions, have confirmed their
attendance. The results presented at the meeting will have the potential to
guide future developments in understanding the neural mechanisms of sensory and
motor processes that mediate ecolologically relevant behaviors.

The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its small size, which
promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top
scientists whose research spans neurobiology, animal behavior and ecology. It
spans a wide variety of experimental systems and focuses on areas of exceptional
activity or promise. This combination leads to fruitful comparative analyses,
raises new questions about underlying mechanisms and often leads to new
collaborations. The outcomes of the award will include a symposium as part of
the larger meeting, oral presentations by students and postdoctoral scholars, a
breakout session to synthesize ideas in neuroscience, animal behavior and
ecology and publication of the symposium proceedings. This award will also be
instrumental in training a new generation of scientists in this
interdisciplinary field.
