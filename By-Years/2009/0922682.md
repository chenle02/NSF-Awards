The objective of this project is to acquire a state-of-the-art nanoscale imprint
lithography system to provide critical fabrication capabilities for continued
research progress in large area, high-throughput, high resolution nanoscale
device applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The acquisition
of this nanoimprint system will advance nanoscale science and technology on
numerous research projects at the University of Cincinnati and other
Southwestern Ohio Universities. These projects include photonic device
fabrication and integration, photonic optoelectronic structures, silicon and
nanotube-array biosensor fabrication, bioNEMS and labs-on-a-chip, semiconductor
nanowire plasmonic biosensors, quantum well infrared photodetectors for long
wave infrared applications, and basic single semiconductor nanowire
investigations. Each of these projects will benefit from, and in some cases will
be made possible by, the acquisition of the nanoimprinter tool.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This nanoimprint system will expand the
research capabilities for a wide range of faculty and literally scores of
graduate students in their thesis and dissertation research, and will expose
undergraduates and summer program students to state-of-the-art fabrication
techniques. This acquisition will have a direct and strong impact on the
development and training of future U.S. scientists and engineers in nanoscale
science and engineering, a critical segment of the nation's workforce.
Undergraduate students will be exposed to nanoscale science through a series of
structured laboratory experiments integrated with an existing NSF Nanotechnology
Undergraduate Education program. Significant collaborative efforts also
currently exist between the University of Cincinnati, Xavier University (an
undergraduate institution), Miami University, and the University of Dayton.
