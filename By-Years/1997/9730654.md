9730654 Kreps Since its inception in 1970, the Conference on Econometrics and
Mathematical Economics (CEME) has sponsored a number of annual meetings on a
variety of topics in economic theory and econometric methodology. This grant
renews support for the six CEME seminars in Bayesian Inference, Time Series,
Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Decentralization, and General Equilibrium. The
purpose of this ongoing conference series is to stimulate discussion and
research on the frontiers of econometric and economic theory, and to investigate
the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to
empirical economic studies. It is intended to both encourage research on new
topics and speed the dissemination of the latest findings by leading scholars.
To this end, these meetings have been exceptionally successful, providing forums
for the exchange of ideas in economic theory and methods which are not
constrained by more formal frameworks of journal publication. The informal
channels of communication opened by affording specialists in selected topic
areas to meet regularly at widely dispersed institutions and for longer periods
than is generally possible at meetings of professional society has been
especially fruitful, particularly for young scholars at the beginning of their
professional careers. Since its inception, seminar groups have produced hundreds
of working papers, books, and articles in professional journals, which have been
broadly circulated, making the contents of the seminars more broadly available.
A number of collections of papers presented at CEME meetings have been published
in special issues of professional journals. ??
