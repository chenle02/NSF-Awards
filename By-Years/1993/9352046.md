Students are utilizing the concepts of Calculus to solve applied problems in
both Calculus and Physics. The instructional approaches are modeled after the
methods developed by Priscilla Laws, Ron Thornton, Alan Van Heuvelan, David
Maloney, and others, to teach Physics. The approaches also involve stressing the
graphical, numerical, and analytical aspects of Calculus in keeping with the
ideas forwarded by the Harvard Based Calculus Consortium. An important aspect of
this method of teaching is a set of short, simple conceptual experiments whose
outcomes are recorded and graphed in real-time by a computer. Concepts are first
developed qualitatively using experiments and their graphs, then quantitatively
through mathematical representation of physical phenomena, and finally with
overview case study problems.
