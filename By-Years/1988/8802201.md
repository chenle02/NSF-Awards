This research is focused on a mathematical analysis of models arising from the
study of reactive thermal explosions. Initial value problems that describe the
evolution of diffusive and nondiffusive thermal explosions in confined domains
will be analyzed. Also of interest is the prediction of exactly when thermal
explosions will occur, the location in the confined vessel where hotspots will
develop, and a description of precisely how the blowup singularities evolve as
the blowup time is approached. The mathematical models which describe these
problems are partial differential equations with mixed parabolic-hyperbolic
behavior. These models include the interaction between chemical processes and
the the induced gasdynamic phenomena. An understanding of this interaction is
needed if progress is to be made on ignition explosions, high speed
deflagrations, detonations, and the transition of flames to detonations. These
topics are vital in the study of accidental explosions.
