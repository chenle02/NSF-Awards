This theoretical program will improve our understanding of the formation of
large-scale structures in the universe such as galaxy clusters, and use this
understanding to provide constraints on cosmological models derived from
observational studies. Broader impacts of the work include training of a
postdoctoral researcher, public lectures both for adults and in primary and
middle schools, interviews in the media including those targeted to Hispanic
audiences, and a lecture series at a senior citizen
center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Zaldarriaga will develop a new theoretical and
statistical framework combining two state-of-the-art techniques: analytical
field theory methods that provide a theoretical foundation, and computational
and statistical techniques that confront theory with observations in an
efficient and statistically accurate way. The work will be useful in the future
interpretation of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
