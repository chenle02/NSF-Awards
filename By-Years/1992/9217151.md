Coherent phase transitions lead to characteristic fine scale structures.
Analytic methods based on the minimization of elastic energy have had
considerable success, but they also have notable limitations. Numerical methods
are an absolute necessity for exploring local minimizers, for understanding the
role of various selection mechanisms, and above all for modelling dynamics. We
will continue the development of a new approach based on nonconvex elastic
energies. Both elastodynamics and diffusion-driven dynamics will be considered.
This work will make use of large-scale computation on both serial and parallel
architectures.
