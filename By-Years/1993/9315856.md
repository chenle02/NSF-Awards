9315856 Goldfinger This award will fund a project to investigate a fundamental
problem in neuroscience: information propagation in branched axons. Anatomical
and physiological data suggest that axonal arborizations are efficient regions
for neuronal signal propagation; however, theoretical studies have found that
low safety factors for impulse conduction occur in these regions. This study
will reexamine the theoretical studies and use a new approach to solve the
impulse propagation problem. This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems
Analysis and Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of proposals
that through the study of neurophysiological systems could advance engineering
science and advance the knowledge of biological systems through the use of
engineering analysis techniques. The research being funded by this award has the
potential to further the understanding of a basic neurophysiological phenomena
and advance the field of engineering in the area of computational methods. ***
