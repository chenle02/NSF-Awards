This project implements for the first time on world trade data a model that
appropriately predicts bilateral trade in both homogeneous and differentiated
goods according to the distinct logic of trade in each. This study examines
bilateral exports for 30 industries and 61 countries. This study takes as a
maintained assumption that there are two types of goods: the differentiated
goods contemplated in the conventional gravity framework and a set of
homogeneous goods. The methodological contribution in this study will be the
development of a procedure to identify each of the two types of goods and to
predict the trade patterns in each. This is undertaken in the context of maximum
likelihood estimation. The results will provide a better understanding of the
determinants of bilateral trade patterns and balances. An improved model of
bilateral trade may also be important for consideration of many problems for
which the gravity framework has been a key input. Finally, one output of this
project will be the program used to compute the bilateral trade patterns, so
that others can easily apply the methodology.
