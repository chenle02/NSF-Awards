The project will support US participation in the XIIth Scientific Committee on
Antarctic Research (SCAR) International Biology Symposium. The theme of this
meeting and ancillary workshops is Scale Matters. Meeting sessions will
specifically address biodiversity and physiology spanning from molecular through
ecosystem scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide partial support
(airfare and meeting registration) for up to 25 US participants enabling them to
travel to Leuven, Belgium and attend the SCAR International Biology Symposium in
July 2017. Preference will be given to applicants who are students and early
career scientists. The call for applications will be broadly disseminated to
encourage participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. The SCAR
International Biology Symposium is a unique opportunity for US scientists to
present their work and learn about the most recent findings on all aspects of
Antarctic organisms and ecosystems research, to establish and strengthen
international contacts, and to be actively involved in the development of new
directions and the establishment of new frontiers in polar biology.
