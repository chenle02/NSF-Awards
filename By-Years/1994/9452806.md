9452806 Unruh The University of North Iowa seeks to initiate a three-week,
summer commuter, Young Scholars Program (YSP), in the fields of physics and
chemistry for 24 students entering grades 8 and 9. The project will provide
students with enriching summer activities along with a series of Saturday
morning follow-up activities during the academic year. The project focuses on
several basic physics, chemistry, and mathematics concepts, including energy
transfer, light, sound, density, graphing, probability, and statistics. Students
will have opportunities to engage in career exploration activities through
interactions with scientists from a variety of work settings who may serve as
role models in their fields.
