Elicitor treatment of bean or soybean cell suspension cultures causes rapid
cross-linking of preexisting structural proteins in the plant cell wall,
following a burst of oxidative metabolism and generation of hydrogen peroxide at
the plant cell surface. Oxidative cross-linking is also under developmental
control associated with cellular maturation, eg., during hypocotyl growth, and
in tissues subject to mechanical stress, eg., the stem-petiole junction.
Stimulus-dependent oxidative cross-linking of pre- existing structural proteins
in the plant cell wall is a novel site of cellular regulation, with potentially
important functions in the flexible realization of the final functional
architecture of cell walls during plant development, and rapid toughening of
walls in the initial stages of microbial attack or related stresses. Moreover,
the rapid response to defined elicitors, which is initiated within 1-2 minutes
and complete within 5-10 minutes, provides the basis for functional dissection
of the initial steps in the perception and transduction of elicitor signals. The
present proposal seeks to explore the regulation of oxidative cross-linking,
underlying signal mechanisms and the impact of cross-linking on cell wall
properties.//
