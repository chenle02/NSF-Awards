This research is on automated synthesis of high speed, highly reliable clock
distribution networks. A global clock signal is required in order to control
synchronous operations, and it must be distributed to every register at a
precise time. A four phase top-down design system for synthesizing buffered
clock distribution networks is being investigated. Models of operation which
include the effects of process parameter variations on timing are being
developed. Scheduling clock skew is done at the behavioral level of the system.
The clock distribution algorithms are being included in an integrated synthesis
system.
