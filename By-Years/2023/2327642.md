The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
advancement of perovskite solar cell technology, making it more accessible and
affordable for a wider range of applications. The project's innovative
functionalized inks address key challenges in perovskite solar cell
manufacturing, including cost reduction and compatibility with various layers in
the solar cell stack. By offering a cost-effective, high-quality solution for
solar cell manufacturers, the project can promote the adoption of renewable
energy technologies, ultimately leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and
decreased reliance on fossil fuels. The commercial impact of this project
extends to startups and established companies within the perovskite solar cell
industry, as it enables them to produce solar modules at a lower cost, creating
a more competitive market and driving innovation.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of functionalized metal-oxide
charge transport layers for solar cells, which offer a significant reduction in
layer costs and facilitate solution-phase processing. The project's core
innovation is the functionalization of nanoparticles with acetate ligands,
allowing for dispersion in perovskite-compatible anhydrous ethanol and providing
unmatched process flexibility. This innovative approach overcomes the challenges
of solvent incompatibility and processing temperature constraints that have
limited the choice of materials for charge transport layers. The resulting
dispersion is not only cost-effective, but also compatible with low-temperature
processing techniques, making it an ideal solution for flexible solar
applications. The project also explores the potential of functionalized nitrogen
oxide as an alternative, offering similar advantages in cost, stability, and
manufacturability.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
