The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Hunter College is undertaking a major
upgrade of its three freshman laboratories. Over one thousand students a year
enroll in the Calculus=based and the Algebra-based freshman physics courses and
in a one-semester Basic Concepts of Physics course. The fifteen new laboratory
experiences include a group of three kinematic experiments, tow acoustic wave
and four optics experiments. The remaining five cover areas from gravitation,
thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism and radioactivity. The laboratory
experiences include repetition of classic experiments as well as opportunity to
allow a close-up touch-and-feel of basic phenomena. A majority of the laboratory
experiments include computer assisted data collection. Microcomputer based data
analysis and graphing are provided throughout the year-long laboratory course.
The college is providing more than twice the amount of the grant in support of
the project.//
