A major obstacle in design research is a representation and language to
describe a design problem, interpret the design, and recognize modifications to
the design to support design innovation. As a significant step toward solving
this problem, a graph-based representation will be developed which abstracts
essential geometric descriptions of a body to a level where modification and
interpretation of the body becomes computationally feasible. The anticipated
graph not only represents an abstract model of the geometry of the body, but
also models physical constitutive relations and behavioral design constraints.
The graph can be expanded based on optimization information, modeling the
process of design innovation. A language of features is then defined on the
graph representation to describe and interpret the design computationally; the
language will be built on top of the graph to recognize features modeled in the
geometric representation and adjust design constraints accordingly. This
research is part of a long-term goal to create a design environment which can
reason about a design problem at various levels of abstraction to support the
rapid generation of solution concepts.
