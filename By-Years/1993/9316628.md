EAR-9316628 Wright, Herbert, Ito, Emi, Univ. of Minnesota GRGC: Post-Illinoian
vegetational and climatic history of the Middle West: Comparisons with European
history PIs, in collaboration with the Illinois Geological Survey, will conduct
pollen analysis covering the time from the penultimate glaciation through the
latest interglacial, up to the present (the last 130,000 years), south of the
extent of the last glacier in central North America. A transect of cores will be
taken across a drained lake basin in southern Illinois. Analyses will be
conducted of pollen (in detail), as well as of ostracodes and plant
macrofossils; C-14 dating, lithologic, and other geochemical analyses will also
be done. Results will be correlated with similar European studies and with the
marine sediment-core record of ice sheet volume. Striking variations in
vegetation suggest conspicuous climate changes during these times and have
implications for understanding, for example, the history of jet stream
migration, precipitation, and tree migration rates as indicators of insolation
and climate.
