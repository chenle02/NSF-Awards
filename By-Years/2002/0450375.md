HRD 0450375&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancement of Doctoral Research Capacity in
Environmental Toxicology at Southern University at Baton Rouge
(SUBR)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern University at Baton
Rouge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI- John W. Owens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF
support, Southern University at Baton Rouge will strengthen its science,
technology, engineering and mathematics educational and research enterprise by
expanding interdisciplinary research focused on the effects of environmental
pollutants on health at the molecular level. Research topics include: (1)
Biochemical Role(s) of Plant and Environmental Estrogens in Hormone-dependent
Cancers, (2) Release of Inflammatory Mediators Following Exposure to Particulate
Pollution, (3) Interaction of Fluorinated Surfactants with Natural Organic
Matter (NOM), (4) Mechanisms of Butadiene-Induced p53-Mediated Apoptotic
Signaling, (5) Molecular Basis of Degenerative Diseases Mediated by Oxidative
Stress, and (6) Responses of Endothelial Cells to
1,3-Butadiene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research
program in environmental toxicology at SUBR is that it makes a significant
contribution to the body of knowledge of molecular environmental toxicology in
general and to molecular mechanisms associated with the ill effects of
1,3-butadiene in particular. The broader impact the broader impact of the
research in environmental toxicology is that it will make a significant
contribution to SUBR's mission of becoming nationally competitive as a
Doctoral/Research University-Intensive institution. At the same time the program
is helping to address the under-representation of Blacks and other minorities in
the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
