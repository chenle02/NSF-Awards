HRD-0429729

The submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for
Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to
recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the
participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics,
and engineering.

The work of Charlena Grimes is well above and beyond her position
responsibilities as a staff administrator. This mentoring effort truly reaches,
recruits, and retains underrepresented groups in engineering. The Bridge program
that was developed by Charlena Grimes has documented success and is a primary
component of the nomination. The 14-year old program has improved the
departmental retention rate by 20%. Program documentation reflects that more
than 663 underrepresented students have participate dint he program; 50 percent
earned a degree in STEM (or are very close to degree attainment) and 75 percent
earned some degree from WSU, compared to non-Bridge students who have a 67
percent graduation rate.
