The Federal Statistical System consists of 14 principal statistical agencies and
over 60 others spending large amounts of money collecting basic social and
economic data on the United States. It is the foundation of vast data resources
for the social sciences used broadly across the disciplines. The knowledge
required to design complex sample surveys, which are the basis of much Federal
government statistical series, is a blend of statistics, sociology, psychology,
economics, and computer science. The purpose of this grant is to provide core
support for the Joint Program in Survey Methodology (JPSM), offering graduate
degree programs in survey methodology. The JPSM is a consortium of the
University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, and Westat, Inc. The grant
provides for faculty and staff support permitting the admission of new Masters'
cohorts of students, the development of formal courses in economic statistics,
and the creation of a certificate program in sampling statistics.
