The third conference on Computational Physics in the Undergraduate Curriculum is
being held October 2-5, 1991. Targeting undergraduate physics faculty, the
conference provides an opportunity for faculty to explore two of the most
promising developments in computational physics: (1) symbolic computational
packages, such as Mathematica, and (2) pre-compiled packages, such as MUPPET
(Maryland University Project in Physics and Technology). In order to increase
the impact of this conference on the physics community, the project is being
advertised nationally and utilizes speakers of proven ability and national
recognition in the field of software development. The project includes post-
conference workshops on the most promising software development tools suitable
for distribution to physics faculty and students. Development tools, software,
and conference proceedings are being distributed to all conference participants.
