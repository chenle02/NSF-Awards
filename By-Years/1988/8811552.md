The treatment of wastes on a nuclear level and transforming them into safer
isotopes by selectively irradiating the wastes with a variety of particles
including neutrons, protons, and beta and alpha particles is investigated. The
goal is to significantly reduce the number of certain isotopes that present the
most severe biological hazards. Among these are cesium and iodine which, when
collected, remain in the human body and the transuranic elements are not only
radioactive but highly toxic. The investigation involves mathematical modeling
of the transmutation of isotopes under irradiation. The model includes all
isotopes found in high level waste under all forms of irradiation. The process
is repeated for all possible resulting products through any series of
transmutation. A computer code is to be developed to solve simultaneously all of
the coupled levels of the irradiating particles and the duration of the
irradiation. The code is utilized to achieve a series of irradiations by the
various particles at feasible flux levels yielding the desired result.
