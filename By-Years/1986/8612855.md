This special project is cooperation with Worcestwr Polytechnic Institute to
interest undergraduate students in pursuing a career in engineering, and at the
same time pursue an investigation of research activities within the Federal
agencies which will be of great benefit to the agencies and especially to the
NSF Program of Systems Engineering for Large Structures. The study will involve
a review of the research activities of several Federal agencies in the broad
field of repair, retrofit, and rehabilitition of public works. The investigation
will provide data for the Agencies to cooperate in their research funding
opertions and to avoid duplication but to correlate projects for maximum return.
