Senem Kaptan, under the supervision of Dr. Rocio Magana, will examine how the
rule of law is used during processes of democratization as a tool to dismantle
militaries and produce new forms of citizenship. The researcher will examine the
ongoing trials of military officers accused of treason and coup plotting in
Turkey. Initiated as part of the EU integration process and promoted by the
government as a switch to the rule of law and end to arbitrary legal procedures
of the previous regimes, the trials have paradoxically been fraught with
inconsistencies and irregularities. Through a twelve-month ethnographic research
that includes participant observation in open-court trials; collection of life
histories with the officers' families; interviews with acquitted officers,
attorneys, judges, prosecutors, journalists, and NGO workers; and the analysis
of court transcripts, this dissertation project will examine 1) the social
downfall of the military through the impact these trials have had on the
officers and their families, 2) the public trust in the military, and 3) on the
notions of law and justice. In doing so, this project analyzes how the rule of
law becomes a tool to dismantle militaries and produce new forms of
citizenship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a study that examines how former military
elites in power face charges in court, this research will also be of benefit to
relevant parties outside of academia, like NGOs, in reconciliation efforts with
former victims of state violence. Furthermore, research results will benefit
policy makers by providing them with scientific knowledge on the role that
judicial processes play in transitional regimes. Due to pending EU candidacy and
status as a newly emerging power in the Middle East, the findings of this
research hold particular comparative importance in analyzing the applications of
the rule of law and its extension into realms of citizenship, democracy, and
transparency. This project will also support the scientific training of a
promising early career scholar.
