This award provides partial support for the participation of early career US-
based mathematicians to attend the conference “A Panorama of Homotopy Theory”
June 5-9, 2023, in Oxford, England and the conference “Homotopy: Fruit of the
Fertile Furrow” June 12-16, 2023 in Cambridge, England. In the last decade or
more, the techniques of homotopy theory have permeated many fields of
mathematics. The aim of these two conferences is to synthesize and present these
developments. The core purpose of the project is to support the attendance and
career development of emerging scholars from the United States, both to supply
an opportunity to learn and an opportunity to present their own work. The second
week, in Cambridge, is designed to feature new voices. The support from this
award will benefit scholars from a broad selection of U.S. universities and
diverse backgrounds; the intent is to maximize the effect on workforce
development. These conferences will bring together leading experts representing
the directions of research which form the main branches of the subject: homotopy
theory in chromatic, equivariant and motivic incarnations, spectral algebraic
geometry, and interactions with mathematical physics and representation theory.
All these fields have seen major advances and changes in the last five years,
and this is the first international conference in some time that synthesizes the
major recent development. The expected attendance at these two conferences is
large, and together they are a major nexus for the international algebraic
topology community. More information on the conferences can be found at the
websites: https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topology/panorama-homotopy-theory
(Oxford) and https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/hhhw06/ (Cambridge).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
