The Electrochemical Society Symposium on GaN and SiC Power Technologies 4 will
be held in October 5-10, 2014 in Cancun, MX. The symposium will foster advances
in the leading research on various types of Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon
Carbide (SiC) devices by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and
students. There will be invited talks and contributed presentations. The
Symposium encourages graduate student participation and provides them with the
opportunity to gain exposure to new wide bandgap power semiconductor
technologies. Topics to be addressed include materials and fabrication
technology, power semiconductor switching devices, power packaging and thermal
management, reliability engineering and device, circuit modeling. The Symposium
will promote interactions between leading researchers in power device
technologies and will focus on the technical challenges of these materials and
their applications. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide
through the Electrochemical Society's Proceedings.
