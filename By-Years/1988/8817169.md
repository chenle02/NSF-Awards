This award provides partial (40%) funding to obtain and install a high-speed
computer network system in the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown
University. The University will provide a one-time contribution of 60% towards
acquisition of the necessary hardware and commits itself to support personnel
and system maintenance cost on a continuing basis. The computer network will be
used by researchers in the Department of Geological Sciences in computer-
intensive projects in tectonophysics, marine geology, paleoclimatology,
geochemistry, and planetary sciences.
