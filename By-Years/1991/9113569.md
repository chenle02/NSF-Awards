The objective of this project is to: Apply and adapt Petri net theory for
solutions to pragmatic problems in concurrent-software analysis. Specific topics
to be investigated include continued research on using Petri net techniques and
tools for Ada tasking analysis and for logic specification evaluation. A number
of techniques and problems will be considered including the implementation of
Petri net invariant techniques and study of the relationship of this technique
to the constrained expressions method.
