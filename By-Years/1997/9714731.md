The proposed experiments evaluate the mechanisms governing the balance of energy
supply to the high demands of tailshaking by the rattlesnake. Rattling is a
model system for the coordination of this energy balance over a range of body
temperatures during sustained muscle performance. The working hypothesis is that
O2 balance is sustained during rattling independent of temperature because of
two distinct design properties. First, high frequency rattling can be sustained
because the per twitch cost is minimized. This minimal cost per twitch results
from tailshaker muscle being a "high frequency - low force" muscle which
operates close to the contractile limit of striated muscle. Second, sustained
energy supply is maximized by coordinating cardiovascular and muscle O2 delivery
at the maximal sustainable level to meet the demands of high-frequency sound
production. The specific objectives are to determine whether: during rattling:
1) muscle force production is minimized, 2) cross-bridge cycling costs are
minimized, 3) similar temperature effects (Q10) result in coordination of O2
supply and oxygen consumption, and 4) heart and tailshaker are operating at
maximal sustained performance. The rattlesnake tailshaker system has several
unique attributes that make it a model system for muscle energetic studies. The
homogeneity of tailshaker muscle, the ability to sustain rattling for prolonged
periods and the high oxygen consumption evoked from the snake make the
tailshaker system ideal for discerning the design principles underlying muscle
metabolism and energetics.
