This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Analysis in
Missouri: a Midwestern symposium" that will be held September 5-8, 2019 at the
University of Missouri, Columbia. The conference focuses on recent developments
in Analysis, especially in the fields of Harmonic Analysis and Functional
Analysis and their applications. Participants in the conference have contributed
significantly to recent developments in the fields of elliptic partial
differential equations, Anderson localization, asymptotic geometric analysis,
non-commutative L^p spaces, singular integral operators and the two-weight
problem, convex geometry, and the interplay of harmonic analysis, additive
combinatorics, and combinatorial geometry. We anticipate that these topics will
be presented by the participants in plenary talks and in shorter talks. A number
of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to
attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive
to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of
different activities. More information will be made available at a url to be
established soon that will be accessible via: https://www.math.missouri.edu/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
