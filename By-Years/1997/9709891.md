The objective of this research is to develop a family of fully nonparametric
statistical methods and associated software for use in social sciences research.
These procedures require minimal modeling assumptions, possess desirable
invariance properties, will allow the analysis of all types of ordinal data
(continuous, ordered categorical, and data with ties), and will also permit the
data to be either independent or dependent (as, for example, in longitudinal
studies). The software developed will consist of SAS macros and S-plus functions
which will be made available to researchers in the social sciences through
several World-Wide-Web sites.
