The proposal is a request for support to enable young physicists to attend the
American Linear Collider Workshop. It will take place from July 13-16, 2003 at
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. The funds will be used entirely to support the
travel, lodging and registration expenses of graduate students and young
scientists who otherwise could not afford to attend the meeting.
