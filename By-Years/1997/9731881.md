This grant will support the continuation of an REU Site which was established at
Caltech in 1997 under the aegis of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) Project. The REU Site activities will focus on a ten- week
summer research program at Caltech, involving ten undergraduate students from
around the U.S. Research projects will involve mainly the physics and
engineering of the LIGO initial and advanced detectors, data analysis techniques
and software, and theoretical studies of astrophysical gravitational-wave
sources. Individual LIGO scientists and engineers will serve as student mentors,
while the overall program environment and administration will be the
responsibility of the PI. Active recruiting efforts will be aimed at a number of
target institutions in order to attract a diverse group of talented and
motivated students.
