This is a study of the reactions of atmospheric nitrogen compounds with
components of airborne sea salt, and of the chemistry of the gaseous products of
these reactions. It is designed to clarify questions of atmospheric composition
in coastal regions and of the possible impact of there reactions on tropospheric
ozone in the Arctic. Laboratory studies will be conducted to measure the
absolute kinetics of the reactions of HNO3, NO2 and N2O5 with NaCl and NaBr.
Whether these reactions continue to occur when the salts are dissolved in ice
will also be determined and compared to the reactions of HBr in ice. The
photochemistry of the newly discovered gaseous BrNO2 and the atmospherically
relevant kinetics and mechanisms of reaction of ClNO2 will also be determined.
The results of these experimental studies will then be used to quantitatively
assess the importance of these heterogeneous gas-solid reactions in the
chemistry of regional polluted areas, as well as remote areas such as the
Arctic.
