IBN: 9722220 PI: Eddins Human hearing can detect even simple sounds better when
they last longer, and this auditory temporal integration may be particularly
important in processing more complex acoustic signals such as speech. Although
psychophysical studies of acoustic perception show this integration, we know
very little about the underlying physiological mechanisms in auditory brain
centers. This project uses physiological recordings of evoked brain activity and
of responses of single nerve cells to measure the changing thresholds for signal
detection with stimulus duration, to model the contributions of different parts
of the auditory pathway, and to clarify the parallels between single neuron
activity and gross evoked-potential responses. Integral to these research aims
is the educational goal of this Career project to teach undergraduate and
graduate students basic neurophysiological research methods, by developing an
investigative laboratory course along with an interactive multimedia textbook to
accompany the course. Results will be important in neuroscience to clarify the
important issue of the physiological nature of auditory temporal processing in
the brain, and to understand processing of more complex sounds such as speech,
and also will be have an important educational impact on many students in the
speech and hearing sciences who might otherwise receive very little neuroscience
background.
