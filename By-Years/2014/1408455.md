In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the
Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Murray
Johnston of the University of Delaware is studying the chemical mechanisms by
which nanoparticles grow in the atmosphere. This project will support the work
of three graduate students. These students will be broadly trained and capable
of pursuing a career in areas such as environmental chemistry, industrial
analytical chemistry, instrumentation, nanoscience, or academia. Society will
benefit by training students who are able to predict how changes in human
activity affects climate. Professor Johnston and graduate students will also
work to increase awareness of environmental science among University of Delaware
undergraduates and the general public, by incorporating the concepts and results
of this work into formal coursework and public outreach
events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles that grow fast enough, can reach a
size where they serve as the seeds to form cloud droplets. Understanding how
these particles grow will assist the development of improved models to predict
cloud formation and its impact on climate. Current regional and global
atmospheric models are limited in their ability to predict the contribution of
carbonaceous matter to nanoparticle growth rates during new particle formation
(NPF). This knowledge gap represents the greatest remaining uncertainty for
determining the impact of NPF on today's climate and climate forcing (the
difference between pre-industrial times and now). The specific objective of the
proposed work is to elucidate chemical mechanisms of nanoparticle growth by
carbonaceous matter during NPF. The results obtained from this research will
provide a fundamental basis for developing and improving models that rely on the
prediction of nanoparticle growth by carbonaceous matter.
