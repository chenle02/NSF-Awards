This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern
California (Loma Prieta) Earthquake. The objective is to evaluate the state-of-
the-art analytical techniques for analyzing soil-pile foundation-structure
interaction during earthquake shaking, in order to improve the understanding of
this phenomenon, and to verify and calibrate existing techniques. This is
achieved by analyzing the response of a 30 story building in Emeryville,
California, using various techniques for analyzing soil-pile-structure
interaction under seismic loading. The building is a ductile moment resisting
space frame and wall structure supported by a 5 foot thick concrete mat with 900
14 by 14 inch concrete piles. It is instrumented with strong motion recording
instruments which successfully recorded the building motions during the Loma
Prieta earthquake (USGS Rep.89-568, 1989): the ground motions adjacent to the
building were also recorded. This investigation involves a collaboration with
the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
