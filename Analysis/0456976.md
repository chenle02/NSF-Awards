ABSTRACT

The principal investigator is planning to work on a variety of problems in
harmonic analysis arising in the study of multilinear and rough linear singular
integral operators. These problems are related, but not limited, to the study of
the Carleson operator and the bilinear Hilbert transform. A significant
breakthrough was made by the inspiring work of Lacey and Thiele on the bilinear
Hilbert transform. This work instigated renewed interest and activity in the
area of multilinear singular integral operators and also in the underlying tool
of study of these problems, time-frequency analysis. This method is relevant to
some of the principal investigator's work as he is planning to work on some
problems in this proposal using time-frequency analysis. These problems include
uniform bounds for the bilinear Hilbert transform in the full range of exponents
possible, the study of the disc and the corresponding maximal bilinear
multiplier, the study of the Hilbert transform along Lipschitz vector fields,
and the study ofCarleson-type operators arising in the almost everywhere
convergence of spherical partial sums of Fourier series in higher dimensions.
Recently, M. Lacey and the PI had been able to use the time-frequency analysis
to obtain an affirmative result for the Hilbert transform along $C^{1+\e}$
vector fields. And this casts a light on answering the Zygmund conjecture, which
asks if the integrals of $L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$ functions could be differentiated
in a Lipschitz choice of directions. Although the time frequency analysis works
well for multiliner singular integrals associated with a standard Carderon-
Zygmund kernel, it does not work for the nonsingular oscillatory integrals. M.
Christ, T. Tao, C. Thiele, and the PI established $L^p$ estimates for the
multilinear oscillatory integrals. The proof relies on Gowers ``quadratic
uniformity'' technique, which is a crucial concept in Gowers' proof of
Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progression of length 4. Some basic questions
concerning nonsingular multilinear operators with oscillatory factors are still
under the investigation. The differentiability of the integral of certain
functions is a very important and interesting subject in analysis. The
construction of Besicovitch set indicates that integrals of L^2 functions can
not be differentiated. The recent results obtained by M. Lacey and the PI have a
significant impact on understanding the differentiablity of $L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$
functions in a Lipschitz choice of directions, which was posed by A. Zygmund
about seventy years ago. The study of Hilbert transform along vector fields is
also relevant to the Kakeya problem. The study of multilinear operators is
related to some problems in PDE such as the Schrodinger equation
