This award funds a twelve-month planning effort to initiate technology training
and support nationally to kindergarten through high school (K-12) classroom
teachers through online video and multimedia resources through partnerships with
national classroom teachers and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, University
of California San Diego. Plans will be developed to provide online workshops
("web casts") to help teachers learn to use technology to enhance their teaching
and support their students. The workshops will be designed to cover computer
basics; web design and development; chemistry; geoinformatics; and
bioinformatics.
