Trying Science: Undergraduate Science Curriculum Reform will create new
opportunities for undergraduate students to experience scientific investigation
in real-world problem contexts. The Grand River, a local resource, will serve as
an important connecting theme and an outdoor laboratory. The proposed plan
involves a three-year curriculum reform at Lake Erie College that will impact
75% of our 700 students. Faculty from arts, sciences and education will create
new or modified science courses specifically designed for the General Education
requirement. These courses will attract non-science students and education
majors to the excitement of scientific inquiry. Students will collaborate in
active learning experiences that will encourage cross-disciplinary connections
and the practice of scientific problem-solving skills. These skills are of
particular importance to future teachers who will act as disseminating agents
for our curricular reform. Summer learning experiences will utilize the rich
local resources of science practitioners and our local natural resources to
establish connections between the campus, the community and the local
environment. In keeping with our institutional mission, new courses will address
science-based and intercultural issues in an international context. Students and
faculty will develop multimedia presentations reflecting the learning outcomes
of the new science courses. Local case studies will serve as a vehicle for
student data collection and evaluation. Students will create databases and will
share them with community agencies.
