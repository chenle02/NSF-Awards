9313122 Bazant The aim of the Workshop will be to provide a forum for an in-
depth discussion of the frontiers of research and a critical appraisal on the
current state-of-the-art and promising research directions. Recently, a great
surge of interest took place in this subject, with an exploding literature. This
increased activity has been stimulated by the needs of rebuilding national
infrastructure as well as increasing competitiveness of the U.S. industry in the
field of materials. Advances in the subject may be expected to lead to improved
high strength concrete, tougher ceramics, safer design of structures subjected
to overload such as earthquakes, design of more reliable machine parts, etc. The
symposium is expected to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue between
scientists working in structural engineering and concrete technology, materials
science, continuum mechanics and applied mechanics, and to stimulate new
developments.
