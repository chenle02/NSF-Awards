The proposed work is for research of thin silicon films on relatively low
melting point glass. Polycrystalline silicon is a semiconductor which can be
used to fabricate transistors. Low temperature (550 C) processing of polysilicon
opens up new areas of application such as electronics for large-area displays
and images. However, because the material is deposited rather than grown as a
single crystal and cut into wafers, it makes it possible to consider concepts of
multi-level three dimensional integration since lower processing temperatures
allow for compatibility between layers. CMOS circuitry will be developed and
multi-level aspects addressed for vertical integration.
