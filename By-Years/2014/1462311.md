Electricity is the lifeblood of our society; therefore providing a reliable and
efficient electricity supply is vital for ensuring human welfare and sustainable
economic growth. A pivotal need in ensuring reliable operation of the US power
grid is the development of sophisticated and robust tools for monitoring and
anomaly detection. To this end, this research project aims to develop robust and
scalable data-driven inference algorithms for detecting and isolating the
occurrence of undesirable events that could threaten the integrity of the grid.
In this regard, the combination of tools and methods on which the project will
rely, namely (i) power system reliability modeling and analysis, and (ii)
statistical signal processing and detection, and estimation theory, will result
in a unique interdisciplinary collaboration program.

The proposed framework relies on large datasets obtained with phasor
measurement units (PMUs) located across the system. By exploiting the
statistical properties of voltage phase angle measurements obtained from the
aforementioned PMUs, algorithms will be developed to detect and identify
undesirable events in power grids, e.g., outages in transmission lines and other
assets, in near real-time. Specifically, the ultimate objective of this research
is to develop a data-driven framework for real-time detection of undesirable
events in power systems that is robust and highly scalable. The framework builds
on existing powerful tools from the theory of quickest change detection (QCD),
and will provide techniques for partitioning the graph describing the
connectivity of a power system, and PMU placement to allow these QCD-based tools
to be exploited in large scale systems such as the US power grid. Additionally,
the research will explore the challenging problem of explicitly incorporating
the sparsity structure of the undesirable events in our QCD-based algorithms to
make them scaleable to multiple events.
