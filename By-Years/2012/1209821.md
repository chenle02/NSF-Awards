This action funds Justine Rebecca Garcia of Emory University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Disentangling the effect of multiple symbionts on
host development and survival," during the summer of 2012 at the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Sapporo. The host
scientist is Dr. Yoshitomo Kikuchi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a more complete investigation
of the effect of bacteria on host phenotype. Bacteria can have a significant
impact on host health, reproduction, and survival, but most studies have focused
on the effect of one bacterial species at a time though most animals are
colonized with many, possibly interacting bacterial species. Here a natural
model is being used to assess the impact of multiple, naturally occurring
bacteria on the development, survival, and reproduction of insect hosts.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
