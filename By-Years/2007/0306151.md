Over the last thirty years computer graphics research has created technology
that improves both the realism and generation speed of computer-generated
images. However, there is no widely used method for creating realistic images,
and it remains difficult in practice to create realistic images. This project
aims to develop a practical method for realistic image creation that addresses
the visual effects believed to be salient by the graphics and perception
communities. The method is intended to be robust, relatively simple, and to have
the potential to be interactive in the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ability to rapidly generate realistic images is useful in many applications. For
example, flight and driving simulators rely on realistic imagery, but the
interactive nature of these systems limits the realism that is feasible. The
proposed work should extend these limits. The proposed method would also be
useful for generating images for planning and education; images could be created
to help visualize the results of reconstruction efforts, habitat change, and
urban planning. Finally the method should be useful for generating synthetic
images for input to automated vehicles, where many different scenes and
atmospheric conditions could be generated rapidly and at low expense.&lt;br/&gt;
