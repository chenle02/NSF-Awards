In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr.
Donald Hilvert of the Scripps Clinic Research Foundation will continue to
investigate the rational design of catalysts. Reengineering existing
macromolecules using chemical or genetic techniques represents a powerful
strategy for constructing new active enzyme sites. This research project will
focus on the synthesis and study of semisynthetic selenoenzymes. This research
project is focussing on the continuation of Dr. Hilvert's successful program to
synthesize and study semisynthetic selenoenzymes. The molecular properties of
selenium makes it an excellent probe of steric and electronic factors that
influence the reactivity of oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles in proteins.
Artificial selenocysteine-containing enzymes are also useful models for
mimicking and understanding the redox chemistry of the naturally occurring
selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects mammalian cells from
oxidative damage. The value of organoselenium compounds in organic synthesis is
also being studied and a detailed investigation of the physicochemical and
structural properties of the first artificial selenoenzyme (selenosubtilisin) is
in process.
