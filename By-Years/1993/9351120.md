The Department of Engineering at Winona State University offers a Bachelor of
Engineering degree in Composite Materials Engineering. Composites are
lightweight materials which exhibit both high strength and stiffness and are
fabricated by embedding reinforcing fibers into a polymeric, ceramic, or metal
matrix. The aim of this project is to establish polymer synthesis and molecular
weight characterization capabilities which are currently absent in this program.
To achieve this objective, we are requesting the purchase of a glass reactor, a
high pressure metal reactor, two viscometers, and a high temperature gel
permeation chromatograph (GPC) unit. These instruments will be used in "hands
on" polymer and engineering laboratory instruction, and for independent faculty-
student research on synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric
materials for use as matrices in composite structures. The acquisition of this
equipment plays a critical role in the integration of synthesis laboratory
experience into the chemistry and composite materials engineering curricula.
