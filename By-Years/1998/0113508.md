This project focuses on the creation of a stochastic representation for the
phase-space embeddings of dynamical systems, for application to the task of
speech classification and recognition. The research team will develop a general
stochastic model for such signal embeddings, test the model through
classification simulations, then apply the technique to both isolated and
continuous speech recognition. The goal of the research is to discover time-
domain analysis techniques using dynamical systems methods that will lead to
improved analysis of speech signals and to improvements in speech recognition
accuracy. This approach represents the integration of two traditionally distinct
research fields: statistical signal processing and chaotic systems. Since signal
processing is fundamentally based on linear systems theory and the study of
chaos is inherently non-linear, these fields have little or no overlap outside
of the fact that both attempt to model the behavior of physical systems. This
research integrates these very different viewpoints by applying stochastic
analysis and modeling tools from the signal processing field to the problem of
analyzing embedded phase spaces obtained from chaotic systems analysis of time-
series signals. The results will lead to a significant gain in our fundamental
understanding of the characteristics and analysis of speech signals, with
potential long-term application to other areas of speech processing such as
speech coding and synthesis. The impact of developing these new technologies and
applying them to the speech recognition task extends into both the machine
learning and signal processing communities; specifically, the development of
time-domain characterization methods is directly applicable to many problems of
interest in the chaos and non-linear modeling domain, and will demonstrate an
ability to concretely measure differences between the phase-space attractors of
chaotic systems.
