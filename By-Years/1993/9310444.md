9310444 Whang This research is to study the transition of slow shocks in the
solar wind to fast shocks in interplanetary space and the non- planar magnetic
reconnection associated with 3D slow shocks. Large disturbance in the solar wind
propagate as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks through interplanetary space. Near
the corona, these shocks can be slow shocks, but most likely they appear as fast
shocks by the time they reach Earth. This study is to carry out simulations in
the physical space to verify the transition of slow shocks to fast shocks. The
study uses a compressible model for non-planar reconnection associated with
conical slow shocks. The primary objective is to understand the reconnection of
non-planar field lines associated with curved shock surfaces. The project will
systematically study solutions under different combinations of controlling
parameters to identify the quantitative relationships. ***
