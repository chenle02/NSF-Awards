In modern physics and other areas of science many problems have random
components and are modeled by equations or systems of equations that are
probabilistic. An important part of understanding the physics is knowing
whether, or under what conditions, these equations have solutions. The principal
investigator will further develop methods to study these types of equations. He
will also organize conferences and develop courses on this topic.

Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arise from extremely important
models in areas such as statistical physics, quantum field theory and fluid
mechanics. Solving these equations, including proving existence and uniqueness
of their solutions, is exceedingly difficult. This is often due to the presence
of very singular random forcing, as well as nonlinearities. Various solution
theories were established based on different approaches, the most powerful of
which is the theory of regularity structures introduced by Hairer around 2013
and further developed by the PI and a few other authors since then. This
research will apply the theory, combined with ideas from other areas such as
quantum field theory to investigate more SPDE problems. The PI will provide
solutions to new important examples of SPDEs, including equations with gauge
symmetry and the sine-Gordon equation near criticality. The PI also plans to
prove scaling limit results for these singular SPDEs. In particular the PI will
study convergence of discrete systems, such as the Glauber dynamics of
ferromagnetic systems and directed polymers in random media, to the solutions to
these SPDEs in various scaling regimes. The PI will also organize conferences
and develop courses to disseminate this research.
