9526735 Storm NSF funds will provide partial support for seven student attendees
of the 1995 Gordon Conference on Optical Information Processing and Holography.
The Conference in 1995 will stress optical memory, displays for virtual reality,
and high-speed optical data acquisition. This is an unusual conference in that
there is time for in-depth, informal, off-the-record, discussions and provides
an opportunity for the younger researchers to get to know the others. The
participants are leaders in the field, younger scientists, and students who are
doing research on the cutting edge topics of the field. ***
