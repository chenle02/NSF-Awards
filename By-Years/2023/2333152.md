This award provides partial support for two editions of the Tech Topology
Conference, beginning with the meeting at Georgia Tech in Atlanta on December
8-10, 2023, the 13th conference in the series. The conference provides an
opportunity for topologists from around the country to convene for a weekend of
talks on the latest developments in the field. The speakers, selected for the
quality of their results, their presentation skills, and their contributions to
promoting a diverse and inclusive environment, range from internationally
renowned mathematicians to rising young stars. The conference features seven
hour-long talks, complemented by three lightning talk sessions, which give
junior researchers the opportunity to give a five minute presentation on their
work. The schedule includes ample time for informal discussions amongst
participants and speakers, providing opportunities for mentorship and
collaboration. The grant will help support the travel expenses of graduate
students, early career researchers, and speakers.

This year's Tech Topology Conference will focus on low-dimensional topology and
contact/symplectic geometry. These are both very active fields of research, both
in the Southeast and beyond. The conference serves as an opportunity to bring
leading researchers to the Southeast and highlight the some of the recent
results obtained by junior researchers in the region. The conference organizer
will continue posting notes from the talks online in order to make materials
from the conference publicly available. The conference website can be found at
