The Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology (PLE), located on Pymatuning Lake in
northwest Pennsylvania, is the University of Pittsburgh's field station. PLE has
been a site of research and education in biology for 85 years. PLE's facilities
and resources have been used by educators and researchers from over three dozen
universities and colleges in the last five years, resulting in numerous
scientific publications. Due to a large recent turnover in faculty with ecology-
related research interests at the University of Pittsburgh, a near-term need for
renovation of lab space capable of accommodating new researcher groups, and a
need for the expansion of housing facilities to accommodate growth in PLE's
education mission, now is an opportune time to plan for the future of PLE.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the development of a new Master
Plan, with input from PLE's research, education, outreach and conference
stakeholders. Strategic planning activities to be undertaken include site visits
to other regional field stations and attending the annual Organization for
Biological Field Stations meeting to explore collaborations and learn from the
successes of peer field stations, hosting facilitated meetings with stakeholders
to discuss the state of each PLE mission and opportunities for their
improvement, and producing a new 10-year Master Plan to guide efforts to improve
PLE programming and facilities over the coming decade. As PLE enters a new phase
of growth that will necessitate programmatic changes, facilities renovations and
new construction, the goal of this planning process is to focus the station's
limited resources where they will produce the most impact on advancing PLE's
core missions. For more information see
