The STEM Colorado Streamline to Mastery project is a professional development
program supporting ten Master Teaching Fellows who hold masters degrees and seek
additional content-specific educational experiences. Streamline to Mastery
teachers receive salary supplements for five years while they continue to teach
full time and participate in courses such as Teaching and Learning Physics,
Teaching and Learning Biology,and Physics and Everyday Thinking at the
University of Colorado, Boulder. Streamline to Mastery teachers also participate
in (and form) a community of teachers, university STEM and education faculty,
mentor teachers, and novice teachers. This community meets regularly to discuss
content-specific instructional issues ranging from how to teach a specific topic
in physics to using mathematics and science to empower underrepresented youth.
Streamline to Mastery Teachers also participate regularly in the nationally
recognized Science Discovery program, which is an informal science education
program in Boulder that serves teachers and students in the greater Denver area.
It is anticipated that by participating in the program, these teachers will
develop expertise as teacher leaders and in teaching various subject-specific
content areas.
