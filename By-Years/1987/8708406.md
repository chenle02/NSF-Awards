Through extensive research on great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and
gorillas), Dr. Nadler has found that several aspects of their reproductive
behavior, anatomy, and physiology are predictable from the amount of competition
among males for mates. He hypothesizes that the origins of these differences are
causally related to the difference in their mating systems. Relatively few
species of nonhuman primates live in parental or family groups. Gibbons do so,
and the social organization of these lesser apes thus differs from that of the
great apes. The major aim of the present research project is to use the
monogamous gibbon to test the hypothesis derived from Dr. Nadler's research with
the polygynous great apes. Gibbons show little or no competition among males for
mates, resembling gorillas in this way. Pairs of gibbons, the natural social
unit, will be studied in large enclosures. The gibbons' behavior will be
observed in conjunction with anatomical measurements and biochemical assays of
sex hormones. Subtle behavioral changes in the female and the male will be made
more detectable by use of different types of tests, in which either the male or
the female controls physical access to the other. Research with gibbons provides
a special opportunity to assess comparatively the relevance of a monogamous
mating system to the regulation of reproductive behavior in the closest nonhuman
relatives of human beings.
