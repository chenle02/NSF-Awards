A set of four laboratory instruments is to be added to the capability of Dr.
Eden's spectroscopic laboratory. There are a diode array detector, a
turbomolecular pumping station, an ionization gage and several vacuum
components. Their purpose is to allow electronically excited diatomic molecules
to be studied in a higher energy range (VUV and electron energy) than has been
done in the past. Thus, a new class of structural and kinetics studies will be
opened to inquiry. The ability to accomplish higher vacuum levels will also
enhance the resolution of the many states involved in collisional and radiation
kinetics. The relevance of this extended area of investigation is substantial
for the development of such high energy devices as VUV lasers, switches, display
panels and diagnostics techniques in plasma reactors.
