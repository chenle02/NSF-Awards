This research is concerned with phase transitions and critical phenomena. The
principal investigator, in collaboration with D. Abraham, recently introduced
and exactly soluble model of three dimensional wetting; they plan to study some
of the remaining open problems in this random surface model including the issue
of surface roughening. Professor Newman proposes to extend his joint work on
percolation in half spaces with D. Barsky and G. Grimmett, in order to prove
continuity of the percolation transition in full spaces. He also intends to
study with C. Wu related problems in inverse square models. Professor Newman
plans to investigate the use of percolation theoretic methods, which have been
very fruitful in the study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, for the analysis
of short range spin glasses.
