In this project, the PI studies any-angle search methods. Any-angle search
methods are variants of the heuristic search method A* that interleave the
search with path optimizations by propagating information only along grid edges
(to achieve small runtimes) but without constraining the paths to grid edges (to
find short "any-angle" paths, namely paths whose headings can change by any
angle). The objective of this project is to broaden any-angle search from a few
isolated search methods to a well-understood framework and to extend its
applicability. To this end, the PI is developing new any-angle search methods
and analyzing their properties, which is complicated by the fact that even base
properties often do not transfer from A* to them. The team will also evaluate
all new and existing any-angle search methods against each other and against
alternative search methods, for example, to understand how they trade off among
runtime, path length and memory consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any-angle
search is a recent search paradigm that promises to result in a new class of
powerful path-planning methods for mobile robots, including underwater and
aerial vehicles. The project includes dissemination activities to raise
awareness of any-angle search in artificial intelligence and robotics (such as
via tutorials, open-source code and web applets) and offers research
opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students.
