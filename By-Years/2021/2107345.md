Group testing is a screening technique that relies on careful combinatorial
mixing and testing of batches of samples. By using group testing instead of
individual testing, for most problem settings of practical interest, one is
guaranteed significant savings in the number of tests performed and
consequently, significant reductions in reporting delays and experimental costs.
Group testing is especially desirable when monitoring the spread of infectious
diseases such as Covid-19, which requires frequent examinations of massive
populations. Although many ad-hoc approaches to group testing for infectious
diseases have been put forward, little work has addressed the problem of end-to-
end group-testing protocol design, which includes the selection of genetic
regions for viral/bacterial identification, mathematical modeling and analysis
of the test results and the development of guiding protocols for communal
testing strategies. The overarching goals of the project are to determine which
group-testing methods can actually mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and other
diseases and to what extent, to estimate the reduction in the number of infected
individuals achievable through the use of pooled real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) tests, and to aid in the employment of Mobile Testing Units
that can reach geographically remote regions. Other broader societal impacts
include increased readiness for fighting future pandemics and training a new
cohort of young researchers on interdisciplinary topics involving machine
learning, coding theory and bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
aims to develop specialized machine-learning, combinatorial and information-
theoretic methods for (a) identifying genomic regions with predictably low-
mutation rates that may be used as amplification primers for gold-standard real-
time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and determining best mixing strategies
based on the likelihood of infection; (b) developing adequate models for
amplification curves generated by RT-PCR and corresponding test-errors; (c)
formulating experimental-protocol-specific non-adaptive and adaptive
semiquantitative group testing schemes that account for nonbinary test outcomes;
(d) addressing the testing issues associated with high-viral load subjects and
heavy-hitter communities; and (e) integrating the mathematical techniques
developed into an agent-based model for disease spreading and control in order
to assess the potential impact of group testing and recommend effective test-
quarantine-retest strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
