ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI: E. B. Saff/M. Neamtu&lt;br/&gt;Prop:
0242875&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference `Advances in Constructive
Approximation'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is primarily for the
support of graduate students and &lt;br/&gt;recent Ph.D.'s to participate in the
international&lt;br/&gt;conference "Advances in Constructive Approximation,"
which&lt;br/&gt;will be held May 14 -17, 2003 at Vanderbilt
University.&lt;br/&gt;The general theme of the meeting concerns the
interactions&lt;br/&gt;of approximation theory with several areas of
classical,&lt;br/&gt;functional, and numerical analysis, with applications
to&lt;br/&gt;data fitting, computer-aided geometric design,
wavelets&lt;br/&gt;and signal processing. The conference is expected
to&lt;br/&gt;attract a good mix of academic, industrial, and
government&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The estimated attendance
is about 120.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
