This project is redesigning a sophomore-level electrical and computer
engineering course to increase students' intrinsic motivation for learning
technical engineering content. Motivation research has found that students learn
more when the content is linked to their career goals and when they can make
some decisions about their own learning. This project is offering students
different options for projects which will help them learn the required course
content. The investigators are collecting evaluation data which relates
students' motivation to their learning of key engineering concepts in digital
logic and computer organization. Student learning and motivation in this new
course are also being compared to a control group in a traditional engineering
course on the same topic. Graduate teaching assistants and engineering faculty
members are being trained to teach motivation-based engineering courses in other
topics as well.
