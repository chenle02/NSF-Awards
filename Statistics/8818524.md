A fellowship program entitled "On-Site Research to Advance Industrial Quality
and Productivity" is to be established, jointly sponsored by the National
Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST). The American Statistical Association will administer the program while
NIST acts as the host agency. This program is designed to bridge gaps between
quality assurance efforts in industry, academia and government through the
formation of research teams of industrial, academic, and NIST statisticians and
engineers. Possible areas of research for Fellows are statistical design of
industrial experiments, process control, studies of advanced manufacturing
systems, computing for engineering and industrial statistics, and calibration
for manufacturing process control.
