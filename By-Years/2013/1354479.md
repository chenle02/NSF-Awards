Project scientists will conduct whole-genome DNA sequencing and comparative
genomic analyses on several species of fire ants to reveal the genetic
determinants of variation in colony social organization. Fire ants are ideal
models to learn about genes that influence complex social behavior because the
biology of these pests is well known, genetic resources are available, and
strict genetic control over variation in fundamental social traits has been
documented. Project researchers will generate complete genome sequences for more
than 140 specimens of native, South American fire ants and use statistical and
comparative analyses to reconstruct the architecture and evolutionary history of
the genomic region regulating social organization.

This research will have broad implications for evolutionary biologists seeking
to understand the genetic bases of complex social behaviors. Description of a
genomic region involved in a major social innovation using the fire ant model
will advance understanding of the evolution of advanced social behavior as well
as clarify the evolutionary origin of integrated gene complexes, which underlie
such important biological phenomena as the origin of sex chromosomes and self-
incompatibility. The information to be generated is essential for an improved
understanding of the molecular basis of social life. Associated outreach and
educational activities will inform the public about the evolution of social
behavior and involve secondary school classrooms in citizen-science activities
related to the project.
