The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The proposed
technology is based on using 3D printing design technology to generate oral
therapy devices that are custom fit to the individual patient. Currently,
traditional fabrication methods for oral appliance therapy to treat OSA are
costly, and the average wait time is 3 weeks. This can lead to patient non-
compliance and/or delays in treatment of OSA. The goal is to create a device
that is more comfortable, effective, and non-invasive and provides additional
treatment options for patients with OSA. The proposed generated devices may then
be worn by patients to treat OSA through nightly wear, which may reduce the
societal impacts of sleep apnea and healthcare costs.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of point-of-care manufacturing
of devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The proposed technology is
based on advancements in additive technology to allow low-cost, custom
fabrication of digitally designed oral appliances. Oral appliance (OA) therapy
uses a device to protrude the jaw in a more anterior position during sleep to
treat obstructive sleep apnea. It may be used as an alternative to positive
airway pressure (PAP) therapy or as a combination therapy. Oral appliance
therapy has been shown to have higher compliance rates than continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP). Point-of-care manufacturing eliminates the need for
expensive manufacturing equipment or individually hand-made OA that increase
treatment costs and prevent access to care for patients. In addition, the
patient wait time for point-of-care manufactured devices may be reduced from
weeks to hours.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
