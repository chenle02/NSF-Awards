Recognizing the ever growing importance of computation and computer aids in
engineering practice, Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Chemical
Engineering is establishing an advanced computational laboratory for
undergraduate education. The laboratory is used as an instructional aid in the
teaching of all of the basic courses, such as fluid mechanics, reactor design,
and chemistry, through the graphics capability of each student station and one
large common viewscreen in the front of the laboratory. Undergraduates are
exposed to the computational laboratory from the freshman through the senior
years so as to continually develop their computer skills and become comfortable
with computers for a variety of tasks including word processing, numerical
analysis, spreadsheeting, and team (parallel) computation. The uniqueness of
this laboratory is the integration of computer methodologies into the learning
process of students over their entire educational experience, so that each
student will appreciate the range of computation from personal computers to
workstation up to the supercomputer level, and know how and when to use each
level.
