ABSTRACT CTS-9419513 Bala Subramaniam Travel of Dr. Bala Subramaniam to attend
the Sixth International Symposium on Catalyst Deactivation to be held in
Oostende, Belgium, on October 3-5, 1994. At the meeting he will report on his
work on the use of supercritical media to control coking in reforming
operations. This effort was supported initially by an Engineering Research
Initiation Grant and later by NSF's EPSCoR program and the State of Kansas
EPSCoR. This represents a successful effort for both the RIG and The EPSCoR
program and deserves to be presented before an international audience.
