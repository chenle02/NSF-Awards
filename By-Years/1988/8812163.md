The general goal of the project is to study neuronal differentiation in the
mammalian nervous system by generating markers for molecules expressed by
neurons early in their development. These markers will then be used to follow
the expression of early-expressed molecules in vivo and in vitro. The study has
two main objectives: 1) To identify antigens expressed by early postmitotic
neurons. 2) To examine the developmental regulation of the expression of
identified molecules. These experiments are designed to generate reagents with
which to identify specific cell classes and developmentally significant changes
in neurons. Such reagents could then be used to follow normal and abnormal
neural development and to test hypotheses of developmental mechanisms. The long
term goal of these experiments is to obtain a molecular description of
developmental events which could be used to assay the effects of teratogenic or
genetic insult on neural development.
