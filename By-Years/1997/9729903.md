This dissertation project explores unexamined aspects of the history of
biological determinism in the twentieth century through a focus on postwar
international conservation and its influence upon land-use planning and human
population control. International post-war conservation efforts asserted a
primary role suggesting a revised relationship between the biological and the
social sciences. Frank Fraser Darling, Julian Huxley, Fairfield Osborn, and
William Vogt claimed biology must be the arbiter of the social order if the
human species is to survive. Environmental determination of a populations's
optimum density meant that only biologists could judge what constituted a
quantitatively and qualitatively appropriate population. These four
international figures were ardent conservationists who participated in the
founding of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUNC), a
non-governmental organization recognized by UNESCO. A study of IUCN initiatives
in the 1950's will reveal much about the significance and influence of
biological and political concerns regarding reproductive limits and resource
scarcity on land-use planning and population control during the Cold War.
