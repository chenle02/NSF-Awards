As the computing industry accelerates into the many core era, it is confronted
with the need for reliable and accurate simulation, modeling and performance
prediction tools for future systems comprised of tens to hundreds of cores per
die. Due to different intellectual histories and goals, the integration of
mature existing point tools into accurate models of even small 4-8 core systems
has proven to be time consuming, error prone, and brittle, with the models
themselves taking hours to days for a single simulation run on state-of-the art
workstations. Concurrently, these effects make re-use across groups and
institutions difficult and have begun to severely inhibit research and teaching
progress in many core architectures.

The proposed program of work will create an open source many core simulation and
modeling infrastructure. This infrastructure, Manifold, will adapt techniques
for concurrent simulation to enable existing highly parallel architectures to be
harnessed to model future designs. Manifold will enable users to incorporate
existing simulation tools when they exist, as well as provide models for key
many core components and phenomena, for example interconnection networks. The
goal is a software infrastructure that is i) easily accessible to all academic
and research communities, ii) runs on commodity clusters, iii) runs on many core
laptops for classroom use, and iv) reduces barriers to entry in catalyzing new
efforts. Central to Manifolds mission is the development of curricular material
for computer architecture modeling and simulation including new courses, course
modules, training materials, and significant evangelization.
