This RUI addresses structure-property relations in a range of glasses which have
both fundamental and technical importance. The primary measurement technique is
nuclear magnetic resonance, which provides information about the bonding and
local environment of the atoms in the various glasses. The latter include alkali
borosilicates, particularly high alkali content glasses. The results bear on the
glass stability under different processing conditions. This information is of
interest in the context of technical production of glasses. A further sub-
project addresses the glass transition in the materials. The nature of the glass
transition and its structural basis remains a challenging problem in condensed
matter science. %%%
