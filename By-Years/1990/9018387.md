In this project, the P.I. will study upper ocean variability and thermohaline
circulation in the region east of the Antilles Archipelago, using data obtained
as part of the NOAA Sub-Tropical Atlantic Climate Studies (STACS) program. Data
include shipboard upper ocean currents from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers,
water density from Conductivity Temperature Depth profilers, and absolute
velocities from the PEGASUS profiler.
