Susquehanna University will purchase a fiber optics kits and components for the
construction of an optical spectrometer. This equipment will be used to improve
instruction in the upper division physical measurements laboratory. The
spectrometer will be specially designed for teaching spectroscopy. Students will
use the fiber optics equipment to gain a basic understanding of this new
technology, while the optical spectrometer will be used to instruct students in
the basic principles underlying this widely used type of instrument. Susquehanna
University will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
