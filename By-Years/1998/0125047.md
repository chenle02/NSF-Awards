The investigator and his colleagues develop an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary
training program that would give graduate&lt;br/&gt;students substantive
training in both mathematics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to produce
students competent in both disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;with genuine expertise in
applied mathematics and some specific&lt;br/&gt;area of biology: biofluids,
ecology and evolutionary biology,&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience, or physiology.
Training is built on the Special&lt;br/&gt;Interest Group, which includes
faculty members from both&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and biology, students and
postdocs, and&lt;br/&gt;industry-based researchers where appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;
Modern biology is increasingly mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational.
Education and training in components of both&lt;br/&gt;disciplines is needed to
prepare people for the 21st century&lt;br/&gt;workforce, for leading-edge
research, and for teaching. This&lt;br/&gt;pilot project includes innovative
aspects in its thematic&lt;br/&gt;organization, flexible arrangement of both
common and&lt;br/&gt;area-specific content, interdisciplinary teaming,
combination of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental training, and involvement
of&lt;br/&gt;industrial partners. The combination is promising for
fostering&lt;br/&gt;long-term changes by growing a generation of
scientists,&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, and engineers who share language and
skills well&lt;br/&gt;enough to take up and solve key problems.
