Advances in information technology have resulted in the generation of voluminous
data in every walk of life. Efficient techniques are needed to process these
data. In particular, tools are needed to extract useful information from massive
data sets. One of the objectives of the ITR Program is "extending the capability
to process, manage, and communicate information on a global scale beyond what
can be imagined today". Society at large can benefit immensely from advances in
this arena. For example, information extracted from biological data can result
in gene identification, diagnosis for diseases, drug design, etc. Market-data
information can be used for custom-designed catalogues for customers,
supermarket shelving, and so on. Weather prediction and protecting the
environment from pollution are possible with the analysis of atmospheric data.
Estimates indicate that more than 40% of online transactions are fraudulent.
Analyzing the log data can reveal information that can be used to detect
fraudulent attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state of the art in information
extraction is the use of disparate ad-hoc application-specific techniques. For
example, association-rule algorithms are used for processing market data,
Sequence-analysis techniques are employed in handling biological data,
etc.&lt;br/&gt;Unifying techniques are needed for processing data. Such unifying
information extraction techniques could benefit from and be of benefit to the
various communities that deal with massive data. Historically, communication
among these communities has been very sparse. The proposed research will examine
closely the techniques employed by these communities and to develop novel
techniques that will be applicable to all kinds of data. It is anticipated that
the new techniques will also vastly improve the individual techniques currently
employed.&lt;br/&gt;
