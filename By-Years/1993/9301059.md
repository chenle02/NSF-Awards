This a renewal award to support research previously supported under NSF Grant
No. 89- 18935 in which the investigator studied the deterioration of marble when
subjected to sulfurous and nitrogenous atmospheric pollutants, both categories
of which are produced during the combustion of fossil fuels. The objective of
this renewal project is to extend the studies of deterioration to dolomites and
limestones, building materials that are much more porous than marble. This
research is likely to lead to a better understanding than now exists of the role
played by air pollutants in accelerating the deterioration of materials and
structures that are exposed to the pollutants. This knowledge may be applied to
engineering design of structures to minimize damage from air pollutants and to
establish the economic value of pollution abatement measures in comparison with
the structural deterioration to pollutant exposures.//
