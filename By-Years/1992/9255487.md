A three-week workshop that emphasizes hands-on manipulative use of modern tools
for classroom and field activities for faculty primarily engaged in teaching
introductory geoscience courses. Topics to be considered include: the use of
spreadsheets and databases in the classroom; computer assisted construction of
illustrations, maps, and graphs; use of US Geological Survey materials such as
GLORIA, JEdI, National snow and ice data, and the Ocean Atlas; earthquake
modelling and analysis; volcanology; and, hydrologic management. A field trip to
Owens Valley for seismic analysis of the San Andreas Fault is also planned.
