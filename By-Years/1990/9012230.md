The project is aimed at the theoretical development and experimental
verification of constitutive models for porous viscoplastic materials that will
be useful in assessing the effect of porosity on localized deformation. Such
constitutive models will lead to the development of improved tools for computer
simulation of deformation processing of metallic materials.
