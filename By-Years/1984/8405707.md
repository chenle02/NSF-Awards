Support will be provided for the purchase of an induction heater, high-
temperature grips, biaxial extensometers, and signal conditioning units. They
will be added to an existing automated axial/torsion mechanical test system to
provide a high temperature test capability. This equipment will be used for
fundamental studies of the constitutive (stress-strain) behavior and failure
criteria (creep and/or fatigue) of engineering materials at elevated
temperatures.
