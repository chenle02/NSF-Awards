The U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNCTAM)
represents the U.S. mechanics community to the International Union of
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) on behalf of the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS). The national committee serves as the focal point for the U.S.
engineering, scientific, and applied mathematics communities that have common
interests in the field of mechanics. It is the national forum to define the
major issues in mechanics research, technology, and education. It also provides
a network through which the National Science Foundation(NSF) and the National
Academies enhance their capacity to contribute to global research, technology
and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The committee has both national and
international impact. Nationally, it oversees the organization of the
quadrennial National Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (NCTAM);
steer research directions in mechanics; and connects with the broader mechanics
community through its website and its members who serve as representatives of
the committee's 15 member societies. Internationally, the committee plays an
active role in two of the major IUTAM activities including the quadrennial
International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) and the
IUTAM symposia, which are small meetings (70-100 attendees) that focus on new
research topics. The committee supports U.S. involvement in these activities
through its congress fellowship program and its encouragement of symposia
proposals.
