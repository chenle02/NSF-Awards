This proposal is about interactions between Representation Theory and Number
Theory, as predicted by the conjectural Local Langlands Correspondence (LLC) for
general reductive groups. The LLC is a body of predicted relations between the
representation theory of local Galois groups and the representation theory of
reductive groups over a p-adic field. The goals of the work in this proposal are
aimed toward an explicit understanding of the LLC. There are four topics: i)
Extending the proposer's earlier work introducing Geometric Invariant Theory to
study representations of p-adic groups, in particular the recently-constructed
'epipelagic' representations. ii) Study of discrete Langlands parameters,
including proof of a conjectured inequality for adjoint Swan conductors,
atypical behavior at small primes, parameters for Yu's representations,
classification of depths and mass formulas. iii) Uniqueness results for the LLC.
iv) Jordan decomposition of depth zero representations and
LLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematics in this proposal is rooted in two
ancient topics of mathematics: Representation Theory (the study of symmetry) and
Number Theory (numerical solutions of equations). Though these appear to be two
quite different areas of mathematics, the Local Langlands Correspondence
predicts surprising relations between them. Roughly speaking, it says that
certain kinds of infinite dimensional symmetries should correspond to certain
equations whose solutions have a related collection of finite dimensional
symmetries. The aims of the proposal are first, to discover and explicitly
verify new and interesting examples of the LLC, and second, to use the
predictions of the LLC to make new discoveries in Number Theory and
Representation Theory.
