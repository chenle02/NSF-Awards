The focus of this work is the preparation of benzopyranones, benzothiopyranones,
benzoquinolines and benzacridines, compounds with potential for intramolecular
proton transfer in the electronic excited state. Many of the proposed target
molecules have potential as radiation scintillators, luminescent solar
concentrators and laser dyes. The students working on the project will have the
experience of conducting organic synthesis and carrying out steady-state and
time-resolved spectroscopic studies on many of the compounds prepared. With this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Drs. Charles F. Beam and Shannon S.
Martinez of the Department of Chemistry at the College of Charleston. Work will
focus on the preparation and photophysical study of heterocyclic compounds with
the goal of understanding intramolecular proton transfer in the electronic
excited state. The research will serve to enhance the education of a number of
undergraduate participants
