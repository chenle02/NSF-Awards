This project will use a software toolkit developed at CERN and referred to as
GEANT4. The GEANT4 software will be applied to the interaction of neutrons with
the atmosphere. The interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere generates
albedo neutrons. The atmospheric response as a function of input cosmic ray
energy and composition will be determined. The response function will then be
convolved with the cosmic ray energy spectrum, which has a solar cycle
dependence, to obtain the albedo neutron flux as a function of time. The decay
of the albedo neutrons produces the proton content of the Earth's inner
radiation belt. The neutron flux can therefore be converted to a model of the
energy and density of the protons in the inner belt. The model results will be
compared with proton data obtained by the AMPEX satellite over the most recent
solar cycle. Agreement between the model and the data will validate the GEANT4
toolkit as a framework for further space weather modeling of the inner radiation
belt.
