This project aims to extend the Soar architecture to include episodic and
reinforcement learning. Although Soar is a mature and widely known cognitive
architecture, the extensions will enhance Soar by providing it an episodic
memory of prior events that can improve future decision making and the ability
to improve its behavior in response to rewards. This research will explore
possible synergies between these learning mechanisms including using
reinforcement learning for learning memory encoding and recall strategies, using
internal episode-based models to boost reinforcement learning and using a model
of emotions for affecting learning rates. Given that episodic memory is an
important aspect of human cognition, this project will also strengthen Soar as a
cognitive model. Besides building on on-going work on Soar, this project will
build on results from closely allied fields such as Case-Based
Reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;
