This award is for renewal of a summer REU program held at the Wadsworth Center
of the New York State Department of Health in Albany, NY. The research
scientists who supervise the students in this program are also faculty in the
Department of Biomedical Sciences (BMS) of the University at Albany's School of
Public Health. The Wadsworth Center is a unique scientific institution with
state-of-the-art facilities, in which basic research programs have developed
alongside service-oriented public health laboratories. The research interests of
the participating BMS faculty cover a broad range, with emphasis in molecular
genetics, cell biology and structural biology. Ten undergraduate students
interested in research careers are recruited from institutions with limited
research opportunities for undergraduates, including small colleges across the
U.S. and historically Black colleges in the South. Additional students
participate in the program with stipend support from the Wadsworth Center.
Laboratory projects in basic biological research topics are chosen that are
likely to engage students' interest, yield results within the timeframe of the
program, and allow for some degree of student development and independence.
Group meetings are held on an approximately weekly basis to discuss science- and
career-related issues (including the proper conduct of science), to hear
lectures by visiting scientists, and to monitor student progress. The students
give short oral presentations of their work in a symposium in the last week of
the program, and also submit written reports before they leave, to stress the
importance of communication skills within science. The program mutually benefits
both the students, who gain experience conducting academic style research, and
the scientists at the Wadsworth Center, whose research measurably benefits from
the efforts of these students.
