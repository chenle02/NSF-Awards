A bold, new, integrated, first-year engineering curriculum is being developed.
Students are being prepared by a curriculm which both develops relationships
among concepts and demands that students develop effective problem-solving
methods. By relating the many topics in a first-year curriculum through broad,
unifying concepts, students are building clear, effective mental pictures of the
physical world. Powerful workstations strengthen students' abilities to apply
physical laws by minimizing manual data and symbolic manipulation. Students'
abilities to analyze and synthesize are nurtured by applying widely applicable
search heuristics throughout the curriculum. The new curriculum has three goals:
1) infuse broad concepts, 2) improve techniques, and 3) cultivate effective and
efficient search heuristics. The grantee is providing funds for this project
that are greater than the award.
