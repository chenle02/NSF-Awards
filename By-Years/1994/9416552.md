9416552 Kutzko This Americas Program award will support a collaboration between
Dr. Philip Kutzko, University of Iowa, and Dr. Jorge Soto Andrade, Universidad
de Chile, on the local aspects of the Langlands program. The researchers will
explore the connection, via compact induction, between theta correspondences for
groups over finite fields and theta correspondences for groups over local fields
to try to determine to what extent these correspondences are functorial in the
sense of Langlands. Determination of such functoriality is of substantial
number-theoretic interest. The proposed work is likely to lead to a detailed
analysis of the local aspects of the Langlands program, which experience has
shown is necessary for a real breakthrough in this area. In addition, by working
with the different groups in Chile, the collaboration will broaden and
strengthen joint work in an important mathematical area. ***
