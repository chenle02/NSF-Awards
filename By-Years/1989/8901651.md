They will study nonlinear phenomena (NP) (e.g., bifurcations of chaos) in solids
within the framework of the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems.
Experiments will be performed at far-infrared and radio frequencies. A series of
different-sized quantum wells will be driven with far-infrared (FIR) laser
radiation. NP will be studied in the classical (large well) and quantum (small
well) limits. Bifurcations, chaos and coupling between the FIR mode and the
pinned charge-density-wave mode will be studied in the response of these
materials to FIR laser radiation. Avalanche-depinning, chaos, and an apparent
self- organization from many- to few-degree-of-freedom dynamics will be studied.
These projects should extend the understanding of NP beyond classical systems
with few degrees of freedom and provide valuable insights into the physics of
solids.
