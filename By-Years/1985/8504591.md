The objective of this research is to predict the fracture behavior of a fiber
reinforced composite laminate containing cracks and debonding. The stress lag
theory will be used to represent the stress-displacement relationships and the
failure will be investigated by using a micromechanics strength theory. The
failure predictions will be verified with appropriate data from laboratory
experiments. The results of this research will have the potential to improve the
understanding of the failure behavior of several similar composite systems.
