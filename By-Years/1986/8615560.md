This proposal is to conduct a comprehensive research effort on the analysis and
design of production systems. The research will focus on the coordinated
development of algorithms and mathematical models, general purpose computer
modular software, a hardware simulator, and the integration of these elements
into an overall design tool for production systems. Capacity, configuration, and
operation-control design issues will be addressed by the design tool. The work
will include complete algorithmic development documentation and a prototype
implementation tested and validated on real data. Two universities will
collaborate on this work. The product of this research will provide solid
foundations for the subsequent commercial development of production-grade design
tools suitable for direct industrial applications. This should result in
increased productivity.
