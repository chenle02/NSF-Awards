ABSTRACT OPP-9702004 OPP-9701840 STAMNES, KNUT LUBIN, DAN UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO OPP-9703565 BORYS, RANDOLPH UNIVERSITY OF
NEVADA This research project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-
investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The
research program will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice
pack. These investigators will measure near-surface atmospheric conditions of
the region from the cloud base to the surface of the permanent ice cap of the
Arctic Ocean using an instumented research balloon during a period from Spring
to Fall. The research will be conducted in conjunction with a DOE Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement research program jointly conducted at the site. These
researchers will determine the vertical profile of temperature and humidity as a
function of changing cloud conditions. Their results will help determine how
atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These
measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by
the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to
seasonal variations in climate, especially changing cloud conditions. The
balloon measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of
researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of
instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above, as well as ice and ocean
property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of
measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate and
the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could
occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
