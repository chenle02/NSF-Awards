A precise three-dimensional chemical structure is generally essential for the
function of a protein in the cell. Although ribosomal synthesis generally
insures the production of an exact sequence of amino acid residues, such
structures are not chemically stable over time. A number of spontaneous
processes that occur under physiological conditions, including oxidation,
glycation, isomerization, racemization, and deamidation reactions, lead to the
alteration, and in some cases, the inactivation of proteins. Asparaginyl and
aspartyl residues represent two of the major sites for such reactions in
proteins, where intermediate succinimide formation results in the accumulation
of L- and D-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl derivatives. The studies to be performed
here are directed at understanding the spontaneous reactions that lead to these
altered residues. The goals include the development and testing of models for
the succinimide formation in proteins and the analysis of their racemized,
deamidated, and isomerized products. By examining known structures of proteins,
especially those from thermophilic organisms, The PI hopes to learn how specific
folding patterns may decrease the succinimide formation. This should ultimately
lead to an understanding of how the accumulation of these derivatives can affect
protein structure and how the organism may recognize these altered proteins and
catalyze their removal from the cell.
