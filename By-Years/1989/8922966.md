Knowledge of the origin of the Primate Order is an important consideration in
Biological Anthropology. In a cladistic analysis this is best equated with
knowing the "sister group" of the Order Primates. The sister taxon of primates
remains unidentified despite numerous analyses based on gross anatomy and
biochemistry. Most studies have pointed to scandentians (tree shrews),
dermopterans (flying lemurs), or chiropterans (bats) as likely candidates.
Recent investigations of structural variation in tooth enamel have provided
insights into the phylogeny of several mammalian groups. In this manner, this
study will analyze the tooth enamel of primates, tree shrews, flying lemurs, and
bats in order to develop a novel data base to be used in a phylogenetic
assessment of primate higher-level relationships. Developmental and functional
components of enamel structure will be identified. Analysis of the elements
relevant to higher-level phylogeny will provide a perspective on primate ordinal
level relationships that is independent of previous interpretations based on
osteological, gross anatomical and molecular data bases. This will help in the
better understanding of the origin of the Primate Order.
