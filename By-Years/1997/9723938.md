PI: Schneider, J. IBN-9723938 Many people overeat and gain too much weight,
while other people eat too little and experience serious problems such as
malnutrition and infertility. Leptin is a newly discovered protein that is
naturally made and secreted by body fat cells, and is thought to play a role in
the regulation of eating, body weight and fertility. This proposal is designed
to understand how leptin influences eating, body weight and reproduction. We
will study Syrian hamsters because, unlike other animals, they have a reliable,
4-day ovulatory (estrous) cycle that is very sensitive to leptin treatment, a
short period of fasting, and increased exercise. We will look for clues as to
where in the body and by what mechanism leptin affects body weight, eating and
estrous cycles. For example, in order to find where leptin acts, we will compare
the effects of leptin injected into the body to effects when leptin treatment is
restricted to a small area of the brain. Some of the effects we will examine
will be body weight, food intake and length of the estrous cycle. We will also
treat hamsters with leptin and determine which parts of the brain become active.
In addition, we will determine whether particular parts of the brain are
critical for leptin's effects by examining the effects of leptin in hamsters
with small lesions of these exact brain areas. Knowledge of leptin's mechanism
and site of action may provide important clues to how body weight, eating and
fertility are regulated as well as how to treat obesity or anorexia nervosa.
This work may have more general importance for understanding a variety of
behavioral problems that involve effects of metabolism on the nervous system.
