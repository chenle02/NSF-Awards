The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE; www.dlese.org) provides
access to over 6000 resources of potential use for teaching and learning about
the Earth and environment. The PI will enhance the value of this collection by
providing review and annotation information about DLESE resources, so that
resource creators can improve their resources, educators can strengthen their
relevant pedagogical expertise, and all users can build on the experience of
their peers in selecting and deploying resources. This will be accomplished by
scaling up the DLESE Community Review System and developing an annotation
service for related pedagogical resources. The existing DLESE Community Review
System (CRS; crs.dlese.org) gathers, aggregates, and disseminates web-based
feedback from people who have used DLESE resources to teach or learn. We propose
to scale up the CRS by: (a) embedding an emphasis on the value of pooling
pedagogical insights via the CRS throughout DLESE s outreach message, (b)
opening CRS review to all instructionally-oriented resources in the DLESE
collection, (c) soliciting reviews by email from registered members of the DLESE
community whenever a new resource becomes available for Review that matches
their interest profile, and (d) generating individualized summary reports for
instructors by aggregating learners reviews from their own students. The goal is
to reach the point where regular DLESE users habitually check out the CRS
annotations before choosing or using a new learning resource, and habitually
feed their experiences and expertise back to the community after using a DLESE
resource.
