This project addresses the implementation, using Very Large Scale Integration
(VLSI) technology, of an extremely high-speed, low-cost parallel processing
system for display and processing of three- dimensional surfaces. There exist a
large number of applications for computing systems capable of rapidly displaying
three-dimensional data and/or recognizing, processing and creating three-
dimensional patterns. The computational engine developed by this work is an
essential component of these systems and greatly impacts the development of
inexpensive, competitive products for these applications. The authors have a
patented processor architecture and analyze various design trade-offs to allow
an optimum VLSI implementation. In addition, they also study the choice of host
computer and solutions to data Input/Output problems.
