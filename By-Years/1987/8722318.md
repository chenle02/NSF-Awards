This award will provide partial support for the 1988 Aspen Winter Conference on
Elementary Particle Physics. This year, the Conference topics will include: (A)
new experimental results on the violation of combined charge-conjugation-space
inversion symmetry in the decay of neutral K mesons; (B) the observation and
consequences of transitions between neutral anti-B and B mesons; (C) neutrinos
from the 1987 supernova; and (D) results from recently started experiments at
Fermilab and the Stanford Linear Collider. These results represents new advances
in our knowledge of the structure of matter and of fundamental forces in nature.
This Conference will play an important role in the dissemination of new ideas
and results in elementary particle physics to both U.S. and foreign physicists,
including younger scientists who may receive support from the Aspen Center in
order to attend.
