The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) have been widely
accepted as a foundation for mathematics; virtually all branches of mathematics
that have been studied and applied to other scientific fields can be interpreted
in ZFC. However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical
theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs)
are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is GÃ¶del's
program in Set Theory. If an LCA is "correct," then the theories it decides are
also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model
Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by
constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the
canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a
correct theory). This project contributes to the Inner Model Program by
advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various
extensions of ZFC. The educational component includes annual conferences,
curriculum development, and outreach and broadening participation activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project fits into the general framework of studying
the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as
hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and
strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The
problem of building a canonical inner model for an LCA is referred to as the
Inner Model Problem for that LCA. One of the project's main goals is to identify
certain obstructions that may prevent the current approaches to resolving the
Inner Model Problem for various LCAs from going further as well as proposing
ways of overcoming them. Specifically, the project will study obstacles to the
current techniques of the Core Model Induction (one such obstacle is the Sealing
of the Universally Baire Sets) and develop new approaches to the Core Model
Induction that overcome these obstacles. One main application of the above
analyses is in constructing canonical inner models of large cardinals from
various strong extensions of ZFC, like the Proper Forcing
Axiom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
