The research component of this project is designed to develop an
interdisciplinary approach to creating geologic hazards potential maps in areas
at high risk for slope failure. The study will integrate geological
observations, geotechnical materials testing, and geographic information systems
(GIC) analysis of major paleo- landslides within the Huntsville, Alabama city
limits. Concerns about the potential for catastrophic slope failures in this and
other parts of the southeastern US has been heightened by recent delineation of
a belt of active seismicity in Eastern Tennessee. Meaningful analysis of the
potential risks will require both the short-term, pragmatic considerations of
geotechnical engineering and longer-term geologic understanding of natural
systems. The interactive activities will promote dialogue between geologists and
geological engineers. Activities include supervision of Earth- systems based
geology laboratory, already successfully implemented at the investigator's home
institution; leading a graduate course on pedagogical strategies for geology
teaching assistants; and conducting a graduate seminar on a topic of mutual
interest to geologists and geological engineers.
