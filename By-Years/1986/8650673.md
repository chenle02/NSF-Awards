Saint John's University will purchase a germanium gamma ray detector, associated
nuclear instrumentation electronics and a multi-channel analyzer, and an active-
passive shield in order to conduct high resolution, low background spectroscopy
experiments. The requested equipment, when combined with current Physics and
Biology Department instruments, will provide a complete nuclear detection
facility. The new systems will increase the resolution of the department's
spectroscopy equipment to the level of present charged particle systems, thus
enabling students to (a) see modern nuclear detection techniques in introductory
physics and radiation biology courses, (b) do meaningful laboratory experiments
at the intermediate through advanced levels, and (c) do higher quality nuclear
physics-related senior thesis projects. The new equipment will free the present
gamma spectroscopy system for wider use in the introductory and intermediate
labs. It will help revitalize and expand the use of some current equipment such
as a neutron generator and PDP11/73 minicomputer. Several new experiments are
planned to familiarize students with the principles of high sensitivity
spectroscopy.
