0323293&lt;br/&gt;Knapp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this grant will
provide for the acquisition of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system for
geoscience research and teaching at the University of South Carolina (USC). This
project is collaborative with another such request from Coastal Carolina
University (CCU; EAR-0323338). Together, the funds will provide for two
different but complementary GPR systems for local and regional geoscience
research and education projects that require high resolution imaging of the near
subsurface. The equipment will provide for hands educational experiences for
undergraduates at CCU and both undergraduate and graduates students at USC and
the two-unit pool will be available for sharing by either institutional faculty
members when not otherwise subscribed. The instruments will support a range of
basic research by early career faculty at these two institutions including
studies in barrier beach evolution and dynamics, geoarchaeology and
paleontology, paleoseismology and environmental geology.
