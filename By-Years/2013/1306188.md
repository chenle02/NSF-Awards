Influence of Redox Environment on the Self-Assembly of Cephalopod Proteins
Cephalopods can alter their skin's coloration, pattern, texture, and
reflectivity to communicate with other members of their species and to blend
into their environment. These remarkable abilities are conferred by specialized
cells known as iridophores, which contain optically active platelets from unique
structural proteins. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that govern the
organization and assembly of these platelets remain poorly understood. The
proposed work will explore the influence of the redox environment and amino acid
sequence on the self-assembly of cephalopod proteins into nano- and micro-scale
aggregates, which will be characterized via physical techniques. Such studies
will simultaneously provide fundamental insight into structural coloration and
the camouflage capabilities of cephalopods.

Part of this research effort will establish a Biomaterials Self-Assembly Summer
School (BMSS). This school will specifically enhance the research and education
infrastructure available to high school and undergraduate students from STEM
underrepresented groups. BMSS will include teaching, training and learning in an
interdisciplinary setting, while simultaneously providing students with access
to unique facilities, instrumentation, and resources. The education efforts will
be broadly disseminated through press releases and a web site designed for the
general populace. The proposed outreach plan will potentially establish a new
strategy for experiential learning at the interface of biology and the physical
sciences.
