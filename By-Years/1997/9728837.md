ABSTRACT OPP-9728825 OPP-978837 MAYKUT, GARY McPHEE, MILES UNIVERSITY OF
WASHINGTON McPHEE RESEARCH The project will utilize a U.S. Navy submarine to
conduct a larger-scale study of the solar heat flux affecting the melting of sea
ice in the Arctic Ocean than has been possible previously. This study extends
earlier studies by the investigators that show large seasonal differences in
heat flux at single measurement locations. Those studies did not provide the
opportunity to extend the single-point measurements over a large region;
therefore, large-scale and seasonal patterns of variability in the Arctic Ocean
are unknown. The variability is important because compiler simulations of the
climate must represent a large-scale (Arctic Basin) value of heat flux and may
be seriously in error if the single-point measurements are not representative of
the regional value. The submarine will provide the opportunity to extend the
point measurements over a larger region and assess more variables in the heat
flux measurement than currently possible. The study is one component of a larger
project, Surface HEat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA), that is examining the
role of global change on the Arctic Ocean sea ice cover. The extension of the
SHEBA site measurements to a large region of the Arctic Ocean using the
submersible will allow calibration of the site measurements to the regional
scale, and provide a basis for a regional-scale interpretation of SHEBA
measurements on a full annual cycle. This project will lead to improved regional
and global circulation models that are used to predict the impact of global
climate change on the permanence of the Arctic Ocean ice pack.
