9502121 Liang This project is on research to further the technological
development of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques. It is
aimed at optimizing the data acquisition and processing methods so as to provide
sufficient spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and signal-to-noise for the
study of complex brain functions. Specifically, this research will seek to
develop two novel methods: one for three-dimensional continuous imaging and the
other for high- resolution metabolic imaging. ***
