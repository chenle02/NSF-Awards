SES-0954791&lt;br/&gt;David E. Willer&lt;br/&gt;University of South
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tests theory that places three
contrasting actors: an individualist, prosocial, and competitor in the positions
of two exchange networks. Individualists are actors who rationally seek to
maximize payoffs only to self. Prosocials are equally rational but seek to
maximize payoffs to self and other(s) while minimizing payoff differences.
Competitors are also rational actors, but they seek to maximize the difference
between payoffs to self and to other(s). Placing all combinations of the three
actors in dyads and three-actor power structures generates highly contrasting
predictions for interaction processes and outcomes. This research will
experimentally test those predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:
The broader impact of this research is that if the theory of this proposal is
supported, it will reject exchange theory's justification for using only the
individualist actor and thereby call for a wide-ranging change in the way that
exchange theory is formulated in sociology, game theory and economics.
