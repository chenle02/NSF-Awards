Granite-greenstone belts in the Canadian shield are tran- sected by Archean
shear zones and by younger more brittle strike- slip fault systems. Over wide
areas, the Archean shear zones are now exposed at a structural level
representing the base of the seismogenic zone (brittle-ductile transition) when
the shear zones were active. Vein systems are concentrate where fluid pressures
apparently intermittently attained supralithostatic values. These localized vein
systems may represent fossil rupture nucleation sites for large earthquakes
initiated by rapid upwards release of pressure. This project will map structural
features in surface and subsurface exposures in two locations - yellow-knife NWT
and Val d'Or mining district of Quebec. Laboratory work will include petrography
and fluid inclusion analysis of the hydrothermal veins and associated wall rock.
Results, while aimed primarily towards fundamental fault mechanics should also
be applicable to improved understanding of mineralization processes in deep
fault zones.
