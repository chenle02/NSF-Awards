The Space Science Institute, in collaboration with the Catawba Science Center
(North Carolina), the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the
American Library Association, and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific
propose to develop a multi-pronged project on the topic of asteroids. Content
areas will include: Asteroids ? Up-close and Personal; Deep Impact; and
Planetary Protection.

Deliverables will include a 2,500 square-foot traveling exhibit for small to
mid-sized museums; four, 300 square-foot ?small exhibit components? (SECs) for
libraries, community centers, etc.; Web 2.0 sites for the project developers and
for the public; public education programs; professional development programs for
informal STEM professionals; and a study of how Web 2.0 can be used to improve
the evaluation of Web sites. The project team will be experimenting with virtual
prototyping of exhibit modules as a way to improve exhibit development,
especially with team members who are around the country.

Teens from around the country will be enlisted to help inform the project on its
deliverables. The Association of Science-Technology Centers will manage the
exhibit tour. The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the evaluation
activities, including the study of Web 2.0 and virtual prototyping tasks.
