This project is seamlessly integrating telescopes equipped with remote access
and control capabilities into one virtual observatory. Building on the current
Telescopes in Education (TIE) effort that involves some twenty such telescopes,
Virtual TIE is providing the services required to operate this facility,
including a scheduling service, tools for data manipulation, an online proposal
review environment, an online "Virtual TIE Student Astrophysical Journal" for
publication of results, and access to related educational materials provided by
the TIE community. This effort leverages ongoing projects of the collaborators
to increase access to astronomy education at the K-12 and undergraduate levels,
especially among traditionally under-served communities. Results of this effort
are also being used to enhance ongoing educational efforts in astronomy and
computer science. This project represents a collaborative effort among the
University of Maryland Baltimore County, Tennessee State University, the
Telescopes in Education Foundation, Raytheon ITSS, and NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center. Other partners include the National University of Ireland, Maynooth,
Rochester Institute of Technology, and TIE project affiliates at Little Thompson
Observatory and Howard University.
