This award supports travel to the Third International Conference on Mathematical
Population Dynamics, which will be held at the University of Pau, France, on
June 1 - 5, 1992. The focus of this conference is the mathematical modeling of
heterogeneouls biological populations. The aim of the conference is to provide
an interdisciplinary international forum for an exchange of views and
experiences between biologists working on real life data and matematicians
developing and analyzing model equations.
