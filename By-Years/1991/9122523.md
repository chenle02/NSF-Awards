This project provides partial support for the secretariat of the Council of
Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP). COMNAP provides for the
exchange of information and reports, as well as periodic meetings and workshops
among those nations active in the Antarctic. By facilitating this interaction,
COMNAP makes a significant contribution to the effectiveness of support for
research programs in the Antarctic, which address a wide range of polar and
global problems. Typical activities include developing uniform guidelines for
environmental documentation and air safety, as well as general meetings were
managers can address lessons learned and upcoming problems within the community
of countries working in the Antarctic.
