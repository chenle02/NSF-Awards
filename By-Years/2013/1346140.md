This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project entitled ?High
Efficiency Robocasting for Ceramic Product Application? is intended to improve a
unique additive manufacturing process called robocasting for the large-scale
production of next-generation ceramic catalyst supports useful to automotive and
clean-energy-generation industries. In particular, large advanced ceramic
catalyst supports could be an enabling technology for the efficient conversion
of natural gas into clean fuels. Currently, robocasting can be used to fabricate
advanced catalyst supports with intricate geometries however; the technology has
been limited to relatively small components because of problems associated with
cracking after fabrication. This project will combine advanced ceramic
processing methods with microwave-assisted drying and sintering technology to
competitively manufacture industrial-sized ceramic catalyst supports with
improved performance. Research will be completed to reduce limitations due to
cracking, reduce energy consumption, and improve automation with the result
being a new market for an advanced technology that will be cost competitive
throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project has implications for:&lt;br/&gt;1) the scientific
understanding of optimized catalyst supports for clean-energy applications to
help meet demands for tighter environmental controls on automotive and plant
emissions;&lt;br/&gt;2) the utilization of microwave technology for energy
savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in industrial
manufacturing;&lt;br/&gt;3) the creation of manufacturing and STEM-related jobs
on US soil; and&lt;br/&gt;4) the advancement of additive manufacturing
technology to keep the US a step ahead of foreign competition.
