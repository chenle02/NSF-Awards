Due to the ubiquity of software and the increasingly disruptive nature of
program bugs, techniques for guaranteeing software reliability are more
important now than ever before. This project studies program verification
techniques that achieve the right trade-off between expressiveness and
automation, thereby allowing the verification of a diverse class of software.
The key idea is to use abductive reasoning to automate the correctness proof as
much as possible by automatically synthesizing lemmas needed in a compositional
proof. Another key idea is to automatically diagnose failed proof attempts and
provide constructive feedback to users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of the project is to enable mostly-automated, user-friendly verification of
interesting properties that are too hard to prove using traditional deductive
verifiers but beyond the reach of fully-automated program analyzers. Another
important goal is to uncover deeper and more subtle software defects than those
that can be identified using testing and program analysis technology today.
