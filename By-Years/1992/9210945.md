Wolpert The objective of this research is to recreate the function of a network
of biological neurons using a VLSI-based neuronal analog, of neuromime. By
reconstructing a well-documented network of biological neurons and comparing the
signal patterns resident in the artificial network with those of the biological
network, the hardware and sorfware of the network may be related to one another.
This is being carried out in five iterations of modify, design, and test. In
each iteration, a nominal neuromime is augmented with discrete components to
match the characteristics of each of nine biological counterparts. These changes
are then incorporated into the nominal chip, submitted for fabrication, and
subsequently tested.
