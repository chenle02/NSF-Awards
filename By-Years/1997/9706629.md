9706629 Duke This project will examine potential applications of spectroscopic
methods to supplement traditional methods of field mapping to extend the results
of modern laboratory analysis to regional-scale, high-spatial-resolution maps of
metamorphic terranes. It is proposed that spectroscopic methods can be used to
produce maps of mineral distribution, maps of relative or absolute mineral
abundance, and amaps of chemical variation. Tasks include: (1) forward modeling
of simple metamorphic reactions using library mineral spectra to evaluate the
spectral response of metamorphic processes, (2) inverse modeling of spectra of
synthetic mixtures and natural rocks to evaluate and improve the accuracy of
spectral decomposition methods for estimating mineral abundance, (3) correlation
of mineral-chemical variations with spectral adsorption band shifts to evaluate
the sensitivity of spectroscopy, (4) conduct new field studies to test results
of tasks 1-3, (5) evaluate the applicability of spectroscopic methods to low-
grade metamorphism through analysis of synthetic mixtures, natural samples, and
field studies and (6) convolve model and real rock spectra to spectral
resolutions of current and planned remote sensing spectrometers to evaluate the
sensitivity of different sensors to metamorphic processes. The greatest impact
of this research will be to develop the framework for integrating these new
techniques into the study of metamorphic processes.
