The electronic hand-held calculator is a tool that can be used as an integral
part of the elementary school mathematics curriculum. With calculators so
abundant and inexpensive, each child should be able to have a calculator for
appropriate use in mathematics and in other subjects where mathematics can be
applied. Although some materials are available that support the use of the
calculator in the elementary school, there exists currently no coherent set of
materials that looks at the curriculum in a new light, assuming that the
calculator is an essential tool to be used in learning and doing mathematics.
This project will develop a model for change in the K-6 mathematics curriculum,
based on the assumption that every child has a calculator. Anticipated changes
include diminishing time spent on certain topics (such as long division) and
increasing time spent on other topics (such as problem solving and reasoning).
The project will develop a set of calculator-based student materials for Grades
K-6 designed to be flexible enough to stand alone or be supplementary; a set of
teacher materials that will include a guide for teaching mathematics using
calculators and student evaluation materials with protocols for evaluating
student work when engaged in activities such as problem solving; and materials
on the use of calculators in an elementary setting, to be used in the preservice
preparation of teachers. The project will be a collaborative effort of the
California State University at Fulleraton and the Los Angeles Unified School
District. One of the goals of the project is to create a replicable model for
university-school district cooperation in curriculum development and teacher
education.
