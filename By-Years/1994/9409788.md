9409788 Wang In the applications of Markov chains, certain limiting properties
are often of interest, such as the convergence rate and the behavior of the
limiting distributions. The most general condition of Markov chains related to
the above properties is associated with Harris recurrence, which requires the
Markov chain returning to every set of positive measure infinitely often, with
probability 1. The properties of Harris recurrent Markov chains are well
studied. However, there are examples of common Markov chains (e.g., some simple
auto-regressive models) which are not Harris recurrent. It appears that Harris
recurrence is a strong condition. A.V. Skorokhod suggests another type of
recurrence --- topological recurrence. Topological recurrence requires the
Markov chain returning to every open set infinitely often with probability 1.
Topological recurrence is essentially weaker and more natural than Harris
recurrence. Skorokhod's work should have impact in a lot of applications. But so
far, this result is still a heoretical advance only. Further understanding of
topological recurrence should give us insight into the essence of convergence of
Markov chains. The proposed work here is to make a preliminary study of further
applications of topological recurrence. ***
