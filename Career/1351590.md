The PI intends to study a model for cluster algebras in terms of certain tensor
diagrams called webs. This model relates to higher Techmuller theory,
specifically to representations of fundamental groups of Riemann surfaces inside
special linear group of a three dimensional vector space. This class of cluster
algebras allows one to have a conjectured purely combinatorial model for some
cluster algebras of infinite mutation type. The PI also intends to study a
generalization of cluster algebras called Laurent phenomenon algebras. In it,
the exchange polynomials do not necessarily have to be binomial. The examples of
such structures appear for example in the study of electrical networks, and in
the study of hyperbolic metrics on non-orientable surfaces.

The proposed project is rooted in two areas of mathematics: representation
theory and combinatorics. Representation theory is an important area that is
fundamental for the study of quantum mechanics and particle physics. Cluster
algebras provide a new approach to representation theory and related
disciplines, and have found their application in string theory and quantum
gravity. The PI's research focuses on cluster algebras that lie just beyond the
current frontier of our understanding (the so called infinite mutation type).
Another part of the proposed research focuses on a generalization of cluster
algebras, called Laurent phenomenon algebras. The educational part of the
proposal pertains to creating a summer undergraduate research program (URE) for
international students which would run parallel to the already existing summer
REU in combinatorics at University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.
