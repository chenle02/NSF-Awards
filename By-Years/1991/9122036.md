Professor Farley will study the high resolution laser spectroscopy of negative
molecular ions. Rare species of ions, normally difficult to produce in
sufficient density to study, will be measured using a coaxial ion- and laser-
beam spectrometer placed at the center of an optical buildup cavity.
Photofragmentation and autodetachment of the negative ions as a function of
optical excitation will lead to basic understanding of the electron-nuclear
coupling processes in negatively charged molecular species.
