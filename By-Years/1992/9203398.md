The principal investigators will continue their work in differential geometry,
hermitian geometry, and differential topology. In particular, they will study
volume-minimizing cycles in Grassmann manifolds, fibrations of spheres by great
spheres, stratified spaces, Einstein metrics and symplectic geometry. This award
will continue support for one of the strongest programs in differential geometry
in the country. In addition to their research, the principal investigators will
be expected to continue making a strong contribution to education at the
graduate and undergraduate level as well as their work with high school teachers
and students. This award will support research in the general area of
differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of
the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined
on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
