9661574 Behling This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is to
transfer materials design 'know-how' which has been developed for the
formulation and use of inks into the development of extruded, thermoplastic
matrix composite tapes which can be used for widespread, innovative and cost-
effective over voltage surge suppression applications. Oryx Technology has
successfully developed such a material in the form of a conductor-filled,
polymer matrix, thick film ink which can be applied to the fabrication of small,
discrete device structures. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a transient over-
voltage event which poses a serious threat to integrated circuits (IC's)
rendering them irreparably damaged due to the associated over-current flow
through the circuit. The standard means of contending with over-voltage threats
is to place a surge suppressor in parallel to the IC. These suppressor types
include diodes and varistors. A need exists for a new generation suppressor
concept which exhibits far lower leakage current and capacitance than existing
devices. These applications will include direct mounting of tapes onto printed
circuit boards as well as the creation of on-leadframe and in-IC package
placement.
