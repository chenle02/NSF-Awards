9712081 Wongsaroj, Ben Florida Memorial College CISE MII: FMC/FIU Integrated
Dual Engineering and Enhanced Computer Science Program This proposal supports
the development of a plan that integrates the Dual-Degree/Pre-Engineering
Program at Florida Memorial College, a historically Black institution, with
Florida International University's Engineering and Computer Science bachelor
degree programs. The endeavour is expected to increase the retention and
graduation rates of FMC computer science students by giving them access to FIU's
advanced research facilities and of FMC pre-engineering students by allowing
them to register for FIU upper-level engineering classes, including computer
engineering. Graduates will be positioned for employment after graduation and
for entrance into graduate programs at FIU by the enhancement of the computer
science and pre-engineering programs at FMC. The net effect will be to increase
the number of minority computer scientists and engineers in the workforce. The
integration of the programs utilizes strong collaboration between the faculty at
FMC and FIU through distance learning, parallel course development, and
collaborative computing through the Internet. Hands-on laboratory exercises and
design projects create an exciting and innovative academic environment. A
structured and well-organized management process is being developed through
which the responsibilities of all personnel can be delegated and an attainable
schedule for appropriate milestones developed.
