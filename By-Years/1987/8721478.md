Fronts or near-discontinuities in wind and temperature frequently exist near
the jet streams in the upper troposphre. It is well know that the vertical
circulation around these fronts play a role in the development of midlatitude
cyclones and precipitation systems; however, the dynamic link is not fully
understood. Because the horizontal and vertical scales of an upper-level front,
100 km and 1 km respectively, are smaller than the average spacing of the
radiosonde stations, it has always been difficult to extract much information on
the frontal circulation from the radiosonde network. Also because the forces
near a front are not in geostrophic balance, simple models cannot address
nonlinear complexity, and primitive equation model simulations make the
understanding of dynamics difficult. Under this grant Professor Keyser will
apply a hierarchy of approximated diagnostic models to the study of frontal
circulations, the levels of approximation being quasi-geostrophic, geostrophic
momentum, and balance; simulations from primitive equation models will be
treated as the limiting form of the approximated models. The results from this
work should reveal the characteristics of the upper-level frontal dynamics as
well as its link to the development of cyclones in lower troposphere.
