This study will investigate the processes involved in the evolution of gene
regulation. The sarcomeric myosin alkali light chain gene (Mlc1) in Drosophila
undergoes alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA and encodes two Mlc1
polypeptides, one of which lacks exon 5 (14 amino acids). The deficient form is
unique to the indirect flight muscles which power flight. They will compare
patterns of sequence variation in the regions of the Mlc1 gene that are under
selective constraint in several Drosophila species and representative species of
the orders Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Odonata. These patterns of
sequence variation will reveal whether sufficient variability in splicing exists
to enable measurement of evolutionary change in this system.
