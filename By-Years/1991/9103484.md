The general question addressed in this project is: how do sex steroid hormones
cause maturation of reproduction organs? A model system for the study of this
question is the immature female rat. When such a rat is given an injection of
estradiol (E2), a very rapid development of the uterus ensues. One of the first
detectable biochemical changes is an increase in two proteins - tissue factor
(TF) and thrombin. Because they are among the first things to change, it seems
possible or even likely that they may be involved in the further development of
the uterus - that E2 activates them, and they in turn activate other
developmental processes. Both proteins are associated with cell division in
other biological systems. When the smooth muscle cells lining blood vessels are
stimulated to grow, increases in TF occur. Thrombin is a stimulator of cell
division in fibroblast and may be important in the process of wound healing.
Since both proteins are present in the uterus as it begins to grow they may be
involved with uterine development under the control of E2 . Our investigations
are directed at proving this hypothesis. Our studies are complicated by the fact
that thrombin is generated in biological systems from a precursor - prothrombin
- by the enzymes of the coagulation cascade which begins with TF. A question we
must answer is whether TF acts as a growth factor per se or as the initiator of
thrombin generation through the coagulation cascade. The aims of this project
are: 1) to show that thrombin causes cell division in the uterus after E2
stimulation and 2) to find out whether TF acts directly on the uterus or
indirectly by the generation of thrombin. This research will increase our
understanding of a normal biological process - the maturation of one of the
organs of reproduction.//
