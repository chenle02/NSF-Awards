The University and Jepson Herbaria (UC/JEPS) at the University of California at
Berkeley is the sixth largest herbarium in the United States and the largest at
a public university. Current holdings total approximately 1.7 million specimens.
UC/JEPS holds the world's best collections of California plants, Pacific South
American algae, Philippine plants and South African algae. UC/JEPS has been
supported by the National Science Foundation during the past five years to
provide additional storage cases for the collections and to assist in the
curation of the backlog of unprocessed collections. The University of California
at Berkeley is in the process of reorganizing biology and providing new
facilities and buildings for the biological sciences. As part of this
reorganization UC/JEPS will be moving to temporary quarters. During the stay in
temporary quarters, UC/JEPS will continue to work on processing its backlog of
specimens, upgrading its storage facilities, and preparing for the move back
into renovated space on the Berkeley campus. This project will provide funds to
continue curation of the phycological and vascular plant backlogs. In both cases
specimens will be processed for incorporation into the permanent collection, for
exchange, or as gifts for determination. Two Lab Helpers will be supported to
assist with technical tasks associated with preparation of labels, sorting of
specimens, filing of collections, and moving the collections and archives. Funds
will also be provided for the purchase of herbarium cases to provide a 16%
expansion in storage space.
