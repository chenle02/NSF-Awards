This research project concerns the statistical properties of mathematical models
known as particle systems that describe fluid-dynamical and materials-science
aspects of important physical systems. More specifically, the project studies
models of (1) cluster growth, (2) randomly composited materials, and (3) diffuse
gases. Many basic and important questions about these models remain open. One of
the more striking examples is that we still lack a fully rigorous understanding
how fluid equations arise from molecular interactions. The investigator will
attempt to make progress on this problem and others by applying recently-
developed techniques in the theory of stochastic homogenization. The work will
have an interdisciplinary character, mixing results from probability and
analysis. The project will make use of computer simulation to empirically test
ideas during development of the theory.

Techniques in quantitative stochastic homogenization, particularly those used to
obtain optimal rates in the elliptic setting, are now mature enough to attack
problems that previously did not seem to be amenable to this approach. The basic
homogenization idea remains the same, namely, to view the microscopic models as
perturbations of their smooth macroscopic limits. The key new insight is that
the regularity theory of the macroscopic limit often has a microscopic analogue.
Examples of possible applications include the derivation of the Landau equation
as a scaling limit of interacting particles and Anderson localization for a
Bernoulli potential on the lattice. This approach has already proved successful,
and the investigator expects it to continue to yield new results.
