Eight undergraduate students will be involved in the research activities of the
radio astronomy group at Cornell University. The undergraduate students will
work directly with members of the Cornell faculty and research staff on projects
covering a range of disciplines in radio and radar astronomy. The students will
conduct individual research projects and also participate in group activities
such as seminars. At the end of the program the students will present papers
detailing their research. Attempts will be made to encourage participation by
students at small undergraduate institutions, by women and by minority students.
