In distributed systems, certain control processes run concurrently with
application processes. Examples include deadlock and termination detectors,
garbage collectors, and consistent global state coordinators. These types of
processes sometimes inhibit actions of the application process; in other words,
they disable a subset of actions that the application would otherwise perform.
For example, consistent global state coordinators sometimes prevent the sending
of application messages temporarily. Such inhibition is often undesirable for a
computation, particularly if performance is a primary issue. It has been
formally demonstrated that inhibition can be necessary in order to develop
certain control algorithms, and that there are sometimes tradeoffs between
inhibition and increased message traffic. In particular, this is the case for
consistent global state coordinators. This project investigates the role of
inhibition in a broader range of distributed control algorithms. Potential
targets include termination and deadlock detection, garbage collection, and
multicasting. The goal is to understand precisely when inhibition is necessary,
how to minimize inhibition, and how it affects other factors such as execution
time, message complexity and fault tolerance.
