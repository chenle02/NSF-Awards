This award provides funding for a three-day workshop "Advances in Nonlinear
Analysis", to be held March 13 - 15, 2014, in the framework of the 2014 Theme
Semester on Analysis and Convex Integration in the Department of Mathematics at
the University of Pittsburgh.

The main theme of the conference is recent developments in nonlinear analysis
and partial differential equations, including geometric analysis, geometric
measure theory, optimal transport, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and
calculus of variations. Some leading experts in these areas are confirmed as
participants and will give lectures. Special attention is paid to recruit junior
participants and members of underrepresented groups. Ample opportunity is
provided to graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present
their work. The workshop is a part of a one semester thematic program including
several minicourses in the research areas at the University of Pittsburgh.
