This award will support the purchase of reach-in and walk-in environmental
chambers that permit programmed control of climatic conditions and of associated
monitoring equipment. The units will be shared by five researchers and their
students and postdocs. Some of the units will be used for rearing various animal
taxa (e.g., cooperative spiders from African tropical rain forests that require
moderate temperatures and high humidities, or Mexican free-tailed bats whose
nursing-colony maintenance requires temperatures of 120F). Other chambers will
be used in experiments (e.g., simulated releases of biologically engineered
bacteria in a quasi-natural system, or territory size estimates for genetic
studies of the behavior of desert animal species). All of these projects require
varying conditions of lighting, temperature and humidity. Additionally, some of
the projects require the presentation of stimuli (e.g., odors) under conditions
isolated from extraneous stimuli. The equipment to be funded permits the
achievement of these necessary conditions.
