The proposed work will measure reaction rate constants, product branching ratios
and spectrcospic rate parameters which must be further quantified in order to
reliably model the sodium nightglow and to unequivocally utilize simultaneous
measurements of sodium nightglow emissions and ground state sodium
concentrations to quantify nighttime upper mesospheric ozone levels. The low
temperature NaO+O(3P) reaction, a secondary source of mesospheric NaO, will also
be investigated. These experimental investigations will utilize temperature
variable fast flow kinetic technique and crossed molecular beam methods, both
coupled to high resolution tunable laser probes for spectroscopic state
identification and characterization. Their successful completion will allow a
much more experimentally grounded modeling effort to quantify the mesospheric Na
nightglow and more firmly anchor recent attempts to use measured nightglow
levels coupled with lidar measurements of atomic sodium density to deduce
nighttime concentrations of upper mesospheric O3.
