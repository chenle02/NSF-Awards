*** 96-61626 Kirkpatrick This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will investigate the use of gas cluster ion beams to produce surface
modification effects which have not previously been possible by any existing ion
beam or direct energy beam method. Cluster ions have large total energy and very
high mass and momentum in combination with low energy per individual atom.
Impact of a gas cluster ion upon a solid surface involves a number of
exceptional effects including generation of high momentary temperature pressure
transients within an extremely shallow surface region at the impact site. It is
believed that conditions can be produced within a graphite surface by means of
gas cluster ion bombardment at room temperature which will cause tranformation
of the graphite surface to diamond. The capability to produce carbon-to-diamond
transformations will form the basis of a procedure for room temperature
deposition of diamond coatings onto surfaces of virtually any material.
Transient processing by gas cluster ions will become the basis for a low
temperature method for growth of diamond coatings onto virtually any material.
