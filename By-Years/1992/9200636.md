The PIs plan to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in the
area of atmospheric sciences. Proposed participants include Professor Donald K.
Brandvold, Chair, "Chemistry Department, Dr. James Jones, Physics
Department,Professor Carl J. Popp (PI), Professor David J. Raymond,
Chair,Physics Department, Professor William Rison, Department of Electrical
Engineering, Professor Stephen D. Schery (Co-PI), Professor Ronald Thomas,
Department of Electrical Engineering, andProfessor William P. Winn, Physics
Department and Chair, Langmuir Laboratory. The Departments of Chemistry and
Physics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology have maintained an
REU site for five years. NMIMT has ongoing programs in studies of atmospheric
electricity, atmospheric chemistry, and acid deposition centered around
facilities available at the Irving Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research
located near Socorro, New Mexico and the physics and chemistry laboratories on
the NMIMT campus. The PIs plan to support eight students to participate in the
REU site, and they intend to allocate six of the eight awards to students
outside of the NMIMT through a formal application procedure. Additionally, they
plan to involve minority students in the program. Students will have the
opportunity to participate in the following studies: 1) The role of large liquid
drops in precipitation development (Prof. Blyth); 2) Chemistry of N2O in
lightning and corona: field and laboratory experiments (Prof. Brandvold); 3)
Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment data analysis (Dr.
Jones); 4) Distribution, sources, and effects of acidic precipitation in New
Mexico (Prof. Popp); 5) Rainwater chemistry associated with lightning
discharges; 6)Cloud physics and mesoscale convective systems (Prof. Raymond); 7)
Lightning (Prof. Rison); 8) Atmospheric Radioactivity (Prof. Schery); 9) Remote
atmospheric and ionospheric detection system (Prof. Thomas); and 10) Electrical
structure of thunderstorms (Prof. Winn).
