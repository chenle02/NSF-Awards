The conference will bring together engineers, architects and scientists from the
U.S. and other countries to discuss a wide range of issues on research and
design methods for snow engineering. The nature, distribution and statistics of
snow loads, together with design criteria, damage estimation, wind tunnel
studies, artificial environments, analytical methods, snow mechanics, and
standard and codes will be some of the topics discussed by the participants
which come from different backgrounds and specialties. The results of this
conference will be published in proceedings and disseminated nationally and
internationally.
