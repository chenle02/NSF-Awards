9730698 Casey Boston College plans to design, develop, evaluate, and
disseminate innovative mathematics instructional materials for teaching spatial
skills, spatial patterning, and geometric concepts at the kindergarten level.
These stand-alone modules will center on the creation of multicultural stories
that pose geometry and spatial problems. Kindergartners will solve the problems
using manipulatives and other hands-on materials. Based on NCTM and NAEYC
recommendations, these instructional materials will do the following: 1.
Incorporate gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the mathematics curriculum
in a substantive way; 2. Integrate mathematics learning through the kindergarten
curriculum using developmentally appropriate practices; and 3. Shift the focus
of early mathematics education from a mainly arithmetic-based curriculum to one
that incorporates geometry and spatial skills.
