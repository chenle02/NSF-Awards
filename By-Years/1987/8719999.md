This is a three-year cross-linguistic project dealing specifically with the
syntax and semantics of quantification. Questions addressed include: 1) Is the
use of noun phrases as one means of expressing quantification universal? Are
there languages with no "essentially quantificational" noun phrases? 2) What are
the similarities and differences, within and across languages, in the structure
and interpretation of quantification expressed with noun phrases and
quantification expressed otherwise? 3) Is the basic distinction between noun
phrases and verb phrases (or sentences) due to a semantically universal noun-
verb distinction, or is it brought about by the distinction in their closed-
class functor (specifier) categories DET (determiner) and AUX (auxiliary)? The
languages to be investigated include English, German, Dutch, Italian, French,
Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and the Wakashan languages of British
Columbia.
