The Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics (http://www.math.ncsu.edu/TLC)
conferences are held twice a year in or near the Research Triangle region of
North Carolina. This proposal supports the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 meetings.

Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics. The states of
North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee have
recently seen an influx of research strength in combinatorics and adjacent
areas. In particular, there are remarkably many tenure-track researchers, senior
researchers and graduate students in combinatorics and related fields at various
colleges and universities within about 4--5 hours drive of the Research Triangle
region of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill). A relatively large
proportion of these researchers are from underrepresented groups. Since the
Spring of 2010, we have organized one-day (Saturday) conferences, once a
semester, under the name Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics, with the aim of
fostering regular contact between researchers in North Carolina, Virginia, South
Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Each conference has brought four
outstanding mathematicians from around the country to give talks about some of
the most significant and most exciting developments in combinatorics.

The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to
continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of
mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering
applications. The Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics workshops play numerous
roles: they enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by
creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers;
facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results
among researchers in the Southeastern United States; promote the teaching and
training of graduate students by exposing them to the perspectives of leading
researchers; increase awareness and understanding of combinatorics, on the part
of faculty and students in the Southeast; support the development of young
faculty at various schools and help them build local support and research
networks; broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women;
and foster research interactions among participants, leading to new research
results.
