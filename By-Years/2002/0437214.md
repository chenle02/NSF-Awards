The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramic and Composite
Materials has met the program criteria over their first five year period. The
Center's research now spans synthesis processing, microstructural
characterization and properties from nanometer through the micron scale. The
Center has added three new thrust areas, 1) ceramic armor materials; 2)
catalysis and; 3) electrochemical and energy related materials. &lt;br/&gt;
