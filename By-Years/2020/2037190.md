The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve detection of prostate cancer, a
highly prevalent fatal cancer in men. Approximately one million prostate
biopsies are performed annually in the U.S. Unfortunately the standard
diagnostic method is imprecise and inefficient. The proposed project will
advance a new method that uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to target
biopsies for improved detection. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance diagnosis of prostate
cancer by developing a system that combines an endorectal MRI coil and a
multichannel array of transrectal biopsy needle guides and allows for endorectal
MRI with in-bore biopsy as a single rapid integrated procedure. The project will
advance a procedure that optimally combines endorectal MRI and MRI-targeted
biopsy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
