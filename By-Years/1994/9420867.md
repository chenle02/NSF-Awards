9420867 Calaprice The development of a new detector for live-time measurements
of low energy solar neutrinos is proposed. To achieve the required low
background conditions, the detector must be located underground and be made of
materials of natural radiopurity. It consists of a large ultra pure liquid
scintillator operation in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. The
required purity levels are unprecedented and much of the effort of this proposal
will be to develop special detector materials by powerful purification methods.
This detector will be the first of its kind and will be the lowest background
detector in the world. The scintillator detector proposed here, which has become
known as the Borexino experiment, is designed to detect the 7Be neutrino in live
mode. The expected count rate in the 100 ton fiducial volume is about 50 per
day. The essential requirement of this experiment is a large unsegmented
detector with uranium and thorium radiopurities of better than 0.5fg/g. A
prototype detector with mass of a 4tons is currently under construction to test
the purity of the scintillator an other technic aspects of the design, the
initial research effort is to complete the development of the scintillator
vessel and the scintillator purification system an to install these in the
prototype detector. The second major effort will be to employ the test facility
to study the effectiveness of purification processes. The researcher will then
design the full scale Borexino experiment. ***
