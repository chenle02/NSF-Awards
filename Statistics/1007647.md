Given multiple multivariate data sources, each represented by an unknown
multivariate distribution, the investigator proposes an approach to regression
analysis based on relationships between semiparametric estimates of these
multivariate distributions. Resulting from this are regression estimates
expressed as estimates of the conditional expectation of a response given its
covariates, for each source. The investigator plans to study the statistical
properties of the regression estimates, associated diagnostic tools, the
applicability and computability of the method using real data, and compare the
method to multiple and kernel regression methods.

A basic statistical problem, referred to as regression, is to estimate a
relationship between a dependent variable, called the response, and
corresponding independent variables, called the predictors or covariates. Most
often this is done using a single data source. In many cases, however, multiple
data sources are available such as different groups of patients and a control
group, data sets from many surveillance sensors, multiple surveillance sources
from land, sea, and space, or multiple time records. The existence of multiple
data sources motivates a generalization. The investigator will study a novel
approach to regression based on multiple data sources, by combining or fusing
the data from all sources as to increase the precision of all estimates, and by
studying the joint statistical behavior of all sources. Potentially the approach
may impact regression analysis in general, as well as forecasting of such time
series as unemployment, commodity prices, and the course of a moving object
given covariate information, whenever multiple data sources are available. The
investigator plans to compare the approach with existing regression methods both
theoretically and by data analysis using real data.
