This proposal will develop the concept for an MHD-based GGCM (Global Geospace
Circulation Model). The end product would be a facility, which could be used by
the science community. Use could include testing changes in the models and the
development of modules for addition to the basic MHD core. The end product of
this project will be the definition and structure of the concept. The importance
of such a concept study is to help determine the best implementation strategy to
undertake in a concerted GGCM development effort, which may be mounted in the
near future.
