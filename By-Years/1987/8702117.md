Continuations provide a general abstraction of sequential control. If they are
provided in the context of a logic programming language, more dynamic variations
on the search strategy become possible. However, when continuations are invoked
to perform 'lateral' control transfers, as in variations on breadth-first
search, it is necessary for the values of logic variables to be restored. This
is related to the problem of maintaining multiple environments in the context of
or- parallelism. The state-space model of control has been extended to solve
this problem, allowing continuations to be used in the context of logic
programming. For the last several years the semantics and uses of first-
continuations in the context of imperative and functional programming has been
explored. It is now possible to extend much of this work to the context of logic
programming. Topics to be investigated include the modeling of Prolog extensions
using continuations, the use of continuations in conjunction with engines to
obtain search strategies based on computation time, the development of formal
models and reasoning systems for continuations in the context of logic
programming, and the investigation of more general issues of reification and
reflection in logic programming. This research should provide a better
understanding of control in the context of logic programming.
