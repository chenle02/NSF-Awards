The research focuses on the acoustical structure of porous fibrous layers and
the optimum design of such layers for engineering purposes. Computer-aided
design procedures to facilitate the optimization procedures are developed. These
analytical and design studies are quite relevant research topics since porous
materials are of key importance to the control of noise generated by virtually
all high technology devices used in modern society.
