Composite materials are highly valued in engineering and manufacturing for
their unique physical and chemical properties that are superior to those of
conventional products. Science and industry are continually searching for
composites that are stronger, lighter, and less expensive than their traditional
counterparts. These structured media -- or metamaterials -- may exhibit
increased electrical conductivity, enhanced thermal or acoustic insulation
properties, more reliable durability, or even seemingly unattainable properties
such as invisibility. Specific examples include lighter wings and fuselage
materials for aircraft, body armor for the military, artificial joints used in
orthopedic surgery, and professional sporting equipment. Composites also appear
throughout the natural world -- in human and animal bodies, and in most
components found within and on the surface of the Earth. Examples include bone,
lungs, porous rocks containing oil and gas, agricultural soils, and sea ice. The
mathematical theory of homogenization for composite materials has been developed
to explain observed effective properties of existing composites, which can then
be used to predict and discover new composites with less need for costly
experimentation. Recently the investigators discovered an unexpected
mathematical parallel between homogenization for composites and the Anderson
theory of the metal-insulator transition, for which Anderson shared the Nobel
prize. In this project the investigators develop new methods for studying
composites based on this parallel, bringing the powerful ideas of the Anderson
transition to bear on a broad range of problems in the theory of composites.
Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the work of the project.

In this project the spectral theory of homogenization for transport in
composite media is investigated through the lens of random matrix theory. A
powerful approach to homogenization problems is the analytic continuation
method, which encodes information about the microstructure of the composite
through the spectral measure of a self-adjoint random operator governing
classical transport in the medium. Random matrix theory naturally arises by
considering finite discrete models of composites, which allows the spectral
measure, and thus the macroscopic behavior of the composite, to be computed in
terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the random matrices. Surprisingly,
as a percolation threshold is approached, these eigenvalues and eigenvectors
display strikingly similar behavior to what is observed in Anderson transitions
in condensed matter, optics, acoustics, and water waves. This unexpected
connection enables the investigators to develop new methods of analysis and
computation for homogenization of two-phase composites and related systems such
as polycrystals and advection-diffusion processes. Moreover, their approach ties
together previously unrelated fields of random matrix theory and homogenization,
opening up new avenues for investigation and application. Graduate and
undergraduate students participate in the work of the project.
