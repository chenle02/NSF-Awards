Enbedding and Attitude Theory: An Empirical Test This study will draw from
recent developments in attitude theory and survey research to address the
embedding program contingent valuation (CV). Conventional wisdom and economic
theory assume that people should be willing to pay more for the whole than for
just one part of that whole, but empirical CV data show that these expectations
are sometimes not fulfilled. This has caused some scholars to question the
overall validity of CV. Employing a social psychological perspective, this
research considers the contingent values estimated on questionnaires by
willingness to pay (WTP) as one component of attitude called behavioral
intention (BI). What economists call a `good` is traditionally conceptualized as
an `attitude object` by social psychologists. In the literature, several
variables have been shown to affect BI (WTP) toward attitude objects: the nature
of the attitude object itself (specific vs general), the nature of attitude
structure toward the object (many beliefs vs few beliefs), the degree of direct
personal experience with the object (high or low), the degree of emotional
attachment (high or low), the relationship of the object to self-identity (far
or near), and the level of importance/centrality (high or low). In this study,
the goal is to specify the variables that influence CV assessments and then test
the conditions under which the embedding effect occurs. By tackling the
embedding problem, this study will aid in the future design of contingent
valuation surveys, particularly those dealing with broad and diffuse attitude
objects like ecosystem diversity and regional environmental amenity
improvements.
