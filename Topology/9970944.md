9970944 Carlsson This award will provide partial support for speakers and others
at the Conference on ``Topology, Geometry and Algebra: Interactions and New
Directions'' to be held at Stanford University from August 17 to August 21,
1999. The aim of this conference is to promote interaction between algebraic
topology on the one hand and several extremely active areas of application of
topology on the other. The areas of application will include differential
geometry, moduli spaces, symplectic topology, representation theory, and
discrete group theory. The organizers have in mind interaction in two
directions, both applications of topology to other areas and applications of
other areas of mathematics to topology. The conference is particularly timely,
since such interaction is well begun, and they view their role as encouraging it
and helping to broaden and deepen it. The conference will consist entirely of 22
plenary lectures and will permit ample time for discussions among participants.
The organizers expect participation by between 75 and 100 mathematicians. They
have invited a number of younger mathematicians as well as graduate students,
and three of the featured speakers are women. A conference proceedings, to be
edited by A. Adem, R. Cohen and G. Carlsson, will be published as a volume in
Contemporary Mathematics. ***
