9412582 Tsao This project is on research to study the production of fumaric acid
by Rhizopus oryzae. A procedure for removing the product by resin adsorption as
it is formed in the bioreactor will be used to avoid product inhibition. In
addition to developing this process, this research will also investigate the
effect of oxygen supply and carbon dioxide transfer. A mathematical model based
on material balances, process kinetics, and bioenergetics will be developed and
used in an analysis of the process. ***
