The mechanisms by which endocytic vesicles form and by which vesicle formation
is regulated are not understood in any biological system. The proposed SGER is
directed at understanding these phenomena by taking advantage of the temperature
sensitive recessive mutation, shibire, in Drosophila. At 30 degrees C coated
visicle formation and endocytosis are stopped within 1-2 minutes in flies
homozygous for the mutation. Resumption of uptake occurs within 1-2 minutes
after return to 22 degrees C. Wild type Drosophila exhibit normal uptake and
vesicle formation at both 22 and 30 degrees C. Such rapid onset and reversal in
the mutants suggests that a protein intrinsic to vesicle formation is the target
of the shibire mutation. P element transposon mutagenesis will be used to
identify and mark the wild type shibire gene. Portions of the wild type shibire
gene will then be used to identify and isolate both genomic and cDNA clones of
the wild type shibire gene. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an important step
in the traffic of cellular membranes and a fundamental cellular function that is
closely associated with the ability of cells to receive and respond to chemical
signals. If this project is successful it will be the first isolation of any
gene involved in endocytic vesicle formation during receptor-mediated
endocytosis. This should then permit the identification, characterization, and
localization of one or more of the cellular constituents which control this
critical step in cellular membrane traffic.
