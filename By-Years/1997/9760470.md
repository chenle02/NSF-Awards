*** 9760470 Dean This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore spraying metal and composite particles at room temperature and at
velocities of 200-300 meters per second to coat substrates. Current thermal-
spray coatings exhibit important limitations; especially, porosity, inadequate
adhesion, non-uniform properties, and low deposition efficiency. The high
temperature of thermal spray precludes the inclusion of desirable fibers, e.g.,
graphite. The current innovation (Cold-Spray) will utilize proprietary
activation solutions to enable metallurgical bonding of particles to occur on
impact. Because of its low operating temperature, Cold-Spray will allow metal
matrices to be strengthened with thermally sensitive reinforcements, e.g.,
graphite fibers in titanium. No thermal damage to the deposit or substrate
results. Phase I will focus on the feasibility of cold bonding metal and
composite powders by spray impact into high-density, high-strength, and strongly
adhering coatings on metal substrates. A prototype Cold-Spray system will be
built and tested. Phase II will demonstrate forming free-standing, function-
gradient composite components using Cold-Spray. Potential commercial
applications are expected in the fabrication of composite structures and
components for aerospace, defense, and industry. Cold-Spray forming of parts
from CAD files will be a flexible and lower cost process than current methods
for their production. ***
