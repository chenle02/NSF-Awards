Present health monitoring and diagnosis devices are typically limited to bulky,
often complicated, and costly equipment accessible only in a central laboratory.
This research project aims to develop a low cost, high quality system for
monitoring biomarkers of diseases (such as cardiac disorders, cancer, viral
infections, and preeclampsia) in clinical as well as in remote and low resource
settings. Preeclampsia is the initial target as it is a leading cause of
maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity, but no preventative test is
currently available. A low-cost, reliable technique for detecting biomarkers of
preeclampsia provides the opportunity for early intervention before symptoms
occur and enables closer monitoring of women at increased risk. This project
provides research training to diverse students at the graduate and undergraduate
level. The research team works with the university programs, including Society
of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists, National Society of Black
Engineers, and the Society of Women Engineers and Women's Research Symposium, to
broaden participation in science and engineering. In addition, the team engages
high school students and teachers in university-based laboratory research to
excite them about science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point-of-
care diagnostic system being developed uses a paper-based microfluidics
cartridge that contains novel metal nanoparticles functionalized with Raman
reporters and biomarker probes. The change in surface-enhanced resonance Raman
scattering (SERRS) signal in the presence of target biomarkers in a blood sample
is read by a handheld Raman spectrometer. The specific aims of this project are:
1) the design and study of novel metal nanoparticles functionalized with Raman
reporter molecules to understand the structural factors that influence the
surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering signal; 2) the development of
bioassays to monitor the preeclampsia biomarkers with high sensitivity and
specificity; and 3) the design and development of the three dimensional
multichannel paper microfluidic cartridge for simultaneous monitoring of
multiple early epigenetic biomarkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
