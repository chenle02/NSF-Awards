The long term goal of this project is to elucidate the role of bacteria in the
manganese cycle in nature. The work immediate objective focuses on the role of
bacteria in reducing manganese. In laboratory studies with pure cultures, the
mechanisms by which bacteria reduce manganese will be investigated. Using these
pure cultures, and enrichments (mixed cultures) from a variety of environments,
the PI will also develop methods for distinguishing biological from (strictly)
chemical reduction, and for charact- erizing the different types of biological
Mn reduction. Finally, he will apply these methods to the study of Mn reduction
in the field, both in fresh water (Oneida Lake, N.Y.) and marine (Black Sea)
environments. Mechanistic studies will begin with strain SK13sp, a marine
Bacillus that is a potent reducer of manganese. These studies will focus on
isolation and identification of the extracellular Mn reductant produced by the
cells. Concomitant with these studies, Nealsen will be characterizing other pure
cultures, and beginning detailed analyses of other mechanisms. Development of
field methods will focus on identifying mechanisms of Mn reduction, using
analogues, inhibitors, and poisons. These methods will be tested in Oneida Lake,
in Saanich Inlet, B.C. by Dr. B. Tebo, and used for field work in the Black Sea
in 1987.
