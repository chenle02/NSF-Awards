Preferences are orders among a collection of items attributed to a population of
judges. Preference data comes in a variety of forms, such as ranked lists and
pairwise comparisons, and is ubiquitous in a plethora of applications across
different domains. Useful and effective analysis of preference data typically
involves various forms of aggregation among many judges. This work focuses on
the analysis of incomplete preferences, including mining, clustering and
aggregation. Models, algorithms, data and software products developed as part of
this project will be made publicly available. The work will have an impact on
the scientific community, in particular on the analysis of functional genomics
data, which is central to many areas of bioinformatics, and on social
applications, where it will enable efficient and effective analysis of user
preferences.

This project develops data analysis methodologies that are geared towards
incomplete preferences. This work will establish principles, paradigms, and
computing machinery for effective analysis of large datasets of incomplete
preferences. To that aim, this project develops (1) novel approaches for mining
frequent, or otherwise interesting, patterns in preference data; (2) novel
clustering and preference aggregation methods; and (3) an extensive data
acquisition and experimental evaluation to enhance the research and development
of analysis methodologies. The PI will involve graduate and undergraduate
students in her research, and will continue to work with women and under-
represented minorities. Both the process and the outcome of this research will
be integrated into data management and data science courses taught by the PI.
