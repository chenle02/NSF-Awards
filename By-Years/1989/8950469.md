Two new laboratory courses will be developed, one in molecular/cellular
genetics, and one in microbiology/immunology/cell biology. These courses are
designed to create a lab experience that simulates a research environment for
these students who are not yet fully prepared to engage in actual research. The
courses will introduce students to a variety of experimental systems, including
plant and animal cell and tissue culture. Various experimental approaches will
be considered, but the primary focus will be on cell biology (culture, fusion,
transformation), immunology, recombinant DNA technology, and the analysis of
regulation of gene expression. An incubator and safety cabinet are needed for
the tissue culture experiments, while radioisotope counters, centrifuges, and
balance will allow students to do all of their own analytical and most of their
own reparative work, in keeping with the goal of creating a research lab
environment. Computers will allow students to work with simulation programs,
record and plot data, and carry out statistical analyses directly in the lab.
Students will report their work in research-style lab conferences. The college
will provide 50% matching funds.
