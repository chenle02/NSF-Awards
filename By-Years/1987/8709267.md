The current numerical solutions of most engineering problems are obtained on
computers based on the classical von Neumann architecture where a set of
instructions are executed in a sequential or serial fashion. The utilization of
computers to tackle more and more complicated problems requires that there be a
continued increase in computational speed. However, the "von Neumann
bottleneck", the serial nature of the computer system itself, is the
restriction. The present supercomputers with vector processing, special
arithmetic/logic units, etc. is one approach. Despite the power and speed of
supercomputers, such systems will rely on a basically serial execution of
instructions and their capabilities are approaching the physical limitations
imposed by the speed of light and quantum mechanical effects. Recent
developments in computer science indicates that the parallel processing has the
most promising and viable computer architecture for significant improvements in
computational performance. Such systems use a large number of processors, each
of which is assigned one computational task. Since the processors execute
computations simultaneously, the potential computational speed is far than the
serial systems. As yet there is very little application software for engineering
problems on parallel systems. The goal of this Engineering Initiation project
will be to apply parallel computations to nonlinear dynamical system. Efficient
parallel processing software will be developed including; cell mapping
techniques for analysis and synthesis of optimal control, bifurcation curves for
two and three degrees of freedom systems, and implement and test the algorithms
on FLEX/32 Parallel computer at the University of Southern California.
