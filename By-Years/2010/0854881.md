Present day nanoscale patterning techniques are inherently two dimensional and
it is extremely challenging to construct arbitrary patterned three dimensional
nanoscale components. This proposal seeks to develop a simple and high-
throughput strategy for fabricating these precisely patterned and monodisperse
nanoscale components. Specifically, the proposed strategy that will be developed
involves the self-assembly of two dimensional lithographically patterned
templates to form three dimensional, untethered polyhedral components. In
addition to demonstrating the applicability of the process at the 100 nanometer
length scale, investigations directed at understanding defect tolerance and
parameters that influence overall yield will also be carried out.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed low-cost, mass production of nanoscale
components, with arbitrary patterning will enable a wide range of miniaturized
and more effective devices to be constructed for applications such as
nanoelectronics, biomolecular imaging, drug delivery, sensing, and actuation.
Additionally, the process is compatible with present day fabrication of
microchips; hence the process allows the seamless integration of electronic
modules, such as transistors and sensors, within the components. Along with the
research, a concerted effort will be made to enhance undergraduate education and
outreach in Baltimore high schools. Undergraduate students, high school teachers
and students, including under represented minorities, will be invited to
participate in research experiences. Moreover, activities directed at increasing
an appreciation for science, engineering and nanotechnology in schools, colleges
and to the public will be organized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
