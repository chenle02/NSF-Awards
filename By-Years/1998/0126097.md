Kurz&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0126097&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve a
combined geochemical, isotopic, and chronological study of Galapagos lava flows
in order to constrain the origin of the Galapagos hotspot and to compare it to
other oceanic hotspots, such as Hawaii. An important obstacle to evaluating the
temporal evolution of Galapagos volcanoes has been the lack of an eruption time
scale. This project will rely heavily on the relatively new dating method of
surface exposure dating (using cosmic-ray-produced nuclides such as 3He and
36Cl) to determine lava flow ages. Combining the new age information with the
geochemical data (i.e. the isotopes of strontium, neodymium, lead and helium)
will help determine if the large geochemical differences between Galapagos
volcanoes are related to temporal or spatial variability, which is crucial to
hotspot models. One key goal of the research will be to evaluate temporal
evolution at Cerro Azul and Fernandina, the two most active volcanoes in the
western end archipelago which are thought to be near the center of the present-
day hotspot. The project will also generate a west-to-east geochemical transect
from Fernandina to San Cristobal to evaluate the hotspot model in the paradigm
of plate tectonics. New field work will provide a geochemical comparison of
these results to the northern volcanoes on Pinta and Marchena which are
presently difficult to explain in standard hotspot models.&lt;br/&gt;
