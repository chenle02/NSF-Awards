OCE-9525856 Siegel The links between solar radiation penetration, near-surface
radiant heating, and the thermal structure of the western Pacific warm pool
mixed layer will be investigated using in-situ data and models. Several new
aspects of solar radiation penetration and heating for the range of atmospheric
and oceanic conditions found in the western Pacific warm pool during TOGA COARE
(Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere, Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment)
will be evaluated in order to model the processes by which solar radiation
regulated the sea surface temperature and the mixed layer heat content of the
warm pool.
