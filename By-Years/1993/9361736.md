This research deals with in intelligent vision perception system modeled after a
human cognitive system (retina); specifically, a multilayer parallel focal plane
array image processing system that combines this company's highly advanced
optical interconnects and waveguide hologram techniques with a multilayer
serial-parallel structure; a RETinally INspired Algotecture (RETINA). A 3-layer
RETINA structure and algorithms are being carefully studied and implemented. The
first layer performs edge enhancement, the second, reduced and/or eliminates
noise, and the third implements line construction algorithms to enhance results.
Sobol, median and 3-pixel line segments are being used for each corresponding
layer. Phase I of this program will produce (1) a useful algotecture, (2) a
determination of how it will work with noisy, nouniformly-lit images, (3) an
understanding of component tolerance, (4) the critical waveguide hologram
illuminator, and (5) a first-order system design. An edge lit waveguide hologram
which is the critical physical component will also be constructed, perfected,
and tested
