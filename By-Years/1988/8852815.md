Six laboratory courses have been selected for improvement with the addition of
microcomputer-based data acquisition systems. These courses cover the areas of
hydraulics, soils and foundations, construction materials, structural behavior
measurements, and construction planning. The objective of the addition of these
computers to these courses is to provide the students the opportunity to gain
first-hand experience with computers as instrument controllers and data
collectors. All of these laboratory courses will use the same basic hardware and
software. A microcomputer will be located in the laboratory as the host for the
data acquisition system. Data from the micro will be sent via a Ethernet network
to a VAX11/750 which will serve as a central file server for all of the
laboratories. During the laboratory session the students will control the
experiments with the micros. At a later time the students will use a remote
terminal to the VAX to retrieve their data, do the analysis, and prepare the
appropriate graphs and figures for the lab report. Using this centralized
procedure, the students will have access to a great deal more data than is now
presently available with conventional systems of analog measurements recorded
during the actual laboratory session. Current laboratory course content is
improved by including both the statistical analysis of experimental data as well
as the analysis of the transient behavior of engineering materials.
