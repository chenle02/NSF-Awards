Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University acquire a Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction
System. Among the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition are the following: 1. Crystallographic studies of Model Complexes
for the Metal Binding Sites in "Zinc Fingers" and Other Metal-Binding Domains 2.
Systematic Development of New Organic Conductors 3. Application of an X-ray
Diffractometer in the Development of New Synthetic Methods 4. Application of
X-ray Structure Determination in Organic Chemistry 5. Studies in Natural Product
Biochemistry 6. Structural Studies of Inhibitors of Steroid - Transforming
Enzymes
