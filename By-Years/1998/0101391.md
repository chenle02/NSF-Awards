Zeolites and other nanoporous materials are of major importance in catalysis,
ion exchange, gas separation, and other technologies. They consist of a wealth
of open framework structures with varying compositions and degrees of hydration.
As Part of an ongoing study of the energetic driving forces which govern zeolite
synthesis and reactivity, this work uses unique calorimetric capabilities in the
UC Davis Thermochemistry Facility to determine energetics of formation, ion
exchange, and hydration in selected aluminosilicate zeolites and their gallium
and germanium analogues. This work is completed by molecular modeling. In situ
calorimetric studies of zeolite synthesis form another focus of research. Such
synthesis is controlled by both inorganic and organic structure directing
agents, and their energetic role in both zeolites and mesoporous materials will
be investigated by calorimetry. The overall goal of this research is an
understanding, at the molecular level, of the factors which cause specific
structures to form. The Thermochemistry Facility and its diverse activities
(including participation in an NSF IGERT) provide vigorous, rigorous, and
supportive education for a large number of students and postdocs from many
cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.
