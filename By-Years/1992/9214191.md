This modern helium liquefaction system in the Department of Physics at the
University of Florida will be capable of meeting the full needs of all the
research groups in the Physics Department including the Microkelvin Research
Laboratory, and also the needs of groups in Chemistry, Materials Science and
Engineering, Radiology, Astronomy, and Geology on the campus of the University
of Florida. The system will produce 75 liters per hour that will satisfy current
and estimated needs of a planned expansion up to the year 2010. This will also
include uninterruptible power services and chilled water systems that will
operate the liquefaction facility as well as clean uninterruptible power and
cooling for the operation of research equipment in the experimental laboratories
in the Department. This upgrade will enable research programs dependent on
liquid helium to realize their full potential, and will result in a significant
increase in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the physical
sciences.
