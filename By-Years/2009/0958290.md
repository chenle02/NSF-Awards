The Center for the Study of Higher Education at Pennsylvania State University
will assess data available and identify if more is needed to design programs to
ease the transition of military veterans into engineering disciplines. The
results will help postsecondary institutions meet the unique needs of military
veterans returning to or enrolling in college for the first time.

Intellectual merit: The new Montgomery GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans is
expected to bring an influx of former military personnel to the nation's college
campuses. Many of these veterans will bring technical skills and expertise, and
an interest in continuing their education in those fields. The proposed planning
grant will catalog examples of programs already developed on some college
campuses to serve veterans. It will also assess the data that are available from
military and other sources to assist in implementing efforts to recruit and
serve veterans. The project will also suggest designs for appropriate evaluation
methodology for such program to serve veterans who study engineering.

Broader impacts: While the primary focus of this planning grant is on data and
evaluation of programs for veterans, the results will have implications for
other populations of non-traditional students. Most military veterans returning
to college have characteristics that are quite different from traditional
students transitioning directly from high school to postsecondary education.
Adult students returning to college to complete a first degree, or enrolling for
the first time, share many of the characteristics of military veterans. Many
have spouses or partners as well as dependent children, and juggle family
responsibilities while enrolled in college. All bring with them to the campus
skills and talents learned in the labor force, and are looking for ways to build
on that existing expertise.
