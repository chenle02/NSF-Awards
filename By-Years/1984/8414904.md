The objective of this project is to develop design procedures and associated
computing software to achieve economical structural designs which are closer to
the accepted seismic design philosophy. Computer-aided-design software will be
developed for the probabilistic limit states design and analysis of structures.
A concurrent effort will be made to identify ground motion and structural
response parameters which are statistically correlated to structural damage with
high confidence. An effort will be made to separately deal with uncertainties
and statistical variations in earthquake resistant design. The braced frame will
be studied for identification of key factors affecting beam-column-brace member
interaction by carrying out rational analyses for the post-elastic behavior of
simple K-braced frame systems. Thus, proportioning recommendations for seismic
design should be obtained.
