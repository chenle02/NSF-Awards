There is increased interest in constructing buildings, dikes, and highways over
marginal sites with compressible, fibrous, organic soils such as peat. The
purpose of the proposed research is to develop laboratory techniques and
theoretical models to characterize the behavior of peat soils under compression.
This activity will be focused on developing predictive methodology that can be
used in engineering design of embankments and other foundations that must be
constructed on peat soils. It is planned to verify the predictive models by
field testing. The combination of theoretical modeling, laboratory experiments
and field testing should provide reliable guidelines for predicting and design
against settlement. The PI is well-qualified to conduct this research. His past
accomplishments have demonstrated that he is experienced and knowledgeable in
the proposed area of research. An award is recommended.
