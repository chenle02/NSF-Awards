AST-0307482&lt;br/&gt;Zaritsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research takes
advantage of progress on both theoretical and observational fronts to
investigate the physics behind the properties of Local Group (LG) galaxies, by
comparing simulated star formation histories to their observed counterparts.
Large-scale, high-resolution, N-body simulations will be complemented by
smaller, detailed gas-dynamical simulations, which can follow the progress of
LG-like structures identified in the first step. The results will be compared to
the observed kinematic and photometric properties of LG galaxies. This work
should address the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of LG
galaxies, the origins of different stellar populations, the properties, spatial
and orbital distribution, of satellite galaxies in the LG, and the origin and
nature of the current LG mass function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
make public both the algorithms used and movies of the simulations (which are
educationally quite effective). The research will also contribute to more than
one doctoral thesis.&lt;br/&gt;
