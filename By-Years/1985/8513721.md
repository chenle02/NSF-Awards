This conference will have implications for research on such hazards as floods,
drought and on dam safety. The conference will complement the inquiry undertaken
by the ASCE Task Committee on Risk-Based Decisionmaking in Water Resources
Planning and Management on integrating information derived from technological
risk assessment with that of social risk acceptance within a common set of
multiobjective water resources planning problems. In particular, the conference
will concentrate on those issues of public decision-making in which risk
analysis plays a prominent role and will evaluate current risk assessment issues
confronting water resources planners and areas of uncertainty, identify the
requirements and procedures currently promoted by engineering professions which
are in use by Federal and state water resources agencies, review and evaluate
decision analysis models/methods which can explicitly incorporate risk
preferences, and develop information exchange mechanisms.
