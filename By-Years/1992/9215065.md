Theoretical studies will be conducted on the transport and thermodynamic
properties of solids at low temperature focusing on the physics of novel
microstructures and semiconducting heterostructures. The research will extend
further our understanding of quantum mechanical interference effects and their
interplay with Coulomb interactions and high magnetic field in mesoscopic and
macroscopic conductors. Topics will include thermodynamic properties of
mesoscopic systems in both non- interacting and interacting models, mesoscopic
fluctuation phenomena in the ballistic regime and their explanation in terms of
the quantum theory of chaotic systems, and both the mesoscopic and macroscopic
properties of two-dimensional electron systems in high magnetic field.
Calculations will be done analytically using impurity-averaged perturbation
theory, semi-classical methods and random matrix theory, and numerically using
recursive Green function techniques, for instance. The objective is to obtain a
quantitative and microscopic description of phenomena which are currently at the
very forefront of experimental investigations and which have important
implications for future microelectronic technology. %%% Research will be done on
electrical transport (current) in devices which are of intermediate between
large (macroscopic) and atomic (microscopic) size. This mesoscopic region is
such that microscopic effects are seen on the macroscopic scale resulting in
unusual and useful physical phenomena. Besides affecting our understanding of
basic physics, these studies will have important ramifications for
microelectronics.
