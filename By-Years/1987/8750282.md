The College is organizing a single laboratory into an all-purpose Microscope
Resource Center housing all of the College's microscopes and related equipment,
allowing for maximum utilization of equipment at the lowest cost to the College.
The center is serving the Animal Health Technology program as well as the
Biology Department. A microvideo camera unit and the new microscopes themselves
are aiding the introductory students through expanding their capability for
viewing samples of special interest.
