0102983 Crittenden This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. The
goal of this project is to design and synthesize novel TiO2-based nanotube p-n
junction photocatalysts. The principal investigators have combined the p-n
junction principle and concepts of template preparation of nanomaterials toyield
a new general route for preparing nanotube p-n junction photocatalysts. Through
this process, they will further understand the nucleation and growth of very
small diameter semiconductor nanotubes. The morphology of these TiO2 nanotubes
will be analyzed. The photocatalytic activity will be evaluated by examining the
destruction of representative organic pollutants in the gas phase.

The proposed research is expected to improve the quantum efficiency for
photocatalytic destruction of environmental pollutants by providing a basis for
designing and constructing TiO2-based nanotube photocatalysts. An important
feature of the multidisciplinary research team is the integration of research
and education through broader academic and research training of students in
fundamental materials science, environmental science, and related technological
areas.
