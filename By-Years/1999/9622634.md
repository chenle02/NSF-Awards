ABSTRACT CTS-9622634 A rotating ring/disk electrode (RDE) system and a control
system for an atomic force microscope (AFM) are acquired. They are used to study
the roles of chloride and dissolved oxygen in copper electroplating, including
effects on the kinetics of deposition and on morphological development such as
crystalline anisotropy, kinetic roughening, and facet formation. ***
