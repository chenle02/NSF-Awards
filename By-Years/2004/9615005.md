9615005 Jain The present grant is to support the extension of earlier work by
the PI on composite fermion description of the fractional quantum Hall effect.
More specifically, the PI has devised a formalism to calculate the wave
functions of the ground as well as the excited states for large systems using
Monte Carlo techniques. The possibility of calculations in thermodynamic limit
promises a quantitative understanding of various outstanding experimental
issues. In particular the grant plans to calculate the energy gaps and
collective mode dispersions at general fractions, degree of polarization
including the Zeeman energy, transitions between the fractional quantum Hall
states and a Wigner crystal and finally the response of a mesoscopic quantum dot
to applied high magnetic fields. %%% The subject of fractional quantum Hall
effect has been an active area in recent years, in significant part due to this
PI's discovery of the composite fermion description. A serious limitation so far
has been that the theoretical calculations are limited to system of smaller
sizes, as opposed to the experiments which are generally for larger sizes. A
significant development recently by the PI suggests possible removal of this
limitation. This grant is to support calculations of various experimental
observable in the large system limit. ***
