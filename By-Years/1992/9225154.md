A large number of excellent strong ground motion and structural response
accelerograms were recorded during the M 7.5 Landers earthquake of June 28,
1992, which was the largest to occur in California since 1952. There was
relatively little damage to engineered structures due to the remote location of
the epicenter. However the ground motion records obtained from this event are
among the most significant measured to date, and especially the recording from a
free-field instrument installed and maintained by the Southern California Edison
Co. (SCE). This instrument was located in Lucerne Valley within approximately
one mile of the surface rupture, thus providing one of the closest near- field
recordings of a major U.S. earthquake. A preliminary analysis of this record
shows a very pronounced long-period pulse in the displacement with an amplitude
of about 120 cm. This type of ground motion could have a serious effect on the
response of large structures. The existence of significant long-period motion in
the near-field of a large earthquake has been postulated for some years and
analytical models have been proposed to characterize this near-field motion.
However there has been insufficient data with which to verify either the
existence or the nature of this type of motion. The evidence of significant
strongly correlated long-period motion provided by a preliminary analysis of the
Lucerne Valley (SCE) record is of very great interest and concern to earthquake
engineers. The objective of this project is: (1) to undertake a thorough study
of the site, the instrument, and the recorded data so as to determine the
accuracy of the Lucerne Valley earthquake record, (2) to develop appropriate
correction algorithms for this instrument and to apply these to the measured
ground motion record, and (3) to study the characteristics of the Lucerne Valley
record any available comparable data to obtain a better understanding of the
possible effects of near-field earthquakes on structural response.
