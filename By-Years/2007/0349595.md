With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor Frantisek Turecek of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. The
research will continue the PI's research on the chemistry of transient
intermediates in reactions of biological interest. These transients will be
investigated in the gas phase in the absence of solvent and other complicating
factors allowing intrinsic properties to be determined. The experimental
observations will be complemented by sophisticated calculation of the structure
and energy of these species. Since the intermediates to be studied will be
derived from DNA nucleobases, amino acids, and peptides, this research will
contribute fundamental data in the area of protein and nucleic acid
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are expected to have broad impact
upon the biological sciences. In particular, they will contribute to our
knowledge of factors responsible for DNA and protein damage. In addition these
experiments will provide a significant base of knowledge in the areas of
proteomics and genomics in which many of the recent advances have been achieved
through mass spectrometry. The research will also provide valuable training for
students in the area of biological mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;
