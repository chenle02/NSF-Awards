9411631 Hudetz The research proposed in this application is the study of
angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in microvascular networks. Major hypothesis
is that microvascular network development is the result of endothelial shear
stress, and that communication of stress occurs between cells and vessels,
possibly through growth factors. Three models are proposed: a mathematical model
in which network development proceeds according to specified experiment based
rules, an experimental network of microtubes seeded with endothelial cells, and
an in vivo model of the cerebral vasculature of the one-to-three week old rat.
