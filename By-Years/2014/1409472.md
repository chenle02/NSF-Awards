The NSF ADVANCE program aims to increase and promote the advancement of women in
academic STEM. The University of Delaware (UD) contributes to broadening the
participation of women in the academy through a series of initiatives that focus
on leadership development, promotion of mid-career women in STEM, development of
transparent policies for faculty recruitment, retention and promotion as well as
enhanced data collection on faculty and a focus on improving the climate for
women faculty from underrepresented groups. Women Faculty To Leadership, the W2L
program reframes campus leadership training to the top - the Office of the
Provost with faculty. Campus leaders will partner with women faculty to develop
strategies to lower the barriers to advancement. The data collection, through
system climate studies and faculty exit interviews, will enhance the
institutional knowledge of the issues that faculty encounter, particularly STEM
women of color, so that the institution may develop plans for
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Delaware proposes a clear
analytical framework that, in its simplicity, may have tremendous impact on
future thinking and action. They propose a multi-level approach, the hourglass,
that shows how to link the upper level administrative strategies with grassroots
strategies proposed by faculty. The middle area is a space where department
chairs may connect the upper and lower portions to create more balance in the
system. This is the underlying rationale for the programming that composes the
W2L activity and other aspects of the project. Prior research on sources of
barriers for advancing women in STEM identifies department chairs and heads as
key players in shaping the work climate, specifically the microclimate of the
department, at colleges and universities that may slow women's progress. Another
example is that UD will create a mentoring academy for department chairs to
share current research on how to improve departmental climate. W2L's regional
conference will help to disseminate to a national audience findings from this
project related to broadening participation of women in academic STEM. The
resulting a partnership of women faculty of color and university leadership will
serve as a model for academia in general to become a more inclusive environment.
