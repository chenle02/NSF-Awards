There are many transmitter substances which regulate the activity of nerve
cells of the central nervous system. The objective of this proposal is to
elucidate the mechanisms by which these transmitter substances activate
intracellular messenger processes that lead to the modulation of excitability
through their action on potassium channel conductance properties. Recent studies
have shown that excitability of neurons is dependent on potassium channels which
are, in turn, regulated by G-proteins called Gi and Go, of which there are
several subtypes. The specific aim of this investigation is to identify which of
the G-protein subtypes are related to neurotransmitter action (acetylcholine and
somatostatin). Molecular biological techniques will be used to produce specific
mutations to selectively inactivate G-proteins and thereby determine which of
them is directly affected by the neurotransmitters to act on potassium
conductance of the cell. For this purpose mutated alpha subunits will be
inserted into AtT-20 cells, a pituitary tumor cell line which contain G-protein
regulated potassium channels. The effect of the mutants can then be ascertained
on potassium channel function.
