It is now widely recognized that paleomagnetic studies of Paleozoic North
American carbonate rocks have revealed mostly secondary (but ancient)
magnetization; shallow-water carbonates that contain primary or early
magnetizations are rare and exceptional. Recent studies have revealed that the
magnetization of these carbonates resides in (probably authigenic) magnetites.
In this project the PIs will investigate to study these magnetites with electron
microscopic techniques, (2) to fully characterize the paleomagnetic and rock
magnetic properties, and (3) to integrate these observations with isotopic
characterization (K, Ar, O, C, H) of the magnetites and surrounding mineral
phases.
