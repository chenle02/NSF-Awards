It is recognized that numerical multilinear algebra is playing an increasingly
important role across the sciences and engineering. High-dimensional modeling
has become ubiquitous because of advances in storage technology.
Computatationally-oriented researchers no longer have to be shy about the
involvement of unimaginably large, tensor-structured data sets. For the nation
to maintain its leadership in scientific computing, the NSF needs to review the
progession from matrix-based computational thinking to tensor-based
computational thinking and design a coordinated program that will effectively
support research in this area. We propose to hold a small, invitation-only, two-
day workshop comprised of established researchers that will identify the
important open problems and opportunities for discovery in computational
multilinear algebra. Getting the right mix of talent is crucial and we plan to
assemble representatives from key application areas together with experts in
large-scale matrix computations, numerical multilinear algebra, high-performance
computing, classical numerical linear algebra, and crucial areas within the
field of programming languages. Based on the discussions at the workshop, a
document of recommendations will be delivered to the NSF one month after the
Workshop.
