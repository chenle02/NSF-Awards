One of the major goals of this research program is the long- term isolation of
a single ionized atom nearly at rest in free space. Using only rf techniques for
observing the normal mode frequencies of the ion, bound to a small
electromagnetic cage called a Penning trap, it will become possible to measure
light- ion masses relative to an appropriate calibration mass with a precision
approaching one part in ten billion. An applied magnetic field forces the ion to
revolve in circular orbits about the field direction at a rate which can be
measured and compared with the corresponding calibration frequency (which may be
obtained from either a single electron, proton, or carbon 12 ion depending on
the particular experiment). The ion of interest and the calibration-ion are
alternately stored in the same apparatus; the ratio of their respective
cyclotron frequencies, corrected for the trapping fields, yields the inverse
mass ratio. A variable magnetic bottle has been incorporated into this trap
which has the effect of externally adjusting the quadratic magnetic field
dependence at trap center. Using this new variable bottle, the proton to
electron mass ratio has been measured as a function of the magnetic field
dependence to yield a uniform-field value accurate to 20 ppb. This ratio will be
used primarily in a consistency check for the next least squares adjustment of
the fundamental constants. Present efforts are concentrating on measuring the
tritium helium-three mass difference which will have a direct bearing on the
measurement of the antineutrino rest mass. On one occasion, one helium-three and
two tritium ions were isolated at the same time yielding the expected result
that the effective cyclotron resonance was shifted according to the ions'
resultant center of mass. In yet another experiment, the deuteron-proton mass
ratio will be measured in order to indirectly yield an independent determination
of the neutron-proton mass ratio.
