The 2003 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Coatings and Films will focus of
response-driven polymeric films and coatings, and will be chaired by Dr. Marek
Urban. The conference will be held in Colby-Sawyer Academy, July 13-18, 2003.
The theme of the conference, Stimuli-Responsive Polymeric Films, will encompass
the following areas of polymer science: Frontiers in Polymer Synthesis, Flow and
Rheology, Film Formation, Frontiers in Photo-Polymerization, Waterborne
Coatings, Functionalized Polymeric Coatings, Corrosion and Barrier Properties,
and Surfaces and Interfaces. Each session will consists of 2-3 presentations on
the most current discoveries. Specific topics will include Modeling and
Prediction of Coatings Properties through the Use of Artificial Neural Networks,
Electrodeposition of Adhering Polymer Films: a Route to Multifunctional
Surfaces, Novel Proton Exchange Membrane Dispersion Coatings for Electroactive
Catalysts, Less Utilized Reactions in Polyurethane Chemistry, Functional
Polyurethane Surfaces, The Flow of Binary Polymeric Fluids Through Patterned
Microchannels, How to Control the Rheology of Mixed Polyelectrolyte Fluids
Through the Polyanion/Polycation Ratio, Photophysical Techniques for Studying
Latex Film Formation, Adhesion and Friction between Polymer Films, Coatings
Prepared from Suspensions of Latex and Functional Inorganic Particles,
Photopolymerization of Thin Polymer Films, Initiators and Catalysts for Rapid
Formation of Coatings, Quest for an Ambient Cure Thermoset Latex Crosslinked
with a Cycloaliphatic Epoxide, Pigment Distribution and Characterization of
Waterborne Coatings, Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Copolymer Emulsions, Why Don't
Barnacles Stick to Silicones?, The Weathering of Paints Made with Thermoplastic
Resins, Using an EIS Corrosion Sensor to Monitor Coating Degradation, Flake-
Filled Barrier Materials, Coatings for Automotive Plastics: Characterization of
Interfacial Properties and Mechanism of Adhesion, Study of Mechanical and
Tribological Properties of Polymeric Films and Coatings in Micro and Nano-Scale
w/Nano-Indenter and Scanning Probe Microscope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF
award is directed to help with travel expanses of junior faculty, postdoctoral
associates, or senior graduate students who are interested in pursuing science
carriers. &lt;br/&gt;
