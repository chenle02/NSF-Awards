This research involves the study of the optical transmission properties of high
temperature superconductors, using free standing ultrathin single crystals and
the exceptionally bright infrared radiation available at the National
Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven. A major part of the research will be
devoted to sample preparation and characterization, including structural and
transport measurements carried out at Stony Brook. The objectives of the present
investigation are to elucidate the nature of the superconducting energy gap in
these compounds, and to study the optically active elementary excitations in the
normal and superconducting states. The optical reflectivity of these materials
is unusual and complex and transmission studies have an inherent advantage of
better accuracy at low frequencies. Materials with magnetic and non-magnetic
dopants, with irradiation induced defects, and with various level of oxygen
deficiency will be prepared and investigated. Studies will also be made of
reference samples of conventional superconductors and quasi two- dimensional
metals.
