The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) proposes to fund student
attendance at the 2009 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
Conference that will be held April 1-4 in Portland, Oregon. The Tapia conference
is unique in that it focuses on underrepresented minorities in Computer Science.
Students will have access to the many researchers and technical presentations at
the conference. In addition, they can present their own work in a poster session
and at a PhD Consortium, giving them the opportunity to get feedback from
discipline specialists. The Tapia Conference provides a supportive environment
for students, allowing them to engage in intellectual discourse with a range of
researchers and to meet peers from other institutions. The students will be able
to build their personal networks and form professional relationships. This award
will also fund travel support for some faculty at MSIs, giving them the
opportunity to accompany their student mentees and make important technical
contacts for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
