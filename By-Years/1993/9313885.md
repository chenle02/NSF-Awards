Professor Kleppa is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Metals,
Ceramics, and Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research
to continue his research in the study of high temperature calorimetry of
refractory materials. The major emphasis of this work is on the thermochemistry
of binary intermetallic compounds. The research emphasizes the following areas
of high-temperature reaction calorimetry: 1) Thermochemistry of alloys of the
lanthanide elements with late transition metals and with noble metals; 2)
Thermochemistry of alloys of Group V transition metals with the late transition
metals; 3) Mixing calorimetry at 1473 K, above temperatures where fused silica
refactories can be used; and 4) New applications of high temperature direct
synthesis calorimetry for studies of the enthalpies of formations between basic
and acidic oxides. There are a number of applications which require materials
which maintain their structural integrity at extremely high temperatures even
beyond the temperature at which silica melts. Binary intermetallic alloys
between transition elements, and between lanthanide elements and transition
metals have excellent refractory properties. Kleppa 's research group is one of
the few remaining groups in the United States which performs systematic
calorimetric studies of binary intermetallic compounds. This research provides
important fundamental insights into the way in which properties of these
materials depend on electronic structures of the metals involved.
