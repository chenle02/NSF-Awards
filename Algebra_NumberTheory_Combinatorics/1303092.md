This project is part of an ongoing research program. It revolves around
understanding how various fundamental algebraic objects occurring in mathematics
---such as rings, class groups, algebraic curves and varieties, and maps
relating such structures---are parametrized. Our goals in understanding these
parametrizations are at least fourfold: 1) to describe how these fundamental
algebraic objects are distributed with respect to their most basic invariants;
2) to discover new invariants of these objects, and their applications; 3) to
develop efficient and practical algorithms for performing computations with
these algebraic objects; and, perhaps most importantly, 4) to discover and
understand how various seemingly different algebraic structures are in fact
closely related to each other. Such parametrizations have been already used by
the PI over the past few years to obtain precise information on the distribution
of number fields with respect to basic invariants such as discriminant and class
number divisibility. Applying refined counting methods to these parametrizations
has led, for example, to a proof of the first known case of the Cohen-Lenstra-
Martinet class number heuristics for higher degree number fields, and other
theorems of this nature are forthcoming. In more recent joint works with Arul
Shankar, Wei Ho, and Dick Gross, theorems on the average sizes of Selmer groups
in families of elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves have been obtained, with
applications to understanding the distributions of rational points on such
curves. We expect several further analogous results on rational points,
divisors, and other data of this kind for algebraic curves and surfaces in the
near future.

The primary purpose of applying for this grant is the support of graduate
students. Many of the projects described above will involve graduate (and
undergraduate) students in an essential way. All these projects involve very
fundamental questions in number theory, and are an excellent way to introduce
and bring students into the subject. Many other mathematicians from various
institutions will also be involved in these projects, which will thus increase
interactions among researchers from many different but related subjects.
