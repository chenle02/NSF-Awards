During its growth the maize shoot progresses through distinct juvenile and
adult phases of vegetative growth and then enters a reproductive phase. Previous
work has suggested that these three phases are regulated by independent, but
interacting developmental programs. The extent of coordination between these
programs will be tested by studying the effect of "early flowering" genes on
phase-specific vegetative traits, and by examining the interaction between these
genes and several mutations that cause the constitutive expression of a juvenile
vegetative program (Tp1, Tp2 and Tp3). To obtain a more complete picture of the
genetic regulation of phase change, several recently identified mutations that
affect the expression of phase specific vegetative traits will be characterized
at a cellular and molecular level. Other genes that regulate phase change will
be identified by screening for suppressors of Tp2, and by screening for
mutations that cause the precocious expression of adult vegetative traits.
Finally, g115, a gene that regulates several juvenile traits, will be cloned by
transposon-tagging.
