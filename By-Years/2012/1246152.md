The composition and concentration of marine aerosols in the Southern Ocean
atmosphere is a key factor needed for our improved understanding of global
climate change. Both the sources (e.g. sea-salt, biogenic, anthropogenic,
mineral dust) and the fluxes of aerosols and cloud condensation and ice nuclei
(CCN; IN) under prevailing atmospheric conditions (e.g. wind speed, temperature,
insolation, precipitation etc.) are poorly known in this harsh and remote
environment. Yet they are essential in understanding aerosol-cloud processing
and subsequent effects on the Earth's radiation budget.

Based on the outcome of a successful MRI award, which developed the Portable
AERosol Observing System (PAEROS), a miniaturized aerosol package will be
deployed remotely on a research cruise in the Southern Ocean (onboard R/V
LMGould) and then in the maritime environment at Palmer Station, Antarctica.
Direct measurements of the size spectra of CCN, aerosol particles that serve as
seeds for cloud formation, are notably poorly observed in high polar and
southern latitudes. The deployment will also allow additional testing of the
autonomous operation of the PAEROS instrumentation under harsh environmental
conditions.
