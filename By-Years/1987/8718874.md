The PI will do theoretical research on superconductivity and other properties of
granular materials. Studies will be made of the superconductive glass state; the
predicted properties of this state have been observed by several groups in
samples of high Tc superconducting oxide ceramics, and are the subject of
intense theoretical and experimental interest. Other proposed work in
superconductivity includes studies of the dynamical properties of
superconducting arrays, both ordered and disordered, and with and without an
applied magnetic field, and various properties of composite and polycrystalline
superconductors. Additional work is proposed in the area of non-linear optical
properties but also including the mechanical properties of a composite of a
brittle and a ductile material, and on Faraday rotation in granular magnetic
materials. The work will be carried out by a variety of methods including
numerical simulations, exact analytic results, and mean-field theories.
