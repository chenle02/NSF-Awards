This ongoing program of research has led to several discoveries in the domain of
early emotional development. First, it made it possible to determine the
infant's repertoire of emotion expressions, which are vital to parent-child
communication and social development. It also found what emotion expressions we
can expect in different situations as the child matures. The research has
demonstrated that mothers' emotion experiences and styles of emotion expression
significantly influence the infants well-being and performance. Finally, the
project has demonstrated that the expressive behaviors of infancy are more than
mere responses to a momentary situation or passing event. Children in the first
two years of life tend to have characteristic ways of expressing their emotions
in response to both happy-playful and more demanding or mildly stressful
situations. The research to be undertaken will show how pre- school children
control or regulate emotion expressions and what patterns of emotion expression
are stable and effective through the first 6-1/2 years of life.
