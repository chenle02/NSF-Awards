The continuing prevalence of GC/MS instrumentation in industrial and academic
research laboratories makes it increasingly important that baccalaureate
chemists gain experience in this technique as an integral part of their
undergraduate education. A primary objective of this project is to give
undergraduate chemistry students at California State University-Hayward hands-on
experience with GC/MS instrumentation and its capabilities for solving problems
in chemical analysis, physical measurements, organic and inorganic synthesis,
qualitative organic analysis, and undergraduate research projects. The
instrument will also introduce students to computer control and spectral library
searching. Additionally, the unit will augment training in other chemistry
courses by providing GC/MS analysis for students of organic chemistry and
illustrative spectra for introductory courses in chemistry.
