The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program project is to
create reliable algorithms for the control of plasma in a fusion reactor. The
approach can be generalized to systems that interact with fluids or structures
and/or systems with delay. This project creates a new framework for optimal
control of systems described by delayed or partial differential equations (PDEs)
based on convex optimization of polynomial variables. A three-step approach is
used: First, optimal control of delayed and partial-differential system is
expressed as convex optimization of positive operators; Second, positive
polynomials are used to parameterize the cone of positive operators; Finally,
Sum-of-Squares and semi-definite programming are used to optimize the positive
polynomials. The result is a sequence of tractable algorithms for direct control
of distributed-parameter systems with decreasing error
bounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structural or fluid components are modeled by
partial differential equations (PDEs) can include plasma in a nuclear fusion
reactor, blood flow around an aneurysm, or vibration in an aircraft wing.
Sources of delay can include control over a network such as the Internet.
Control of systems modeled by PDEs can be challenging due to its complexity.
This project considers the control of nuclear fusion plasma - which has yet to
experimentally sustain a positive net energy production - the resulting
improvement in efficiency may have long-term implications for future worldwide
energy production. The project will leverage international collaboration through
NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) Global Venture Fund
(GVF) co-funding and integrate with local middle and high school programs to
promote energy education as well as building support and public awareness for
high-energy magnetic confinement fusion and its role in the national and global
energy discussion.
