This project will focus in three main directions of scattering theory, namely:
a) understanding scattering poles, b) the Keller-Rubinow conjecture, and c)
understanding the propagation of conormal singularities for semilinear wave
equations in domains with diffractive boundary. These are basic theoretical
studies whose results will impact technologies such as tomography and pattern
recognition.
