9625590 Kirk We propose to measure and analyze device parameters needed to
optimize the performance of the Biopolar Quantum-Well Resonant-Tunneling
Transistor (BiQuaRTT) which is on the cutting edge of quantum device research.
The applications where this device can be most effectively used are low-phase-
noise frequency multipliers for wireless communications, central adder elements
for redundant digit arithmetic processors, and submircon magnetic field sensors.
The preparation of this quantum transistor for these applications requires a
fundamental understanding of the device current-voltage (I-V) behavior, as well
as benchmark measurements of system performance parameters. The research plan
involves a collaboration between the NanoFAB Center at Texas A&amp;M University
and Texas Instruments, Incorporated. ***
