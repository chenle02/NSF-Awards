9506675 Anderson The Guerrero Accelerograph Array consists of 30 strong motion
accelerograph stations in Guerrero and neighboring states of Mexico. It was
installed under NSF Grant CEE 82-19432, and has continued to be fully
operational with subsequent grants from the National Science Foundation
supplemented by support obtained by and from the Instituto de Ingenieria,
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Because of Mexico's high seismicity,
the array is currently producing accelerograms from 50 to 80 earthquakes per
year. The data set includes over 20 significant earthquakes with 10 or more
records each. It has already recorded 4 earthquakes with magnitudes 6.9 or
greater at close range. Most important, it is located in a mature seismic gap,
where an earthquake with magnitude up to 8.2 is considered more likely than at
any other place in North America. This action is to continue support for the
array operations, and for cataloging and distributing the data recorded.
Accelerograms recorded to date are available on the Internet World Wide Web. ***
