9450077 Matute-Bianchi This project, Science and Mathematics Equity (SAME),
involves activities to develop a culture that promotes high achievement in
mathematics and science for girls, particularly Latinos. All activities are
conducted in English and in Spanish. The participants will be involved in a
series of collaborative problem solving activities focused on integrated
mathematics and science. Gender Equity Consortiums (GEC) will form the focus for
gender equity development and dissemination activities with four main
components: (1) a 3 week Lego/Logo summer institute which will involve girls and
their teachers in collaborative problem solving in a new domain. (2) girls will
return to their schools to become peer mentors to other students and to receive
mentoring from university undergraduates (3) teachers will participate in a
staff development program focused on gender equity, and (4) family members will
participate in a workshop designed to help them support the young women in
mathematics and science achievement. A Mathematics/Science/Technology Equity
Team (MSTEAT) will integrate gender equity activities into the county and
university subject matter projects in mathematics and science. Finally, the
project will disseminate the model through an interactive video disk and public
access TV program. ***
