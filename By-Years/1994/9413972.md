This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the SUNY--Geneseo acquire a solid state 300 Mhz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research. The research activity to be
supported includes: (1) the synthesis and characterization of macrocyclic
complexes, (2) the synthesis of lipophilic and aromatic cyclam derivatives, (3)
the synthesis of ferrocenyl cryptands, (4) the hydride addition to
cyclohexanones, and (5) improved methods for mixed Wurtz-like coupling reactions
using Mg(O) and Cu(I). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
