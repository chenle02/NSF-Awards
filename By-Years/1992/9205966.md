Diurnal carbohydrate reserves provide leaves with carbon for export at night and
during times of low photosynthesis, thereby maintaining an uninterrupted supply
of carbon to non- photosynthesizing plant structures for growth, storage and
metabolism. In some plants, like sugar beet and soybean, the diurnal reserve
takes the form of starch, while in other plants, like fava bean and spinach,
sucrose accumulates. The objectives of our program are to identify
systematically (1) how carbon apportionment to sucrose and starch and of export
together are regulated in a way that furnishes a diurnal carbohydrate reserve to
leaves and regulates the current rate of export throughout the day- night cycle
and (2) how photosynthetic carbon assimilation, carbon allocation and export
interact when export is restricted or photosynthesis is increased, both in
plants that accumulate sucrose and those that do not. We will measure changes in
export rates, enzyme activities and metabolite levels in leaves of the two types
of plants when carbon allocation is changed by extending the day or shortening
the previous night. The ways in which restricting export by chilling-induced
slowing of metabolism in the receiving organs or of increasing photosynthesis by
raising CO2 affects photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation will be
compared in sucrose-storing and starch storing plants.
