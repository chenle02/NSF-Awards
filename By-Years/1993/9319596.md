ABSTRACT AST-9319596 Appleton &amp; Struck-Marcell This project will
concentrate on a rare but important class of colliding and merging galaxies,
namely the colliding "ring" galaxies. The rings are thought to form from a head-
on collision between two galaxies, one of which passed down the spin-axis of the
other. These galaxies are ideal laboratories for exploring the effects of
density-waves on the star formation properties of the host disk galaxy as well
as providing information about the form of the potential in which the gas disk
resides ***.
