9353445 Murray Teams of elementary and secondary school teachers participate in
a series of Earthkeeping programs, in which the process of ecological
restoration is utilized to teach prairie ecology, natural and cultural history.
The program is conducted at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Arboretum over
a period of two years per group of teachers. Two groups of teachers (96 teachers
total) attend two 2-week workshops, meetings and conferences, and field days at
the Arboretum with school classes. In the initial 2-week summer workshop, 16
teachers (teams of 2 teachers each from 8 schools) conduct hands-on ecological
restoration activities -- planning, site analysis and preparation, planting and
management. Teachers learn about the ecology, cultural and natural history of
prairies as they learn how to reconstruct this biological community. They also
experience activities suitable for use in the classroom and have time to develop
curriculum plans. During the subsequent school year teachers and their students
begin to plan and plant a prairie at their school. The 16 teachers return to the
Arboretum the second summer with additional teachers from their respective
schools (4 associate teachers per school on average). Each team of master
teachers teach their colleagues and work with these associates to further
develop curriculum plans and activities. The expanded teams of master and
associate teachers offer inservice sessions on prairie ecology and prairie
restoration for other teachers at their respective schools or districts. ***
