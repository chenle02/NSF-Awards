eight to ten students per year in programs carried out during the Summers, for
two years. Students will be involved in research projects across the interests
of the department faculty, including AI and law, computer visualization, DNA
mapping, medical informatics, distributed computing, neural networks, parallel
architectures, and others. Students will be selected from institutions across
the country based on selection criteria which include quality of background,
research potential, diversity, and representation of underrepresented groups.
Students will be matched to research professors based on faculty and students
interests and prospects of success. The students will utilize all of the
research facilities of the department including parallel processors, graphics
systems, multimedia networking facilities, and the high-bandwidth switching
network developed at the University. ***
