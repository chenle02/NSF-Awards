The proposed project deals with kinetic-MHD theory of low frequency
instabilities and satellite data analysis of particle and wave to understand the
excitation mechanisms of internally excited ultra low frequency (ULF) magnetic
pulsations observed in the magnetosphere. The studies will provide important
theoretical basis and techniques for computing new stability parameters from
satellite particle data associated with ULF magnetic pulsations observed in the
magnetosphere. Transverse waves are probably driven unstable by releasing free
energy associated with oxygen ion velocity space bump-on-tail distribution or
its pressure gradient via wave-particle resonances. Preliminary research results
have revealed many new and important features of the physics of ULF waves and
the related plasma properties.
