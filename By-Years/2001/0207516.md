The objective of this research is to quantify the light from the overcast sky
using spectroradiometry and digital imaging to measure the photometric,
colorimetric, and polarimetric properties of the light with high spectral,
spatial, and temporal resolution. These observations, taken under different
meteorological conditions, will constitute a better description of the physical
characteristics of skylight than hitherto available and thus provide a new
standard for evaluating different atmospheric radiative transfer models. Broader
impacts of the work include contributing not only to atmospheric optics, but
also to the understanding of cloud effects on radiative transfer and climate and
to the education of undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
