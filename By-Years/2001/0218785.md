This project will manage the coordination, synthesis, data collection and
outreach for the PARCS (Paleoenvironmental Arctic Sciences) component of the
ARCSS (Arctic System Science) Program. These activities will provide overall
coordination of PARCS research to maximize its scientific impact and
productivity. To achieve its goals, the PARCS Science Committee (SC) will
support: (1) data and science management, (2) workshops and Working Group
meetings to coordinate regional-scale projects and integration of specific data
sets to address the two research priorities, (3) a PARCS Community Meeting to
assess the outcome of research on the two priority topics and formulate new
research priorities and collaborations, and (4) outreach efforts to disseminate
information on current PARCS activities and the results of the PARCS research
efforts.
