Strategic and societal concerns are driving current research and engineering
efforts to produce more fuel-efficient, less polluting vehicles in the United
States. Associated pollution problems such as the production of photochemical
smog and ozone, with their adverse health effects are also important and
compelling reasons to develop advanced methods of control for next generation
vehicle engines. Advanced technology engines presently achieve emissions
reduction by utilizing multi-point fuel injection, high compression ratios and
high swirl combustion chamber design and by incorporating exhaust gas after-
treatment using catalytic convertors. Future engine design will be significantly
more radical in approach and will utilize lean burn combustion to meet
increasingly strict emissions regulations. Currently envisioned ICE designs will
utilize an array of control and performance sensors. Under a NSF and OSTP Clean
Car sponsored program, NeuroDyne, the University of South Carolina, West
Virginia University, and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are
collaborating as an interdisciplinary research team in the development of
advanced lean-burn engine control for reducing pollution and enhancing fuel
economy in existing automobiles. NeuroDyne, Inc., proposes to leverage this
program to investigate the integration of advanced sensor technology with
intelligent sensor processing and control methods to enhance the performance and
efficiency of next generation vehicle engines.
