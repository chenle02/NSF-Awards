This project addresses several important problems in the areas of tribology,
mechanics, and precision engineering. The tribology effort concentrates on
improved seal design and the mechanics of wear. The mechanics work focuses on
nonlinear phenomena in dynamic systems. Lastly, the precision engineering
activity addresses design and implementation of magnetostrictive devices for use
in active structures.
