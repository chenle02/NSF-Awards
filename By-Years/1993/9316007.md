9316007 Kao This award provides funds for equipment needed for plant and plant
protoplast work. Work will continue on biochemical characterization of structure
and function of brome mosaic virus replication proteins and will begin on
studies of the replication of the single-stranded DNA geminiviruses. %%%
Anticipated results from this research should advance our current understanding
of the replication mechanism of plant viruses. A better understanding of these
processes will allow for better strategies in plant disease reduction as well as
providing insight on the workings of other plant and animal viruses. ***
