The Teaching Mathematics Methods Using Interactive Videodisc Project will
develop an interactive videodisc instructional program to prepare preservice
elementary teacher to integrate content, manipulatives, methods, and learning
styles into their mathematics teaching. This project will be a collaborative
effort involving mathematics educators from Arizona State University, classroom
teachers from local school districts, elementary education preservice teachers
and the projects' advisory board. The instructional package will consist of one
Level three interactive videodisc containing instructional segments. The
interactive videodisc instructional segments will be composed of animation, a
master university professor teaching mathematics with manipulative materials,
and exemplary classroom teachers using the manipulatives with first, third, and
fifth grade students. Included in the project are the development of a printed
instructor's guide and computer software with Hypercard stacks to access
designed programs that will emulate the use of content, manipulatives, methods,
and learning styles in the elementary classroom. The cost sharing will be thirty
percent of the NSF portion.
