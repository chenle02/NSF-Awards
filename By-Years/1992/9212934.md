The history of science in America cannot be discussed without acknowledging the
central role that James McKeen Cattell (1860- 1944) played in its development.
He was a psychologist trained in Europe whose first experiments led directly to
the formation of behavioralist psychology, and he originated the first program
of mental tests in 1890 as part of a goal of creating an applied psychology. Yet
his major contribution to science was not in the field in which he was trained.
For Cattell played a major role in the emergence of Columbia University and the
New York scientific community; he was a long-time owner and editor of the
journal Science as well as a number of other important scientific periodicals;
he created American Men of Science (now American Men and Women of Science) and
controlled for many years the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. His mark thus remains indelibly on the major institutions of modern
American science. Dr. Sokal is undertaking a major study of Cattell's life and
work. Dr. Sokal argues that Cattell approached his work with an understanding of
science rooted in the 19th century. He plans to trace how Cattell's 20th century
significance emerged directly from his 19th century attitudes. This study
promises to enhance our understanding of how American science came to be
organized as it is today.
