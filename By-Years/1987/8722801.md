The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program funds research which
explores the fundamental chemistry associated with reactions involving organic
molecules and transition metal complexes. Research in this area will provide
knowledge of reaction pathways between metals and organics which will be
important in areas such as surface science, material science and heterogeneous
catalysis. The goal of this project is the development of detailed mechanistic
understanding of reactions between organic molecules and transition metal
complexes. One focus of this project is the metal-mediated formation of carbon-
carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, since such processes are central to the
construction of complex carbon frameworks from simple ones. In addition,
emphasis will be placed on organometallic reactions that are involved in the
formation of carbon-nitrogen and carbon-oxygen bonds, as substantially less is
known at present about these transformations. The project also involves
collaborative studies designed to enhance understanding of reaction mechanisms
and explore new areas in which organometallic chemistry might have an impact.
These include experiments designed to study the thermodynamics of organometallic
reactions, measure the rapid rates of reaction of coordinatively unsaturated and
paramagnetic intermediates, attach oriented metal-based molecules to electrodes,
and examine the possibility of utilizing metal complexes bound to antibodies as
catalysts having high specificities.
