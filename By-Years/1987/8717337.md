The research concerns the study of nonequilibrium properties of dense fluids and
continues previous work carried out by the PI. The problems to be considered are
of two types: 1) dynamical properties of viscous fluids and their freezing in a
glassy state. Emphasis is placed on the study of the slowing down of the
relaxation of degrees of freedom that are important in real glass-forming
fluids, such as orientational correlations and compositional disorder. 2)
Nonequilibrium phase transitions to and from states characterized by ordering on
molecular length scales, such as shear induced melting and freezing. An
important objective of this study is to make some progress toward establishing a
general framework for the description of these phenomena. A generalization of
the equilibrium theory of freezing is proposed to describe discontinuous
nonequilibrium phase transition.
