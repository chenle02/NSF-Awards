CAREER: Future Values: Reshaping the Future of Instruction Level Parallelism

Abstract

This research aims at providing an effective solution to the fetch problem of
instruction level parallel processors. With the concept of "future values", one
can represent traditional programs in a new control-flow form such that on any
control flow path the data-flow aspect of the computation is either traditional
(i.e., definition of a value precedes its consumers), or reversed (i.e.,
consumers of a value precedes its definition). The representation hence allows
ordering of instructions even when the data dependencies would prohibit doing so
in a control-flow graph. As a result, it is possible to seamlessly exploit
control independence, use predication to eliminate any branch instruction, and
design processors, which can reuse the internally generated dataflow graph as
another source of instructions.

This approach has the potential to significantly impact the design of processors
and optimizing compilers, and positively affect every field of science and
commerce that relies on processor performance. The project will also result in
course materials and software tool sets that will be made publicly available.
Finally, the project will contribute greatly to the development of the recently
initiated Computer Science Ph.D. program at Michigan Technological University.
