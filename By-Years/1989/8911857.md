The purpose of this two-year research project is to solve the problem encounter
by behavioral researches of not being able to identify a vocalizing delphinid or
other cetacean when the animal is in a group. In order to solve this problem, a
methodologywill be designed, constructed, and tested which can be used to
identify vocalizers. At the successful completion of the project, other
researchers will be able to benefit from this equipment and methodology needed
to understand the auditory cognitive process in delphinids and cetaceans.
