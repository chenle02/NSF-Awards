This three year project, sponsored by Beaver College, will provide a four week
summer programs for thirty teachers each year to learn the basic science
concepts of modern psychology. Topics will include psychology, sensation,
perception, learning, memory and cognition. In the project teachers will learn
how to set up laboratory experiments, carry out classroom demonstrations and
learn statistical principles to illustrate psychology concepts to their
students. By the end of the summer the teachers will have developed lesson plans
in each topic area and will be given curriculum materials which can be used upon
returning to the schools. the follow-up portion of the project includes
presentation of teaching modules at regional workshops and classroom visits by
project staff to aid in the implementation of the new materials into the
classroom. The college and schools are providing a 13% match to the NSF grant.
