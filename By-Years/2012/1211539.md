The goal of this project is to use the Event Horizon telescope, a network of
millimeter-wave antennas distributed throughout the world, to image the environs
of SgrA*, the site of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The
awardees will conduct a broad program of scientific research that includes
analyzing (sub)mm VLBI observations, simulating theoretical models on
Schwarzschild Radius scales, and developing new software tools for VLBI
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach via high-school teacher hands-
on experience and mentoring of pre-college students from under-represented
groups.
