Teaching and conducting research in Science and Technology Studies within
engineering and polytechnic universities poses significant challenges and offers
substantial opportunities. This workshop explores these challenges and
opportunities by drawing together STS researchers who work in these contexts
from across the nation at Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology's new
Center for Science, Technology, and Society. The group will discuss big ideas
for advancing Science and Technology Studies in engineering schools, strategies
for developing Science and Technology Studies communities, cohorts, and research
centers in these contexts, and ideas for increasing impacts in engineering
environments. Workshop outcomes will include a set of archived and curated
workshop sessions, a research report, articles in a leading Science and
Technology Studies journals, and the creation of a national community of Science
and Technology Studies scholars interested in these
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together a diverse group
of researchers in Science and Technology Studies to discuss the appropriate role
of Science and Technology Studies in engineering and polytechnical universities,
and to develop collective strategies for overcoming the potential challenges of
working in these environments and for capitalizing on the potential benefits of
doing so. The workshop structure will be informed by recent scholarly reviews of
the state-of-the-field within Science and Technology Studies, and by the
experiences of Science and Technology Studies researchers who have worked in
engineering and polytechnical universities. The workshop will result in
strategic plans for advancing the place and impact of Science and Technology
Studies in technical universities, the creation of a community of Science and
Technology Researchers interested in these issues, and in research reports and
scholarly articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
