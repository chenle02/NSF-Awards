In this research program, self-assembling arrays of molecules will be
constructed that are photoactive and will mimic some of the essential features
of natural light harvesting complexes. Porphyrin chromophores will be assembled
so as to form antennae that facilitate energy migration between porphyrin
molecules and subsequent energy transfer to a trap, where a chemical reaction
can be initiated. Each antenna will be assembled by spontaneous self-
association, by multi-point hydrogen bonding of heterocycles that are covalently
bonded to the porphyrin ring. One, two, or four such heterocycles will be bonded
to a single porphyrin ring such that dimers, polymolecular ribbons, cyclomers,
and three- dimensional supramolecular arrays will result. In this manner, highly
oriented structures will be formed in solution, in a mesophoric phase, or in the
solid state, each of which has discrete porphyrin chromophores positioned within
the critical distance for excitation energy migration and transfer. %%% This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr. Anthony M.
Harriman at the University of Texas, Austin. The harvesting of light energy for
the synthesis of molecules by plants, whereby chlorophyll is the energy
harvesting system, is of obvious importance. This is a complex process in
nature, where an array of chlorophyll molecules are assembled for the task of
light harvesting. The porphyrin ring portion of chlorophyll is the light
absorbing unit. In this project, porphyrin rings will be self-assembled and the
transfer of light energy from the porphyrin ring to an appended energy trapping
moiety will be studied. This system will serve to mimic the natural light
harvesting system.
