Abstract

Award: DMS-9971828 Principal Investigator: Eric L. Grinberg

The P.I. will continue to study problems of analysis and geometry on homogeneous
and non-homogeneous spaces. He will use techniques of group representations when
these are available, and microlocal analysis along with integral transforms, and
their generalizations to not-necessarily homogeneous spaces. A major focus of
his program will include Radon transforms on symmetric spaces, especially their
injectivity and restriction properties. He will use symmetric spaces as a guide
to analysis on spaces with less regularity. He will also investigate problems in
geometric inequalities and also several complex variables using ideas closely
related to, but formally distinct from Radon transforms. Finally, he will
consider orbitfold analogs of Radon transforms (or Radon transforms modulo
finite groups) by means of invariant polynomials and enumeration arguments. He
will continue an active program of travel and seminar visitors that has had a
significant impact on the scientific community in North Philadelphia.

Imaging devices are used with increasing frequency in medicine, industry,
science, and information technology. While engineering, computational, and
ergonomic considerations are critical in the design, production and utilization
of these devices, the foundational operating principle is generally
mathematical. Typically, a mathematical theorem says that information may be
recovered from a geometrically defined integral transformation or partial
differential equation. The Radon transform played a critical role in A.Cormack's
pioneering work on the CAT scanner. Today, this transform and its
generalizations play a unifying role in an expanding set of branches of
mathematics. The P.I. will focus on the following areas: 1) geometric
inequalities, which relate properties like volume, width, cross-sections shadow
areas; 2) functions of several complex variables, which may be viewed as data
with great regularity and which play an important role in mathematical analysis
and physics; 3) homogeneous spaces, where the existence of a great deal of
symmetry is assumed and its exploitation is the ultimate goal; 4) finite
analogs, where the continuous harmonic analysis of smooth spaces is replaced by
counting arguments involving finite and discrete sets
