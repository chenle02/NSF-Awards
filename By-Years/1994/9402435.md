9402435 Agrawal This research project develops a comprehensive theory for
assembly in space using free-floating robots. Freely moving systems in space
conserve linear and angular momentum. As moving systems collide with each other,
the velocities get altered due to transfer of momentum. During this project,
strategies are developed for assembly using analytical models of self motion,
propulsion, docking, pock-up, and release, and these strategies are validated in
a free- floating planar robot laboratory facility. Simulations include
commanding dual-arm robots to propel to destinations, dock with a material
table, pick up work pieces, combine into prespecified assemblies, and release on
an assembly platform. Analytical developments, in addition to kinematics and
rigid body dynamics, include impact and collision dynamics of multibody systems.
These robots also have applications on industry work floors for component
handling and assembly tasks. ***
