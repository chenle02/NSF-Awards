An NSF ADVANCE Adaptation grant will support the creation of a supportive campus
community for STEM faculty at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE).
SIUE is a doctoral and professional university with over 13,000 students. The
project will implement three components: recruitment and hiring: Progressive
Recruitment Initiatives Mark Excellence (PRIME); improving departmental climate
and support for female faculty Keeping Educators through Equity Programming
(KEEP); and mitigating bias in the tenure and promotion review processes
University Promotion (UP). This project builds on work from a previous ADVANCE
IT-Catalyst grant which resulted in some changes at SIUE such as stop the tenure
clock and family leave policies. This project will target persistent issues with
climate and culture at SIUE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIUE will implement projects
to enable search committees to conduct better searches with equity advisors,
create an advocates and allies program, create dean and department chair
toolkits and implement equity scorecards, train tenure and promotion committees
on un-conscious bias, coordinate with dual career staff, and create leadership
opportunities for STEM faculty. The Adaptation project aligns with and supports
the institutional strategic plan and mission of the institution. SIUE
anticipates that the ADVANCE Adaptation project will result in changes in the
culture and climate of the organization which will enhance the recruitment,
retention, promotion and success of all STEM faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes,
practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Adaptation"
awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based
strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as
non-academic, non-profit organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
