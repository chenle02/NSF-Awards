Aspects of cavity QED related to the quantum measurement process and the
interface between quantum and classical physics are studied. The studies include
the generation and detection of macroscopically separated quantum states
(Schroedinger cats), cotangent states of the electromagnetic field and on new
mechanisms combining cavity QED effects with the mechanical manipulation of
atomic trajectories by light. Two of the most exciting subfields of quantum
optics, cavity QED and atom optics will merge and should enable new ground to be
broken in the study of fundamental questions in light- matter interactions.
