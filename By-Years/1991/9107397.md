This proposal will extend the long-term studies of genetics, ecology and
behavior of African lions. The study includes two contrasting populations. The
Serengeti contains a very large outbred population whereas the population in
Ngorongoro Crater is descended from 15 founders and has been genetically
isolated for five generations. Future work will investigate why the Center
population has comparable variability in minisatellite DNA to the Serengeti,
whether the inbred Crater population is immunologically impaired as a result of
its loss of diversity in MHC genes, and whether declining reproductive
performance in the Crater population is due to persistent inbreeding. Because
many species of large mammals are increasingly restricted to small ecological
"islands" and are hence subject to increasing levels of inbreeding, this
research will be valuable in assessing the kinds of genetic and epidemiological
problems that may commonly affect such small populations. Ecological studies
will focus on the factors that regulate lion population size and test whether
density dependence directly operates on the number of individuals in the
population or on the number of groups. Finally, behavioral studies will focus on
the unusually long period of dependency of subadult lions. The protracted
development of young lions is more typical of primates and suggests that
subadults which remain in their natal prides for longer periods may become more
proficient foragers (both as hunters and as scavengers). Subadults play an
active role in defending the pride territory against neighboring groups, and
this proposal will explore the ontogeny of territorial behavior of subadults
with playback experiments.
