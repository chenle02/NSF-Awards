The end-linking of functionally-terminated polymer chains will be used to
obtain a variety of elastomers of known and controlled structure. This technique
will be used to achieve a better molecular understanding of rubberlike
elasticity and to obtain materials of unusually attractive mechanical
properties. Typical polymers investigated will be polyisobutylene, polyacrylates
and methacrylates, with both unimodal and multimodal network chain- length
distributions and with known numbers of dangling-chain irregularities.
Properties will include stress-strain isotherms, strain-induced crystallization,
and birefringence. Some cyclics will be used in trapping measurements in such
reactions and in the preparation of "Olympic" networks. Additional studies will
include unusual materials (such as some gels useful in the preparation of high-
performance materials, liquid-crystalline elastomers, spider-web silk, and
polypeptides), and some will employ less-common deformations (biaxial extension,
shear, and torsion). Novel reinforcing fillers will be prepared by the
hydrolysis, photolysis, or thermolysis of organometallic materials such as
silicates, titanates, aluminates, etc. The resulting filled elastomers will be
characterized primarily by mechanical property measurements, electron
microscopy, and X-ray and neutron- scattering techniques.
