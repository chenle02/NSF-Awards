The objective of the proposed program is to develop a prototype of a novel large
area, thin film, microwave diamond deposition reactor. Present microwave
reactors for the deposition of thin diamond and diamond-like films from the gas
phase are limited to small diameters, typically 2-3". The possibility of
achieving larger area thin films would open new possibilities for these coatings
which possess unique corrosion, chemical, electrical, optical and hardness
properties. There are direct commercial applications for such films in a variety
of markets. The proposed reactor design exploits the physics of microwave plasma
formation to generate a spatially uniform flux of chemically excited process gas
to the substrate on which the thin film is grown. In order to attain this
uniform flow, however, neutral gas fluid flows, plasma generation and microwave
coupling must be carefully modeled in order to provide design tools with which
to refine initial proof of principle prototypes. In Phase I these modeling tools
would be developed and a prototype design working drawings created. In Phase II,
the prototype would be built and optimized.
