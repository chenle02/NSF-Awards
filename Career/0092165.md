The investigator studies problems in algebraic geometry related to families of
higher dimensional varieties. The main goal of the project is to find good
definitions of compact moduli functors, with special regard to the moduli theory
of surfaces. As part of the moduli theory project special efforts are devoted to
reflexive sheaves and their behavior with respect to morphisms in an effort to
develop a theory that includes many results for reflexive sheaves of rank 1 that
are similar to results already known for line bundles. This is very important in
order to develop a moduli theory of singular varieties, which in turn is
essential for geometrically meaningful compact moduli spaces. Another problem
the investigator is studying is generalizations of Shafarevich's conjecture and
its applications to the case of higher dimensional bases, in particular the
problem of boundedness and rigidity for families of varieties of general type.
This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved
problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest
form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field
uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science
cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic
geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn an important
part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is
that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the
way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in
theoretical physics. Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on
how an object is changing in space-time. This project focuses on compact moduli
spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give
additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially
different from others. Presently the existence of compact moduli spaces is known
for low dimensional problems. The investigator is studying the higher
dimensional case. As part of the project, but somewhat independent of the above,
the investigator and his graduate students are running a website that works as a
forum for graduate students and young researchers in algebraic geometry. Users
of this website can pose questions that are likely to be known to experts but
not available in the literature. The main goal of this project is to open a new
venue for a larger number of students to access the knowledge of experts in the
field helping to achieve a more equal opportunity environment. In addition, the
collected database provides references to results that are too "small" to occupy
an entire article, but too important to ignore, as well as a collection of
potential research problems for graduate students.
