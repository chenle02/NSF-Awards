The project will study the accuracy of the distributed, physically-based model
KINEROS as applied to a semi-arid watershed and as used for the forecasting of
flash floods. In semi- arid and arid watersheds flash floods are frequent
producing loss of life and property, and warning systems (FFWS) are some of the
tools used to mitigate these effects. The current FFWS do not include recent
advances in the methods for hydro-meteorological data collection and analysis
that makes real-time warning systems possible. This study will examine existing
quality rainfall-runoff data from the 150 square kilometers, semi-arid Walnut
Gulch Experimental Watershed, the effects of small scale variability of
rainfall, the characteristics of the runoff processes at the watershed scale and
its implications for flash flood forecasting.
