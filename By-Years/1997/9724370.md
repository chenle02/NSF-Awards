This request for infrastructure from MRI/OMA will allow research groups of
physicists and students at Hampton University to develop and construct a
sophisticated tracking device: a Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, in Geneva,
Switzerland. This proposal will allow underrepresented minorities to participate
in the highest priority future experiment of the EPP program, in collaboration
with physicists from other universities in the US and aboard, and in
collaboration with nearby Jefferson Laboratory. Surface characterization and
process control using keV X-rays; imaging applications, including biological
imaging and imaging for inspections; detectors for astrophysical applications
are possible future uses of these detectors.
