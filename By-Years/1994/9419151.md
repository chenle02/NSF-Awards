This researches the numerical modeling of gravity wave breaking and instability,
wave transports of energy and momentum, wave spectral evolution, and the
generation and evolution of, and mixing induced by, wave-generated turbulence.
Wave influences in the atmosphere, only qualitatively understood, can only be
addressed in a comprehensive manner using numerical techniques because of the
complexity (and nonlinearity) of the important interactions. The proposed
studies will also identify the processes that act most strongly to control the
spectral evolution of the wave field and assess the validity of the various
theories that have been advanced to account for the observed spectral behavior
with altitude.
