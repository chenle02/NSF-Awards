9409121 Pizziconi The research proposed in this application is concerned with
the feasibility of an immunobiosensor design based upon sensitized mast cells
immobilized over the sensing junction of a thin-film thermopile. Antibody on the
sensitized mast cells will activate the cell in the presence of antigen, causing
a exothermic reaction that will result in very small temperature increases.
These temperature increases are detected by the thermopile as the output
measure. The project involves microcalometric characterization of cell
activation, studies of methods of mast cell immobilization and development of
prototype sensors. This research further amplifies a technique using living
biological cells as the component in a sensor system by understanding mast cell
activation processes. It will also extend bioanalytical sensor research into
devices based upon reticuloendothelial cells. ***
