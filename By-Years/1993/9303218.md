The investigator wishes to continue with his developments of aspects of
sumanifold theory and the geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian geometry.
Particular attention will be paid to those hypersurfaces where the principal
curvature function has constant multiplicity. Incorporated in the program is the
support of an undergraduate research assistant who will be writing a
dissertation under the investigator's directorship.
