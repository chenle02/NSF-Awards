The goal of this research is to develop systematically new organic
semiconductors, metals, and superconductors through a detailed understanding and
chemical control of the electronic properties. The research will initially focus
on the synthesis of tetramethyltetratellurafulvalene and its charge-transfer and
complex radical cation salts; preparation of a series of
dicyclobutenotetrachalcogenafulvalenes and their corresponding salts; and the
synthesis of a number of tetraoxafulvalenes and their salts. To guide the
synthetic program, studies will be conducted on physical properties, electrical
conductivity, themoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility, and scanning
tunneling microscopy on these salts as well as on new charge- transfer and
complex radical cation salts from known donors. The next generation of
microelectronic devices is likely to depend on the development of new organic,
organometallic, and inorganic materials. Thus, the aim of this research is to
develop systematically new organic semiconductors, metal, and superconductors
through a detailed understanding and chemical control of the electronic
properties. The research will initially focus on the synthesis of selected
compounds and their charge- transfer and complex radical cation salts. To guide
the synthetic program, studies will be conducted on physical properties,
electrical conductivity, thermoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility, and
scanning tunneling microscopy on these salts and on new charge-transfer and
complex radical cation salts from known donors. A number of new chemical and
physical studies are designed to help elucidate the switching and memory
mechanism in metal-organic charge transfer salts.
