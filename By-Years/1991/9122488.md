Models using survey data typically assume that respondents report their
behavior accurately. In fact, however, these models may be flawed due to bias
and imprecision in the survey data collection process. The sources of error of
self-reports are numerous, reflecting a combination of the characteristrics of
individual respondents and the nature of the survey instrument and the way it is
administered. This research focuses on gender differences in self-reporting on
several topics, including sexual behavior, where primary emphasis is put,
illicit drug use and abortion. It will be carried out in conjunction with the
investigators' National Center for Health Statistics project entitled,
"Cognitive Research on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention". Numerous
surveys, both in the United States and in other countries, have shown that men
report more sex partners than women do. This difference persists even when
homosexual partners are excluded and when adjustments are made for extreme
values, item non-response, population size, and related matters. The differences
become larger as the time frame covered by the questions grow longer. The most
plausible explanation for the difference is that the two genders differ in the
direction and/or magnitude of their response errors -- either the men are
overreporting, the women underreporting, or both. A series of related studies
will be carried out to examine these gender differences in the reports of sexual
partners as well as reports on other sexual behaviors, drug use, and abortions.
They consist of 1) cognitive interviews exploring the understanding of sexual
terms and willingness to discuss sexual matters, 2) a bogus pipeline experiment
to test whether assumed validation of self-reports will change the reports of
men and women, 3) a survey experiment to test differences in response format,
recall cues, and interviewing staff, 4) a second survey experiment to test
differences in mode of administration, place of interview, questionaire context,
and question wording, and 5) a third survey experiment to test anonymity vs.
confidentiality. These studies should identify the factors that lead to
misreports of sensitive behaviors about sexual partners, abortions, and drug
use; contribute to the design of an optimal measurement strategy; and provide
improved estimates of the true incidence levels of these sensitive behaviors. It
is crucial that work of this sort be conducted, particularly in view of
questions raised by the AIDS epidemic and the potential extent of its
applications.
