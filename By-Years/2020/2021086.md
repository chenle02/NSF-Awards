In many parts of the United States flooding from storm surge and intense
rainfall is occurring against a backdrop of rising seas, intrusion of salt
water, and stronger and wetter storms. Sustaining health and prosperity as these
dynamics play out requires anticipation of the long-term implications and design
of effective mitigation strategies. Efforts must draw on integrated data
regarding vulnerability to floods and wind, how specific events affect
communities and habitats, effectiveness of programs that support recovery and
resilience, and how behaviors and outcomes evolve over multiple years in
impacted areas. This project will generate and analyze these data for eastern
North Carolina, which will help project how the storms of the future will affect
migration, economic well-being, health, and ecosystems of coastal regions more
generally. The team combines scientists from engineering, earth and marine
sciences, population sciences, and policy and planning, providing opportunities
to train students at a range of levels in interdisciplinary science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transformational adaptation and mitigation strategies for
hazards in coastal regions require a convergent approach, integrating methods,
insights, and data from the social sciences, the natural sciences, and
engineering and geosciences. The goals of this project are to 1) integrate
conceptual frameworks, approaches, data, and analytical tools from four broad
perspectives: engineering, environmental sciences, population sciences, and
policy and planning, 2) develop fine-grained measures of risk and event-specific
intensity of exposure by combining geophysical models with information extracted
from satellite imagery 3) develop a data collection strategy that combines
survey research with publicly available data and that embeds a multi-level
approach and a multi-year time-horizon, and 4) develop approaches and associated
tools to predict the impacts of floods and storms of the future on multiple
facets of people and places. The results will inform the design of effective
strategies for mitigating impacts of extreme events for places and
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
