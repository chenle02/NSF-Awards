This award provides partial funding of a workshop in professional communications
skills to be held just prior to the national meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, 5 May, 1991. This workshop will provide basic training in
effective communications skills appropriate for academic science faculty. These
exercises in which the attendees will participate are based on the strategies of
neurolinguistic programming (NLP) developed at the University of California by
John Grinder and others. NLP training has been widely used in professional and
organizational development since the late 1970's. The workshop is especially
appropriate for academic scientists who have little opportunity (compared to
their colleagues in the business world) for training in the "people skills" so
important for mentoring, running a research team, negotiating the steps to
promotion and tenure, etc. Since effective communication and the ability to
manage/motivate others are fundamental prerequisites for professional
advancement in every field, this workshop is especially appropriate for women
and minority scientists.
