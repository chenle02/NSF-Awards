9706603 Johnson Volcanoes in Hawaii are among the most active on Earth. However,
due to their high rates of eruption and subsidence, direct documentation of
their temporal evolution is lacking. This project will use samples from three
deep (~2 km) drill cores in Kilauea Volcano's Lower East Rift Zone to study
magmatic processes and plume evolution in the type oceanic hotspot. The goals of
this project are: (1) to document the diversity of primitive magmas, preserved
as melt inclusions, in the Kilauea plumbing system over more than 100 Ka of
Kilauea's history, (2) to record the change in source compositions over time,
(3) to determine volumetric proportions of magmatic components contributing to
Kilauea lavas through time, and (4) to evaluate connectivity of the plumbing
systems of Kilauea and Mauna Loa. This study, together with an ongoing deep
drilling study at Mauna Kea, an older volcano on Hawaii, can provide a much
longer time-series of Hawaiian plume evolution than would be possible by
conventional field sampling. This will not only enhance our understanding of the
evolution of the Hawaiian plume, but will provide a benchmark for studying other
hotspot volcanoes.
