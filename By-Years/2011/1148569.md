With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is funding Professor Gary
Sulikowski of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University to explore
the development of synthetic methods to access structural complex and rare
marine diterpene natural products. A number of complex marine diterpenes, such
as bielschowskysin, display interesting biological activity (tumor cell growth
inhibition, antimalarial properties), but are either no longer available from
their natural source, or of limited availability. The unique molecular structure
of bielschowskysin and related marine diterpenes requires the development of new
methods and strategies to assemble its unique
architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include co-worker
training in a multi-disciplinary environment through the inclusion of biomedical
researchers on the project, and continuing to build a program in the biological
study of natural products. This work could lead to more efficient methods for
the preparation of marine natural products. The chemistry developed during the
course of these studies will have a broad impact in areas ranging from the
pharmaceutical, chemical, and biotechnology industries to basic biological and
chemical research endeavors. In addition, this project will provide excellent
training of students, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from
groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
