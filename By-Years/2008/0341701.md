With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will
acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometers. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out studies on a) organometallic chemistry; b) dendrimer research and
applications in development of electronic devices and photosynthetic mimics; c)
conducting organic materials; d) supramolecular materials; e) development of
molecular devices based on supramolecular chemistry; and f) development of new
MRI contrast agents and radiopharmaceuticals for site-specific treatment of
tumors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in materials
chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
