A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State
University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The
request includes:

1) GPS Based Network Time Server 2) Multicorer Refurbishment 3) Acoustic Testing
on R/V WECOMA 4) Double-Rate Pingers

Broader Impacts: The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its
shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research
projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research
program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researcher.
