This project is for computer laboratory equipment to support the development of
an integrated land and water resources analysis curriculum. Lancaster County
Pennsylvania offers excellent opportunities for studying interactions between
land use activities and the resulting impacts on local water quantity and
quality, and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. We propose to integrate and enhance
three courses--a GIS course, a hydrology course and a water resource management
course-- through the use of computers. This proposal will allow undergraduate
students to develop a better understanding of environmental systems. They will
also gain meaningful experience with two major uses of computers in
environmental analysis, namely GlS and simulation.
