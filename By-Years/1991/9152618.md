The goal of this project is to improve an introductory course, Concepts in the
Biomedical Sciences, and thus provide an enriched experience for the several
hundred non-science majors at this state teachers college who normally enroll in
the course to meet their teacher education and general education requirements.
The MacIntosh computers, printer, and software, and videomicroscopy equipment
acquired allow the instructors to communicate concepts and tasks more
effectively, increase hands-on experience for the students, enhance the
student's quantitative skills, and better prepare students for entry into a
human-focused, cell/molecular-based biology program.
