The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the underlying kinetic
processes that are responsible for intricate surface patterns observed in both
synthetic soft materials and biological systems. With high mechanical
flexibility and chemical tunability similar to biological tissues, hydrogel-like
soft materials have been exploited recently as soft active materials in
biomedical and bio-inspired devices for a wide range of applications, including
drug delivery, tissue engineering, microscale sensors and actuators. It has also
been recognized that the swelling behavior of hydrogel-like soft materials could
be used to unravel some of the universal physical processes at work during
biological growth. Motivated by experimental observations, the proposed research
will develop a kinetics approach with analytical and numerical methods for the
study of surface instability patterns in soft materials, such as wrinkles and
creases. These instability phenomena reflect the typically complex behaviors of
soft materials, where mechanics is inherently coupled with chemistry and
multiphysical interactions (e.g., thermal, electrical, optical,
etc.).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed study will
significantly enhance fundamental understanding on the physical nature of soft
materials in both synthetic and biological systems. The theoretical and
computational tools developed in the proposed research will enable
characterization and design of soft materials for active device applications.
Education and outreach activities will be integrated within the proposed project
to enhance its societal impacts. The proposed project will open ample research
opportunities for broad participation including graduate, undergraduate,
minority and female students. The results from the research will be incorporated
into graduate and undergraduate courses. The outcomes of the research and
education activities will be broadly disseminated to the academic community as
well as the general public.
