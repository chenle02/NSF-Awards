This Small Business Innovation Research project is for a novel radiation
detector which has the potential to provide the commercial sector and government
with a simple, low cost, room temperature radiation detector with extremely high
energy resolution. The detector requires no cryogenic cooling, is planned to be
extremely rugged and provide efficient and accurate identification of x-rays and
gamma-rays from 50keV to lOMeV. It will have an intrinsic energy resolution far
superior to any scintillation detector currently available and will approach
that of cryogenically cooled germanium. The researchers at SenTor have been
investigating highly purified xenon gas near the critical point as a room
temperature detection medium. Xenon gas in this thermodynamic regime has proven
to be ideally suited for room temperature radiation detection. An xenon
ionization chamber detector constructed in a cylindrical geometry provides the
additional opportunity to perform Compton suppression through pulse shape
discrimination. A cylindrical ionization chamber xenon x-ray/gamma-ray detector
represents a significant advancement in high resolution, room temperature
radiation detection and could be used in such diverse applications as treaty
verification, hazardous waste monitoring, deep well logging, x-ray and gamma-ray
astrophysics and medical diagnostics.
