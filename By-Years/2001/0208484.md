This Social and Behavioral Sciences Post-Doctoral Fellowship research program
focuses on the relationship between information structure and prosodic structure
in language. This work has two objectives. The first is to understand how the
information status of words (e.g. their newness, oldness, or focus status)
influences intonational phrasing in language production. The second goal is to
understand how listeners interpret intonational phrase boundaries and pitch
accents in on-line language comprehension. This research program also has two
primarily methodological goals. The first goal is to test a new paradigm for
eliciting spontaneous speech from participants in the lab. The second goal is to
use an eye-tracking paradigm to explore the interpretation of prosodic
information in language comprehension. The researcher will pursue a set of
experiments will explore the relationship between information structure and
prosodic structure. The experiments are as follows: Production Experiments: the
first set of experiments explores the effects of discourse status on
intonational boundary placement in reading. The second set of experiments
explores the affects of discourse status on intonational boundary placement in
spontaneous speech. Comprehension Experiments: the third set of experiments
investigates the points at which intonational boundary information is used in
the interpretation of an utterance. The fourth set of experiments use the eye-
tracking paradigm to determine the point at which pitch accents are interpreted.
Differences in the semantic interpretation of pitch accents are also
investigated. The PI, Dr. Duane Watson, will be under the mentorship of Dr.
Michael K. Tanenhaus at the University of Rochester Department of Brain and
Cognitive Sciences.
