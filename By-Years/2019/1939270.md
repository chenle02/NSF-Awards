postdoctoral associates and young professionals who will attend the first
AfroBiotech conference which will be held October 27-29, 2019. The venue for the
inaugural AfroBiotech conference is Atlanta, home of the emerging Georgia
biotech corridor. The conference will focus on discoveries, innovations, and
achievements from African-American scientists and engineers in biotechnology. It
will highlight the contributions of this underrepresented group to solving
current problems and demonstrate the power of a diverse engineering community.
By organizing African-American scientific talent from across the U.S. at a
single event, the conference will to enable diverse professionals to choose the
right career paths, inspire organizers of other scientific conferences to invite
diverse speakers, and inspire the next generation of diverse students and
scholars to join this community. The conference will provide a venue for a new
generation of diverse biotechnology professionals. It will include scientific
presentations from a diverse group of leading biology, chemistry, mathematics
and engineering researchers and highlight achievements of African Americans in
biotechnology. It will encourage active participation and networking of Ph.D.
students and postdoctoral researchers, who represent the future of biotechnology
and will encourage interdisciplinary dialogue among professionals working in
numerous fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
