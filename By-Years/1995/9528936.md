ABSTRACT OPP-9528936 Chagnon/Ziker This dissertation research project will test
the proposition that Siberian peoples are becoming more integrated with the
Russian and global market economy. Although microeconomic theory and
ethnographic reports support this hypothesis for many regions, there is reason
to question it for the Siberian north. Since the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, native people across Siberia are instituting "family and clan" farms.
They are replacing the State Farm economy and may represent greater autonomy on
the part of native people. The project will generate both quantitative and
qualitative data from household surveys, interviews and participant observation
in the community of Ust Avan. These data will be used to analyze and compare
family/clan farms with the State Farm system, modes of exchange, patterns of
land and resource use and ethnicity.
