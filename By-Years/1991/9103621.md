In this project the principal investigator will study the phase transition
between the Haldane phase and the dimerized phase in the spin-1 Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic, one-dimensional quantum spin system. In particular, he will
prove that this phase transition does indeed exist by showing that an order-
parameter proposed for this transition is zero in one phase and nonzero in the
other. In addition, the principal investigator will continue his rigorous study
of the majority rule renormalization group transformation for Ising-type
systems. Finally he will study the existence of continuous spectra for the
infinite volume limit of the Hamiltonian of a quantum spin system. The behavior
of matter at the microscopic scale is very often what determines the behavior of
matter at the macroscopic or observable scales of ordinary life. For example,
what we call the temperature of a liquid or gas is simply the macroscopic or
cumulative effect of the motion of countless atoms and molecules on the
microscopic scale of the material. In this project the principal investigator
will study various mathematical models of the behavior of atoms at the
microscopic or quantum level, in order to establish connections between
microscopic and macroscopic properties of matter.
