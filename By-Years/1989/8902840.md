This research will demonstrate the developmental motoneuron death in vertebrates
is a gene directed event. This will be pursued by determining if embryonic
neurons, that are induced to undergo developmental death, express the gene,
ced-4, which has been shown to regulate developmental neuronal death in an
invertebrate. Molecular biology techniques will be used to clone a DNA fragment
for ced-4, which will be used in hybridization assays both in vitro on spinal
cord neurons induced to undergo cell death and in situ on histological sections
of embryonic spinal cord to determine if ced-4 is expressed when embryonic
neurons normally die. The significance of these studies derives from the
demonstration that the motoneuron death is a gene directed event and the
establishment of an assay with which to study the regulation of motoneuron
death. Interactive activities include teaching a course entitled 'Seminars in
Neurobiology' for senior undergraduates. The seminars will be open to all
students on campus, and half of the participants will be established female
scientists working in neurobiology. The course will consist of formal
presentations by both a student and a senior scientist followed by an informal
gathering. Dr. Weill will also give a research seminar and two lectures in the
department's developmental neurobiology course. This project furthers VPW
program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF
and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by
providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
