Natural sounds are complex high-dimensional signals. The "cocktail-party
phenomenon" in the hearing sciences is a classic example of the brain's ability
to parse out and attend to a particular dynamic signal (speech) in the presence
of multiple extraneous (non-signal) sounds, all of which reach the ears
concurrently and continuously vary in pitch and location as a function of time.
The ability to identify a relevant signal out of this "acoustic mixture" far
outdistances that of the most sophisticated current automated speech-recognition
systems. To understand how people process complex sounds that dynamically vary
in time, space, and frequency, scientists must determine how the brain organizes
these auditory dimensions. With support from the National Science Foundation,
Dr. Saberi and his colleagues will use neuroimaging techniques to systematically
map the neural landscape that underlies the functional organization of brain
regions responsive to temporal, spatial, and spectral aspects of complex sounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include applications
to automated speech-recognition systems, development of auditory navigation
systems for the blind, improved signal-processing by auditory prostheses for the
hard-of-hearing and cochlear-implant users, and a deeper understanding of
cortically-based auditory deficits in humans. The project integrates research
and education by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students
to engage in research, and by complementing the planned development of an
undergraduate and Ph.D. program in cognitive neuroscience at UCI and an
interdisciplinary Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;
