Modeled after P.A. Meyers Seminaire de Probabilit'e which propelled the French
probability school to the forefront of research in the seventies, the Seminar on
Stochastic Processes was created in the eighties by Chung, Cinlar and Getoor to
have the same boosting effect on this side of the Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;This
initiative had a tremendous impact on the probability community, reaching far
beyond the limits of the North American continent.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from
all over the world strive for an invitation as peer recognition of their
international standing. The list of past invited speakers is a Who is Who in the
world of probability.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific committee strives to include
successful young researchers, minorities and women in the list of
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;Financial support to attend the conference will
preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women and minorities as
well as junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
