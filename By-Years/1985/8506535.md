A rheological spectrometer is being obtained to update and extend rheological
measurements in a variety of engineering flows currently under study.
Development of a processing science for liquid crystalline polymeric fluids used
to fabricate solids having great mechanical strength at elevated temperatures,
for concentrated suspensions used to fabricate composite materials, for gels,
and for systems in which phase changes may occur during processing, requires
resolution of a series of worthwhile scientific and engineering challenges.
These include a careful coupling between measurement of the relevant rheological
properties and studies of the fluid response in a variety of flow configurations
of engineering interest.
