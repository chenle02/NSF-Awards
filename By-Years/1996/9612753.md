The critical importance of robust, flexible, and efficient software tools has
long been recognized, and has been a major discussion topic at several national
meetings, including those organized by the PI. These meetings focused on the
difficulties associated with building good tools, and the lack of infrastructure
for tool development and test. This proposal is for a workshop to discuss design
and implementation solutions to the lack of these software tools for high
performance computing systems. The discussions will focus will focus primarily
on issues of debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and presentation as
they relate to these needs. By including academic researchers, vendors, and
government agency representatives, a wide variety of opinions, viewpoints, and
needs can be presented and explored to the mutual benefit of all the groups.
