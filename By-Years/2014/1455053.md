Studies from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the number of software
developers is expected to grow by 22% between 2012-2022, much faster than the
average of all other occupations. A critical aspect of software development is
the thorough testing of software, yet there is a serious lack of software
testers in industry. Academic institutions contribute to this problem since few
software testing courses are offered in the curriculum, and there is little, if
any, software testing done in programming courses. As a result, many software
companies are seeking cost effective ways to train new and existing employees on
how to effectively test software using the appropriate testing techniques and
testing tools. Training software testers will become more important as companies
are held liable for faulty software.

This team proposes an online cyberlearning environment (WReSTT-Com - Web-based
Repository of Software Testing Tutorials Commercial), that provides individuals
and companies with the ability to obtain training in conceptual and practical
skills in software testing techniques and tools. WReSTT-Com will provide
trainees with an adaptive learning environment where the trainees or employers
can configure the system to suit their needs, including the selection of
learning objects and the generation of evaluation reports on the performance of
the trainees. Income will be generated based on the time and facilities used in
WReSTT-Com by trainees.
