We have recently identified chloroplast-derived DNA sequences in an intron of a
tomato nuclear gene that we had cloned. Although it had been demonstrated, by
hybridization experiments, that the nuclear genomes of many plants contain
sequences derived from the chloroplast genome, this is the first example of the
physical isolation of such integrates. Our analysis of the integrates and of the
integration sites suggests the involvement of homologous recombination
mechanisms in the transposition events. In this proposal we outline experiments
designed to physically isolate and characterize many chloroplast DNA integrates
in the tomato nuclear genome. The date obtained will be used to test the
hypothesis that homologous recombination is involved in the transposition of
such chloroplast sequences into the nuclear genome. The presence of DNA
sequences integrated into the cellular genome which originated in the organelle
genomes has been abundantly documented. However, little or nothing is known
about the mechanism(s) involved. The results of this study should provide
insight into those processes.
