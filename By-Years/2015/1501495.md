The availability of different types of nutrients can determine which species are
able live together. When microbes (such as bacteria) live inside animals (such
as humans), they may compete for a limited nutrient (such as nitrogen) or may
cooperate with each other to acquire that same nutrient. This project will
examine how humans and the bacteria in their guts manage their needs for
nitrogen. Humans get nitrogen from their diet, and gut bacteria get nitrogen
from inside their human hosts. The bacteria can either compete with humans for
nitrogen in swallowed food or they can be "fed" through material that humans
excrete into the gut. The researchers will focus on competition for nitrogen in
the gut and test whether it is important in determining which species of
bacteria can live there. The results of this work may help in the design of
treatments that require a change in the community of bacteria living in the guts
of sick people and domestic animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis that
nitrogen is limiting in the gut comes from the observation that most
indigestible material reaching the large intestine is nitrogen poor and,
therefore, there is little nitrogen available to most of the gut's microbiota.
This leads to two testable predictions. First, there is a longitudinal gradient
in the environmental (non-microbial) carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio and a
depletion of diet-sourced nitrogen along a healthy gut. Second, much of the
nitrogen used by bacteria must come from host secretions. These predictions will
be tested by measuring C:N ratios along the gut and by using stable isotope
tracer studies to identify the fate of dietary nitrogen and the source of
bacterial nitrogen. Finally, to determine if changes in nitrogen availability
can alter microbial community composition in the gut, in vitro co-culture
competition experiments will be conducted under varying levels of nitrogen
availability.
