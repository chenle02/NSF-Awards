The Department of Science and Mathematics at Coker College will incorporate into
its curriculum more laboratory experience for its upper-division chemistry and
biology majors. This project adds a course in quantitative chemistry and new
laboratory exercises to the extant courses in physical chemistry, cell
physiology and plant physiology.
