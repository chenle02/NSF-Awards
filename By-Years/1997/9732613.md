*** 9732613 Ross The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) will
continue to offer an NSF-sponsored REU Site Program for the summers of
1998-2000. The focus of this program is the neutron science that can be achieved
at a 10MV nuclear research reactor center on a college campus. The program will
include eleven undergraduate science students and three students having
backgrounds in Journalism/Media. Each student develops a research plan with a
dedicated mentor and spends his/her summer pursuing this plan and participating
in our REU Group activities. This program will involve eight weeks of intensive
training and research at MURR followed by two weeks of data analysis and report
writing at an appropriate location. ***
