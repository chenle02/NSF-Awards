This renewal proposal continues a long-term experimental study of grasshoppers,
their enemies (predators and parasites), their food plants and nutrients for
these plants in a Montana Palouse grassland ecosystem. Grasshoppers are the
dominant herbivores in this ecosystem and strongly influence the ecosystem?s
functioning (nutrient cycling and primary production). Previous research has
showed that classic food-chain or food-web theories are insufficient to explain
how grasshoppers affect nutrient cycling and primary production, because these
interactions very over time within a particular habitat (vegetation type) in the
ecosystem as well as spatially among the four habitats comprising this
ecosystem. Ongoing experiments will be continued in order to determine how food
web dynamics vary over space and time, and whether this variation is associated
with natural climate cycles or with anthropogenic climate change.

This study will have a number of broader impacts. First, long-term studies like
this are critical to assess the effects of climate change and to forecast future
impacts of climate change. Since 1908, these grasslands have experienced a 0.4
degree Centigrate increase in average daily temperature and a 30% (11.1 cm/yr)
decrease in annual precipitation. The main factors (food plant availability and
natural enemies) that influence grasshopper abundance and their ecosystem
impacts have clearly been influenced by climate changes. Results from this study
will also inform range management and conservation programs, particularly with
respect to climate change and ongoing ecosystem modification. The study is
integrated into an undergraduate program created by the University of Notre Dame
and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to foster better resource
management and cultural exchange with Native Americans.
