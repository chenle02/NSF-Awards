This CRPA award will engage public audiences in a robotic experience that will
help them better understand live fish, aquatic environments, engineering and
marine science. The issue addressed by this project deals with enhancing the
aquarium experience and learning several new concepts in biology and animal
behavior. Each engaged youngster can control a robot fish or even a school of
fish to experiment with how fish function and perhaps to mimic what he or she
has observed in the big tank of live fish. One special App that is downloadable
to i-devices allows the viewer to see what the fish sees and can control that
fish.

This activity is an aquarium exhibit containing robotic fish. It is engineered
so that external devices can keep the fish energized, but the key is that
observers can actually control the movements of the fish remotely using the
exhibit controls or their own i-device such as an i-Phone. This exhibit will be
at the New York aquarium on the Boardwalk of Brooklyn where large numbers of
people visit. Many of these individuals are from under-served groups.

This is a cooperative venture between Polytechnic University of New York, New
York University and the New York Aquarium.
