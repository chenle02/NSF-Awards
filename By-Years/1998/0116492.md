With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Richmond will acquire a high field
(500 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for undergraduate
research. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
characterization of relatively small molecules prepared in organic, inorganic,
and organometallic synthetic studies; and b) structure elucidation of small- to
medium-sized biomolecules in biochemical studies. The NMR will also be used on a
limited basis in upper level laboratory courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and synthethic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
