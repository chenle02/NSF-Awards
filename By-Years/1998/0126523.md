Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving the laboratory experience for
our students in The Chemistry of High&lt;br/&gt;Polymers. This is being
accomplished by the introduction of a GPC, coupled with UV and light-scattering
detectors, with attendant software. Experiments are being adapted from a program
at the University of Northern Iowa and from the educational literature. These
instruments allow students to accurately determine synthetic and/or commercial
polymer's accurate macromolecular characterizations, such as their molecular
weights, molecular weight distributions and molecular size. The result is that
we are upgrading and enhancing the laboratory program for an undergraduate
polymers course that has been offered for the last 26 years. Since it is a well-
known fact that about 75% of all chemistry majors will work in the chemical
industry at some time in their careers, and that a vast majority of those
chemical companies manufacture polymers, many exclusively so, this particular
course and its laboratory experience are integral to the education of chemistry
majors who pass through our department. It has proven to be a very popular
course over the years we have offered it, and most all our chemistry majors take
it.
