Anne Myers of the University of Rochester is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program in her continuing studies in which she uses resonance
Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies to characterize the coupling of electronic
transitions of a chromophore to nuclear degrees of freedom in the surrounding
environment in liquids and amorphous solids. Three types of experiments will be
carried out: (i) Raman linewidths for molecular ions will be compared under
resonant vs. nonresonant excitation conditions to test the hypothesis that the
previously observed increase in linewidth on resonance is due to coupling of the
chromophore-localized vibrations to solvent or intermolecular phonons; (ii)
resonantly excited emission spectra will be measured as a function of
temperature and the spectra will be modeled to better understand the temperature
dependence; (iii) low-temperature fluorescence line-narrowing spectra will be
measured in chromophore/matrix combinations to investigate the chromophore
dependence of the coupled phonon frequencies and coupling strengths. These
investigations will provide insight to the processes that are responsible for
the broadening of electronic absorptions in condensed media and to processes
that affect chemical reaction rates in condensed phases. Efforts to develop
practical optical memory devices based on persistent spectral hole burning in
solids will be aided by a better understanding resulting from this research.
