This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support a project in the general area of inorganic solution chemistry and
in the specific area of the chemistry of polyoxometalate anions.
Polyoxometallate anions are the largest inorganic compounds which can be brought
into solution, and their solution chemistry is in a region intermediate between
that of small molecules and that of solid metal oxides. This project is expected
to help elucidate the processes which occur at the surfaces of metal oxides
during catalysis, and in particular to elucidate the mechanism by which
acrylonitrile is synthesized using bismuth molybdate as a catalyst, a process
responsible for the production of four million tons of this chemical per year.
The overall objective of the project is to exploit the synthetic methodologies
developed recently for organohydrazido complexes of polyoxomolybdates in the
synthesis of polyoxometalates with organoimido ligands. Emphasis will be placed
on the synthesis of organoimido derivatives which are soluble in organic
solvents, of polyoxomolybdate complexes stabilized by coligands, and of lacunary
polyoxomolybdates. The complexes will be characterized by x-ray crystallography,
by multinuclear NMR, and by electrochemistry. Thermal and photochemical
decomposition of the organoimido derivatives, as well as their reactions with
allylalcohol and alkenes, will be investigated.
