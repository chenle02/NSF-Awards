Chloroplasts act as sensors of environmental changes that activate a broad range
of stress defense responses. This activation requires the rapid transfer of
signals from the plastid to the nucleus. So far, very little is known about how
this chloroplast-nucleus communication takes place. The project includes work
that will compare the physiological impact of two chloroplast-derived signals,
singlet oxygen and tetrapyrroles, that have previously been implicated with the
modulation of nuclear gene expression. The aims of the project are primarily the
isolation and molecular characterization of signaling mutants . These will be
instrumental in defining and eventually modifying genetic constraints that
determine the adaptability of plants to environmental stress. The identification
of genetic factors that determine the robustness of plants to climatic changes
is of immense importance to both agriculture and the environment. Results of the
project will be made publicly available through the Web site (www.singlox.com/)
of the investigator. The research activities of the project will include the
training of undergraduate students. The investigator will paticipate in the BTI
summer internship program that strongly supports applications from students of
minority groups (www.bti.cornell.edu/pgrp).
