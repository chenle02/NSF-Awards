0452132&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Hey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt
;The Reykjanes Ridge is one of the most striking parts of the mid-ocean ridge
system on global maps of gravity and bathymetry because of the V-shaped
diachronos ridges pointing away from Iceland. It shows the strongest influence
of a hotspot (Iceland) of any mid-ocean ridge and is the type example of an
obliquely spreading ridge. This project will test two hypotheses for the origin
of the V-shaped ridges; pulsing of the Iceland plume versus ridge jumps. The
goal is to provide a seamless history of the plate boundary geometry both at sea
and on land during the past 18 Ma. Marine geophysical data will be collected in
the area from the Iceland margin to the northern boundary of the existing data
at 62 degrees north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study involves the training of a
graduate student and Icelandic scientists will participate in the expedition and
receive training in various aspects of data gathering. They will also provide a
critical link to the land data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
