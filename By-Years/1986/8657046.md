Dr. Kahn is a new investigator under the Presidential Young Investigator
program. Under this will be studied conformationally restricted mimetics that
should provide novel methods of studying the relationship between peptide
structure and function. Beyond these fundamental investigations, the industrial
applications of this research could prove profound. The ability to mimic the
activity of peptides and proteins with synthetic models should prove invaluable
in the design of new pharmaceutical agents, enzyme inhibitors, and synthetic
catalysts. The investigations are focused on the design and synthesis of systems
which mimic peptide beta-turns. The surface localization of turns in proteins
and the predominance of potentially reactive functional groups in their side
chains has led to the suggestion, which is now partially established, that turns
can function as recognition sites which trigger complex immunologic, metabolic,
genomic and endocrinologic events. Additionally turns have been implicated as
sites of nucleation of protein folding as well as markers for proteolytic
degradation and antibody recognition. Evidence obtained by the comparison of the
endogenous opioid peptides and the opiate analgesics suggests that the
pharmacophoric interactions responsible for the biological activity of these
peptides, occur between the side chain alpha substituents and their target
receptors. Based on this assessment, with the aid of computer assisted molecular
modeling, a nine-membered ring carbocyclic framework has been designed as an
idealized mimetic of the pseudocyclic ten-membered ring of a beta-turn.
Synthetic strategies which allow for the placement of any of the amino acid side
chain functional groups at position R1 through R4 in addition to the
introduction of both the amino and carboxy termini are under investigation.
