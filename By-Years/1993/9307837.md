9307837 Mann This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the synthesis, chemical
reactivity, and photochemical and photophysical behavior of cyclopentadienyl-
arene ruthenium and osmium complexes. The primary objective of these studies is
to understand and control the partitioning of reactivity between the metal and
the arene ligand in the photochemically excited state. Syntheses of the
previously unknown osmium complexes will be done using newly developed electron
transfer catalyzed methods. The arenes to be utilized will include a variety of
laser dye molecules as well as oligothiophenes. Characterization methods will
include infrared and optical spectroscopies, quantum yields, variable
temperature luminescence lifetimes, and laser-flash photolysis studies of
electron transfer reactions. These studies may lead to improved optical and
conductive devices. %%% New transition metal molecules will be prepared and
characterized for their chemical and photochemical reactivity. Knowledge gained
in these studies is expected to have technological importance for new optical
and electrically conductive devices. ***
