Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dykema&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial participant support is
requested for the Seventh East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), to be
held at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station,&lt;br/&gt;Texas, during a
weekend1 in late September or October, 2009. It is expected that&lt;br/&gt;the
conference will host 50?80 participants, including 40?50 graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows. This will be the seventh annual meeting in the East Coast
Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting in the series was held at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003, and since then meetings
have been held each fall. The focus of the meetings is on operator algebras and
non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from number
theory to quantum physics. In addition to facilitating interaction between
researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in
which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the
eastern region of the United States can acquaint hemselves with current issues
at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior
mathematicians in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
