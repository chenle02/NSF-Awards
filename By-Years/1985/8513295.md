The objectives of this research are to provide a better understanding of liquid
metal ion source emission processes (ions & clusters) and development of the
fine-focused cluster beam technique as a tool for patterned thin film
deposition. These objectives will be realized through completion of a set of
experiments. In addition, a model is developed for operation of these sources in
cluster dominated emission mode. These experiments are designed to provide
experimental data to verify the model and to develop the focused ion cluster
beam technique as a finely focused thin film deposition process. The proposed
model is based on the hydrodynamic instability of the liquid metal under
electric field stress. This model is consistent with the experimental
observation and with measurement reported in the literature.
