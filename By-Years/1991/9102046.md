This awards supports the research of Professor M. Green to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on Hodge theory, the geometry of projective varieties,
and algebraic curves. The techniques used will be a mixture of algebraic and
differential- geometric. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
