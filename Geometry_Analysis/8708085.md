Karen Uhlenbeck will continue her research in three topics. The first is the
study of the harmonic map equations from two dimensional base space into Lie
groups and symmetric spaces. The second involves investigation of the geometric
meaning of supersymmetric field theory. The final topic concerns an
investigation of the solution space of the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations on
high dimensional complex manifolds. This will hopefully involve the discovery of
more interactions between Yang-Mills theory and algebraic geometry. Varghese
Mathai plans to use the superconnection formalism and superdeterminants in order
to prove the Riemann-Roch theorem without denominators for embeddings. Jose
Escobar will continue studying the problem of conformally deforming a compact
Riemannian manifold with boundary to have constant scalar curvature and minimal
boundary. All the issues to be studied by these investigators are deep and basic
ones, in many instances they are interdisciplinary in nature and promise to have
a broad impact.
