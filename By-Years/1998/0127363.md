Physics (13) Curriculum materials and Java-based software are being developed to
make it easier for faculty to incorporate computer applications into the
undergraduate physics curriculum. In particular, the principal investigator, in
colloboration with Jan Tobochnik of Kalamazoo College and Wolfgang Christian of
Davidson College, is developing an extensive and powerful library of Java
utilities and templates that make it relatively easy to develop computer
simulations and animations in a variety of contexts. The software is platform
independent and open source and available at no cost. In addition, the third
(Java) edition of our popular undergraduate level computer simulation text is
being developed during the time frame of the work.
