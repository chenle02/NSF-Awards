DMS-0206647&lt;br/&gt;James M. Turner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An active area of
research in commutative algebra since the &lt;br/&gt;1950s has involved the use
of homological methods to &lt;br/&gt;characterize Noetherian rings and the
homomorphisms between &lt;br/&gt;them. In the 1960s, simplicial methods were
used to enable &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory to apply to commutative algebras and
develop &lt;br/&gt;richer homological techniques. This project seeks to use
&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory to characterize (simplicial) commutative
&lt;br/&gt;algebras with a Noetherian property. Part of this effort
&lt;br/&gt;will seek to resolve a conjecture of Quillen on the rigidity
&lt;br/&gt;of the homology of commutative algebras and draw deeper
&lt;br/&gt;connections between simplicial methods and methods from
&lt;br/&gt;differential homological algebra. This project will also
&lt;br/&gt;study how the cohomology of algebras can serve as host &lt;br/&gt;for
obstructions to realizing a topological space from &lt;br/&gt;given algebraic
data that functions as the value of a &lt;br/&gt;suitable homotopy invariant of
the putative space. &lt;br/&gt;Attention will be paid to developing methods for
computing &lt;br/&gt;such obstructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is
a method of studying certain mathematical &lt;br/&gt;objects and the relations
between them from a global &lt;br/&gt;perspective. In the case of geometric
objects, certain &lt;br/&gt;algebraic invariants can be assigned to study and
distinguish &lt;br/&gt;between homotopy types. Understanding the properties of
these &lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures and how they relate to the geometric
&lt;br/&gt;objects they are associated to are therefore important parts
&lt;br/&gt;of this theory. This project seeks to further the
&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the homotopy theory of geometric objects
&lt;br/&gt;from the algebraic perspective. There are two aims to this
&lt;br/&gt;project. The first is to develop further the homotopy theory
&lt;br/&gt;of algebras that parallels that of geometric objects. The
&lt;br/&gt;second aim seeks to make use of the homotopy of algebras
&lt;br/&gt;and their various properties to understand the homotopy of
&lt;br/&gt;spaces. This would involve studying the extent to which
&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures and properties can be lifted to
&lt;br/&gt;corresponding structures and properties for geometric objects.
