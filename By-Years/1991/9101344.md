This award will support Professor Jacob Leventhal of the University of Missouri
at St. Louis in a research collaboration with Professors M. Allegrini and E.
Arimondo of the University of Pisa, Italy. The purpose of the collaboration is
to study the interaction of highly excited atoms in order to better understand
atomic properties at the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The
work, which represents a continuation of collaborative work starting in the
early 80's, is producing significant research in atomic interactions. The
proposed experiments will combine the infrared expertise of the Italian group
with techniques developed in St. Louis for the production of highly excited
atoms. Fundamental to the experimental set-up is the fact that highly excited
atoms, by virtue of their sensitivity and exaggerated responses, provide useful
amplification of atomic properties making it feasible to study effects that
would otherwise be difficult to observe.
