Professor Mauldin will conduct research in various aspects of the measure
theory of fractal objects. One major theme centers on Hausdorff measure and its
variants. Topics include (i) further development of deterministic and random
recursions yielding objects in n-space and determining their Hausdorff and
packing dimension functions, (ii) finding the exact Hausdorff dimension of the
graphs of general Hardy-Weierstrass functions, and (iii) characterizing
Hausdorff measures which scale. A second theme centers on the production of
random maps and finding their properties. Most smooth objects in space have an
integer dimension. For example a solid object has dimension three and a surface
dimension two. Hausdorff dimension and measure are capable of describing fractal
objects which have non-integer dimension.
