The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to develop software that may be
implemented in a variety of computing environments to visualize algorithms and
then (2) to incorporate the use of that software into laboratory exercises in
courses throughout the computer science curriculum. The former goal was achieved
largely during the summer of 1988, with refinements to the system occurring in
the summer of 1989. Working with students Pamela J. Krussel and Christopher D.
Hundhausen, project principal investigator Dr. Thomas L. Naps developed the
GAIGS (Generalized Algorithm Illustration through Graphical Software) algorithm
visualization system. This software runs on the local area VAX cluster which is
the hub of the computer science laboratory. The software presents graphical
animations of algorithms on VAXStation 2000s. The animation is generated by a
program that implements that algorithm on any of the computer systems on campus.
