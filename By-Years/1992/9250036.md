The Texas Science and Mathematics Renaissance is designed to reform science and
mathematics education for all of its students by reforming curriculum and
assessment through changes in teacher development. The project will develop
Renaissance Centers that will house teams of master teachers, scientists and
mathematicians, and higher education faculty to develop and implement a model of
reform for preservice and inservice programs. The project has the following
objectives: 1. Create a project governing board composed of the Governor's
senior education aid, the dean of the College of Education at the University of
Texas, Austin, the Commissioner of the Texas Education Agnecy and the Chair of
the Commission on Higher Education; 2. Connect the Texas SSI to the state's
ongoing reform work through the Committee for Student Learning; 3. Provide
matheamtics and science expertise in the state's Education Service Centers
(initially in regions 2, 4, 10, 18, and 20) to assist school-based centers in at
least 20 middle schools (one for each region), provide support for improved
mathematics and science education, and include institutions of higher education
and communities in the effort. The Renaissance Centers will encourage site-based
management, the use of a thematic, hands-on science curriculum, and performance-
based assessment. 4. Develop a process for adding other Education Service
Centers and Renaissance Centers in years 2 - 5; 5. Reform preservice education
in science, mathematics, and technology education through a competitive grant
program operated by the University of Texas, Austin; 6. Extend the Texas
Prefreshman Engineering Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio, to
other areas of the state; 7. Conduct a program evaluation through Texas A &amp;
M and share results with the Committee on Student Learning; and 8. Work with the
Texas Alliance for Science, Mathematics and Technology Education; Texas Buisness
and Education Coalition; and the Texas Mathematics Education Coalition to
institutionalize the Renaissance Centers after NSF funding.
