Henry Ford Community College (HFCC), along with its partners the University of
Michigan-Dearborn (UMD) and Eastern Michigan University (EMU), are piloting and
evaluating the introduction of a writing component into science and mathematics
courses for pre-service teachers. In the first stage of the project, writing
instructors work with mathematics and science faculty members to develop writing
activities that encourage students to formulate in writing what they are
learning about mathematics and science. As a result of these faculty
professional development activities, science and mathematics faculty become
adept at formulating and assessing writing assignments, defining learning
outcomes, and encouraging student reflection. In the second stage of the
project, faculty members implement a number of writing activities in their
classes. Formative evaluation includes meetings among the science and
mathematics faculty and the writing instructor to critique classroom practice
and results and make necessary revisions. Further evaluation includes
examination of faculty- and student-generated portfolios, as well as exit
interviews of both students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
