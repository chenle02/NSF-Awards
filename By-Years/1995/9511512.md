9512868 Polenske This award supports collaboration between Dr. Karen Polenske,
MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and Professor Chen Xikang,
Institute of Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China on
research on the effects of alternative technologies on energy and pollution. The
study will investigate the principal energy-efficiency improvements being
undertaken in the electricity generating sector of the PRC as well as assess the
economic effects of alternative technologies on energy and pollution in the
household sector. The project has immediate importance for global energy use and
pollution reduction, given the magnitude and rapid urbanization of China's
population and the brisk growth of the national economy.
