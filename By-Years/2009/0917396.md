This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). As our society stores ever-increasing quantities of digital
data and abandons analog storage, we must be able to manage, organize, and
preserve digital data for decades or longer. Maintaining access to large-scale
digital archives will be critical in enabling future generations to access the
medical records, personal information, photographs, and other data that we are
generating and storing digitally. However, current approaches to archival
storage are ill-suited to long-term preservation because they do not cope well
with evolution of device technologies and rely upon centralized search indexes
that do not scale well and are prone to failure. This project is exploring
techniques that allow the management of large-scale archives containing 105?106
intelligent power-managed storage devices connected by a network. These
techniques allow seamless evolution of the archival storage system by
integrating new devices and removing old, inefficient devices. The research is
also developing approaches to index data in the archive, allowing users to
quickly find the data they need by maintaining indexes on each device and
routing queries to the devices that might contain relevant data. These
techniques will allow archives to scale to hundreds of thousands of devices,
allowing them to contain the vast digital legacy we are leaving to our
descendants. This research will guide the design of archives that are power-
efficient and can gracefully evolve as storage technology changes. Additionally,
the project will train both undergraduates and graduate students in the problems
facing digital archiving, an area of critical importance.
