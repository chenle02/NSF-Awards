This research examines mechanisms of plastic deformation in titanium aluminide
intermetallic alloys, TiAl (gamma) and Ti3Al (alpha 2), over a wide range of
temperature and strain rates. Factors that influence dislocation mobilities are
identified so that mechanisms that contribute to plastic flow can be determined.
Two models for dislocation mobility are investigated: one looking at anisotropy
of bonding charge densities and its relationship to dislocation mobility; the
other at the role of non-planar dislocation core configurations on dislocation
mobility. A third component of the study examines the variation in critical
resolved shear stresses of various dislocations taken from a number of potential
slip systems. This involves the fabrication of single crystals so that stress
can be applied along specific crystallographic directions. Experimental
techniques include transmission electron microscopy and high resolution electron
microscopy. %%% This research adds to the fundamental knowledge concerning
mechanical deformation of intermetallic alloys. It is relevant to the future
development of ductile, strong intermetallic alloys for operation at high
temperatures in applications such as jet engines.
