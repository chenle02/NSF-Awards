Continuation of an experimental and theoretical research program is proposed
that is focussed on the dynamics of atomic inner-shell processes and on
multiphoton ionization in strong radiation measurements of correlation effects
in deep-lying atomic states; concomitant numerical computations are carried out
to study details of deexcitation dynamics, including relativistic effects. The
second topic comprises the application of formal time-independent scattering
theory to describe the interaction of an atomic electron with a very strong
elliptically polarized electromagnetic field, with special attention to above-
threshold ionization.
