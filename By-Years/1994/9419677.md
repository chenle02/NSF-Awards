Fire is an important component of the functioning of ecosystems. Fire also is
currently being used extensively by human populations worldwide in the
conversion of forest to pasture and agricultural land. The historic role of fire
and the frequency of fire in different ecosystem types is important in assessing
present-day management decisions. This project looks at 6,000 years of fire
history in changing landscapes of the boreal forests and grasslands of North
America. Pollen records and charcoal records will be combined to examine
interplay between vegetation and fire. This will provide a comparison of how
modern emissions from modern fires differ from those of the past. This research
is important because it places the role of fire in a regional perspective.
Methods are to be developed and tested which will allow fire history from
individual lakes to be extended to a regional view of how fire structures and
affects ecosystems.
