Freiman's Theorem says that given a set A, if the sum set (i.e. the set of sums
of two elements in A) is not too big, then A can be included in the homomorphic
image in the set of integers of a d-dimensional box with integer coordinates. We
propose to sharpen our bound on the size of the box. We would also like to
improve our results on some conjectures made by Erdos and Szemeredi in
combinatorial number theory, which says that the sum set and product set cannot
both be small. We would like to generalize some of the results to h-fold sum or
product and sum-product problems along graphs. The importance of these and
similar issues became more apparent in recent years because of their relation to
issues in computer science and harmonic analysis. Important contributions along
this line were made by Fefferman and Gowers.

One of the features of several current developments in mathematics and applied
mathematics is the emergence of issues with a combinatorial flavor, sometimes in
seemingly unrelated questions. Some of these issues turned out to have already
been studied in earlier days with different motivations. Well-known examples of
this phenomenon is the revitalization of mathematical topics such as graph
theory and computational algebra under impetus of computer science, in
particular complexity theory and the theory of algorithms. My work in
combinatorial number theory has this feature. But besides an interest from part
of the computer science community, it does primarily belong to an active
research direction in harmonic analysis and differential equations.
