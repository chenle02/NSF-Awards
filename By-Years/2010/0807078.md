This S-STEM project focuses on students interested in or majoring in mathematics
or computer science. On an annual basis, 32 incentive scholarships of $500 each
for prospective mathematics and computer science majors and 30 support
scholarships averaging $4,000 each for declared majors are offered.
Approximately $136,000 is allocated to scholarships annually. The goals of the
S-STEM project are to (a) recruit and retain academically talented, financially
needy mathematics and computer science majors, and (b) increase the number of
mathematics and computer science graduates who enter the workforce in these
fields. Academically talented students with financial need are actively
recruited for the program and selected through a structured application process.
Support services include tutoring, mentoring, career placement assistance, and
interactions with businesses and professional individuals. The program
establishes a sense of community that instills personal confidence and
encourages success.
