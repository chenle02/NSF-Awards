Mathematicians at Washington and Lee are developing an innovative course in
tensor calculus as a sequel to an existing course in vector calculus. They are
creating computer laboratory and class materials that will support and
supplement both the existing vector calculus course as well as its sequel. These
subjects involve the study of quantifiable spatial relationships (as in physics)
and related quantities plotted in an abstract space (as in economics).
Mathematicians have devel- oped these concepts by quantifying their geometric
intuition. This project plans to use mathematical computer graphics to cultivate
such geometric intuition in students. Students will use computers as tools of
investigation of vector calculus concepts and learn to visualize three
dimensional shapes.
