The use of large ground based adaptive optics telescopes holds the potential to
revolutionize astronomcial observation at visible wavelengths. In order to make
such systems practical, bright sources (guide stars) must be available over all
regions of the sky. such stars can be artificially produced by laser excitation
of resonance radiation in the mesospheric sodium layer. This project addresses
the development of a suitable laser. The Phase I work plan is to breadboard and
evaluate two configurations of a dye laser pumped dye amplifier. The data will
include gain, beam quality, and efficiency measurements as functions of input
power, pump laser fluence, dye concentration, and solvent composition at low
repetition rates. The results will be used to prepare a baseline design scaled
to 100 pulsars per second. Phase II will be dedicated to the construction of the
scaled laser and the demonstration of a usable guide star.
