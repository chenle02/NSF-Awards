This research will investigate genetic divergence and phylogenetic
relationships among species of the owl monkey, Aotus. Owl monkeys are widely
distributed in Central and South America. Until ten years ago it was generally
assumed that owl monkeys comprised a single species, A. trivirgatus. More
recently, however, it has been suggested that the owl monkey represents at least
ten allopatric species which have distinct geographic distributions and can be
distinguished both phenotypically and genotypically. Aotus has undergone an
extraordinary amount of karyotypic change with diploid chromosome counts ranging
from 46 to 58, but changes in other genetic characters have not yet been
investigated. This research will examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and several
related gene sequences within and among several karyotypically distinct species.
This work is important because of the use of the owl monkey as a model for
malarial research, and because of the unusual nature of chromosomal
rearrangements in this genus.
