The 2007 Barrett Memorial Lectures: Multiscale Modeling and Simulation in
Materials Science will bring together ten distinguished speakers, three of whom
will give a series of three lectures on some aspect of the conference theme. The
aim of the conference is to explore modeling and simulation of materials over a
range of length scales from atomistic to continuum, as well as methods that seek
to combine techniques that normally apply on different length scales. Topics are
to include: the quasicontinuum method, the heterogeneous multiscale method and
heteroepitaxial growth. In addition, there will be an opportunity for junior
researchers to present their work in poster format. The requested funds are to
support the travel of these junior participants. The 2007 Barrett Memorial
Lectures: Multiscale Modeling and Simulation in Materials Science will bring
together ten distinguished speakers, three of whom will give a series of three
lectures on some aspect of the conference theme. The aim of the conference is to
explore modeling and simulation of materials over a large range of length
scales, including the nanoscale, as well as methods that seek to combine
techniques that normally apply on different length scales. The meeting will be
highly interdisciplinary in nature, drawing an audience from universities in the
Southeast as well as Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In addition, there will be
an opportunity for junior researchers to present their work in poster format.
