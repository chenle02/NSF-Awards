&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research has demonstrated the prevalence and
importance of a large scale organization in turbulent boundary layers thought to
be caused by packets of individual eddies. Given that packets appear to have a
specific spanwise spacing, the PI hypothesizes that obstacles can alter the
spanwise structure. For example, obstacles can be spaced at intervals to either
enhance stability of neighboring packets or alternatively interfere with and
hence alter the typical spanwise (and probably streamwise) scaling observed in
flow over smooth walls. In the current study, the vortex packet structure will
be perturbed using obstacles extending into the logarithmic region of the
boundary layer. Planar and volumetric velocity fields of boundary layers in a
large water channel facility will be measured by stereo and tomographic PIV,
respectively. The resulting velocity fields will be probed with feature
identification algorithms to determine the effect of perturbations on eddy and
packet interaction, evolution, and scaling. Instantaneous shear stresses and
shear stress gradients will be quantified simultaneously to determine potential
effects of perturbations on wall-normal momentum transfer. Obstacle height and
spanwise spacing will be varied to modify the packet organization. Further, the
flow speed will be varied to scale the results with Reynolds number and to see
how they might extrapolate to behavior at the much higher Reynolds numbers in
practical applications. The results of this study will help answer whether
packet formation in boundary layers results from a 'bottom up' mechanism
initiated near the wall or it results from perturbations or instabilities
initiated away from the wall. Further, the experiments will demonstrate how
scaling, organization, and accompanying characteristics can be altered by
intelligent control methods. Accurate models will lead to more efficient
processes in energy production and conversion, more efficient transport of
vehicles and materials, better understanding of pollutant, microorganism and
nutrient transport in the atmosphere and aquatic environments. One graduate
student will be trained, and undergraduate students will participate in the
research through REU supplements and the UM UROP program. Also, the PI and
students will work with elementary school teachers and students at a school with
significant Native American population to develop interactive demonstrations and
flow visualization activities based on rockets, paper airplanes, and
environmental flows.
