Weaver 9410032 This project is concerned with making massively parallel
computers more usable by scientists and engineers working with irregular
applications. Irregular applications are those whose underlying data structures
are not simple static dense arrays, but are more complicated either because the
relationships between the underlying data elements are not modeled well by
arrays or because the amount and shape of the data change significantly during
the course of the computation. There is little support of any kind available for
the programmer who wants to put one of these applications on a massively
parallel machine. The project will take a language, DYNO, that has been designed
for programming irregular applications and testes with a number of small kernels
and subject it to intense analysis using significantly sized, real irregular
applications.
