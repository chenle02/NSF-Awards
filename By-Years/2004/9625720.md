9625720 BROWN The University of Miami will operate the R/V CALANUS during 1996
as a general oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-sponsored research
projects. The R/V ISELIN a 170' general research vessel owned and constructed by
the University of Miami is out of service following a grounding in 1994. The
University intends to sale the vessel. The CALANUS is a 68' general research
vessel owned by the University of Miami. The CALANUS is scheduled for 87 days in
1996 of which 24 are in support of NSF-sponsored research. The Calanus will do a
series of short cruises of the coast of Miami with three cruises in the Bahamas.
The CALANUS is part of a fleet used by NSF to support oceanographic research.
Most oceanographic research requires highly specialized equipment that must be
permanently installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically
designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew members for
maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as
general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
operated by universities and research institutions around the country. ***
