9623480 Carl M. Pearcy, Jr. The purpose of this project is to accumulate more
knowledge leading to a better understanding of the structure of operators on
Hilbert space. In the past eighteen years much progress has been made there by
employing the theory of dual algebras of operators, which the principal
investigator helped to establish. During the next two years, he plans to conduct
research along these same lines, and to supervise the research of three Ph. D.
level students who are writing theses under his direction. Today's scientific
technology depends on many sophisticated mathematical concepts, including that
of an operator on Hilbert space. The principal inves- tigator and his students
are engaged in research concerning such operators. Knouledge gained from the
investigations may lead to future advances in such important technological areas
as data transmission, seismic exploration, sig- nal processing, and petroleum
recovery.
