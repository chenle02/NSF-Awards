This award is for support of a feasibility study to investigate whether the
internal layering, as recorded in radar data from the Siple Coast ice streams,
can be interpreted to yield information about the transition from normal ice
sheet flow to streaming flow in the ice streams. A methodology for modeling the
production and advection of folds in internal layers, using approximations based
on steady state analytic models of Whillans and Johnsen (1983), and on simple
geometic numerical modeling will be used. Recently acquired data will be
analyzed with the objective of determining the scale of the processes operating
in the transition zone. The practicality or feasibility of using the technique
to guide further research will be examined. If successful, this approach
represents a low-cost means of investigating the poorly known transition zones
of the ice streams.
