Dusty plasmas are ionized gases containing small charged dust particles that
occur in a wide variety of cosmic and terrestrial environments. This theoretical
research seeks the advancement of the basic knowledge of the collective behavior
of dusty plasmas, with applications to the laboratory and space. The focus is on
dusty plasmas in magnetic fields. This is a newer direction in dusty plasma
research with added impetus from ongoing and upcoming experiments with larger
magnetic fields. Areas of study include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) waves and
instabilities in weakly coupled dusty plasmas in magnetic fields, where some or
all of the charged particles are magnetized;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) waves and
instabilities in strongly coupled dusty plasmas, including those containing
superparamagnetic dust;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) innovative applications
involving interaction with electromagnetic waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research covers a broad range in that it investigates the basic physics of dusty
plasmas in magnetic fields, strongly coupled dusty plasmas, and potential
photonics applications of dusty plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of the research include training of students and wide dissemination of
results through publications and talks. In addition, there are possible impacts
on technological plasma areas (e.g., plasma processing and fusion).
