The human body produces antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, to recognize
and respond to specific pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Synthetic
production of high quality antibodies is a means to treat disease via
immunotherapy. The use of synthetic antibodies in commercial kits continues to
grow. The handling and purification of antibodies is thus crucial to commercial
manufacturing of therapeutics. Current technology uses bacteria-derived proteins
that bind to the antibodies as a means to capture and purify the antibody.
However, these proteins are costly and the process typically requires harsh
chemical solvents. In certain cases, the harsh chemicals lead to irreversible
damage of the desired antibody product. This project seeks to develop DNA-
derived molecules (oligonucleotides) that have programmable antibody capture and
release, yet do not compromise the therapeutic function of the antibodies, and
employ environmentally-friendly processing steps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project strives to identify and implement oligonucleotide-based ligands for
antibody capture. Trainees on this project will employ a multidisciplinary
approach spanning engineering, biology, and immunology to both (i) screen and
identify effective antibody-binding ligands that do not compromise antibody
quality and (ii) discover structure-binding relationships in the ligand-antibody
systems that can, in turn, inform screening efforts. Successful identification
and implementation of these ligands or affinity reagents for immunologlobulins
address a growing demand for identifying new, robust, cost-effective and
sustainable technological approaches. Moreover, these oligonucleotide-based
ligands can potentially shorten the time-to-market for the ever expanding supply
of new polyclonal, monoclonal, and modified
antibodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
