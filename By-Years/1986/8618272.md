This project involves the experimental determination of mineral- melt
equilibria in felsic systems as functions of pressure, temperature, water
content, and minor element concentrations. Particular emphasis will be placed on
the role of minor elements (aluminum, iron, and magnesium) which lend
distinctive signatures to felsic magmas and which may serve to distinguish
important aspects of their evolutionary histories. Natural hydrous minerals
(biotite, hornblende, muscovite) will be added to quartz-feldspar compositions
to test their stability ranges and breakdown reactions and the compositions of
coexisting liquids. The results of these experiments will help to constrain the
compositional variability of felsic liquids and magmas as functions of source
composition and conditions of generation, will test the viability of mafic rocks
as sources of primary trndhjemitic magmas, and will constrain the range of
conditions over which epidote and muscovite can coexist with magmatic liquids.
