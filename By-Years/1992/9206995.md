This award supports basic research in nuclear theory carried out by Professors
D-H. Feng and M. Vallieres at Drexel University. The main focus is on
understanding nuclear structure phenomena both in terms of the group theoretical
based Fermion Dynamical Symmetry Model and a newly developed shell-model code.
Work will be done on the properties of super-deformed nuclei and nuclei far from
stability.
