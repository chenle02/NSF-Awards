This award will support a cooperative research project between Professor George
Klinzing of the University of Pittsburgh and Professor Yutaka Tsuji of Osaka
University in Japan in the area of basic understanding of pneumatic transport to
produce a more realistic model and simulation. Professor Klinzing will
concentrate on the experiment on particle wall interactions while Professor
Tsuji will carry out the modeling and simulation aspect of the research.
Facilities at the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, such as the world class
laser-sheet motion analyzer, will be utilized in this project. Through this
collaboration, more realistic simulations and thus efficient study and design of
pneumatic transport systems will be possible. The investigators will develop the
proper model in concert with the experiment results of the micro-experiments.
