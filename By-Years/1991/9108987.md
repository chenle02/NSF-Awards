This project will investigate the chemical and sensory foundations of host
specificity in herbivorous insects. Differences in the ability of closely
related insect species to use a plant host, and discrepancies between responses
of adults and larvae of the same species will be examined. Two cabbage
butterflies, Pieris rapae and P.napi oleracea (Lepidoptera) and five
differentially utilized crucifers will serve as a model system. The major
objectives are (1) to determine how behavioral and sensory responses differ
between life stages and between species, and (2) to determine the extent to
which chemical differences between plants account for their susceptibility to
pierid herbivory. Different bioassays will guide the isolation of plant
compounds affecting oviposition, feeding and growth of the insects.
Electrophysiological recordings will be used to compare sensory and behavioral
responses to the compounds. The results will provide an integrated view of the
way that interactions between plant chemistry and insect responses at different
life stages lead to insect-hostplant specificity.
