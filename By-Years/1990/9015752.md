A new approach to implementing an optical crossbar using acoustoopics is
proposed. This novel device configuration can permute an array of single mode
fiber inputs to outputs without suffering from fan- in and fan-out loss, which
plague other approaches. The reconfiguration time of the switching network can
easily be sub microsecond, and the addressing complexity is minimal. This fiber
optic switching system avoids optical to electronic conversion and can transmit
ultra high bandwidth signals. The device concepts will be verified using phased
array bulk acoustooptic devices. Then, a compact integrated optics module will
be fabricated and optimized using surface acoustic wave based guided wave
acoustooptic devices, and the SAW modules will be inserted into digital and
video switching system testbed demonstrations. These SAW modules can be combined
into larger networks, and photonic switching architectures that take advantage
of this unique device configuration will be investigated.
