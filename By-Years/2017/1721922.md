PI: Sah, Robert L. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1721922&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF
has made an award to support registration fees for 54 graduate and undergraduate
students to attend the four-day TERMIS-AM meeting, held in San Diego, CA from
December 11-14, 2016. The conference, organized as the annual Americas meeting
of the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society
(TERMIS), brings together researchers from biomedical science, biomedical
engineering, and manufacturing engineering from throughout the western
hemisphere to present the latest research. Focus on the outcome rather than on
the discipline supports cross-disciplinary conversations and the development of
interdisciplinary collaborations. The theme of this year's workshop is
"Personalized and Precise Science, Engineering, and Translation". Sessions
include a focus on cellular reprogramming, vascularization, drug delivery,
organoids for in vitro screening, biomaterials, manufacturing, and applications
of tissue engineering. Special sessions to support the professional development
of trainees have been included to support the development of networks and
identification of varied career opportunities.
