The aim of this project is to add capability to an existing undergraduate
laboratory course in Instrumentation in the form of an Air Process Control
Trainer. The present laboratory, partially funded through a previous ILI grant,
includes equipment that demonstrates some of the fundamentals of Proportional-
Integral-Derivative control, the basis for modern feedback control theory,
programmable logic controllers, and computer control. Using a water tank as a
test bed, the student can become familiar with the concepts involved in
controlling water level, and flow. Student learning is limited, however, by the
low inertia of a water level detection system which limits the degree to which
Derivative control can be understood. Working with a local engineering firm, a
prototype device has been built and tested that uses air temperature as the
control parameter, thus overcoming the limitations of the water tank unit. This
Air Process Control Trainer permits control of air temperature and air flow,
permits demonstration of Derivative control, and adds the capability of
experiments in heat transfer and fluid mechanics. This proposal requests support
for the purchase of eight devices from the manufacturer for our existing
Instrumentation lab stations. This will give our students a stronger background
in process control equipment; many of our graduates are employed in industries
such as chemical plants, refineries, power plants, HVAC, food technology and
pharmaceuticals that utilize this equipment. The course is currently offered as
an elective to both mechanical engineering technology and electrical engineering
technology students; it will become a requirement for the B.S. degree in MET in
1996. The project is thus interdisciplinary, affects many students including
women and minorities, and can benefit other institutions through dissemination
of experiments and availability of a new product.
