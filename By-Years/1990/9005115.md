This project, by a group of outstanding young observational astronomers, aims at
an understanding of the properties of extremely faint galaxies. These objects
dominate the universe in terms of numbers, although their contribution to the
total mass is poorly known. Indeed, most of our knowledge of star formation in
external galaxies, and of galaxy properties in general has come from studies of
systems which may not be typical. These workers will explore the properties of
these much more numerous objects by both optical and radio means. Preliminary
work by these investigators has already resulted in the discovery of the two
largest, most gas-rich spiral galaxies known, both systems of very low surface
brightness.
