The objectives of this research are to synthesize new organic- inorganic
layered structured with adsorption sites for specific organic molecules and to
investigate the synthesis of new extended lattices based on connected frameworks
of VO5 square pyramids with tetrahedral oxyanions. Subsequent removal of the
guest species from the solid leads to compounds which can show highly selective
molecular sorption and ion complexation in subsequent reactions. The new phases
will be characterized by powder and single crystal diffraction methods, magnetic
susceptibility measurements and the determination of sorption isotherms and
kinetics. These studies are of special value in catalysis for processes
involving the production of fuels and chemicals.
