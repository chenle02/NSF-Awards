Phosphorus may have important effects on the bulk phase equilibria and
distributions of trace elements in alkali aluminosilicate melts. The central
mission of this proposed study is an experimental calibration of the partition
coefficients for phosphorus between melt and feldspars as functions of bulk
composition, bulk H2O content, pressure, and temperature. Additional studies
include (1) vapor/melt partitioning of phosphorus, H2O, and alkali
aluminosilicate components, (2) the structural role of phosphorus in hydrous
alkali aluminosilicate glasses, and (3) creation of a data base for phosphorus
contents of natural feldspars. This kind of information will also add greatly to
our understanding of pegmatites and other felsic residual magmas.
