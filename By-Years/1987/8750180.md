Spectropolarimetry is being fully integrated into the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum at Trinity University. A polarimeter equipped with a monochrometer
and continuous sources affords applications that demonstrate the essential
characteristics of optical activity measurements in understanding the
3-dimensional structure of chiral molecules. Determination of the optical
rotations of inorganic complexes and organic compounds, the measurement of
optical rotatory dispersion curves in conformational analyses and base stacking
of nucleosides, and the determination of the specific rotation of pure
enantiomers by modern methods are among the activities students are
experiencing.
