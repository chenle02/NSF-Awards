An undergraduate research participation project will be held in the UNLV
Physics Department during the summer of 1992, with follow-up activities during
the 1992-93 academic year. The research efforts are in the areas of atomic,
molecular and optical physics, astronomy, and condensed matter physics. Students
will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on laboratory experience using lasers,
to analyze astronomical data on a workstation using image analysis software, and
perform numerical computation and simulation using the UNLV Cray supercomputer.
This program builds upon the successful experience of the past four years, in
which undergraduates have worked in research laboratories in the department.
Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from selected schools in
the Los Angeles area.
