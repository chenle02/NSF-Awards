Exploring complex topics in general biology laboratories is often impossible due
to economic, technical, ethical, or time constraints Students work
algorithmically from rigid manuals, mimicking scientific practice without
understanding it. Rarely do they learn that science is a dynamic, problem-
solving activity as opposed to a collection of laws and facts. Funds from this
award will be used to develop a new computer- based laboratory curriculum for
general biology, designed to emphasize open-ended problem-solving activities
that more closely resemble what scientists actually do. Students will be
involved in posing, testing and evaluating hypotheses, and in communicating
their ideas to their peers. Graphics-oriented computer workstations, equipped
with production software (e.g. spreadsheets and custom simulations of biological
systems, will be used by students as tools to practice science. Activities will
include: (1) use of spreadsheets and statistical packages to help organize data,
discover patterns, and test hypotheses; (2) use of flexible simulation
environments ("lab construction kits ") that provide an electronic toolbox of
components from which students can design their own experiments; and (3)
establishment of an electronic journal with students and faculty working
together as editor and reviewers. The grantee institution is matching this NSF
award with funds from non- Federal sources.
