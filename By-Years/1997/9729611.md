This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Through this new
connection, Northeastern intends to facilitate a significant increase in science
and engineering research with specialized computing and communication
requirements. Representative projects include applications in high-energy
physics, biophysics, computer science, materials science, and engineering.
Related work will involve international collaborations, access to very large
datasets, interactive real-time experiments, and large-scale testing and
comparison of algorithms. Northeastern is collaborating with Boston University
in establishing its connection. At a later time, should Boston University
upgrade to OC-3 connectivity to the vBNS, Northeastern expects to do likewise.
