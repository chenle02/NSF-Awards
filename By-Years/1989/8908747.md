The work planned in this mathematical sciences group research project seeks to
combine two approaches to the problem of representing signals as expansions of
discrete sets of functions. One is through the Gabor transform, the other uses
the wavelet expansion. One of the primary goals of this research is to combine
the two approches using a new technique called the multiplicative Zak transform.
Applications of this work will concentrate on characterizations of non-
stationary signals. Algorithms will be developed to compute the coefficients of
the resulting double series expansion and signal properties will be derived from
the expansions. Since the multiplicative Zak transformation can be interpreted
as the Weil map, it appears in another context within the representation theory
of the Heisenberg group. This theory provides insight into special function
theory including theta functions and Krautchouk and Poisson-Charlier
polynomials. Applications to number theory are also planned. //
