This project will support the creation of a microcomputer laboratory for
undergraduate mathematics at Columbia University. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated
goal of improving "the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting
projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory
and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering." This laboratory
will serve undergraduate students in both lower division (calculus, linear
algebra, theory of equations with applications, and ordinary differential
equations) and upper division (number theory, dynamical systems, and Fourier
analysis) courses and will enable them to use state-of-the-art computer graphics
and both numerical and symbolic computer software.
