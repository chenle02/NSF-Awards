Many key problems in industrial and biological processes involve mechanisms
which occur at solid-fluid interfaces. Adsorption, lubrication, dispersion
stability, sol-gel fabrication, and membrane transport all involve solid/fluid
interactions. The goals of this research are to understand and predict, at the
molecular level, the behavior of fluid next to or between solid surfaces.
Theoretical aspects will focus on development of molecular theories for strongly
homogeneous fluids. Experimental research will focus on use of the surface force
apparatus and will complement the theoretical work.
