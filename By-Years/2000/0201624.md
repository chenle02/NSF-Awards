The project will investigate the role of ULF waves in the energization and
diffusion of highly energetic radiation belt particles. It will extend a
previously existing two-dimensional model of energetic particles in the Earth's
radiation belts to three dimensions, which will allow the model to include
effects such as losses of energetic particles to the upper atmosphere. It will
couple the model to a more realistic model of the magnetic field and electric
field produced by Magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the global magnetosphere.
