This research will study the SPMP (Selective Private Model-
based&lt;br/&gt;Prediction) problem demonstrated with the following scenario: A
client&lt;br/&gt;with a private input wants to use a server's private model to
make&lt;br/&gt;predictions; however, neither side wants to disclose its private
data to&lt;br/&gt;anybody. More specifically, the research will study the
problem for&lt;br/&gt;selected models including the Hidden Markov Model, the
Neural Network&lt;br/&gt;Model, the Bayesian Network Model, and the Decision
Trees Model. The goal&lt;br/&gt;is to develop efficient and practical solutions
that enable such type of&lt;br/&gt;privacy preserving
prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate two approaches:
commodity-server approach and&lt;br/&gt;multiple-server approach. The commodity-
server approach uses the&lt;br/&gt;commodities (data) from a third party to
preserve the confidentiality of&lt;br/&gt;the private data. The multiple-server
approach uses duplicate servers so&lt;br/&gt;no single server can learn all
information about the client's data. Based&lt;br/&gt;on these two approaches,
various data disguising techniques will also
be&lt;br/&gt;studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient solutions to the SPMP
problems enable model owners to provide&lt;br/&gt;new forms of e-commerce
services while protecting customers' private&lt;br/&gt;information. Furthermore,
the results, methodologies, and the building&lt;br/&gt;blocks gained from the
proposed activity can provide invaluable&lt;br/&gt;understanding and insights
into the Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)&lt;br/&gt;research, and help to
advance and expand the areas of SMC research.&lt;br/&gt;------------------------
