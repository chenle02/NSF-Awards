In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Robert N. Compton of the University of Tennessee will
continue and expand his researches on electron attachment to molecules and
negative ions. Work on singly and doubly charged anions will continue. New work
will be directed to observe the cross section for electron attachment to a
negative ion and to determine its autodetachment lifetime. Electron affinities
of these anions will be measured and compared to values obtained by means of
Rydberg electron transfer and field detachment methods. In addition,
photodetachment cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions as
function of photon energy will be determined and compared to theoretical values.

This research will be conducted with the assistance of graduate and
undergraduate students, as well as with collaborators within and outside the
United States. Through their participation in this research and the
collaborations with other American and international groups the students will
gain valuable experience that prepares them for advanced studies or employment
in the academic, government or industrial sectors of the economy.
