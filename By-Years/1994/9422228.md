STERMAN Accumulating evidence suggests that for many firms, including winners
of the Baldrige award, successful quality improvement programs have not led to
greater business success. The researchers hypothesize that productivity gains
from successful quality programs can interact unfavorably with existing routines
and structures. Unrecognized interdepencies may cause unanticipated side effects
that cause firms to take actions that ultimately lead to the demise of otherwise
successful programs. The researchers will study five organizations to identify
the nature of such interactions and assess the circumstances in which they feed
back to undercut the benefits of successful quality initiatives. Hypotheses were
generated and research methods developed based on a preliminary study of the
unanticipated side effects of quality improvements at Analog Devices, Inc. This
research will begin with development of case histories of the quality program in
five firms (AT&T, Bose, Ford, Harley-Davidson, National Semi-Conductor) then
develop formal models of the systematic impacts of quality programs on firm
dynamics. A `Management Flight Simulator` will be developed based on results to
allow managers and students to understand challenges facing organizations as
they implement quality programs.
