Anabaena is a filamentous cyanobacterium that responds to nitrogen deprivation
by elaborating along the filaments semi- regularly spaced cells called
heterocysts that are specialized for nitrogen fixation. The cells that
differentiate in response to nitrogen step down may be the same as those that
first sense nitrogen deprivation; or if the latter cells respond to nitrogen
deprivation by initiating a sequential process of scavenging nitrogen form
contiguous cell, the differentiating cells may be positioned distant from the
cells that first sense nitrogen deprivation; or if differentiation merely makes
manifest a latent (albeit experimentally manipulable) pattern, the
differentiating cells may bear no consistent spatial relationship to the cells
first sensing nitrogen deprivation. Dr. Wolk has developed an array of
techniques to study spatial and temporal aspects of the expression of genes in
the developing filament, and dependency relationships between pairs of genes.
This array includes the use of transposons and site directed insertions that
incorporate genes for luciferase to report on the activity of individual
promoters cell by cell along a filament. To elucidate the mechanism of
heterocyst spacing, he proposes to: 1) identify genes required for control of
heterocyst formation, genes regulating early responses to nitrogen deprivation,
and the dependency relationships among them; 2) elucidate the spatial
relationship between the sites of activation of genes in response to nitrogen
deprivation, ant the location of eventual heterocyst formation; 3) ascertain
whether possible transcriptional inhomogeneities in nitrogen replete filaments
bear any spatial relationship to subsequent differentiation; and 4) investigate
how particular experimental manipulations affect differentiation and pattern
formation.
