RF plasma discharge reactors will be employed to deposit anti- corrosive
coatings as protective layers for a variety of surface reactive materials. In
addition to providing protection from oxidative degradation, these coatings
provide excellent moisture protection. The proposed studies are based on recent
observations of the oxidation resistance of these coatings. Furthermore we have
demonstrated that these coatings can be applied to a variety of materials under
appropriate plasma conditions. Specific materials identified in this proposal
include rubbers, elastomers, optical devices and various carbon-carbon
materials. The Phase I research effort centers on a more quantitative
characterization of these films along with a determination of their corrosion
resistivity.
