Photovoltaic energy conversion is an important industry for the future of the
world?s energy system. The current production volume worldwide is over 2.5
GW/year, growing at over 40% per year. The current industry is based
approximately 91% on the use of crystalline Si, and the growth of the industry
has been hampered by the high and increasing cost of Si wafers. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI program focuses
on developing low cost, high performance solar photovoltaic technology based on
thin film Si deposited on polymer substrates, using a transformative device
architecture. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses an alternative thin film
silicon technology that can achieve a level of performance similar to that of
thick crystalline silicon , while using only 1-2 micrometer thicknesses. The
proposed work focuses on the investigation of novel device architectures
including use of amorphous/crystalline superlattices, photonic bandgap
structures and new material growth techniques to achieve higher performance in
thin film silicon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program involves a strong collaboration with PowerFilm
Solar, the leading U. S. company working on polymer based solar cells. The
program will offer research and educational opportunities to both graduate and
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
