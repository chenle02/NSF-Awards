While major changes have taken place in all areas of the natural sciences,
introductory instruction in both the lecture hall and the laboratory has not
changed significantly in many years. The PI instituted innovative teaching
techniques in an elementary chemistry course called "Chemistry and Crime: From
Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science" for the non-science major. The
techniques used in the laboratory have received national attention and many
colleagues have instituted similar innovations. However, many institutions do
not have the resources to develop laboratory programs along these lines and, as
times have changed, are increasingly concerned with exposing the students to
situations now recognized as potentially dangerous. Since the PI has proven that
forensics can be used to spark interest in science and since it is given that
young people are intrigued by computer graphics, it was decided to use computer
animated simulations to allow extensive, intensive investigation of scientific
evidence collected at simulated crime scenes and studied using simulated
scientific instruments. These animated modules will enhance not only the
laboratory program in the forensic science course but also the programs in
introductory science courses for majors. The PI will guide the development of
the computer animated modules, develop the story board and oversee the computer
interfacing and the integration of the components into the curriculum. The
actual modules will be created by Engineering Animation, Inc. EAI, using their
Vislab software, is one of the premier computer animation companies in the
world. It is anticipated that implementing this innovative and creative
approach, as part of an overall multimedia program including actual laboratory
experience, will enhance science education by stimulating interest and
engendering enthusiasm instead of promoting the stereotype that science is
boring and hard.
