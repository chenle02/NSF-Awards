This project is a mathematics research training group in the areas of number
theory, applied algebra, and algebraic geometry. The research group activities,
centered on training through research involvement for students and postdoctoral
associates, include collaborative undergraduate research labs (CURLs), a summer
enhancement program for training new U.S. graduate students, and miniconferences
and graduate student research conferences. Postdoctoral associates receive
substantial mentoring to ensure their continued professional development, and
graduate students play a central role in the research activity. Graduate
students mentor undergraduates in CURL participation, spend semesters in the new
Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, and receive special fellowships at the
critical juncture of starting a thesis.

The Algebraic Geometry, Applied Algebra, and Number Theory Group at Wisconsin
has seen a recent influx of faculty with substantial experience in mentoring
students. The group will develop a unique, ground-breaking program in Applied
Algebra, in conjunction with the multidisciplinary Wisconsin Institutes for
Discovery, providing broad training in the education of students and postdocs
for diverse careers in academia and industry.
