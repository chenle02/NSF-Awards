The reconstruction of 3D-scenes from noisy camera images is a fundamental
problem in computer vision. In this project, these reconstructions are
approached as problems in polynomial optimization, which is not the usual
practice in computer vision. By understanding the mathematical structure of
these problems, we aim to advance theoretical understanding of these problems
and to develop practical and efficient algorithms for 3D reconstruction. This
project creates an unusual opportunity to apply methods from optimization,
algebraic geometry and computational algebra to applied problems that are both
mathematically rich and practically important. A second component of this
project seeks to develop the theory of cone factorizations of nonnegative
matrices with a special emphasis on positive semi-definite factorizations. This
new concept has many potential applications to diverse areas such as
optimization, data compression, machine learning and statistics. Both projects
involve graduate students and their training in a number of inter-disciplinary
mathematical areas.

The main project outlined in this proposal is a multi-year effort to understand
the algebraic geometric foundations of 3D-reconstruction problems in computer
vision. This process involves two steps -- the first is to identify the
constraints and the second to solve these problems efficiently using methods
from convex optimization. The first step requires methods from computational
algebra and classical algebraic geometry and the second step relies on
techniques from optimization, real algebraic geometry and convex geometry. These
problems also provide numerous fascinating applications of (computational)
representation theory, multi-linear algebra, and geometry, and the two-way
exchange will enrich both mathematics and computer vision. Students will be
trained in this cross-disciplinary work and several researchers from
mathematics, optimization, and computer vision will be involved in this project.
The project on cone factorizations builds on a currently booming area at the
interface of mathematics and computer science. Developed originally by the PI
and collaborators for the sake of understanding extended formulations of convex
sets, these factorizations have much further potential and applications. The
plan is to develop the structural and mathematical theory of cone factorizations
with the aim of better understanding extended formulations and other potential
applications.
