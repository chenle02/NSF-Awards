This award supports the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS)
conference ?Foundations of Causal Graphical Models and Structure Discovery?
hosted by the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University, May 15-19, 2023.
The main lecturer of the conference is Dr. Kun Zhang of the Department of
Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University, an expert in the field of causal
discovery and learning. The series of ten lectures and other conference
activities are expected to provide investigators and trainees outstanding
opportunities to learn and discuss foundational ideas as well as recent advances
in causal discovery. The regional emphasis of the conference will strengthen the
links and collaborations among research groups and institutions in Texas and
will expand research programs in causal discovery.

Understanding causality is arguably the ultimate goal in any field of science.
Knowledge about causality allows one to predict a system?s behavior under
external interventions, a key step towards understanding and engineering that
system. While the gold standard for establishing causality remains controlled
experimentation, such experimentation is not always possible due to practical or
ethical concerns. Therefore, inferring causality from observational data has
become an increasingly popular research area attracting researchers from
statistics, philosophy, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data
science. The ever-changing field of causal discovery leads to a steep learning
curve for students and junior researchers. This conference aims to provide a
deep review of causal discovery that will help to orient researchers new to the
topic. For more information, please refer to the conference webpage:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
