9410706 Franklin The multiscalar processor is a recently proposed execution
paradigm for exploiting instruction-level parallelism. It is a collection of
sequential processors that are connected together in a logically decoupled and
physically decentralized manner using ring-type network. The central idea is to
divide an instruction stream into blocks of instructions, and then exploit
parallelism by executing these blocks using multiple processing elements. The
multiscalar processor has generated wide interest, both in the academia and the
industry, and seems to have tremendous potential to become the processing
paradigm of choice for a circa 2000 intruction level parallel processor. The
purpose of this research is to develop a high performance fault tolerant
multiscalar processor and to provide an impetus to the incorporation of fault
tolerance in general purpose processors. The primary manner fault tolerance will
be incorporated in the multiscalar processor is by run-time replication of
software and by executing the replicas on the processor's multiple execution
units, which are provided for performance reasons. Two re-execution schemes
(both using the same replication technique) are under investigation. Preliminary
simulation studies have been conducted to get an idea of the performance loss
incurred because of fault tolerance. These preliminary results indicate that
time-redundant techniques are an excellent choice for providing fault tolerance
in the multiscalar processor. ***
