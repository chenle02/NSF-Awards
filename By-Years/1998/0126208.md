The proposed study will investigate the potentially significant role of the
Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current System in the global ocean
circulation. The focus will be on those specific antarctic processes that can
influence the World Ocean, including formation of major water masses in the
vicinity of Antarctica, air-sea exchanges of heat, moisture and momentum, as
well as eddy mixing in the Southern Ocean. Key questions to be addressed
are:&lt;br/&gt;1. What is the dynamical role of the Antarctic Bottom Water?
&lt;br/&gt;2. What is the role of the Antarctic Intermediate Water in the global
circulation? &lt;br/&gt;3. Why is the global thermohaline circulation sensitive
to the magnitude of southern hemisphere winds?&lt;br/&gt;4. What is the
sensitivity of the global thermohaline circulation to the magnitudes of southern
hemisphere heat and moisture fluxes? &lt;br/&gt;5. What is the role of the eddy
mixing in the Southern Ocean?&lt;br/&gt;6. What is the role of the lateral
fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum across the northern&lt;br/&gt;boundary of
the Southern Ocean?&lt;br/&gt;These questions will be addressed with an ocean
general circulation model coupled to a sophisticated sea-ice model in a series
of numerical experiments combining a sufficient degree of realism with
computational efficiency, in order to obtain meaningful results within a
reasonable time frame. The work significantly improve our understanding of the
dynamics of the Southern Ocean, and will emphasize the importance of the
Antarctic region and the need for future observational and modeling studies of
the area.&lt;br/&gt;
