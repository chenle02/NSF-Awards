The proposal is to provide support for a conference of experienced women
geoscientists to (1) identify the elements contributing to the
underrepresentation of women in science and technology, and (2) develop
recommendations for actions to rectify the problem. The discussion topics will
include tenure for women in academic institutions, empowerment of women
geoscientists (leadership, policy-making, visibility), the pre-college
"pipeline", and women who are ethnic minorities.
