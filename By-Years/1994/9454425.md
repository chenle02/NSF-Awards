9454425 Barnhart This project implements a 5-year, multi-phase Teacher
Enhancement program consistent with the West Virginia Science Curriculum
Framework (WVSCF). As a statewide project it will reach all 7-10th grade science
teachers. It is a leadership project congruent with the national science
standards, Project 2061's tenets and the tenets of SS&amp;C. The project
develops a Cadre of change agents and teams of Science Mentor Teachers(SMT), at
least one team for each of West Virginia's 55 counties, and empowers them to
provide high quality professional development in science education to their
peers in West Virginia. Workshops and institutes will immerse: 35 master
teachers in 30 days of classroom/laboratory/field experiences; 150 leader
teachers in 25-days of such experiences; and 1000 s/m/t educators in 12-days of
such experiences and teleconferencing. Content specific courses will be
delivered by satellite to meet content enhancement needs of the teachers. There
are 55 implementation outreach workshops which will reach teachers who have not
participated in NSF/TE workshops previously. Administrators and guidance
counselors will also participate in the training. Participants may earn graduate
or continuing education credit. Indeed, one component of the project is a Master
of Arts Degree in Coordinated and Thematic Science offered jointly by the
graduate institutions of the state.
