&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Nanowires'
unique geometry leads to a large surface area to volume ratio, which, along with
the capability of rational control in doping and heterostructure formation, can
be exploited in many devices and subsystem modules for various applications. In
this program, we will build upon our experience on nanowire growth on
semiconductors substrates to advance the study of nanowire based electro-optic
and photonic devices such as nanowire optical modulator and nanowire photodiode
for optical communications, and to develop fabrication processes that allow the
massive integration of nanowire devices with Si devices. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will advance the
technologies that make functional nanowire devices and allow their integration
with existing CMOS or Si Photonic circuits. Optical modulator and photodiode
incorporating nanowires investigated and fabricated in this program will lead to
very significant and important advances in optical communication systems as well
as enabling high speed and energy efficient optical intrachip interconnects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will provide a better
understanding of nanowire properties that are essential for achieving
performance uniformity and reproducibility in devices incorporating nanowires.
From an educational perspective, the project will train undergraduate and
graduate students in an inherently interdisciplinary field by incorporating
aspects of materials science, nano- scale device and fabrication, into existing
courses. The project will contribute to the educational infrastructure required
to attract and train a broadly represented group of future engineers through
undergraduate seminars and research participation, and through outreach to high
school students.
