This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project addresses the
development of a proton- exchange membrane for use in elevated temperature
proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (ETPEMFC) (>100C) for automotive
applications. In this work we propose to develop a membrane that can operate at
temperatures approaching 150C. Specific program objectives include: (1) to
demonstrate feasibility of fabricating a membrane for ETPEMFC use, (2) to
evaluate select, important physical/chemical properties of the membrane, (3) to
fabricate high performance Membrane-Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) for ETPEMFC use,
and (4) to demonstrate performance of the MEA in single-cell ETPEMFC at
temperatures up to 150C. The proposed research will consist of membrane
synthesis, evaluation and fuel cell testing.

The potential market for PEMFC, for transportation vehicles and utility
applications (residential, power) is in the 100s of billions of dollars. The
California (CA) legislature previously mandated that by 2004, 10% of large
volume manufacturer's sales in CA must be Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs). Many
other states, including Massachusetts, followed the lead taken by CA. The market
value of residential fuel cells, by the year 2020, is expected to reach $40
billion according to estimates by the Small Scale Fuel Cell Commercialization
Group, Oklahoma City. Retail prices for the residential systems (approx 7 kW)
are expected to be $4,000 by the year 2003.
