Knowledge of Late Quaternary environments of the desert southwest has expanded
greatly in the past twenty years, due mostly to the introduction of
paleobotanical studies of packrat middens. Paleoecological reconstructions of
the Chihuahuan Desert regions of western Texas have been developed by Van
Devender (1985) for the past 40,000 years, documenting a series of vegetational
responses to environmental changes during and after the Wisconsin Glaciation.
Van Devender has made a series of 110 insect fossil assemblages available for
detailed investigation. In this research, these assemblages will be used to test
hypotheses concerning modern analogs for past insect faunal assemblages, the
relative rate of insect response to environmental change in comparison to that
of the vegetation, and the origins of the modern Chihuahuan Desert insect fauna.
In addition, the taphonomy of insect fossils in packrat middens will be examined
and modern insect habitat and distribution data will be collected. Experiments
on live-trapped packrats will test their acceptance and/or preference for
various large-sized beetle species. The insect fossil samples cover the same
time span as the paleobotanical record, and derive from the same midden samples.
This provides site-by-site and sample-by-sample paleobotanical data and
radiocarbon chronologies for correlation with insect fossil data.
