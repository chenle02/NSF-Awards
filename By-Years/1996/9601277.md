Research will be carried out in two subfields of theoretical elementary
particle physics. One project will deal with string theory, the most promising
candidate for the unification of all the fundamental interactions in nature.
Particular attention is paid to models that can be exactly solved to extract
physical insights and to apply them to the real world. The strategy is to search
for exact relations between apparently different models, which will be then used
to solve more difficult and realistic models. This project will also investigate
the theoretical basis of novel phenomena in materials physics, observed in
interfaces at high magnetic field. The phenomena of interest are associated with
a class or quantum statistic, extending ideas associated with researchers such
as Bose, Einstein, Fermi and Dirac. Understanding the theoretical basis for the
rich variety of complex phenomena in the behavior of materials strengthens our
ability to develop new materials and applications. A second project will
continue first principle studies of quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the
strong nuclear interactions) through the use of high performance computer
simulations. Emphasis is to be placed on testing and refining improved methods
of computation that promise to extend dramatically the power of numerical
simulation at a vastly reduced computational cost. The new methods will make it
possible, starting from experimental results, to extract the most precise
information to date about the fundamental interactions in nature. They will also
be used to explore the high temperature phase transition between quarks and
gluons confined in nuclear particles such as nucleons and the free quark-gluon
plasma. Such a phase transition occurred in the evolution of the early universe
and is thought to be achievable in the laboratory in collisions of heavy ions at
the RHIC accelerator currently under construction at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory. These studies are important for extending our understanding of the
most fundamental basis of our physical world and of the origins of our universe.
Ideas concerning new computational methods are likely to have applications in
other computational fields.
