The principal investigator and his collaborators propose to work on aspects of
Langlands' program and related topics. A conjecture of Serre predicts that
certain 2-dimensional mod p representations of Galois groups over Q arise from
modular forms, and it further predicts the level and weight of the form. Serre's
conjecture can be viewed as a mod p version of Langlands' correspondence, and
the weight part as a manifestation of its local behavior at p. A main focus of
the proposed research concerns a generalization of the weight part of Serre's
conjecture to the context of Hilbert modular forms and totally real fields,
where the developing formulation reveals new phenomena. The research also
addresses topics to which this has connections and applications, including
congruences between modular forms, deformations of Galois representations, the
global Langlands' correspondence and special values of L-functions.

Langlands' program predicts a deep correspondence between objects from algebraic
geometry (solution sets of polynomial equations, such as elliptic curves) and
objects from representation theory (functions with symmetry properties, such as
modular forms). While there has been significant recent progress (for example,
the advances of Wiles and of Lafforgue), Langlands' program remains largely
conjectural. The links it provides between two seemingly different branches of
mathematics reveal properties of the integers, which can, in turn, have
applications to cryptography.
