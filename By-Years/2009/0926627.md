Inorganic polymers, also called geopolymers, present a unique opportunity to
make concrete binders almost entirely from waste-stream materials. However,
there are many challenges that must be overcome in order to see implementation
of these materials in civil infrastructure. One major stumbling block is that
the waste materials used to make inorganic polymers are inherently highly
variable, heterogeneous, and difficult to comprehensively characterize. The
purpose of this investigation is to clarify the relationship between material
composition and performance in inorganic polymer binders in order to facilitate
production of inorganic polymer concrete from underutilized waste-stream
sources. Selected wastes, primarily those from coal burning, will be fully
characterized for phase composition and reactivity using newly refined analysis
methods specifically adapted for this purpose. The characteristics for optimum
performance in inorganic polymer concrete will be determined, and this knowledge
will be used to identify promising waste materials from sources that are
currently landfilled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portland cement concrete is the
dominant building material. However, portland cement production accounts for 2%
of primary energy consumption and 5% of global CO2 emissions resulting from
human activity. The successful replacement of portland cement concrete with
inorganic polymer concrete in infrastructure and repair applications could
greatly reduce CO2 emissions and energy use. Furthermore, targeting
underutilized waste materials for inorganic polymer concrete will reduce
landfilling. While the field of civil engineering is increasingly emphasizing
sustainable development, classroom emphasis on these concepts is lagging.
Research, teaching and outreach efforts performed during the proposed project
will begin to address this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
