With this award, the Division of Chemistry supports the Chemistry Departments of
Louisiana State University and Southern University in a cooperative project to
develop an environmental chemistry research and education program. Dr. Isiah
Warner, Louisiana State University, and Dr. Earl Doomes, Southern University,
will direct the project. The program will enhance the environmental chemistry
curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Distance learning will be
used to include five other state institutions in pilot courses and seminars.
Research will be carried out by a group of undergraduates during the summer.
Graduate and undergraduate research will be focused in three areas: toxic metal
sequestering agents, sensor technology, and immobilization of wastes in solids
or by adsorption. In addition, collaborations will be formed with chemical
industry in the region and industrial perspectives will be integrated into the
students' educational experience.
