This proposal will provide partial support to U.S. graduate students, postdocs
and young scientists to attend the workshop "Properties and Processes of Crustal
Fault Zones" to be held in the Erice, Sicily (Italy), from May 18 to May 24,
2013. No tenured faculty will be supported with these funds, and priority will
be given to underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
workshop is to bring together the leading experts from various sub-disciplines
of earth sciences, material science, and physics to facilitate the exchange and
integration of ideas, methods and results across the typical disciplinary
boundaries in an attempt to provide a holistic examination of the structure and
evolution of fault zones in relation to earthquakes properties and generated
ground motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding provides an important
opportunity for U.S. students and early career scientists to meet and interact
with their peers and with the leaders in the various fields in an informal
setting, gaining a deeper and broader understanding, and forming the basis for
future international cross-disciplinary collaborations.
