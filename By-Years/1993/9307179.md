9307179 Sen This project proposes new efforts in the feedback control of plasma
instabilities which could have relevance for a variety of plasm sources and
devices used in the manufacturing industry. All plasmas are subject to
instabilities and consequent fluctuations, which cause nonunforimities in the
plasma, increased transport, and possibly microscopic breakup. The elimination
of instabilities is sometimes imperative, but their suppression is always
desirable for better performance. The proposed modulated ion beam suppressors
are unique truly non-perturbing remote type controllers applicable to most
plasma devices. State feedback and optimal control schemes proposed are generic
control systems suitable for complex systems with many modes of instabilities.
Furthermore, adaptive and neural net controllers are proposed for the
challenging problem of controlling controlling plasmas with partly unknown
dynamics. Lastly, the proposed study of anomalous transport (including its
scaling behavior) addresses a fundamental open question in plasma science and
engineering. All the proposed studies focus on common problems and propose
generic solutions relevant to all plasma devices, irrespective of their
appplications. ***
