9304263 Miller The PI will conduct a series of shock wave experiments to expand
the range of compositions of upper mantle assemblages studied and to obtain
partial molar volumes at high pressure. These experiments will permit a
determination of the effects of olivine fractionation in many mantle- derived
magmas. Experiments will also be performed to determine the Gruneisen parameter
for liquid silicates, addressing problems such as the thermal profile of a magma
ocean, and modeling of melting by adiabatic decompression of hot mantle diapirs.
