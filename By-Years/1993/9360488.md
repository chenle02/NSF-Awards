9360488 Goodman The use of high energy (1-5 MeV), high power (250 kW-1 MW)
electron beams allows the low cost fabrication of unique high temperature
materials which are not economically manufactured using conventional fabrication
methods. Materials which can fabricated using this process include nickel-based
super alloys with graded thermal and mechanical properties and ceramic-
reinforced TixAl and NixAl metal-matrix composited. The electron beam
fabrication process melts and consolidates pure or alloy powders, woven or
particulate reinforcement material and metal foils to produce net shape
structures. Science Research Laboratory has developed a new generation of pulsed
linear induction accelerators (LIA) which allow reliable, cost efficient
production of high average power electron beams with the necessary parameters
for high energy electron beam (HEEB) material fabrication. Unique features of
these accelerators include high repetition rate (&gt;5000pps) all-solid-state
pulsed power drivers which make these accelerators scalable to megawatt power
levels at a capital cost of the accelerator is approximately $2/Watt. *** ! ! !
