The objective of this program is to research, develop, and explore applications
of a new type of optical flow sensor that can measure ultra-flow volumetric flow
rates in real time with three orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the best
commercially available mass flow meters (which use acoustic techniques). The
performance of this new flow sensor is predicted to rival the best laser doppler
velocimetric results in its linear velocity sensitivity. However, it directly
measures volumetric flow rates instead of point particle velocities. In addition
it should be a much cheaper technology. Such an instrument can find a wide range
of applications in materials processing, medical instrumentation, and chemical
measurement and analysis, both in terms of serving present needs and in being a
new measurement tool for further research within these areas. In this program,
we will apply the sensor to directly observe slow flows and diffusions
associated with liquid chromatography systems. The sensor concept is based on
the relativistic Fresnel drag effect which causes the speed of lig ht to differ
between upstream and downstream directed beams. The difference in speed is
linearly proportional to the flow velocity and can be measured with extreme
sensitivity using a state-of-the-art fiber optics Sagnac interferometer.
