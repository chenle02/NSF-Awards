A physicist and mathematician at Colorado School of Mines will combine efforts
to develop and test an integrated calculus and physics course. A unique feature
will be well-planned laboratory/workshops session where much of the integration
of the subject matter will occur. These sessions will provide students with the
opportunity to explore and discover the relationships between a physical
situation, its graphical or geometric representation and the corresponding
analytical representation. The workshop exercises will consist of physics
experiments, numerical simulations, symbolic manipulations, computer programming
and formal reasoning exercises. Study guides, problem sets and modular materials
will be developed. The modules will be self-contained. There will be internal
and longitudinal evaluation of students' progress, as well as external review of
a National Advisory Committee.
