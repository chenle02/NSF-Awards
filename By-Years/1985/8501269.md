This program is aimed at understanding how the central nervous system (CNS)
responds to injury. In particular, a growth response is studied that involves
the invasion of the hippocampal formation in the rat brain by axons that are
normally restricted to blood vessels. This growth response occurs only when
specific areas of the CNS are damaged and appears to be due to the presence of a
neuronal growth factor similar in nature to the classical nerve growth factor
(NGF). Since other axons do not grow in response to the damage, this neuronal
rearrangement appears to be a specific response to injury of the CNS. To
determine whether the growing axons come into direct contact with CNS neurons,
the researchers are using electron microscopic techniques. Studies of the growth
factor involve the use of tissue culture procedures that allow for the detection
of small quantities of neuronal growth factors. These studies of neuronal growth
following CNS injury should assist in unraveling the complex biological
mechanisms that regulate the normal development of neuronal connections.
