The Stony Brook Relativistic Heavy Ion Group are leaders in Experiment
accelerator. This experiment is designed to measure both extreme peripheral
heavy ion collisions as well as the transition to control collisions by
combining 4TT calorimetry with high resolution forward spectrometry. In addition
the goals have recently been expanded to search for strangelets. Initial
experiments have involved 10 GeV/nucleon beams of silicon colliding with targets
of copper and lead. Future experiments planned during the grant period will
involve gold beams colliding with similar heavy targets.
