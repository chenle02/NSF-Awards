Software is a critical part of the economic infrastructure and software errors
cost tens of billions of dollars annually. Models are often used to capture the
behavior of software components, users, and the physical environment, as well as
their interaction. However, these models are often ignored when implementing the
system in code. The M2C (Models to Code) project is a pilot study aimed at
bridging the gap between design-level models and code-level implementations
through the generation of correct and efficient code from high-level design
models. The M2C project creates infrastructure for defining models, using them
in designing systems that are correct by construction, and generating code that
faithfully implements these models on a range of platforms. This will help
improve the software development process globally, with substantial savings in
associated costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In M2C, formalized models of computation
are used to model complex systems. These models are analyzed compositionally for
correctness, and code is generated from them to support simulation and efficient
execution. The investigators specifically consider two basic paradigms. The
first is a functional sublanguage of the PVS Specification and verification
system that can be used to define widely used mathematical and statistical
operations, and to capture the semantics of processor instruction sets,
programming languages, and models of computation. The second is a compositional
model of computation based on quasi-periodic execution that underpins the
architecture definition language Radler. By focusing on the generation of
correct and efficient code from verified models, this project creates a seamless
design flow for safety-critical software-based systems going from abstract
mathematical models to concrete code that can be used for simulation or
execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
