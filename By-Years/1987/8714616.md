The main goal of this research project is to obtain a detailed understanding at
the molecular level the kinetics and mechanisms of gas - surface interactions.
Changes in the nature of the adsorbate chemical bond are studied by time
resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (TREELS) coupled with fast
temperature and pressure perturbations. A wide range of surface processes can be
studied by this excite - and - probe technique, including adsorption/desorption,
dissociation, and reaction of adsorbate. More specifically, the proposed project
will address problems in the following areas: 1. alkali-promoted dissociations
and reactions, 2. effects of impurities on surface kinetics, 3. synthesis
reactions, and 4. electron and photon induced reactions. Extension of the
experimental time resolution from millisecond to microsecond range will be
undertaken. In addition to improvise a faster 96-channel multidector and data
acquisition electronics for TREELS, the more rapid pressure and temperature
perturbations will be achieved by the addition of a chopper to the pulsed
molecular beam and direct heating with a microsecond pulsed laser, respectively.
A pulsed electron source will be generated from a negative electron affinity
GaAs photocathode.
