9360569 Hansen The objective of this research is the adaptation of thermal
field-flow fractionation technology to high temperatures for the separation of
ultra-high molecular weight polymers. The basic technique discriminates among
polymer molecules on the basis of molecular weight as the polymer solution
undergoes laminar channel flow between a hot and cold wall. Macromolecules move
toward the cold wall by thermal diffusion while ordinary diffusion tends to
cause the lower molecular weight species to migrate to the higher velocity
regions. Detector output versus time can be related to the molecular weight
distribution. Polymers are widely used in automotive, electronics, medical and
other industries. Performance of the polymers in these products often depends on
the physical characterization which is in turn affected by the composition of
the polymer. The instrumention system will to maintain and improve product
quality by providing information about polymer composition in polymer systems at
and beyond the capabilities of current methods. ***
