DMS-0307069&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Z. Arone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
goal of this project is to apply calculus of functors, especially
the&lt;br/&gt;"orthogonal calculus" version developed by M. Weiss, to the study
of spaces of&lt;br/&gt;embeddings. In more detail, let M, N be smooth manifolds.
The PI would like to&lt;br/&gt;study the space of embeddings Emb(M,N) by taking
the cartesian product of one or&lt;br/&gt;two of these manifolds with a generic
Euclidean space, and investigating the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the obtained
functor of the Eucliedan space. The general theory of&lt;br/&gt;calculus
associates with such a functor a sequence of "derivatives", where
the&lt;br/&gt;n-th derivative is a spectrum with an action of the orthogonal
group O(n), and a&lt;br/&gt;"Taylor tower" - a sequence of approximations by
polynomial functors. The study&lt;br/&gt;of the derivatives of the embedding
functor leads one to consider a rather&lt;br/&gt;beautiful array of topological
constructions, some classical, some new. The&lt;br/&gt;classical constructions
that one encounters include (a generalization of) the&lt;br/&gt;Fulton-McPherson
compactification, partition posets and spaces of trees. The PI&lt;br/&gt;hopes
that this project will yield significant new insights into the topology
of&lt;br/&gt;spaces of embeddings and automorphisms of
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manifolds are among the basic objects of study
in mathematics. Manifolds come in&lt;br/&gt;different dimensions. One
dimensional manifolds are curves, two dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds are
surfaces, and high dimensional manifolds are suitable extensions&lt;br/&gt;of
these concepts. One of the basic questions about manifolds is: given
a&lt;br/&gt;manifold M, what are the possible symmetries (diffeomorphisms) of M?
It was T.&lt;br/&gt;Goodwillie who came up with the very striking idea that
rather than approach&lt;br/&gt;such questions "one manifold at at a time", one
should study systematically how&lt;br/&gt;the space of symmetries (or whatever
it is we want to study) changes, as one&lt;br/&gt;varies the manifold. This
results in a theory analogous to the classical&lt;br/&gt;differential calculus,
where functions are studied via their derivatives, Taylor&lt;br/&gt;polynomials
and so forth. This idea provides one with a powerful and beautiful
&lt;br/&gt;framework for studying manifolds (and other objects of interest in
mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;especially topology), subsumes a fair amount of
classical techniques, and leads &lt;br/&gt;one to discover beautiful new
constructions in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
