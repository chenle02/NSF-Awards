9451844 Burtt Understanding external and internal microstructure and its
chemical composition is essential to understanding the function and development
of biological and geological systems. A high resolution, computer-driven
scanning electron microscope with a cryopreparation system and an X-ray Energy
Dispersive Detector provides a versatile teaching and research tool for
undergraduates. Cryopreparation eliminates hours of preparation time, which
makes the SEM usable by many students as part of laboratory exercises associated
with courses. The energy dispersive detector is vital to analysis of chemical
composition, which is important for geology students who must determine mineral
composition of samples and biology students who may look at the chemical
composition of pesticides deposited on leaves. Students will use the SEM in the
laboratory portion of many courses, but it will also be an important tool for
student research, which is strongly encouraged. Through lecture/demonstration,
laboratory exercises, and student research the project will impact 917
students/year.
