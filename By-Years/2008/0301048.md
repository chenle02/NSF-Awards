Inorganic single wall nanotubes (SWNT) are modeled over a range of three size
scales that represent the key physical characteristics when considering
nanotubes as individual elements or as components within a composite system. The
nanotubes will first be modeled at the atomic scale using an extension of the
molecular mechanics force field approach. Simulations will be completed for SWNT
under the various types of loadings under which these elements will usually be
subjected. The energies associated with these distortions can then be computed
as a function of deformation. Second, we equate these energies with those of an
equivalent membrane-shell continuum model. This localized behavior can then be
used to determine the wall thickness and elastic constants for the
representative continuum shell or fiber. The third and final model uses the
information on the geometric and material properties of the shell representation
to treat the nanotube as long, flexible elastica or as a finite fiber within a
composite. Both carbon and inorganic nanotubes will be studied, the latter class
of which will include methylalumoxane, methylalumium methylnitride, small and
large diameter molybdenum sulfide, boron nitride, and mixed carbon boronnitride.
