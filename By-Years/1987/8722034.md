This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is in the
area of the Thermodynamic and Thermophysical Properties of Solutions. The
research determines the thermodynamic behavior of binary fluid mixtures near
their critical point. The results of this research will shed light on the
interaction of fluids. It is also expected to be useful in providing data and
estimation schemes for the design of chemical extraction procedures that are of
importance to technology. The research will be performed by undergraduate
students in an institution that is committed to undergraduate research.
