This project is aimed at experimental and theoretical-simulation studies of
molecular and excitation transport, interactions, dynamics and chemical reaction
in small, confined material systems. Understanding the kinetics of
crystallation, phase transitions, solid state reactions, and exitonic
transformations in nanostructures will be emphasized. The controlled formation
of molecular wires or crystalline "dots" is relevant to the search for better
optical memories and chips, nanolithography, and supersensitive molecular
detectors.
