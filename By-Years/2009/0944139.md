Scientific &amp; Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The Synthetic Aesthetics project
will bring together scientists and engineers who are developing and applying
powerful new tools for engineering biology with artists and design professionals
who are expert at creating beautiful objects. The project will explore how the
tools of genetic engineering and biotechnology can be adapted and extended in
service of creative design processes, broadly defined. The project will also
provide scientific and engineering communities with access to the wisdom and
expertise of different design communities, who have collectively analyzed and
developed methods for producing systems that are in harmony with the natural
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable
and support broader access to the tools of biotechnology. Specifically, by
exploring how to responsibly enable the artistic and creative design communities
with the new tools underlying the next generation of biotechnology, the project
will ensure the broader consideration of many perspectives and the participation
of many voices in discussions regarding social issues associated with
biotechnology. Also, by enabling the next generation of biological engineers to
gain wisdom from the lessons of urban planning, architecture, environmental
studies, graphic design, and so on, the project will help to ensure that any
future applications of biological technologies, from large scale bioenergy
installations to environmental remediation projects, will be more likely to
contribute positively to both the human and natural environments. Stated
differently, the project will enable the consideration of new approaches to
engineering, in which lessons from nature and biology might better inform how we
approach and take responsibility for our interactions with the living
world.&lt;br/&gt;
