9503761 Shoureshi This supplement is to provide further financial support to the
project "Development and Performance Evaluation of Low Power Intelligent
Structural Control Systems." The project will develop a neural-based control
scheme, with emphasis on learning of structural parameter variations, and design
and construction of a new low-powered adaptive actuation system for structures.
The control system will have a fuzzy based uncertainty compensator. A small
scale cable bridge structure has been constructed for implementation of the
proposed control scheme. The supplementary funds will be used in this
experimental investigation and to support a graduate student. ***
