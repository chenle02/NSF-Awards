This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the
state-of-the-art in dewatering of industrial and municipal sludges in general
and oily sludges in particular. The project will evaluate the use of
nanoparticle materials to reduce polymer use and odor potential, increase cake
solids, and reduce dewatering costs for oil refinery sludge. The project will
use nanoscale materials with different architectures and surface characteristics
to address dewatering of oily sludges. The final task in the project, developing
plans for a field study with a practical dewatering technology, will be key for
proceeding to commercialization.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be the development
of a new class of dewatering aids for oily refinery sludge. The result will be
improved efficiency and better odor control for industrial oily sludges. In
addition, dewatering using nanoscale additives has the potential to increase the
percent solids in the dewatering cake, leading to a lower carbon footprint
through lower vehicle emissions.
