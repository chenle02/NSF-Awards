Faruk Gul and Ennio Stacchetti Northwestern University SBR-9510942 The proposal
concerns markets with indivisible goods and consists of two projects. The first
project concerns the existence and efficiency of Walrasian equilibrium in an
economy with complete information. The P.I. shows that two properties of
preferences, which they call substitutability and monotonicity are sufficient to
ensure the existence o a Walrasian equilibrium. The propose to find additional
properties of the these equilibria. The second project concerns the
characterization of the interim efficient, incentive-compatible Bayesian
mechanisms for the private-values incomplete information economy with the same
set of preferences. The P.I. shows that the efficient mechanisms are essentially
Vickery-Groves-Clarke (2nd price) auction mechanisms. The proposal is to extend
the results to the case of private preferences with common values..
