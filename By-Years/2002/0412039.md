The goal of the four-day conference is to examine the role that Optimality can
play, or should play, in modern statistics. Due to the advent of high throughput
data collection technology and the parallel development of computing power to
analyze such data, it often happens that statistical theory gives way to raw
computing power. Although most of the new exciting statistical methodologies
have provided tools to make headway in many important scientific problems, a
need to generalize and systematize this knowledge is now quite evident. The
Symposia will take place in Rice University and will bring together a group of
experts to discuss cutting-edge research optimality ideas in the context of
modern statistical methodologies. Although much progress has taken place in
areas such as data visualization and data mining and knowledge discovery, the
subjects are ripe for the development of an optimality paradigm that allows for
objective comparisons of methodologies. This new paradigm, although still to be
defined, is necessary to push the research frontiers in these important
disciplines.

The conference will showcase new developments by leading researchers in an
environment conducive to the development of new human resources. The focus will
be the development of theoretical ideas to provide strong underpinnings to the
many successful efforts in computation intensive areas where statisticians have
contributed. This award supports twelve young investigators and eight Ph.D.
students to attend the conference. Women and minority young investigators and
Ph.D. students will be actively recruited and encouraged to apply. Refereed
papers will be published.
