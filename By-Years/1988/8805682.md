This research is concerned with the development of efficient, versatile, and
accurate algorithms to solve partial differential equations using the boundary
integral method in three space dimensions. These schemes will be based on
recently developed techniques for efficiently approximating the boundaries of
three-dimensional bodies using linear approximants arising from complementary
pivoting methods. The new techniques are ideally suited for use in the numerical
approximation of integrals over surfaces and manifolds inherent in the boundary
integral method. Both interior and exterior problems for the Laplace, heat,
wave, and biharmonic equations will be treated. Time dependent and time
independent problems will be studied.
