This proposal seeks funding to design a coordinated system of student assessment
resources and technical assistance for addressing the assessment needs of the
MSPs. The design study has four goals: 1) To identify the student assessment
needs of MSP programs and classrooms through a survey of assessments the MSPs
plan to use, their current approaches to assessment, and their needs for
additional forms of assessment and technical assistance; 2) To design an
assessment resource management system (ARMS) that takes advantage of the
affordances of technology to serve the MSPs nationwide by supporting access,
use, customization and development of a range of appropriate assessments for MSP
programs and classrooms; 3) To plan the development of new assessment forms in
mathematics and science, some of which may be technologically-supported; and 4)
To design a longitudinal study of the impact of MSPs on assessment practice at
the classroom, school, district and state level.
