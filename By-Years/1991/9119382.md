This grant provides support for the operation, and analysis of data from, an
all-sky camera (ASC) at South Pole. The pictures from the ASC are important for
many auroral investigations, both to provide auroral morphology and to estimate
sky cloud cover. Even though the 35 mm film is analogue in nature, and therefore
somewhat qualitative, more quantitative information will be provided by
digitizing some of the film on sophisticated optical devices at other
laboratories. The same grant provides support for the operation of an ionosonde.
These instruments are important for determining the ionospheric "weather", and
should be operated on a continuing basis just as the tropospheric weather is
recorded on a regular basis by the station Meteorology Department.
