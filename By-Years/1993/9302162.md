9302162 Stern The PIs have completed descriptions and interpretations of
dredged, bathymetry and petrology of most of the Mariana Trough. In the present
project they will carry out petrological/geochemical analysis of a selected
group of samples. The data will be used to model evolution of incipient back arc
basins. ***
