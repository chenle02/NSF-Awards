This research is directed toward an optical fiber distribution network of a
large-scale computer communication network which essentially ties a local area
network to a long distance network. A key area of the investigation involves the
use of spread spectrum multiple access techniques for digital radio networks.
These techniques generally reduce the overall network control requirements and
have the potential to be more efficient than traditional techniques. The study
will include the design and analysis of optimal receivers that simultaneously
demodulate all transmitted signals of cellular digital radio systems and their
delay-throughput performance, of spread-spectrum random access procedures, and
of dynamically adaptive spread-spectrum random-access disciplines.
