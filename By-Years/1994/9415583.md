9415583 Eberly A joint, interdisciplinary Center for Theoretical, Mathematical
and Computational Research in Optical Science and Engineering will be
established at the University of Rochester. The Center will operate within five
departments, institutes and laboratories of the University and is intended to
provide advanced training in theoretical research in the broad field of optics,
including both science and technology. The Center will have a visitor program,
comprised mostly of trainees/fellows, provide graduate student education in
optical science and engineering and a research and development program which
will change as the frontiers of interest in the field change. Finally, a number
of industrial and government organizations have agreed to participate as
partners in the program. ***
