The Information Theory Workshop will be held in Haifa, Israel June 8-13, 1996.
Papers will present new results in the following areas: source coding, Shannon
theory, cryptography and security, detection and estimation, statistics and
information theory, coded modulation, convolutional and block codes, network
information theory, communication techniques and models. The Information Theory
Workshops constitute a longstanding series of distinguished meetings, tracking
and furthering progress in the field of Information Theory. 55 regular papers
are scheduled for presentation. There will also be a recent-results session. A
plenary address will be given by Prof. Jacob Ziv, foreign member of the U.S.
National Academy of Engineering, and president of the Israeli Academy of
Sciences. Travel support for up to seven U.S. participants is requested. Highest
priority will be given to young researchers who are presenting papers and
invited speakers, all from US institutions. The travel reimbursement will be
arranged through the IEEE.
