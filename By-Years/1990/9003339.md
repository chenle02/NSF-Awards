This project will study the mechanisms involved in the development of pattern
and form in embryology. This is to develop and analyze mathematical models for
generating specific patterns and appendages on the integument, specifically
alligator stripe patterns, feather and scale primordia and primate fingerprints.
The models are constructed around known biological facts and close contact will
be maintained with experimental collaborators. The nonlinear partial
differential equation systems which constitute the models will be investigated
analytically and numerically. The mathematical techniques used will primarily be
linear analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory and numerical simulation.
Development of appropriate graphical presentation of the patterned solutions of
the equations will play an important part. The results and biological
predictions will be compared with the biological data and hopefully will be used
to motivate specific experiments to try and elucidate the real patterning
process. Much of the research is closely linked to specific experimental studies
currently underway. The work emphasizes the need for integrating theoretical
studies with experimental and observational facts.
