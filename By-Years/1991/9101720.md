Professor Driver will study differential and integral analysis on loop spaces.
A primary goal is to prove an infinite dimensional version of Hodge's theorem
for loop spaces. The notion of harmonic forms will be determined by an Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck Lapacian whose exact definition will depend on the measure on the loop
space. An important theme in this work is to prove a logarithmic Sobolev
inequality for the resulting Dirichlet form. This project involves loop spaces.
In the special case of a two dimensional manifold, the loop space is just the
family of all continuous closed paths on a surface which start at some fixed
point. One key idea is to construct a measure on these paths so that one can
talk about the "volume" of a set of paths and thus integrate over the loop
space. This is important for understanding the topology of loop spaces and has
implications for string theory in physics.
