Electrical transport in semiconductor superlattices and nanostructures is
expected to exhibit strong non-linearities in large, high frequency electric
fields. Such fields and frequencies are available from the Free Electron Laser
Facility at UC Santa Barbara. This research focuses on dynamic localization,
quenching of the conductance in the presence of strong, high frequency, electric
fields, and photon assisted tunneling in semiconductor superlattices and multi-
quantum wells. Both vertical and lateral superlattices and nanostructures will
be investigated. %%% Modern materials synthesis and processing has enabled
researchers to fabricate semiconductor structures that are so small that the
"wave nature" of the electron controls their electrical properties. These
semiconductor nanostructures are characterized by a very non- linear dependence
of electron current on applied voltage, reminiscent of how a transformer works
in many everday applications. However, this research addresses electrical
responses many millions of times faster than in ordinary transformers, and hence
may lead to the development of new devices which function at frequencies beyond
even the radar frequencies common in the aircraft industry.
