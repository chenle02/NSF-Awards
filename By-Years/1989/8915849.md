Two powerful new tools for looking at solid/liquid interfaces have recently
become available, the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunnelling
Microscope (STM). The full extent of the power of these tools is yet to be
determined. This project involves using these new tools to try and examine
collagen at the solid/aqueous solution interface. Serious questions exist
regarding the results of AFM and STM imaging of macromolecules. The problems of
interpretation are compounded in an aqueous environment. In contrast, this is an
area of great technological importance. Development of successful techniques for
interpretation of images could significantly multiply our understanding of these
important systems, which arise in both biomedical and biotechnology
applications. This one year study will make use of existing instruments and
expertise at the University of Arizona to systematically prove the applicability
of these techniques in this important area.
