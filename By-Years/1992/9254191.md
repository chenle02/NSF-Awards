This project develops an introductory-level undergraduate curriculum in
anthropology for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The
curriculum begins with a two semester sequence in cultural anthropology and
research methodology followed by a summer ethnographic field school. The second
year includes a sequence of one semester of language and culture, a second
semester of field research, and a summer internship. A major focus of this
project is the development of multimedia and interactive modules which will
enhance students' understanding of basic anthropology, the research process, and
cultural and social perspectives. The proposed curriculum is also expected to
increase the scientific and technical literacy of underrepresented minorities at
other institutions.
