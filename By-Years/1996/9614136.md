9614136 Zhdanov Electromagnetic (EM) probing of the earth is one of the major
tools for surveying underground structures and the technique is used to map the
earth from the crust to the mantle. Applications include geological mapping,
mineral and oil prospecting, tectonic and earthquake studies, and environmental
assessment and monitoring. One of the most difficult problems of EM geophysical
methods is the interpretation of EM data in areas with 3-D geo-electrical
structures because of limitations of 3D forward modeling codes and ill-posedness
of inversion procedures. Currently available EM techniques can handle only
simple models and require supercomputer processing. The PI proposes to develop
fast and stable 3-D geo-EM inversion methods that can be applied to real
geophysical data using conventional PCs or Workstations using new methods based
on quasi-linear approximations of the existing integral equation algorithms. ***
