Laboratory experiments related to the physics and chemistry of clouds
frequently require the examination of single raindrops. Existing techniques
using freely falling drops or a charged drop suspended in an electric field are
often unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. A new technique, using acoustic
levitation and the object of this research, would enable new measurements to be
made in the laboratory. This device exploits acoustic standing waves to
accurately control the loaction of a single drop or crystal without direct
physical contact. Professor Hansman is a young scientist and a recent recipient
of a Presidential Young Investigator award. He was trained as an engineer and
highly qualified to carry out the proposed work. The ability to suspend a water
drop or crystal and to manipulate it with ease could benefit many laboratory
investigations in meteorology, particularly cloud physics, and atmospheric
chemistry. I recommend supoprt as a two-year continuing grant at the revised
budget level.
