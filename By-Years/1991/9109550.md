This research seeks to establish a preferred interconnection network for
massively parallel computers of the future. Such a network must have modestly
increasing hardware requirements as the number of processors increases but also
must efficiently support general patterns of communication. Hardware cost is
equated with physical space under a model accounting for minimum width and
spacing rules for wires. This is in keeping with the common use of area as a
cost measure for chips. Particular attention will be given to ensuring that
general-purpose communication capabilities hold up even when interprocessor
distances are large and when faults are introduced. This work will employ both
mathematical proof and simulation of proposed networks. The choice of a
preferred general-purpose interconnection network will allow for the development
of more portable and long-lasting parallel algorithms and programs.
