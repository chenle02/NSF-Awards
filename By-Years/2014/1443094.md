In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrey Vilesov of the
University of Southern California, through the auspices of the Gordon Research
Conferences, will support the participation of early-career U.S. scientists in
an important conference for researchers studying the physics and chemistry of
small clusters of atoms and molecules. Providing exposure and opportunities for
in-depth interaction between young U.S. scientists to the leaders in the field
is an important part in the young scientists development. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The subjects of this conference (Molecular and Ionic Clusters:
Structure and Dynamics of Isolated Particles) are important in understanding the
interaction of solutes with solvents (most of the chemistry taking place in the
natural environment) as well as understanding the unique chemistry that takes
place in atmospheric aerosols. The conference provides a unique venue for
bringing together both experimental and computational/theoretical physical
chemists.
