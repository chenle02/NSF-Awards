Style is a pivotal construct in theories of sociolinguistic variation, for it is
the locus of the individual' s internalization of broader social distributions
of variation. A robust theory of speech style is essential for theories of
variation, and for all work dealing with natural speech data, which requires
accountability in the elicitation and analysis of speech samples. Practice in
the field of variation has been based on a relatively unanalyzed model of style,
adequate for the elicitation and analysis of intraspeaker variation in the
context of sound change in progress. However, as social theories of variation
become more intricate, they require a more sophisticated treatment of style. In
recent years several models of stylistic variation have developed that hold
great promise for the advancement of the field. However, each of these theories
is partial, and synthesis requires intensive collaboration. A two-day workshop
will bring together researchers from several fields and several continents, who
have separately done work on speech style but have been unable to spend
concentrated collaborative time. The aim of the workshop is to bring their
findings and theories together and develop common goals and hypotheses for a new
phase of research.
