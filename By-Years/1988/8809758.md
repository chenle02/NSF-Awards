The project is to build a finite element software model over time of a rotating
electric machine, in either motoring or generating mode. The purpose of these
models is to simulate those conditions such as sudden short circuits,
nonsinusoidal inputs to the machine, unbalanced operation, etc. which cannot be
completely analyzed by presently available models. Several new techniques for
analyzing fields in three dimensions, adapting the mesh dynamically with rotor
motion, and computing torques will be tried. Models of rotating machines have
been developed over the years to analyze various conditions. Different models
work well for studying different conditions. Attempts to find more generalized
models that would be good for all conditions have made significant progress with
the availability of large computers. More efficient and accurate models are the
goals of this project.
