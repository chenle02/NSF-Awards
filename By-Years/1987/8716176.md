This projects will combine a suite of data on atmospheric humidity from diverse
sources to refine the moisture correction for GEOSAT altimetry. The altimetric
signal is refracted by moisture in the atmosphere, and since there is no
spaceborne sensor on GEOSAT, humidity must be obtained from other methods. This
work will use the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and SSMI data, if
available. The project will provide global maps of both water vapor and
altimeter corrections on an appropriate time and space scale. Appropriate scales
will be determined from analysis of the atmospheric variability.
