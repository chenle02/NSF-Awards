This award supports an international workshop on Andean glaciation to be held
in the field in Argentina and Chile from March 25 to April 11, 1989. The
fieldtrip will begin in Ushuaia, proceed to Lago Argentina, Bariloche, Isla de
Chiloe and end in Mendoza. About half of the 20 participants are from South
America: the others from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The
principal investigators are Wallace Broecker of the Lamont-Doherty Climate
Center at Columbia University and Jorge Rabassa, Director of CADIC (Southern
Center for Scientific Investigation) in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.
The glacial record in the southern Andes will be reviewed for evidence of a link
between glacial and climatic cycles in the northern and southern hemispheres.
Available glacial and paleobotanical evidence suggest that these events may be
synchronous. If so, this can only be explained by a massive reorganization of
the atmosphere-ocean system. This international group of experts will review
controversial field evidence which forms the basis for the history of Andean
mountain glaciation. Future cooperative, multidisciplinary research will focus
on solving the basic problem of climate forcing between the hemispheres.
