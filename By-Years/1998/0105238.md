Olson &lt;br/&gt;0105238 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of a series
laboratory fluid dynamical experiments designed to simulate processes that are
important in the generation of the geomagnetic field in Earth's liquid outer
core. One set of experiments will be conducted in rotating hemispherical shells
of fluid, and are intended to model thermal convection in the self-gravitating,
rotating, spherical geometry of the core. The purpose here is to delineate those
characteristics of rotating spherical shell convection that can be used to
interpret seismic and geomagnetic images of the core. A second series of
laboratory experiments will be conducted on thermochemical convection in
solidifying gallium-indium alloys, with and without the influences of rotation
and externally applied magnetic fields. &lt;br/&gt;The gallium-indium alloy is
analogous to the iron-rich alloy of the outer core, and the solidification
represents the growth of Earth's solid inner core. &lt;br/&gt;These experiments
are designed to test the assumptions of the gravitationally powered dynamo
model, which is widely regarded as the most likely energy source for the
geodynamo, and to determine the properties of turbulent fluid motion in the
environment of the outer core. &lt;br/&gt;
