Over forty years of intermittent observations have established that the aurora
emits radio noise which can be observed on the ground. Surprisingly, despite the
intensity with which the aurora is studied, very little is known about these
radio emissions, their frequency-time characteristics, their occurrence
statistics, or their generation mechanisms. This grant will support an
investigation into the spectrum of radio emissions from the aurora in the
frequency range 0.2-20 MHz using an inexpensive ground-based "smart" system,
consisting of a radio receiver and data storage device controlled by a small
computer. This will be located near Fairbanks, Alaska at the site of previous
measurements of auroral radio emissions, thus saving time and expense of finding
a low-noise location. Other instruments are located nearby to support the
measurements, and the Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks will provide on-site
assistance. The scientific motivation for this grant may be summarized as
follows: 1) To better characterize the earth's radio environment; 2) To study
space plasma physics processes from the ground by observing the radio signatures
of those processes; and 3) To explore possibilities of using radio emissions as
an index of auroral activity. Although radio emissions comprise a small fraction
of the total energy of the aurora, they may provide important clues to the more
energetic processes, in analogy to the way in which solar radio emissions have
been used to infer the processes taking place in the solar corona.
