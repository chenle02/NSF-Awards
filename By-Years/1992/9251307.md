This proposal requests funds for computer equipment to serve an emerging
multimedia curriculum in introductory archaeology and archaeological method and
theory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Undergraduate students
will be introduced to the complexities of scientific archaeology, and to major
developments in human prehistory using a Hypercard- based, interactive set of
computer exercises. An Archaeology Learning Center with 15 networked
microcomputers will be established that will serve both introductory and upper-
division archaeology courses. The computer equipment will also assist the
Department of Anthropology in disseminating multimedia materials such as
Anthropology 3 to other institutions across the nation.
