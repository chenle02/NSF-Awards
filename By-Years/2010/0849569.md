This project will emphasize approaches to studying brain hormones and receptors
that utilize new methodologies that are becoming available through the
disciplines of hormonal genomics and proteomics, and presenting themselves
through knowledge of basal vertebrate systems. Based on previous and present
findings, this research will include novel studies using established techniques
and developing complementary molecular techniques to, in part, increase the
understanding and insight into the molecular and functional evolution of brain
and pituitary hormones and receptors. The studies will focus on the molecular,
biochemical and functional studies of brain gonadotropin releasing hormone and
pituitary gonadotropins in lampreys to test the overall hypothesis that these
hormones and their receptor(s) share common functional and developmental
features compared to later evolved vertebrates. The research will examine the
roles that modifications in interactive cellular networks, represented by genes
and their products (hormones, receptors, and signaling molecules), have on
biological function from the perspectives of molecular, cellular, and systems
biology. This research has and will include graduate and undergraduate students
who will be trained and involved in all aspects of this project. Outreach
activities will include presentations to the general public at different kinds
of forums such as the annual NH Sea Lamprey Appreciation Day as well as
collaborations with investigators from other institutions. In addition, the PI
and her laboratory will continue their collaborations with students and staff at
New Hampshire Technical Community College (NHCTC) and students at UNH.
