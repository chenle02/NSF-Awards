The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Harvard
University supports interactive research in four major groups covering a broad
area of condensed matter and materials science. Researchers in the group focused
on new materials are concerned with synthesis, characterization, and theoretical
studies of superconductors and superhard carbon-based materials. Investigators
in the group concerned with interfaces focus on collaborative aspects of
interface science including organic monolayers and thin films, wetting and
nucleation, mechanisms of interface motion in amorphous materials, and
characterization of semiconductor surfaces. The group investigating electronic
and photonic nanostructures addresses size effects and new electronic and
photonic phenomena in a variety of materials. The group of researchers involved
with design and manufacturing issues aims to develop a new paradigm for choosing
the optimum materials and processes necessary to manufacture a component. The
MRSEC also supports the development, operation and maintenance of shared
experimental facilities for materials research. It provides seed funding for
exploratory research, has a minority fellowship program, and fosters research
participation by undergraduates. The MRSEC administers an industrial outreach
program which is likely to be enhanced by the activities in design and
manufacturing. The MRSEC currently supports 23 senior investigators, 12
postdoctoral research associates, 9 technical staff members, 16 graduate
students, and 8 undergraduates. The Harvard MRSEC is directed by Professor Frans
Spaepen.
