The herbarium of the National Tropical Botanical Garden holds a large and
taxonomically diverse collection of Hawaiian and Pacific island plants,
including the most significant recent collection of plants from Kauai and other
major islands. Cabinets housing this collection of approximately 35,000
specimens have become seriously overcrowded, making the specimens difficult to
access and subject to physical damage. This project will support the purchase of
eight full-height and twenty-three half-height herbarium cabinets to accommodate
present holdings and allow for modest growth of the collection. The additional
cabinets will accommodate newly mounted specimens, substantially increase user
accessibility, and reduce risk of damage to the collections. It will also
support the mounting of the backlog of approximately 4,000 specimens stored
outside of cabinets in order to make them accessible for research and loan
purposes. The resulting upgraded storage and archival facilities will greatly
facilitate and improve research use and long-term management of this important
collection.
