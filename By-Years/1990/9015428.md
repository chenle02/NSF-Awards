ABSTRACT The purpose of this project is to investigate a number of theoretical
issues in language acquisition through an experimental study of binding in
Icelandic. "Binding" refers tosystematic constraints on the relationship between
pronouns and their antecedents. Icelandic is a very interesting language for
studying the acquisition of binding, as it has binding properties that are
distinct from English. In particular, Icelandic has a "long distance" reflexive
construction which has generated considerable interest in linguistic theory and
has motivated theoretical work in language acquisition as well. The data will be
collected in Reykjavik, Iceland. 30 children, ages 3;0-6;0, will serve as
subjects of three experiments designed to determine their interpretations of
reflexives and pronouns, and thus to illuminate the course of the acquisition of
binding in Icelandic. The results of this study will bear on a number of issues
in acquisition theory and linguistic theory. First, it will provide a
description of the Icelandic child's acquisition of binding, an area which has
received very little attention, and thus will contribute to the growing body of
cross-linguistic research into the development of binding. In addition, it will
illuminate aspects of the syntax of Icelandic, in particular, the linguistic
analysis of long distance reflexives. Finally, the study has direct implications
for general linguistic theory and for the developmental processes involved in
the acquisition of syntax.
