Graduate student Ms. Jun Wen, under the faculty guidance of Dr. Tod Stuessy of
Ohio State University, will prepare a modern taxonomic treatment of the
estimated 35 species of the flowering plant genus Aralia. The species occur
throughout North America and in eastern Asia, and present an interesting problem
in historical biogeography. New data on morphology and anatomy will be acquired
from herbarium specimens and from new collections to be made in China; field
work has already been completed in Mexico and in the United States by the
student. In addition, chromosome analyses and floral-morphological data will be
used to test relationships with associated genera such as Pentapanax and
Sciadodendron. A revised taxonomy of the genus, providing consistent
delimitation of all species and reliable identification keys, mapping geographic
distributions, and summarizing knowledge of ecology and of reproductive biology,
will help further understanding of a widespread pattern of disjunct plant
distribution in the northern hemisphere.
