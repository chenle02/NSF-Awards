This research involves the use of metal stabilized vinylcarbenoids as reactive
intermediates in organic synthesis with three specific aims. First is the
development of asymmetric synthesis with vinyl carbenoids using (-)-pantolactone
and related systems as inexpensive chiral auxilaries. Second is the synthesis of
phorbol analogues using the tandem cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement sequence.
The third area is the study of novel annulation reactions based on preliminary
observations which have shown unusual reactivity at the vinyl terminus of
monosubstituted vinylcarbenoids containing an electron withdrawing group. %%%
With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will
support the research of Dr. Huw M.L. Davies of the Department of Chemistry at
Wake Forest University. The research involves the use of metal stabilized
vinylcarbenoids as reactive intermediates in organic synthesis. These intriguing
and fascinating species will be used to development asymmetric synthetic
methodology. Their utility will be demonstrated in the synthesis of several
natural products or analogues.
