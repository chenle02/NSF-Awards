This award will support a seminar, "Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics of
Drosophila", organized jointly by Prof. William T. Starmer of Syracuse
University and Prof. J.S.F. Barker, of the University of New England, Armidale,
N.S.W. Participants will meet in January 1989 at the University of New England
to discuss current work, and to consider new U.S.-Australia cooperative research
projects, in the fields of population biology, biochemical genetics, and
molecular genetics. The overall theme of the workshop will be the merging of
disciplines into a coherent structure for the study of evolution. A better
understanding of the organization and maintenance of genetic variation is
epected to emerge. Such an understanding is necessary for more efficient
manipulation in breeding programs and in the control of insect pests.
