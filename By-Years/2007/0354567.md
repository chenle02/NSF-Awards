&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;De la Llave&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to develop a variety of methods that allow&lt;br/&gt;to understand
the long term behavior of dynamical systems and partial&lt;br/&gt;differential
equations. The methods are designed to work together as&lt;br/&gt;a toolkit. We
also plan to use this to study to several problems that&lt;br/&gt;have been
posed in the literature. Among the tools to be developed are: variational
methods and their qualitative consequences, KAM theory, normal hyperbolic
manifolds, slow manifolds, regularity results for cohomology equations,
numerical computations. Among the problems to be considered are the equilibrium
configurations of models from statistical mechanics, the problem of PDE
describing periodic media and the problem of instability in Hamiltonian systems
subject to periodic perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often one has
to make predictions of systems over a large period of&lt;br/&gt;time or over a
large spatial extension. Even if a completely detailed&lt;br/&gt;study is often
impossible, one can hope to identify special features in&lt;br/&gt;the system
which allow to make significant predictions, at least in some cases. Ideally,
these features do not change much if the system is altered and can be computed
efficiently. In this proposal, we will develop an array of tools that allow to
identify and to compute several of these organizing features, both in the
context of systems extended in space and in the context of long term prediction.
The more theoretical work will be developed hand in hand with some concrete
applications that have been proposed in the natural sciences literature. Among
those, the problem of effective properties of periodic (in space) media and the
problem of response of a non-linear mechanical system to external forcing which
is periodic in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
