This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination Theory and
Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners under that competition.
The central focus of this research is experimental observation of groups doing
real collaborative work and using systems and communications media explicitly
designed to aid in their tasks. Expected results are to expand understanding of
how people collaborate and how to design systems that augment collaborative
activities. To this end the project has five interdependent components: 1) a
theoretical foundation for observing and understanding the social and cognitive
aspects of group collaborations; 2) tools for rapid prototyping and
reconfiguration of application environments for use by working groups, and
multi- media communications to support multi-person interactions; 3) protocol
analysis tools to record and study how individuals and groups interact through
the networked computer environment; 4) application testbed systems (generic and
domain specific) that can be used by groups engaged in real work; and 5) group
studies and experiments to test systems, social and cognitive hypotheses.
