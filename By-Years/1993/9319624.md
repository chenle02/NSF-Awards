Adenosine is a naturally-occurring substance which serves as a neurotransmitter,
thereby helping cells to communicate. Target cells which are responsive to
adenosine bear specific receptors for adenosine. These receptors transmit the
adenosine signal from outside of the cell to the interior, and the function of
the target cell can be regulated. The preliminary data for this project
demonstrates that the adenosine receptor subtype 2a A2a receptor is subject to
regulation by adenosine itself and potentially by other neurotransmitters. The
adenosine receptor protein has structural features which are potential targets
for regulatory mechanisms, such as the addition of phosphate groups. The
proposed work will use molecular biology and pharmacology methods in a
laboratory cell culture system to analyze the structural features of the A2a
adenosine receptor which confer regulation of the receptor protein.
