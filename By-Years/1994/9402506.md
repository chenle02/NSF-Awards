9402506 Graham This project will analyze the He isotopes in rocks collected from
three parts of the mid-ocean ridge system--the East Pacific Ridge, the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge, and an area of the Southeast Indian Ridge. The isotopes will be
compared with other geochemical and geophysical parameters from these areas, to
address a set of questions concerning the variability of mantle magmas. ***
