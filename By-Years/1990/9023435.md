This project will study the process of turnover in the small business sector.
The work departs from previous research in that rather than treating the
business firm alone as the unit of analysis, the business firm and the owner are
considered together. Thinking this way leads to a consideration of another
aspect of firm turnover which has received little attention in the literature on
small businesses, namely, the movement of businesses across owners. The project
will employ a new data set collected by the Census Bureau called the
Characteristics of Business Owners Survey. The first part of the project will be
an unstructured approach to uncover the basic patterns in the data with respect
to business turnover. The second part is to develop a theory which successfully
organizes the data in the sense of being capable of matching the most
significant patterns. The model to be developed will combine two search
processes. The first is the search for good matches between businesses and
business owners. The second is the search for businesses of high "general"
quality. The small business sector represents a nonnegligible portion of all
economic activity in the United States. Census figures show that 23 percent of
all employment in 1982 was accounted for by firms with 19 or fewer employees.
Understanding the characteristics of these businesses is important for
estimating the impact of government policies, especially the treatment of
capital gains and other tax policy issues.
