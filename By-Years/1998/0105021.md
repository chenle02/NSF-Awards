Understanding the way in which predators interact with prey communities is a
central challenge of ecology, and becomes more difficult and important in
habitats disturbed by humans. Habitat destruction and nutrient enrichment,
common anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, may shift systems from being prey-
limited to being habitat-limited, with important consequences for predators.
Predators may be less effective at controlling prey populations, and this likely
has far-reaching effects on ecosystem characteristics. Pacific northwest streams
provide a compelling example of these dynamics. Preliminary evidence for larval
Pacific giant salamanders, dominant predators in old growth forest streams,
suggests that logging shifts the ecosystem from being prey-limited to being
habitat-limited. Experimental food and habitat addition at old growth and logged
sites will determine whether salamander larvae are limited by habitat or by
prey. Further, manipulating salamander densities and monitoring the prey
community will determine the relative impact on the abundance and diversity of
prey.
