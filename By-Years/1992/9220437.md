In cooperation with the National Academy of Sciences, the Earthquake Engineering
Research Institute will convene a two and a half day conference in the San
Francisco Bay Area focusing on the application of lessons learned from the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. The conference will be opened to the public and
information developed through prepared papers will be widely distributed to
funding agencies, participants, others in the professional community, and
government officials. It is expected that the conference will provide NSF and
other federal agencies with valuable observations on unresolved problems and
serve to stimulate future research studies on high priority areas in
engineering, the geosciences, and the social sciences.
