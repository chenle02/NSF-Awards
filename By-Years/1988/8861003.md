Among the many software engineering concepts developed to increase programmer
productivity, one of the most promising and most sought after is reuse of
existing, proven software. A general program, also referred to as the
"archetyped source", can be adapted to a broad spectrum of specific situations.
An example is a program for multi- sensor integration, which can be instantiated
for various combinations of actual types of sensors. Ada and other high-level
languages offer abstractions for writing general forms of programs; these are
intended to be used by the programmer to adapt the program on a case-by-case
basis. In this proposal, we show how a "tailoring" system can utilize
abstractions in the programming language; it also allows the designer to
formulate other abstractions in a metanotation for describing the general
program and its specific forms. Thus the notion of an "archetyped source" can be
quite powerful in the context of the derivation of application- specific "actual
sources" from it. During the course of the Phase I project, they will use some
existing application-specific software that AKM Associates built for the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), define "archetyped source" version of it and the
appropriate metanotation for generating actual source.
