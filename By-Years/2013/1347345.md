This I-Corps Site, at the University of Utah Center for Medical Innovation,
enhances and builds upon their existing expertise in medical device innovation,
commercialization and entrepreneurship. The Center for Medical Innovation (CMI)
at the University of Utah developed as a collaborative effort between The
College of Engineering, The University of Utah Health Sciences Center, The David
Eccles School of Business and The Technology and Venture Commercialization
Program. Their's is an integrated activity that supports faculty and student
professional development, develops multi-disciplinary educational programs in
medical device entrepreneurship and has the potential to improve national
healthcare delivery through commercialization of student and faculty
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Site will help bridge gaps and
enhance the translation of University-based Innovations to commercialization.
This will allow the University of Utah to expand their innovation programs,
provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and
improve recruitment of prospective and under-represented participants enhancing
the diversity of entrepreneurial teams in the I-Corps program and regional
commercial sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Utah I-Corps Site
Grant will enable the University Center for Medical Innovation to facilitate and
accelerate the development and commercialization of student and faculty
innovations through entrepreneurial education, mentorship and seed grant funding
to help bridge the gap between early prototype development and
commercialization. These entrepreneurial teams will translate their innovative
research ideas through early stage product development into full
commercialization resulting in regional economic growth and job creation. This
Site's partnership network includes University of Utah programs that support
underrepresented student and faculty groups that offer the support and resources
needed to help underrepresented groups thrive and participate in the process.
