The >>ecotone between trees and the tundra in northern latitudes and with
altitude in all areas of the world is a place where average temperature
increases have been detected already. This increase in temperature is said to be
caused by increased CO..2 in the global atmosphere. Whatever its cause, the
effect will be to alter plant growth and distribution at the tree line ecotone.
This study will investigate possible causes for limited tree growth at the tree
line and thus provide fundamental data against which we may assess shifts in
vegetation and the tree line as global CO.2 increases. Climatic change may best
be detected at this cold dominated sensitive ecotone. The investigator, Dr. B.
Sveinbjornsson, is an expert in northern latitude ecology, and his institution,
University of Alaska, Anchorage, is well situated and equipped to support the
work.
