Research will be carried out on optically pumped alkali vapor targets. This
research is important for both polarized ion sources and targets. Research on
low relaxation rate wall coatings for optically pumped Na, K, and Rb vapors will
be carried out. Both liquid and solid coatings will be studied with emphasis
placed on studing liquid coatings that are easily replaced by flowing fresh
liquid and that may heal themselves when damaged. Research on the limitations
imposed by radiation trapping on the density and polarization of an optically
pumped alkali vapor target as a function of the magnetic field will be carried
out. Both the relaxation rate and radiation trapping research is important for
improving the optically pumped alkali vapor target used as the charge transfer
target in the optically pumped polarized hydrogen ion source. Research on a spin
exchange polarized hydrogen target for nuclear scattering is also proposed.
Finally research on the prospects for the direct extraction of polarized ions
from an optically pumped alkali vapor-hydrogen discharge is proposed.
