Rothman 9418039 This project is for research on the physics of complex
geophysical flows, with emphasis on scale-dependent aspects of multiphase flows.
The research is primarily computational, and the principal computational tools
are the lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann methods. These methods provide special
capabilities for the study of flows with complex interfaces or flows through
complex geometries. The present project emphasizes the application of lattice-
gas and lattice-Boltzmann models to studies of real, three-dimensional, complex
flows. ****
