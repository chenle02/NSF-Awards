In large flexible structures, control is required to eliminate vibrations
induced by actions within and on the structure. The structure may comprise new
materials which provide an inherent capability to actuate every strut in a truss
or any discretized field of body forces in a solid. Furthermore, the structure
configuration itself may change over time. Adaptive control is an appealing
concept for such problems since it provides system identification and updating
with system changes. This project applies adaptive control to an arbitrarily
large structure, of the type previously described, and uses neural (massively
parallel) computing to implement the control. Earlier neural network research
suggest that a neural network approach may constitute a powerful architecture
for the adaptive control of large structures. The research seeks fundamental
analogues to prove or disprove a neural network capability for the large
structures problem.
