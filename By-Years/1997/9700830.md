9700830 Schlesinger This project, centered around the Free-Air Carbon dioxide
Enrichment (FACE) experiment in the Duke Forest of central North Carolina, is
designed to elucidate changes in soil carbon dynamics in response to an
ecosystem-level atmospheric CO2 enrichment. In reaching this objective, the
research proposed here is intended to address questions surrounding process-
level understanding of soil function and its link with the atmosphere and
groundwater. Fluxes of carbon into and out of the soil system, as well as
transfers and storage within the soil profile, will be examined. Importantly,
the study will capitalize on the use of stable carbon isotope (C-13) tracers
that will be introduced into the atmosphere of the FACE plot with the CO2
enrichment. This isotope tracer will allow the examination of the rate of carbon
incorporation into soil organic matter, the effect of soil acidity on weathering
rates, and the potential of a long-term atmospheric carbon sink in soils and
groundwater. This research is of particular interest and importance to global
change scientists and policy-makers interested in the "missing sink", soil
scientists examining carbon dynamics, and geochemists interested in the extent
of biotic control over chemical weathering.
