The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation
(PFI)â€“ RAPID Project is to develop a diagnostic platform that is well-suited for
widespread monitoring of infection during pandemics, such as the current
COVID-19 threat. It consists of a low-cost mailer that can be used at home,
returned in the mail in a safely-sealed, confidential envelope and quickly
scanned upon receipt without opening to diagnose infection. These results can be
relayed to the user immediately and a real-time outbreak map along with affected
demographics can be produced. This approach off-loads the burden of diagnostics
from health workers, eliminates the increased use of limited personal protective
equipment, and provides a better response to outbreaks. Resources could be more
efficiently allocated by local and federal governments, and workers could make
more informed decisions on staying at home or going to work. Moreover, this
project will train a team of four students to collaborate quickly together to
meet the design constraints of an actual product based on technologies from
their thesis work. Commercial impact beyond COVID-19 would be a highly modular
platform that can be rapidly adapted to other current diagnostic needs (HIV,
tropical diseases) as well as future pandemics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project overcomes the current methods of COVID-19 detection which are
limited by 1) healthcare workers having to collect samples, 2) shipment of
biological specimens, and 3) bottleneck of assessment with current RT-PCR
techniques. What is needed is a more rapid method of widespread genetic testing
for epidemic control that overcomes these limitations. Here we propose a new
sensor system that relies on embedded contact-free sensors and sensitive RNA
detection and amplification in a low-cost, passive (no onboard power) solution
that allows for the user to collect sample and safely carry or mail to a local
scanner. In this work we will design genetic switches sensitive to COVID-19 RNA
(aim 1), implement these switches on paper substrates with cell free protein
production (aim 2), and integrate them with a resonant sensor RF transducer (aim
3). The project deliverable will be a working prototype that is tested in our
collaborative labs, along with a first generation data visualization
interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
