Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how differences in firms'
beliefs about project feasibility, success and future potential profits affect
research and development (R&amp;D) activity. These differences may arise due to
firms’ prior experience with similar projects or how farther along a firm is in
R&amp;D process. Firms have an incentive to learn what their rivals know. While
learning about rivals’ progress may be easier in some industries such as
pharmaceuticals due to reporting regulations, it is challenging in other
industries as firms protect their R&amp;D specific information. The project is
centered around three major research questions. First, the project explores firm
incentives to share private information with others and its impact on the
society. Second, the research examines whether firms should make R&amp;D
progress public or not. Third, the project looks at the reasons behind why
startups focus on radical innovations and new products whereas established firms
tend to pursue incremental innovations and improvements to existing products.
The project has policy and regulatory implications in understanding the role of
information asymmetry and information sharing on R&amp;D activities for startups
and established firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on R&amp;D
races where rivals have asymmetric information about the feasibility of the
project. The project explores three issues. First, if firms can commit to be
truthful, then the benefits of better information to a firm seem to outweigh
competitive concerns. Although firms should have an incentive to share what they
know, this decreases the probability of success and is detrimental from a social
perspective. Second, firms can invest more in R&amp;D if they do not share
R&amp;D progress publicly as information on a rival abandoning a line of
research has a strong discouragement effect on others. Third, the observed
regularity about incremental and radical innovations can be explained in terms
of information: Smaller startup firms can usually observe the R&amp;D activity
of larger, established firms better than the other way around, which affects
risk taking behavior. This project studies these issues in a rich setting
incorporating imperfect monitoring of R&amp;D activity by firms, capital
constraints and intellectual capital. The project further considers implications
of incremental and radical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
