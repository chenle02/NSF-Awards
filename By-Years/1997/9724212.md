9724212 Reid This award to University of Miami in Florida provides funds for
acquisition of a new scanning electronic microscope and related instrumentation.
This field-emission environmental scanning electron microscope allows both high
magnification sample analysis in high vacuum mode and analysis of wet or
uncoated samples in low vacuum mode, significantly enhancing researchers'
ability to study environmental samples without preparation artifacts. This award
from the Major Research Instrumentation Program is jointly supported by both
Division of Ocean Sciences in the Geosciences Directorate and the Division of
Biological Infrastructure in the Biological Sciences Directorate. It is expected
to provide major improvements over existing analytical capabilities for
researchers in both earth and biological sciences, as well as other fields, and
it is anticipated that it will serve as an important catalyst for integration of
research and education in environmental sciences at University of Miami and
other South Florida colleges. Substantial cost-share is offered by the
University of Miami towards this project. ***
