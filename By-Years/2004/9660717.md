*** 96-0717 Wong This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will
develop a method of producing fine, uniform tantalum (Ta) filaments, using
technology originally developed for superconductors, and determine the
performanceof these filaments in electrolytic capacitors. Existing Ta powders
used for capacitors have demonstrated increasing specific capacitance as the
manufacturers have improved the sodium reduction process. However the new
powders are more sensitive to capacitor production process parameters such as
sintering time and temperature and forming voltage. This forces a compromise in
the final capacitor between capacitance level and negative performance criteria
such as operation voltage, leakage, breakdown voltage, and equivalent series
resistance. In addition, the new powders are much more expensive due to the
lower production yields. The performance of the Ta filaments is expected to meet
or exceed that of commercially available powder without any of the performance
drawbacks such as sensitivity to sintering temperature or forming voltage while
promising higher yields and lower costs. The Ta filaments have the ability to
address a sizable Ta powder market for electrolytic capacitors. ***
