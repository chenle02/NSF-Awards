ABSTRACT

This award will fund travel and local expenses for 40 US graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, two invited speakers, and six special-
session organizers to attend the "Seventh International Conference on Dynamical
Systems and Differential Equations," to be held at the University of Texas in
Arlington, Texas, May 18-21, 2008. The conference is the seventh in a series of
biannual conferences organized by the American Institute of Mathematical
Sciences (AIMS). The topics to be discussed cover a broad range of topics in
differential equations and dynamical systems and their applications in
engineering and the physical and life science. Previous conferences have
attracted an increasing number of participants, with a record number 0f 694
participants at the Sixth conference in Poitiers, France (2006).The program of
the conference will consist of invited lectures, special sessions, and
contributed talks. The conference maintains a web site at
