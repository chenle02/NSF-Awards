Through this project, the Information Institute of Syracuse is integrating human
expertise into the evolving digital library being developed through the NSDL
program and is building a virtual reference desk to support the library. In
particular, a research study is exploring how the integration of reference and
collection building may lead to a more effective information service. The
research questions shall ask when and why users seek help online, and how an
NSDL virtual reference desk may be evaluated. Multiple qualitative (content
analysis and "talk aloud protocols") and quantitative (web usage analysis and
surveys) methods shall be used to ascertain a better understanding of the
digital reference process. The project's second objective is to build an
operational virtual reference desk system for the NSDL. This system will build
on the extensive digital reference expertise the Information Institute of
Syracuse gained through its AskERIC and Virtual Reference Desk projects. The
NSDL operational system will use in-place math, science, and technology
expertise as well as digital reference systems experience to build a functioning
distributed virtual reference desk. &lt;br/&gt;
