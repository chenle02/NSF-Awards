This research addresses the development of new approaches to carbon-carbon bond
formation by oxidation of functionalized dienes using electrochemistry.
Preliminary results indicate that five, six and seven-membered rings can be
formed in high yield by this methodology. The studies involve the design,
synthesis and electrochemical oxidation of a series of coupling substrates aimed
at probing the overall requirements of the reaction. These experiments are
designed to examine the coupling reactions involving the initiating and
terminating groups that are compatible with the reaction conditions, the size of
the rings that can be formed, the effect of substituents, the stereochemistry of
the products, and the effect of the reaction conditions on product formation.
Finally, the project examines the synthetic utility of the reactions for
constructing polycyclic ring systems and initiating tandem cyclization
reactions. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry
Division will support the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of the Department of
Chemistry at Washington University. The project is in the general area of
synthetic methodology and focusses on the development of carbon-carbon bond
formation by oxidation of functionalized dienes using electrochemical methods.
These types of reactions are extremely important because they allow the
development of entirely new routes for molecular synthesis. Oxidative organic
electrochemistry is ideally suited for initiating the key step in these
reactions since it can selectively generate reactive intermediates under neutral
conditions.
