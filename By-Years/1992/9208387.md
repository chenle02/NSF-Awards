This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support continued studies by Professor R. H. Holm of Harvard University in
several areas of bioinorganic chemistry. Areas to be investigated include 1)
molybdenum oxotransferases including synthesis of analogues and isotopic
labeling studies of rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase; 2) synthesis of models for
the cofactors of nitrogenase; 3) functional models of the nickel enzymes
hydrogenase and CO dehydrogenase. In all analogue studies emphasis is on
synthetic models that provide functional mimics of the enzyme action. In a less
biologically related area investigations of the synthesis of molecular
chalogenide clusters from soluble thiometallates and by excision of fragments
from insoluble, nonmolecular solids will be undertaken. %%% The nature of many
enzymes is such that precise molecular structures and mechanistic details cannot
be determined by conventional physical techniques. A variety of indirect methods
have evolved that can be used to infer enzyme structures and to help define the
individual chemical steps involved in their catalytic mechanisms. The
application and development of these indirect methods is the purpose of this
research.
