The main research objective is to integrate meteorological procedures for
obtaining estimates of mean areal rainfall from satellite Visible and InfraRed
data with hydrological procedures and models for real-time flow prediction. In
particular our objective is to characterize flow-prediction errors when using
satellite rainfall estimates in the real-time prediction of streamflows from
large catchments. Uncertainty due to rainfall estimation errors is explicitly
taken into account and is propagated through the meteorological and hydrological
models and procedures to become uncertainty in the real-time flow predictions.
This a joint project in which the satellite data analysis will be performed at
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the hydrological part will be
performed at the University of Iowa. The results of this research will benefit
experts, administrators and other users because the developed methods for
integrating rainfall satellite data and hydrologic data will be used in
predicting flows in real-time and thus, the quality of real-time flood
prediction will be enhanced.
