This project involves the development of a new technique for the efficient
extraction of low levels of included gases from geological samples for
subsequent mass-spectrometric analysis. Low-temperature (less than 250 degrees
C.) oxygen plasmas will be used to oxidize samples, releasing gases such as the
noble gases, helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, whose istopic composition
provides important information on the origin and evolution of the minerals
carrying them. The low temperature of extraction will eliminate several sources
of interference in current high- temperature (typically greater than 1600 deg
C.) extraction techniques and may allow selective extraction from different
component minerals, yielding additional important information.
