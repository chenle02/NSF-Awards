This collaborative effort is for the analysis of turbulence, shear and internal
waves data collected on the Equator as part of the 1991 Tropical Instability
Wave Experiment (TIWE). TIWE was designed to study the effects of the 21-days
tropical instability waves on mixing and internal waves. The scientific issues
to be addressed in the analysis include the deep diurnal mixing cycle,
turbulence within the surface mixed layer and below the core of the Equatorial
Undercurrent, the role of upper ocean turbulence in sea surface temperature
modification,and the statistical distribution of dissipation rates.
