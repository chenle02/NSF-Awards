The cochlea is the receptor organ for hearing in mammals. One group of its
mechanosensory cells, the inner hair cells, make unique functional synaptic
contacts with auditory sensory neurons that carry information to the brain.
Unlike many other synaptic sites, in the mammalian cochlea a single active zone
of one inner hair cell usually constitutes the entire synaptic input to the
afferent neurons, unlike the extensive branching common elsewhere. This
exploratory project will develop a novel isolated preparation of the mammalian
cochlea to exploit the unique opportunity to study the physiology of a single
synaptic active zone. Results will be important to our understanding of synaptic
mechanisms, and the isolated preparation will provide an important new approach
with impact on auditory neuroscience.
