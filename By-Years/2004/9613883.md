Abstract *** Phillips 9613883 This research undertakes ethnographic and
ethnohistorical analyses focusing on issues surrounding land litigation to study
community-level negotiation and resolution within a pluralist legal system.
Little research has heretofore focused on local legal practices of the citizens
in post-colonial states and the role these legal negotiations play in question
of national identity. By studying contemporary and historical land cases, the
investigators explore change in the legal and social definitions of custom over
time. The project explores the differing ways the indigenous population and the
legal system use and define customs. This work evaluates the theory that
evolving definitions of custom are directly related to processes at the state
level in defining national identity. Interviews with local people, judges, and
attorneys involved in land cases in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands in Micronesia, and archival records will provide data to address these
questions. This work contributes to our basic understanding of the development
of legal rules.
