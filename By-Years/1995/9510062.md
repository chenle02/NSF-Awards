9510062 Cole This project will examine stable isotopes in corals collected off
Venezuela to look for evidence of changes in ocean circulation and temperature
which may correlate with rainfall patterns in Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa. If
so, the coral record can be used to extend rainfall records to prehistoric
times, in order to discern cyclic or long-term changes. The project also
implicitly tests assumptions about the role of cross- equatorial heat transport
in controlling tropical Atlantic climate. ***
