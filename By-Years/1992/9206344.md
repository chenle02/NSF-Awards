By thorough examination of the spatial variations in textures, mineralogy and
chemistry in a few recent, well-characterized ash flow sheets, the PIs will be
able to determine the systematics of devitrification and vapor- phase alteration
and to develop a model for these processes that will allow them to predict their
role in element redistribution. These textures are usually too fine-grained to
be adequately characterized by standard optical petrography, therefore
'nanopetrography' studies will be performed using analytical transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) in addition to standard mineralogical methods of
characterization, in order to determine the mechanics and systematics of
devitrification and vapor-phase alteration. These studies should lead to three
seperate publications, providing significant new information on the evolution of
silicic volcanic rocks.
