direct chip attachment station, a liquid solder and epoxy dispensing system, a
programmable furnace for solder reflow experiments, oven, a laser
cutting/ablative tool for circuit boards, and an electroplating station. The
equipment university will provide unlimited access for all the students and the
versatility of the equipment will enable more innovative research approaches to
chip assembly and packaging. ***
