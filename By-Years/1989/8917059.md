This collaborative proposal with Robert D. Shuster aims to study the growth and
evolution of the Middle Proterozoic Granite- Rhyolite Province. This terrane
underlies the south central North American continent and except for three areas
of outcrop, is buried by Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks. Age constrained samples
from outcrops and from cores and cuttings housed at the University of Kansas
will be used to determine their Pb and Nd isotopic compositions and chemical
(major, trace, and REE) compositions. This study will be directed at
constraining potential source areas, processes, and tectonic models for the
formation and evolution of this large area of highly evolved and unique
Proterozoic crust.
