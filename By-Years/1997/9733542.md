9733542 Goetz Cell adhesion is at the center of a variety of physiological and
pathophysiological processes. An understanding of the basic mechanisms of cell
adhesion has led and will continue to lead to novel medical therapies and
technologies. Specific research aims of this career program are to: (1)
systematically study the parameters which govern cell adhesion under flow using
leukocyte adhesion molecule coated microspheres; and (2) generate and
characterize integrin coated microspheres. The research program is to be used to
train engineers and biologists in a better understanding of living systems. In
addition,an undergraduate/graduate level course in the topic of cell adhesion is
to be initiated. ***
