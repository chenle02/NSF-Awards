ABSTRACT CTS-9702653 Themis Matsoukas Penn State The goal of the proposed
research is to develop a radio-frequency low-pressure plasma process for the
deposition of thin polymer films onto the surface of powders suspended in the
plasma. Hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon-based coatings with controlled porosity,
cross-linking and permeability would have a significant impact on a broad range
of technologies based on particle processing as in powder metallurgy and ceramic
processing. With the development of proper coatings, it may be possible to
improve the flow-characteristics of powders, prevent the irreversible
agglomeration between particles, provide protection against harsh environments
and facilitate sintering by reducing the need for binding agents. The advantages
of plasma-deposited polymeric films have been long recognized and have lead to
the development deposition processes on flat substrates. However, film
deposition onto powders has not been attempted, largely due to the difficulty in
exposing powders uniformly to a low-pressure plasma over the time necessary for
deposition. Recently, it has been demonstrated that particles in plasmas may
become electrostatically trapped and remain suspended over extended periods of
time. It is then possible to sustain a fluidized cloud of fine (micron and
submicron) particles in a low-pressure environment and expose their surface to
the reactive environment for any desired length of the time. In parallel with
the experimental part, theoretical and numerical studies of the fundamental
processes in low-pressure plasmas containing particles will be conducted. The
educational plan is focused on the undergraduate program and aims at maximizing
the educational benefits of students in one of the largest chemical engineering
programs in the country. Its goals span three specific levels- bridging the gap
between engineering education and industrial practice; searching for new
paradigms in teaching beyond the conventional models; and developing speci alty
courses from the research experience and interests of the PI.
