This Professional Development Workshop for Underrepresented Doctoral
Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Students is designed to provide information, guidance, and
networking opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;the graduate students participants. The
proposal is also providing opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;discuss the transition of
the doctoral candidates to academe, government or industry.&lt;br/&gt;The
immediate outcome will enhance diversity and improve the effectiveness
of&lt;br/&gt;engineering companies and academic institutions by providing
educated professionals&lt;br/&gt;to the workforce.
