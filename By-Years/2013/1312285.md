Tuskegee University engages 150 students in grades 8-12 in three-week summer
workshops featuring STEM content, web-design, the multi-disciplinary area of
human-computer interaction, and career study seminars/webinars. Students design
a website incorporating STEM content, and then use a technology called eye-
tracker to test the effectiveness of their communication. The project design
combines three aspects of best practices in learning and extends them to a
technology-based pedagogy: writing-to-learn, learning-to-write, and project-
based learning. Teams of students will use project-based learning and will learn
how to design a web-page (layout, incorporating content) as the learn-to-write
component and then incorporate appropriate STEM content as the writing-to-learn
mechanism to learn STEM concepts. The project will primarily target students
from groups traditionally under-represented in STEM careers. Workshops will be
held at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) sites: Tuskegee
University and Alabama State University. The program will be aligned with the
Alabama Course of Study which is currently based on the Common Core.
