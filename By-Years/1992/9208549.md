This proposal examines inelastic deformation in metals and associated effects of
fatigue and creep on structure evolution, which, in turn, influences the
deformation process. The program consists of three related studies: (1)
reloading tests to assess the evolution of structure as represented by the
mechanical threshold and athermal stress parameters; (2) strain rate change
tests to study the kinetics of constant structure deformation during fatigue;
and (3) stress change tests designed to discriminate between different
theoretical treatments of creep in dispersion-strengthened alloys.
Mechanistically-based models are developed to provide quantitative descriptions
of deformation. %%% The primary goal of this research is to gain understanding
of inelastic deformation processes in order to extend the operating environments
of existing structural materials, to develop new materials with improved
properties, and to gain better control of forming and manufacturing operations.
