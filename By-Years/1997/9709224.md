*** 9709224 KOPPER This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the junior faculty in the Department of
Chemistry at Hendrix College acquire a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-data
system. This equipment will enhance research which is focused on the development
of transition metal-assisted organic transformations in high-temperature and
high-pressure water (pressurized aqueous reactions above 100 C). Mass
spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends
the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any
other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high
resolution provides the latest technique available in mass spectrometry. It
affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the
characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass
spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
fields of chemistry. ***
