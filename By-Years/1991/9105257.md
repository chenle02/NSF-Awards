The basic goal of this proposal is to determine the physiological mechanisms
that cause individuals of the cricket Gryllus rubens to produce either a high or
low amount of the key enzyme juvenile hormone esterase. High enzyme
concentration causes individuals to develop into a long-winged, dispersing form
while low enzyme concentration causes the development of short-winged,
flightless adults. This research will clarify the mechanisms by which hormones
regulate important developmental processes in insects. Since amount of juvenile
hormone esterase produced is genetically determined, this study will be
especially important in identifying genetic aspects of the hormonal regulation
of development. In addition, these high and low-enzyme genotypes of G. rubens
are found naturally in the field. Thus, this study will also identify how
evolution is altering development to produce a new phenotype (short-winged, non-
flying form in this case). This is currently one of the most important but
poorly understood aspects of evolution. Last, by providing information on the
regulation of development, this study will provide important background
information for applied studies that attempt to disrupt development to control
insect populations. //
