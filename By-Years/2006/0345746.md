Optical flow motion processing is fundamental to everyday life. In order to
obtain important environmental information to the viewer that will allow her/him
to react appropriately, the visual system needs to extract and differentiate
different patterns of optical flow motion signals from the environment. For
example, systematic transformation of moving objects is one of the most powerful
sources for reconstructing the 3-dimensional surfaces of the objects. With
support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Takeo Watanabe's research aims
at understanding how different types of motion signals are related to each other
in the brain from a global framework of motion processing. The research will be
conducted using psychophysics and fMRI in which Dr. Watanabe will systematically
measure brain activity with different types of motion and can learn how they are
related to each other. Broader impacts of the project include educational and
medical advances, improved navigational skills of drivers and pilots, and
enhanced artificial intelligence/robotics. Educational benefits will include the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in use of the methodology and
technology. The research also has the potential to be directly applied to
clinical research in neurosurgery by contributing to scientific knowledge
leading to development of medical tools for improved diagnosis and treatment of
brain disorders or lesions. The research can also provide important knowledge to
enhance the navigation skills of drivers and pilots. Finally, construction of
robots with the artificial intellectual power to effectively detect and utilize
motion information would be of benefit to both the civilian/medical and military
fields.
