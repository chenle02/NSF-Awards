This proposal requests funds to augment the existing Hybridoma Facility and to
create a new Transgenic Mouse Facility. The Hybridoma Facility will contain
equipment and supplies as well as provide the technical assistance for the
production of monoclonal antibodies required for biological research. Major
projects include: studies of the structure of ribosomes, RNA polymerase sigma
factors, Botulism toxin, estrogen receptors, and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
particles. The Transgenic Mouse Facility will perform as a service and provide
expertise in the production and genetic analysis of transgenic mice. The
principal objectives of the facility are to produce mouse models for the study
of human genetic disorders and to study the genetic control of physiological
processes or transgenic mouse models for the study of genes that are important
in altering the efficiency or product composition of food-producing animals.
Support is recommended.
