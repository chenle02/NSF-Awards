The objective of this Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to
initiate the development of new methods to analyze and solve engineering
problems using computer mathematical systems such as MATHEMATICA for the
computer extension and analysis of perturbation series. These methods will be
applied to problems in fluid-structural interaction. On of the main problems to
be tested will be the motion of red blood cells which is a well known but
difficult to solve free boundaries are encountered, e.g. phase transition during
crystal growth and convection induced mass transport.
