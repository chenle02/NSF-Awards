9421393 Puzdrowski All vertebrate animals possess a reflex response system that
allows them to stabilize the eyes as the head is moved -- referred to as the
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The brain circuits which control the reflex are
similar throughout vertebrates with the exception that they are somewhat
different in certain fishes (the "elasmobranchs"). With this award Dr. Rick
Puzdrowski will conduct experiments to determine if the form of the elasmobranch
VOR circuit is a unique specialization of that group, or instead is a
fundamental circuit plan from which the circuits of all other vertebrates may
have evolved. This will be accomplished by examining details of the anatomy and
physiology of the VOR circuits in fish related to the elsamobranchs. The
information provided by this research will give us important insights into how
the fundamental operations of our brains were built-up during the course of
evolution. ***
