The object-oriented paradigm has the potential to revolutionize the construction
of software. The goal of this research is to develop, formalize and provide
tools for abstractions which are useful for working with groups of classes.
Abstractions which have already been formalized and whose value has already been
proven include modules (sometimes called clusters), class dictionary graphs,
class dictionaries, etc. This project is to investigate at least two additional
abstractions which have considerable potential: Propagation Patterns and
Contracts. Mathematical models for object-oriented software engineering will be
developed along with the necessary algorithms and tools. The research involves
both general principles, which are applicable to any object oriented programming
effort, and implementation in the Demeter system, which allows the evaluation of
tools and their interaction with other sophisticated methods.
