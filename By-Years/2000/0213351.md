The University of Alaska has a collection of oral history recordings, made over
several decades, of Native&lt;br/&gt;American (Inuit and Athabaskan)
individuals. Although prototypes of Web access to such collections
exist,&lt;br/&gt;research is needed to explore the opinions and preferences of
the native communities to the wider distribution of these materials. This
project will explore how they would like to see the Web used to benefit them,
what use they can make of online access to the materials, and what kinds of
improvements in interfaces and in policy would best suit the communities. The
project involves both design of computer systems and travel and interviewing the
communities. It will result in knowledge that may help ameliorate the "digital
divide" between the majority US society and the generally poorer Native American
communities, as well as presenting challenges to computer science research to
learn how to build systems that support the policies needed by these
communities.
