9320258 George This is a pilot study to develop an on-line issue oriented
bibliographic database on ethics, technology and the environment. The pilot
phase will allow the investigators to (1) test the hypothetical database form on
at least three software products and test the utility of formal options by
discussing them with potential users; (2) interview potential users (news
reporters, scholars, scientists, and secondary and university educators) to
determine what questions they will want answered and to establish criteria for
inclusion of material in database; (3) identify issue areas and broaden database
coverage to give capacity for including all or almost all Northwest
environmental issues; and (4) identify, for software tests, a small number of
summary review publications on particular environmental issues from many
different disciplines; begin development of thesaurus and index of ordinary
language and technical terms from these. The goal is to develop a user friendly
database for people who want to make sound social judgments about environmental
issues in the Northwest. The database should be useful to humanities teachers
and scholars, students and teachers and the media, by giving them access to not
only what other commentators are saying but also to reviews and other summaries
about scientific aspects of these issues. It will be useful to scientists as
well as others making social comment on science by giving them better access to
ethical perspectives and ethical scholarship. As information comes increasingly
over computerized networks, the development of user-friendly sources and
resources must have high priority. This pilot provides a test of ways to develop
these sources, as well as a test of a unique resources for U.S. citizens and
scholars interested in important issues of science and environmental policy. ***
