The Hecke algebra and its generalizations are central objects in modern
representation theory. They naturally appear in number theory, representation
theory, algebraic geometry, and even low-dimensional topology. A
categorification of the Hecke algebra was used to define a new topological
invariant of knots and links, known as HOMFLY-PT homology. However, it is
extremely difficult to compute this invariant from the definition. The project
is focused on understanding the algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial
structure of link homology and categorified Hecke algebras, with the goal of
unifying, deepening, and clarifying connections between these
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent progress strongly indicates a connection
between the HOMFLY-PT homology and algebraic geometry of the Hilbert scheme of
points on the plane, a central object in modern algebraic geometry and geometric
representation theory. In this collaborative project, the investigators plan to
compare and unify different approaches to the study of this connection and to
develop the fundamental understanding of the relation between the category of
Soergel bimodules and the Hilbert scheme. They also plan to provide an algebro-
geometric construction of HOMFLY-PT homology and to understand its relation to
the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
