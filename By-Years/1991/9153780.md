The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) project will engage educators and
scientists in a concerted and sustained effort to improve the teaching of
science in the nation's elementary schools and increase the access of all
students to effective elementary science instruction. The National Elementary
Science Leadership Initiative (NESLI) will: (1) develop a talent pool of
educators and scientists who can lead reform efforts in their communities; (2)
provide technical assistance to school districts throughout the country that are
working to improve their elementary science teaching resources; and (4)
stimulate policy and program changes in school districts that will lead to the
introduction of high- quality hands-on elementary science programs in school
districts across the nation. The key to the attainment of these goals is the
development of informed leadership and the identification of national resources
that can be made available to respond to local needs. The NESLI project plan is
based on research findings concerning the content and organization of effective
elementary school science instruction; theories of organizational change; an
understanding of the context in which organizational change must occur in the
schools; and five years of NSRC experience working with hundreds of teachers,
scientists, science educators, and school system administrators to bring about
reforms in elementary school science education. The cost sharing for the project
will be sixty-four percent of the NSF portion.
