In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Clouthier will develop sensitive spectroscopic methods for detecting
and characterizing reactive intermediates important in semiconductor processing.
The approach will use free-jet expansions of intermediates generated by
pyrolysis, discharge, or chemical reaction whose spectra will be examined using
laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
(REMPI). Among the intermediates studied will be germanium and silicon analogues
of halocarbenes, aluminum- and gallium-containing metal organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) intermediates, and sulfur-halide radicals. Chemical vapor
deposition and plasma processing are two techniques used for manufacturing
electronic devices in the semiconductor industry. The spectroscopic information
from this work will aid in the understanding of these processes and point the
way to better and more methods.
