9529433 Lawler Abstract The proposal requests funds to partially support the
1996 Seminar on Stochastic Processes to be held at the University of Florida
March 14-16, 1996. This will be the sixteenth in a series of annual conferences,
begun in 1981, giving eminent researchers, young specialists and graduate
students the opportunity to work together to discuss the most recent advances in
stochastic analysis, potential theory and Markov processes. There will be five
formal one-hour lectures and about nine hours of shorter and more informal
presentations. At the informal sessions, seminar participants volunteer to give
short presentations of their current research. For young researchers, this is an
invaluable opportunity to showcase their work, as well as to learn from the
senior members of the audience.
