In addition to its important role as a source of energy for photosynthesis,
light plays an extremely important role in the regulation of plant development.
While much is known about the phytochrome system, responsive to wavelengths at
the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum, little is known about
photoreceptors or their signal transduction chains at the blue end. The
investigator proposes to continue investigating a blue light mediated
phosphorylation of a plasma membrane protein that is hypothesized to be involved
in phototropism and perhaps other blue light responses. They plan to purify and
characterize the protein and other proteins which may interact with it in
photoreception and early signal transduction. Studies of the system at the gene
level will be initiated by cloning and sequencing the genes encoding for these
proteins. Elucidation of this system at the cell, biochemical and molecular
levels should be a major step forward in our understanding of how light
regulates plant development.
