This project is developing a Personalized Content Delivery System (PCDS) to
promote and showcase NSDL materials and services, while at the same time
collecting and disseminating information about the best new online SMET
resources from outside the NSDL. Project objectives include: i) development of a
set of "current awareness" services that deliver information about high quality,
online SMET resources (from both NSDL projects and outside sources) to NSDL
users in a fashion that best suits their needs; ii) extension and improvement of
access to NSDL collections and services; iii) collaboration in the development
of shared metadata across multiple disciplines; and iv) contribution to the
overall digital library knowledge base by actively working with standard-setting
bodies and organizations.
