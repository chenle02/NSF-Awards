9520109 Georgakakos The California flash floods of winter 1995 will be studied
by surveying the affected areas, collecting flood data from Federal and State
agencies and by using historical, topographical, hydrometeorological and other
database information to develop flash flood potential maps for critical areas in
the state of California. Data of this event will be used to validate the
estimates and, if necessary, to modify the design of the flash flood potential
algorithm. Once validated, the mathematical model will be used in a series of
sensitivity experiments to provide, quantitative answers to questions such as
the effect of land use changes on the magnitude and recurrence interval of the
flash flood potential index and the role of antecedent soil moisture of
mountainou terrain. The resultant prototype flash flood potential maps will be
of value in activities such as in the design of the safety criteria of small
dams, in the assessment of the flash flood risk, and in early warning when
combined with radar rainfall data. ***
