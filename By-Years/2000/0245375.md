This proposal is to plan for a new partner to join an existing mutli-university
I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and
universities on supply chain management. This existing multi-university center
will be able to have an even broader impact on the industry through having its
existing resources enhanced by the addition of this partner and the other two
partners that are also being recommended to receive a planning grant. Three
partners, of which this is one are the University of Florida, Lehigh University
and the University of Minnesota.

The proposed Center's goal is to focus on tackling the sophisticated challenges
and interdependencies of logistic and distribution, simplifying and advancing
communications systems by identifying new circuits and new circuit-design
techniques as well as new methods in systems design and information technology.

The new partners will bring to the existing center, a focus on: - Demonstrating
the value of operations research in business operations - Enabling industry
partners to harness available technologies, and - Creating new practice-based
research and education models for engineering curricula.

The proposal deals with an area of significant need and by assembling these
three additional institutions into an already strong team, their added breadth
and depth enhances the prospects for success. The existing institutions in this
Center, together with the three new ones will be a national resource on this
topic.
