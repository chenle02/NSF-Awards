The objective of this project is to design algorithms that allow teams of simple
mobile robots to complete a wide range of tasks reliably. The key insight is
that effective planning is possible for such teams, even in spite of significant
uncertainty stemming from both sensing and motion. This approach builds upon
existing work on minimalism for single robots, but must also overcome
substantial complications that arise from coordination and communication between
the robots. A distinguishing feature of this work is that the problems are
complex and nontrivial at multiple scales: Planning for the multi-robot teams
cannot be fully decoupled from the planning and control issues for individual
robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines three related research
endeavors. First, it investigates techniques for representing each robot's
uncertainty about its own state, and about the state and knowledge of the other
robots. Second, it develops energy-efficient and robust strategies for
communication between robots. Third, it applies these techniques in specialized
planning algorithms to allow robot teams to complete their tasks in a
decentralized manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a
collection of new algorithms that will allow teams of simple robots to manage
uncertainty, communication, and planning in order to complete broad classes of
tasks. These algorithms will enable simpler, more autonomous teams of robots to
be deployed with less expense. Such robots will have significant positive impact
on many sectors of our society, including transportation, space exploration, and
agriculture. Broader impact will include development and distribution of
"covertly educational" game software for middle school students, and training of
undergraduate and graduate student researchers.
