The objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility
of alloying an alumina matrix coupled with utilizing titanium diboride whiskers
with or without SiC whiskers to produce a composite cutting tool that is
optimized in regard to thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, hardness,
strength, coefficient of friction, and chemical inertness. The purpose is to
produce an optimized ceramic composite cutting tool insert that will permit
increased speed and metal removal rate to effect a significant increased
machining productivity at an overall reduced cost. A statistical experimental
program will be employed to optimize the ceramic composite cutting tool insert.
Application is expected to be on machining of nickel alloys, cast iron, and
other metal alloys. If this work is successful, a Phase II proposal will be
submitted.
