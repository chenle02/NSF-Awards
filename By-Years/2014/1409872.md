Smartphones and tablets with rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are becoming
increasingly popular. Hundreds of thousands of specialized applications, called
apps, are already available for these mobile platforms, and the number of newly
released apps continues to increase. The complexity of these apps lies often in
the user interface, with data processing either minor, or delegated to a backend
component. A similar situation exists in applications using the software-as-a-
service architecture, where the client-side component consists mostly of user
interface code. Testing such applications predominantly involves GUI testing.
Existing automatic techniques for testing these interfaces either require a
priori models of the interface and are thus hard to use, or operate blindly by
sending random user events to the application and are typically unable to test
the application in satisfactory depth.

This project investigates automatic GUI testing techniques that systematically
explore the state space of an application without requiring an a priori defined
model. One insight behind this project is that the automatic construction of a
model of the user interface and the testing of the interface are tasks that can
cooperate in a mutually beneficial way. Furthermore, a guiding principle
throughout this research is to design algorithms that operate with abstractions
and heuristics that are simple enough to be understood by humans who do not
necessarily understand the internals of the tested app. Such algorithms are
easier to comprehend and to incorporate into a wholistic test process that
includes automated techniques, such as the ones developed in this project, and
manual testing and guidance. The techniques developed in this project benefit
directly programmers for these apps, and indirectly the numerous users of mobile
and web applications.
