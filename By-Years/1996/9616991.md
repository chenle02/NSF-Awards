9616991 Cole, Ronald Whitney, Gail Oregon Graduate Institute of Science &
Technology Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: Conceptualization of
a Flagship Center for Collaborative Research in Learning and Human Language
Technologies The Oregon Graduate Institute has been awarded funding in the
amount of $50,000 for a period of 06 months to plan a NSF Flagship Center for
Collaborative Research on Learning and Human Language Technologies. The mission
of the proposed Center is to support basic research on the use of human language
technology to create better tools and strategies for learning. Areas of research
and tool development will include using speech as an input modality in computer
assisted learning; speech training for second language learning or articulation
training; speech as a primary input modality for physically challenged
individuals; and speech as a context for learning about other things.
