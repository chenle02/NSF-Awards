The objective of this endeavor is to develop a methodology for the design of
three dimensional shapes subject to general geometric and mechanical behavior
requirements. Starting from an initial shape, a geometric reasoning kernel is
used to generate and control a sequence of numerical optimization subproblems
that converges to a final design (a topology and associated geometry) that can
be significantly different from the starting shape. The geometric representation
of the shape is adaptive and changes throughout the problem solving process to
accommodate the shape change trends that occur. The combination of geometric
reasoning and numerical optimization techniques is expected to provide a robust
and systematic methodology for shape synthesis that can generate new design
shapes without relying on heuristic or domain specific knowledge.
