9501044 Morrison The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Jane E. Morrison to work with Dr. Siegfried
Roeser at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut in Heidelberg, Germany. The
Astronomisches Rechen-Institut is beginning a project to produce a catalogue of
positions and proper motions of one million stars, called the Tycho Reference
Catalogue (TRC), by combining two international catalogues: the Astrographic
Catalogue (AC) and the Tycho Catalogue. It will be an extension of the Hipparcos
system to higher star densities and fainter magnitudes. The catalogue will be
produced as a collaboration between scientists in Germany, Denmark, Sweden,
Russian and, by way of this postdoctoral fellow's participation, the United
States. An additional by-product proper motion catalogue, less precise than the
TRC, but containing roughly 4 million stars will be compiled using the
Astrographic Catalogue and the Guide Star Catalogue. The TRC will have
widespread applications to many fields of astronomy, such as, studies of
galactic structure, binary stars, stellar clusters, and secular parallaxes. ***
