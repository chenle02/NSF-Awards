The Chemistry Department at Morris Brown College has upgraded the Polymer
Chemistry Laboratory course with new experiments and modern state-of-the-art
scientific instrumentation. The primary instrument is a Differential Scanning
Calorimeter (DSC). The DSC is used in determining glass transition temperatures,
melting and decomposition temperatures. In addition, physical studies such as
the degree of crystallinity, compatibility, cure kinetics, and phase changes are
studied using the DSC in conjunction with the TGA available at the Atlanta
University. This upgrading better prepares students for the challenging
workplace. The institution is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
