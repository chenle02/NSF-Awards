Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop
a fundamental understanding of the properties of electro-mechanical waves that
propagate as frequency and voltage disturbances over the electrical grid. These
waves reveal much about the short-term dynamics and stability of the electrical
grid and will become increasingly important in the future as time-intermittent
renewable generation resources are incorporated into the grid. The approach is
to leverage the new, wide-area, high-resolution phasor measurement unit
monitoring and apply methods and approaches from the fields of nonlinear
systems, applied mathematics, statistical physics, and signal analysis to study
the dynamics of voltage, power flow, and frequency disturbances on large-scale
transmission grids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Studying electro-
mechanical wave phenomena in large power systems is a promising new approach
that draws on numerous disciplines and will rapidly advance the frontiers of the
physics-based understanding and data-driven inference of electrical grid states
and fast dynamics. This new understanding will enable the design of smart grid
controls to prevent economically-costly cascading grid failures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: New time-intermittent renewable resources
create a need for effective ways of discovering how an event in one location is
manifested in the rest of the grid. Electro-mechanical waves provide one such
relationship and will be key to early detection of problematic grid behavior and
design and activation of advanced control systems to restore reliable operation.
Our project will develop a better fundamental understanding of electrical grid
behavior, which will ultimately translate into improved operation, better
control, and lowered cost.
