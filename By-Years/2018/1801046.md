NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports the 2018 Conference on Highly Frustrated Magnetism to be
held at the University of California at Davis. The award is jointly funded by
the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory and the Condensed Matter Physics
programs of the Division of Materials Research. The conference will bring
together around 250 leading scientists and students in the field of quantum
magnetism from around the world, to assess the field and new directions. The new
materials and experimental techniques developed in this field are relevant for
future quantum technologies, including quantum computers. The conference will
contribute to the training of a new generation of scientists in advanced
instrumentation and computational methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
