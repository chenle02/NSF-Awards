9503420 McDuff This grant provides support funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V THOMPSON, a 274 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and
operated by the University. NSF-funded scientists are the primary users of the
ship. Instrumentation to be purchased includes PC's to replace aging shipboard
models, a color printer, a network upgrade, a mass storage device, a CD-ROM
reader, a fluorometer, and spare IMET sensors. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the THOMPSON during 1995 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
