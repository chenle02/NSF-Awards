This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will support Old
Dominion University with the acquisition of an ultrahigh vacuum scanning
tunneling microscope (STM). The STM will provide single atom resolution and
allow for laser-surface interaction. A load-lock will allow the transfer of
samples from a growth chamber to the STM. Multi-disciplinary reseach to be
performed with this STM include: (a) electronic-induced surface structural
modification; (b) ultrafast surface phase transitions; (c) surface etching by
atomic hydrogen; (d) growth of thin films, nanocrystals and quantum dots by
femtosecond pulsed laser depostion; (e) studies of organic electroactive
polymers for electronic and/or photonic devices; (f) structural-dependent
nanoparticle optics; (g) morphology studies for synthesis of carbon nanotubes;
and (h) surface modifications with microwave discharges. Graduate and
undergraduate students will perform research with the STM and gain training in
thin film growth, surface and nanocrystal characterization, and ultrahigh vacuum
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award
supports Old Dominion University with the acquisition of an ultrahigh vacuum
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with single atom resolution. This STM will
be used to study electronic and optical materials, thin films, and
nanoparticles. Graduate and undergraduate students will be using the STM to
perform their research and gain training in thin film growth, surface
modification, surface and nanocrystal characterization, and ultrahigh vacuum
technology. The use of this STM will enhance the interdisciplinary (e.g.
chemistry, electrical engineering, material science, and physics) educational
environment for our students and will be integrated in graduate and
undergraduate courses presently offered in engineering and sciences. This
instrument will be used to highlight to the students the importance of relating
atomic scale materials characteristics to macroscopic properties, and how
surface properties affect electronic materials, polymers, and nanotechnology.
