This project seeks to improve undergraduate studies of vertebrate physiology by
adding automated equipment for monitoring respiratory function. The Jaeger Ergo-
Oxyscreen System and Pneumoscope acquired through this grant will make it
possible for Oberlin College's Biology faculty to develop new laboratory
experiments in human respiration. (Experimental studies of the human body have
proved to be particularly effective in stimulating learning). The new
experiments enable undergraduate students to make detailed analyses of pulmonary
function and energetics in the human body as functions of work load, body
aerobic training, and environmental conditions, analyzing such parameters as
respiratory air flow, respiratory oxygen, CO2 concentrations, and heart rate.
