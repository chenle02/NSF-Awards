Cadherins are cell adhesion receptors that play a central role in the normal
development and maintenance of solid tissues and during cancer progression and
metastasis. Despite extensive research in the field, many questions pertaining
to cadherin function and regulation remain unanswered. The lateral interactions
between cadherins are likely important for biological function, but they have
not been characterized in detail and their biological implications are unclear.
Ecadherin 1 lateral interactions will be characterized and will establish the
correlation between Ecadherin 1 association thermodynamics and its adhesion
parameters. To accomplish this goal, novel FRET-based methods will be used that
yield the energetics of membrane protein interactions with high experimental
precision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide the broad scientific
community with better methods to study membrane protein folding, structure, and
function. Ultimately, improvement in methods will lead to discoveries that
elucidate the role of membrane protein interactions in cell life. This work will
also advance the basic knowledge about the physical processes that regulate cell
adhesion. The project will support the funding of graduate students and will
enhance the educational experience of undergraduate students conducting research
at Johns Hopkins University. In addition, it will support broad outreach
activities benefiting young scientists by providing travel fellowships for the
2012 FASEB meeting "Molecular Biophysics of Membranes".
