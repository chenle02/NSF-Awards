This workshop proposal describes a workshop focused on addressing the issues
surrounding software to support the emerging Cyberinfrastructure (CI) in the NSF
paradigm. A select set of experts in the field will be convened to evaluate and
discuss how CI-supporting software should be developed, deployed, maintained,
and supported; what programs NSF should apply, and how, to accomplish these
tasks; and required coordination with other federal agencies and industry.
Results will be captured in a report to NSF.
