The Middle School Mathematics through Applications Project is designed to create
a community of math teachers, educators, and math-using professionals to work
together in ongoing seminars and summer institutes to design, develop and test
math materials and activities based on real, everyday science and engineering
problems. The most advanced computer simulation technology will be used in the
materials. New assessment practices will be established. The project has four
major foci: i. the creation of a new community of mathematics practices, ii. the
creation of new learning materials and collaborative activity structures iii.
the gradual design of new teaching and assessment practices, and iv. the
development of cognitive and ethnographic research in teaching and learning
practices. This project will concentrate on middle school mathematics. It is a
joint effort of the Institute for Research in Learning, the Stamford University
College of Education, and Sandia Laboratories.
