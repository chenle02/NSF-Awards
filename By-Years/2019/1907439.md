This award provides support for the 2019 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics
Symposium that will take place at Rice University in Houston, Texas during the
period October 25-27, 2019. The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics
Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice
University, the University of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other
institutions in the region. It is intended for the participation of around 60
people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together
many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not
otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the
year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally
recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions (including a poster
session) for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from
regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate
students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other
departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove
to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and
financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and
members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for
regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to
become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in
addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject.

This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where ergodic theory and dynamical
systems, partial differential equations, and probability theory intersect and
interact. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts,
registration information, and an archive of the past Symposia can be found on
the website of the meeting:
