This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project features as the
main&lt;br/&gt;goal, the development of a simulator of nanoscale electronic
devices, and circuits.&lt;br/&gt;Emphasis will be placed on devices and circuits
that are based on carbon nanotubes, or&lt;br/&gt;tunneling in lithographically
defined junctions. The simulator will be based partly on&lt;br/&gt;the extensive
collection of theoretical and numerical techniques that have been developed by
the firm to describe charge transport in single electron devices. A diagrammatic
technique and non-interacting Green's functions were used to obtain the
tunneling rates in such junctions. Those techniques will be extended to describe
the nanotubes. A graphical user interface will be developed, as well as a module
that provides movies of the dynamics of charge flow. A package that enables the
visualization of charge transport in these ultrasmall devices is expected to be
a stimulating teaching and learning tool. with the standard SPICE
package.&lt;br/&gt; Powerful simulation tools are essential for the evaluation
and development of&lt;br/&gt;nanoelectronic devices and systems. The primary
customers of the proposed nanosystems&lt;br/&gt;simulator is expected to be chip
manufacturers, manufacturers of high sensitivity electrical measuring
instruments and academic researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
