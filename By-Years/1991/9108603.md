Dr. William Eschmeyer is the Curator in charge of the fish collection at the
California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Dr. Eschmeyer has embarked on
an ambitious project to prepare and disseminate of two large data resources for
the world's fish species: 1) a computer database of 50,000+ records
corresponding to the species of living fish and their 20,000 bibliographic
references, and 2) a published catalog of the species and their original
descriptions in the published literature. These species- level references will
extend the results of Dr. Eschmeyer's recently completed catalog of fish genera.
The proposed information resources would be used by the entire spectrum of
biologists working with fishes, ranging from evolutionary systematists to
fisheries managers. The published catalog of species and its corresponding
computer database will have wide impact on an array of research disciplines.
