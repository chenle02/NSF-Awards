Nontechnical description of the project:&lt;br/&gt;Plastids are specialized
plant cellular organelles that are responsible for the process of photosynthesis
that converts sun light into chemical energy. This is one of the most essential
processes for sustaining life on earth. The 2015 Gordon Research Conference on
Chloroplast Biotechnology will present cutting-edge fundamental and potentially
applied research by an international group of scientists interested in
experimental approaches to probe Chloroplast structure and function. In
addition, the workshop will address how engineering and biotechnology approaches
can improve the output capacity of photosynthesis. The Broader Impacts of this
conference will expose students and postdocs to cutting edge interdisciplinary
research, and will expand their horizon on what is novel and important in this
field. It will influence how early career scientists will structure their
continued education and professional development to be marketable in the "New
Biology" arena. The enabling technologies and scientific advances presented at
this conference are likely to lead to significant advances for addressing
important societal needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Generally
recognized benefits of plastid engineering are: the potential for high-level
protein expression from plastid transgenes; the expression of multiple genes in
operons; and transgene containment in crops in which only the maternal parent
inherits plastids, thereby preventing transgene flow via pollen. Applications of
plastid transformation will be discussed in four general areas: (1) expression
of recombinant proteins for industrial and pharmaceutical applications; (2)
engineering the plastid genome to improve photosynthetic efficiency and plant
productivity; (3) engineering novel metabolic pathways into chloroplasts; (4)
engineering novel agronomic traits into chloroplasts for gene stacking and
transgene containment.
