This collaborative project is being implemented at the University of Iowa,
University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, and Brigham Young University. Renewed
calculus materials developed through the NSF supported project at the University
of Iowa will be revised, tested, and refined at these three institutions. The
University of Iowa and the University of Wisconsin- La Crosse are planning
toward full implementation. The project involves extensive training of faculty
and teaching assistants to use these materials and approaches. In addition to
learning traditional calculus skills, students are exposed to new ideas through
large open ended projects on a variety of scientific and mathematical projects.
