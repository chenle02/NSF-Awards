The LIGO Laboratory proposes the continued operation and development of the LIGO
scientific program. The construction of LIGO by Caltech and MIT, under
Cooperative Agreement No. PHY-9210038, has been completed within budget and on
the schedule defined in the rebaselining process in 1994. The LIGO facilities
are in full operation in support of the interferometer commissioning. At the end
of FY 2001, LIGO will be operating the three LIGO interferometers at the two
LIGO observatory sites in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA. During the period of
this proposal, LIGO will carry out the first LIGO Science Run. This will include
operation of the three LIGO interferometers in a stable and sensitive scientific
configuration, at the design dimensionless strain sensitivity (h ~ 10-21), for a
minimum of an integrated year of coincidence running. This data run will take
place during the period 2002 through 2004. During that period, operation of the
interferometers will be interleaved with interferometer R&amp;D and
improvements. These periods of interferometer studies will improve the detector
sensitivity and availability for stable, scientific running. The science goals
of this run are to conduct the first broad search for astrophysical sources of
gravitational waves with sensitivity never before attained. LIGO has fostered
the development of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, consisting of researchers
from the LIGO Laboratory and from external institutions in the U.S. and abroad.
The creation of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration has enabled broad
participation in LIGO. During the period of this proposal, the LIGO Scientific
Collaborations will guide the gravitational wave research and the definition of
the R&amp;D toward technology improvements. LIGO will build upon its program of
education at each of the four LIGO Laboratory Sites, extending the scientific
excitement of LIGO to young people from elementary to graduate levels. Community
outreach activities will be extended to include new demonstration and
interpretive programs. LIGO collaboration with industry will address new
technologies and applications stimulated by the requirements of gravitational
wave observation.
