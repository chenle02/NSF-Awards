Protecting groups are a vital tool in the synthesis of multifunctional molecules
such as valuable third generation pharmaceuticals. When a reaction must be
carried out at a specific reaction site, protecting groups are often used to
temporarily block other sensitive reaction sites on the molecule. Substituted
benzyl alcohols are particularly useful as protecting groups. They are prepared
by reacting electrophiles with a simple derivative of benzyl alcohol, benzyl
alcohol ester. Although this reaction proceeds in excellent yield, it results in
a mixture of isomers with similar physical properties. Separation of the isomers
is expensive and technically difficult. This project is focused on the continued
investigation of a novel membrane-based process to address the above problem.
The process couples a selective catalyzed reaction with membrane-based
separation. Each reaction product is a commercially important protecting group
in pharmaceutical synthesis.
