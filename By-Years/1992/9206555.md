Cell-cell interactions play an important role in defining the fates of
individual cells as they begin to differentiate. While much has been learned
about the cell surface proteins that are necessary for these interactions,
relatively little is known about cytoplasmic components of this process. The
overall goal of this research is to identify and functionally characterize
Drosophila cytoplasmic proteins that are important for developmentally crucial
signals. Specifically, these experiments will examine the functions of the
Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate cytoskeletal protein 4.1 (D4.1). The goals
of this proposal are therefore to: 1) Examine the cellular and developmental
effects of D4.1 mutations, 2) Characterize the major D4.1 alternative splice
forms and determine the genomic organization of the gene that encodes them, and
3) Learn the precise expression patterns of the major D4.1 protein isoforms at
the cellular and subcellular levels, and determine the cellular and
developmental effects of ectopic D4.1 expression. These experiments are expected
to provide insights into the function of both the Drosophila and the human 4.1
genes. Therefore these studies should contribute significantly to work on the
role of cellular interactions in regulating cell growth and determining cell
fate during development.
