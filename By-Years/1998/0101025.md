0101025&lt;br/&gt;Knox&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of California at San
Diego will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the
Oceanographic Data Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as
specific instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the
institution, R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul. All four of these
research vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
instrumentation to be acquired includes new meteorological sensors for underway
data acquisition, new transmissometers, thermometers and altimeters for use with
CTD systems, new servers for shipboard computer networks, a replacement GPS
system for attitude and speed data acquisition, and a grab sampler and deep
ocean pinger. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
scientists conduct studies worldwide on SIO and other research vessels during
2001 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
