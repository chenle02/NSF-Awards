Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research projects on the
Juneau Icefield, Alaska. For 40 years, research, emphasizing geology,
glaciology, geophysics, glaciometeorology, geobotany and surveying, has been
conducted on this icefield. With cooperation between the University of Idaho's
Glaciological and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute and the Foundation for
Glacier and Environmental Research, this research/educational activity aims at a
total systems study of one of North America's largest icefields. It is a total
involvement program, representing a seven days a week immersion in on-going and
new research projects. Under supervision of professors of unique experience,
drawn from the University of Idaho and other universities, each undergraduate
will select a research project and be encouraged to exercise as much independent
judgment and initiative as possible in its development. Undergraduates selected
will be earth science students who demonstrate scholarly aptitude, motivation,
and research potential. The staff will be available throughout the season for
advice and help, including lectures, seminars and site specific instructions in
methodologies to insure an effective research experience.
