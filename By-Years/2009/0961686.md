This project will address the mechanisms and pathways of North Atlantic Deep
Water (NADW) export from the South Atlantic to Indian Ocean. Two eddy-resolving
ocean general circulation models will be analyzed to determine the quantity and
characteristics of deep flow eddies in the NADW and the possible roles they may
play in the inter-basin exchange. The project will also address interannual
changes in NADW transport and its relationship to the subtropical front, if any.
The results will be examined in relation to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research bears on the AMOC and
global thermohaline circulation which are crucial links in the global climate
system. Improved understanding of the deep circulation links between the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans should translate to improved certainty in climate
modeling and prediction.
