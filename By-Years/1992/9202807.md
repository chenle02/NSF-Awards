The goal of this project is to investigate the design of parallel algorithms for
geometric problems, both for shared- memory (PRAM) models and the (more
realistic) network models. The network models of interest include the situation
where the number of processors available p is fixed (i.e., does not depend on
the size n of the problem being solved). In such a framework, one needs to bring
into the picture the sequential "front end" to the parallel machine, since the
parallel machine is too small to even store the problem being solved. Thus the
techniques used are both parallel and sequential, since a substantial part of
the computation may take place in the sequential machine. Attention will be
given to problems that are still open within the traditional frameworks (i.e.,
assuming massive rather than limited parallelism), with special emphasis on
problems whose solution would impact the parallel complexity of many geometric
problems (for example, multisearching and matrix searching). The project will
also initiate investigation of parallelism for computational algebraic geometry
and geometric modeling. The research undertaken involves implementations on
commercially available parallel hardware.
