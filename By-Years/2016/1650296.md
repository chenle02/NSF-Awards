This proposal requests funding for a conference to be held in conjunction with
the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) annual meeting to take
place in San Francisco, CA, November 16, 2016. The Conference is entitled "Bay
Area Biotechnology Topical Conference" with the goal to create a unique
environment for companies and small businesses operating at the forefront of
synthetic biology to come together share ideas, network with AIChE affiliates,
and interface with students to educate and recruit the next generation of
scientists and engineers in this area. In addition, this will include a
SBIR/STTR program workshop and networking event to include current SBIR grantees
and prospective small businesses interested in learning more about the SBIR/STTR
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference offers a unique
opportunity for companies to showcase their capabilities to a diverse audience
of chemical engineers from academia and industry while also identifying
potential partnerships. The Workshop on SBIR/STTR grant opportunities will allow
start-up companies dominating the synthetic-biology space to learn about
obtaining seed funding from the NSF. Finally, through the speaker presentations,
students and post-docs in attendance will connect academic exploration of
synthetic biology into commercial ventures and the challenges of creating
business models and identifying appropriate markets.
