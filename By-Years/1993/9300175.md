Undergraduate participation in research concentrated on remote sensing
applications to the understanding of geologic processes on the Earth and
terrestrial planets will allow students in the mid- Atlantic region of the U.s.
to take advantage of the research efforts underway at the National Air and Space
Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Within the Museum's Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies, researchers are using data obtained from a variety of Earth-
looking and planetary spacecraft to study aeolian processes and real-time
changes in desert environments as they relate to the geologic record of climate
change, the roughness of volcanic surfaces measured via radar to determine
physical parameters that are used to constrain hypotheses for the origin of
similar surfaces on Venus, and structural landforms in intraplate regions on
Earth as analogs to extraterrestrial structures. A two-year program of
undergraduate participation is proposed to allow a close association between the
student and mentor, and to broaden students' interests in, and knowledge of
earth science processes.
