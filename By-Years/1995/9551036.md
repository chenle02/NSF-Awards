This project improves the cryogenic facilities of upper- division teaching
laboratories. In these laboratories, students are given the opportunity to work
with research-class instruments that they may encounter in their future careers
in university, industrial, or government research laboratories. Cryogenics, an
important part of the physics curriculum, it is a source of new concepts such as
the macroscopic quantum states encountered in superconductivity and
superfluidity. It is a region where the absence of thermal motion permits the
clear recognition of many physical properties. Furthermore, it has important
applications such as those associated with high-temperature superconductivity,
Josephson junctions, etc. The heart of our new research standard cryogenic
system is a RMC Cryosystems 4He insertable dewar. This is a low-cost all-purpose
cryostat that provides a temperature range from 1.2-300K, and, with a 50 T
superconducting solenoid, it becomes a very versatile piece of equipment. It has
low operating costs and the fast turnaround time that is essential for the
efficient running of a teaching laboratory where the students are present for
limited periods.
