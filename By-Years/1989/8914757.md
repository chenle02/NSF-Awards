Support is requested for purchase of a peptide synthesizer, to serve a group of
investigators in projects of protein structure- function research and molecular
biology. This is a revision of proposal DIR-8820671, submitted from the
Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research (WCLR), the New York State
Department of Health. The proposal requests funds for the purchase of an Applied
Biosystems peptide synthesizer. All three reviewers agreed that the need for the
synthesizer was well justified, and that the major user investigators, as well
as the WCLR would benefit greatly by having an on-site peptide synthesis
facility. The reviewers raised questions in three specific areas and this
revision responds to these questions. The three areas which are addressed in
this revision are 1) the organizational plan of operation, 2) costs of
synthesis, 3) purification of peptides and number of peptides needed.
