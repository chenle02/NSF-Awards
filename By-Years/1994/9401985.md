9401985 Gunton A theoretical and computational investigation of several problems
involving spatial pattern formation in nonlinear dynamical systems will be
undertaken. One group of problems involves driven dissipative systems, far from
eqilibrium, and includes studies of Rayleigh-Benard convection in simple and
binary fluids, as well as a model of directional solidification. One aspect of
this study deals with the transition from order to spatiotemporal chaos. The
second group of problems involves defect formation, surface effects and shear
flow effects. Although the research deals with problems of fundamental
importance to science, several of the projects are also of technological
importance. %%% ***
