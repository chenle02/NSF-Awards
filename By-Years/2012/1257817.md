The sense of hearing remains one of the least understood of the senses, in terms
of the underlying biophysical mechanisms. To be sensitive to extremely faint
sounds, the auditory system must detect movements at a scale comparable to
atomic dimensions. This involves hair cells--specialized cells that detect
mechanical signals from incoming sound waves and convert them into electrical
signals sent to the brain. This research will measure movements of hair cells to
test the hypothesis that coupling between hair cells constitutes an important
factor in achieving this auditory sensitivity and to explore the role of
synchronization in the sensitivity of the whole organ. Internal auditory organs
from the frog and the lizard will be placed in appropriate chemical
environments, and images of their movements will be captured with a high-speed
camera. By observing the motion of multiple hair cells in parallel, it will be
possible to see if they move in unison. Additional measurements will test
whether the coupled system shows a response that does not grow linearly with the
signal. Finally, comparative study between organs of different species, which
show very different geometry, will determine how different amounts of coupling
affect the overall performance. The prediction is that synchronization among
hair bundles will enhance both the sensitivity and tuning in the inner ear. If
true, this will help to explain the nanoscale sensitivity of hearing, one of the
long-open problems in sensory neuroscience. The project will provide educational
opportunities for undergraduate and high school students, by involving them in
highly interdisciplinary science projects.
