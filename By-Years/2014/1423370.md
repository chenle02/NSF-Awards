Modern software systems tend to be distributed, event-driven, and asynchronous,
often requiring components to maintain multiple threads of control for message
and event handling. In addition, there is increasing pressure on software
developers to introduce concurrency into applications in order to take advantage
of multicore and many-core processors to improve performance. Yet concurrent
programming remains difficult and error-prone. The need to train the software
development workforce in concurrent programming has become increasingly urgent
as the CPU frequency growth no longer provides adequate scalability. As a result
of that, a large number of developers in the current software development
workforce continue to find it hard to deal with thorny concurrency issues in
software design and implementation.

The projects designs a new programming language construct called Capsules, an
improved abstraction for concurrency that can hide the details of concurrency
from the programmer and allow them to focus on the program logic. The main goal
of this project is to conduct a formal study of the semantic properties of
capsules, efficiently realize this abstraction in industrial strength tools that
will be globally disseminated, and empirically evaluate performance and software
engineering properties of a programming language design that incorporates this
abstraction. This approach seeks to create software that is correct with respect
to concurrency by construction. Its success will aid and enable more reliable
development of concurrent software. While it makes great sense to develop
explicit concurrency mechanisms, sequential programmers continue to find it hard
to understand task interleavings and non-deterministic semantics. Thus, this
research on the capsule abstraction, if successful, will have a large positive
impact on the productivity of these programmers, on the understandability and
maintainability of source code that they write, and on the scalability and
correctness of software systems that they produce.
