Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting genetic technology,
particularly in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. This project aims to
explore the feasibility of using two site- specific DNA enzyme systems from the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiase to develop genetic methods in Arabidopsis based
on site-specific recombination. The two systems are the FLP recombinase, derived
from the yeast 2-micron plasmid, and the HO recombinase, which promotes yeast
mating type switching. FLP promotes reciprocal recombination between two
asymmetric FRT target sites, resulting in deletion or inversion of the
intervening DNA depending on whether the two sites are in direct or inverted
respectively; HO promotes gap repair by homologous recombination after cutting
at its Y/Z target. Demonstration of either or both activities will allow the
subsequent design of sophisticated schemes for targeted genetic events in
plants. The goals for the present period are to demonstrate FLP and/or HO
activity in plant systems. Available cloned genes encoding each enzyme will be
placed downstream of the available strong constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, and
activity of the transcribed and translated enzymes will be assayed. For FLP,
assays will score deletion or inversion of a reporter GUS (escherichia coli B-
glucuronidase) gene located between pair of direct or inverted FRT sites; for
HO, assays will score recombination between two copies of GUS reporter gene
promoted by gap repair of a Y/Z site in one of them. Assays will be carried out
in both transient (electroporated tobacco and Arabidopsis protoplasts) and
stable (transgenic Arabidopsis plants) configurations. *** //
