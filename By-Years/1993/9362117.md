93621117 Mehra Fabrication of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) requires the use of
sophisticated manufacturing processes. One such process is Hot Isostatic
Pressing (HIP) which is becoming a key technology for consolidating MMC airframe
structural panels for advanced aircraft. The objective of proposed effort is to
develop a hierarchical two level adaptive optimizing controller using,
techniques of Modern Control Theory, System Identification and Neural Networks.
The Level 2 controller minimizes the ultimate cost per unit of production and
the Level 1 controller regulates the HIP process to achieve optimal temperature
and pressure profiles dictated by the Level 2 controller. Phase I research
includes (i) a State-of-The-Art survey (ii) identification of Level 1 process
models from real data (iii) the design of an adaptive Model Predictive
Controller (MPC) (iv) testing of the MPC controller and (v) development of
architecture for Level 2 controller. IBIS Associates, a leader in the field of
materials technology will provide subcontract support. Industrial Materials
Technologies (IMT), the largest HIP consolidator in the world, has indicated
their willingness for supporting the Phase I effort. ***
