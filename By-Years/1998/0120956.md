The PI will address large-scale low-frequency phenomena that dominate tropical
processes and have sources either within the tropics or higher latitudes. The
principal phenomena of interest are the Asian-Australian monsoon and El Nino
Southern Oscillation and their component modes, all of which range in time scale
from intraseasonal to interannual. The PI proposes to focus on the following
four specific research themes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) the monsoon as a coupled
ocean-atmosphere phenomena; &lt;br/&gt;(2) monsoon intraseasonal variability in
a coupled ocean-atmosphere context;&lt;br/&gt;(3) mechanisms by which the
tropics influence the extratropics and vice versa on time scales that range from
synoptic to interannual; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) the variable nature of the long-term
relationships between boundary forcing and climate variability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is important because it will lead to improved
understanding of major climate phenomena, especially the monsoon over a wide
range of time scales.
