This is a Career Advancement Award to provide Dr. Postle with some release time
from teaching, plus supplies and necessary equipment, so that she can try out
some rather high risk experiments to investigate physical interactions between
TonB (a protein of the E. coli membrane which is involved in transport of
vitamin B12 and iron-bearing siderophores) and other E. coli envelope proteins.
This award will give her the opportunity to try out these risky experiments
without compromising her ongoing research program on various aspects of TonB. If
the experiments work, the results would serve to significantly enhance her
visibility and stature in the field, thereby enhancing her career.
