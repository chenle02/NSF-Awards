Most astronomy teachers at two-year and four-year colleges are not full-time
astronomers and many do not hold doctoral degrees. However, these faculty
annually enroll a large number of astronomy students. The purpose of this
project is to enhance the faculty effectiveness of a number of astronomy
instructors at colleges by assisting them to begin their own observational
astronomy research programs. The entry-level type of research can be mastered by
physics-trained faculty members. The data-gathering required for the type of
research can be undertaken by beginning-level undergraduates using the type of
equipment found at small colleges. The project will enrich educational
experiences for a large number of undergraduate students who would not normally
have such an opportunity. Two groups of 15 college astronomy teachers are coming
to the Center for Astrophysics for a week-long workshop. While at the Center for
Astrophysics, teachers will be taught the rudiments of photoelectric photometry,
photoelectric and charged coupled device (CCD) observation of occulations. The
program will give the participants the necessary theory and background knowledge
to allow them to actually do astronomical research and will provide research
opportunities for their students.
