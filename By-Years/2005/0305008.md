0305008&lt;br/&gt;Knox&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of California at San
Diego will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the
Oceanographic Data Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as
specific instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the
institution, R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul. All four of these
research vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
instrumentation to be acquired includes an acoustic current profiler for R/V New
Horizon, a magnetometer, two portable liquid scintillation counters, a freezer
for sample storage, two fluorometers, a rosette system for 30-liter sampling
bottles with the CTD system, and a data acquisition system for seismic
reflection profiling. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
marine scientists conduct studies worldwide on SIO and other research vessels
during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
