This award provides student subsistence for the 2018 Oregon Programming
Languages Summer School (OPLSS). The summer school provides an important and
valuable educational opportunity for students to study foundational topics
related to programming languages, formal methods, and verification. The focus of
this year's school is "Concurrency and Parallelism". The significance and
importance of the summer school include building international community and
cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US
students, including women and underrepresented minorities, by exposure to and
interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based
students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming
languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and
academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
