This is an award to provide support for research on a model system for
investigating the surface chemical factors that govern the transport of colloids
in porous media that function as groundwater aquifers. The award is in accord
with conditions contained in NSF 91-112, Young Investigator Awards FY 1992
Program Guidelines for Submission of Nominations. Factors that control the
transport and deposition of fine particles in porous media are of interest
because of the role they play in controlling the movement of pollutants through
aquifers and other natural systems. Results of this research are expected to be
applied in engineering design of groundwater supply and pollution abatement
systems.
