Proposal ID: DMS-0307616 PI: Robert E Kass Title: VII Symposium of Case Studies
in Bayesian Statistics

Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics VII is the seventh workshop in the series
that was begun in 1991. The workshops are held in odd years at Carnegie Mellon
University in early fall. The seventh workshop is planned for September 12-13,
2003. The goals of the workshop are to (i) emphasize the close interplay of
statistical theory and applications in the context of substantive scientific
research; (ii) promote the continued development of Bayesian statistics, by
highlighting problems in the sciences that require non-standard approaches,
thereby requiring theoretical and methodological developments for their
solution; (iii) provide an opportunity for scientists and statisticians to
present their work in depth, highlighting both the scientific background and the
analytical approaches, for the benefit of the audience; (iv) encourage young
researchers and graduate students to present their work, interact with senior
colleagues, learn about the latest developments in Bayesian statistics, and
participate in discussions, by providing a small-meeting atmosphere; (v)
highlight the many research opportunities that exist for statisticians who
engage in interdisciplinary work; (vi) include as participants women and under-
represented minorities who might benefit from the small workshop environment and
the opportunities for one-on-one discussions with colleagues at other
institutions; (vii) disseminate the findings presented at the workshop by
publishing a volume or special issue of a journal containing well-documented and
peer-reviewed case studies and related workshop presentations, and by posting
the same information on the workshop's web pages
(www.stat.cmu.edu/bayesworkshop).
