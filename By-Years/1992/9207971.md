This research builds on previous studies of shared-memory multiprocessors by
using the IEEE proposed Scalable Coherent Interface as a research platform.
Multiprocessor issues are studied both at the logical level and the cache
coherence level. Important problems at the logical level include study of the
performance of a single SCI ring as well as multiple rings, the properties of
pipelined networks, and appropriate topologies for connecting simple rings
together to create large-scale systems. Important problems at the cache
coherence level include enhancements to the shared-memory model to provide for
efficient synchronization, extensions to the SCI coherence protocol and the
benefit of relaxing event ordering constraints in the memory system.
