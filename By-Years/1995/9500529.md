9500529 Ding In this research, the problem of developing methods and rules to
sequence and balance mixed-model assembly lines is addressed. The objective of
the research is to develop methods for sequencing parts in a mixed-model
assembly line so as to minimize part usage variation. The methods proposed in
this research will account for both the variations in finished-part level
production and part usage. The effect of mix model changes on the effectiveness
of an existing balance will be analyzed. Furthermore, rules for determining the
necessity of re-balancing a mixed model assembly line will also be developed.
Industrial models in mixed-model assembly lines to incorporate industrial
concerns will also be performed. This will be supported through industrial data
to be collected as part of the research. Finally, computer simulation for
testing the effectiveness of the techniques developed will be undertaken using
both industrial and randomly generated data. Product assembly is a critical part
of manufacturing. Most products are made of several parts which are assembled
together. Given the pressure for quick order turnaround time and small lot size
manufacture, the need for efficient management and control of mixed-model
assembly lines are all the more important. Significant economic gains will be
realized through improvement in mixed-model assembly line management. The
outcome of this research will contribute to a better understanding of the
characteristics of mixed-model assembly lines.
