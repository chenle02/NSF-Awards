Reyer Sjamaar proposes to investigate invariants of symplectic stratified spaces
and of Hamiltonian Lie group actions, using methods from differential topology,
singularity theory and invariant theory. This project is expected to contribute
to the understanding of the singularities that arise from Hamiltonian Lie group
actions and momentum maps. One of the goals is to calculate the equivariant
index of symplectic quotients and symplectic cross-sections. A further goal is
to construct homology Todd classes for stratified symplectic spaces, with
applications to the index theory of manifolds with singularities. Symplectic
geometry is the branch of geometry governing the laws of the classical mechanics
of Newton. Classical mechanics is a quite accurate description of the large-
scale behaviour of objects in the physical world. At submicroscopic scales a
more precise description is given by the laws of quantum mechanics. To link
together macroscopic and microscopic behaviour, it is of importance to be able
to go back and forth between the two descriptions, and this has generated much
activity by physicists and mathematicians in this century. My project intends to
contribute to the quantization of systems that exhibit ``bad'', or singular,
features that cannot be treated by conventional means. Such singularities often
arise in the presence of linear, spherical, or more complicated types of
symmetry. Symmetry in a system of physical objects often enables one to predict
important features of its future behaviour, and my object is to find out how
these features are reflected at the quantum level.
