9452769 Haines-Stiles "Passport to Knowledge" takes students from all across
America on "electronic field trips" via television and computer networks.
Students join research scientists as they conduct their activities in
environments typically inaccessible to the younger population. This is made
possible through the use of television, VCRs, computers, CD-ROMs, modems,
satellites and telephone lines. Using these media students will become involved
in places such as the Antarctic, the Amazon Rainforest and the Hubble Space
Telescope. Some students will be able to interact with scientists live, others
via Internet. All will be able to monitor and correspond with the scientists as
they make entries in their Field Journals. The broadcasts will be distributed
over public television stations and other satellite educational networks so they
will be accessible to schools at no cost. Thus, Passport to Knowledge will
deliver contemporary science through face to face encounters with distant and
exotic places and phenomena and the privileged women and men exploring them,
using a powerful combination of television, print and on-line computer
technologies to inform, inspire, motivate and educate. ***
