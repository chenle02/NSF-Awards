This is a theoretical study of: (1) the influence of water-rock interactions on
the mineralogic and chemical compositions of the lower oceanic crust and upper
an mantle, and (2) an integration of inorganic vent fluid chemistry with
hydrothermal alteration of organic matter at sedimented ridges. Once the major
rock-forming element chemistry is better understood, linkages between shallow
and deep hydrothermal fluids can be elucidated. Trace element and organic
compound transport, as well as alteration and redistribution, will be
incorporated.
