Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological
roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. A non-coding RNA
(ncRNA) is an RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. Non-coding
RNAs contribute to diseases including cancers, autism, and Alzheimer's. Non-
coding (nc) RNAs, such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA),
play pivotal roles in the regulation of various physiological and pathological
processes. Nonetheless, the mechanistic&lt;br/&gt;regulation, subcellular
distribution, and mode of action of ncRNAs remain elusive due to a lack of
effective tools for probing ncRNAs in live cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
will develope a multispectral single molecule barcode biosensor for dynamic
multigene analysis. They will establish a convertible tetrahedral DNA (CTED)
biosensor along with a multispectral single molecule sensing (MSMS) system for
multiplex ncRNA detection in live cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
