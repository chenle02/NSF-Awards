9710301 Jaffe This is an award to support research on and relating to the
effects that surfactants have on enhancing the movement of bacteria suspended in
water through porous media. Experimental investigations are planned to relate
the molecular structure of surfactants and concentration in water to their
effects on bacterial cell surface charge and hydrophobicity. Additional
experiments will be conducted to relate movement of bacteria through sand
columns for determination of the effect that surfactants have on the collision
efficiency factor in applying colloid filtration theory to movement of bacteria
through soil. This experimental work will provide the framework for a
mathematical formulation that may be used in engineering design of systems for
decontamination of soil and for introduction of appropriately acclimated
microorganisms into a plume of contaminated water for its decontamination. The
introduction of surfactants to groundwater has the potential for significantly
affecting the transport of bacteria in soil. Results of this project are
expected to provide a means for predicting characteristics of bacterial
transport in soil as they are influenced by surfactants. This knowledge may be
applied in assessment of policies for intentional and unintentional introduction
of surfactants to groundwater, design of systems to cope with contaminated
plumes of groundwater such as wastewater streams from septic tanks and for
design of systems to decontaminate soil using appropriately acclimated bacteria.
