The award provides travel funds in support of a Soviet-American Youth Exchange
Program conducted by the American Association of Physics Teachers for
academically talented high school students. Some of the funds will underwrite
the costs of bringing the 15 American participants, selected in a national
competition, to the University of Maryland for a pre-departure orientation and
to meet their 15 Soviet counterparts. The remainder of the award will be used to
send the 15 participants and 2 group leaders to Tartu, Leningrad, and Moscow for
the Russian part of the program and to return them home at the conclusion of the
activity.
