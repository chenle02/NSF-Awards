Through this contract, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will continue its
scientific exchange programs with the academies of sciences of the U.S.S.R.,
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia in Calendar
Year 1991. These programs support individual visits by postdoctoral scientists
and engineers of the participating countries to scientific research facilities
of the other countries for familiarization, lecturing, and research. The
programs also include special thrusts to encourage the participation of young
participants and to promote short-term project development visits in support of
the NSF's cooperative research programs with the countries of the region. This
activity promotes two important program objectives: advancing scientific
knowledge by fostering professional contacts between American and foreign
scientists, and supporting U.S. foreign-policy objectives by maintaining a
framework of nongovernmental cooperation with the U.S.S.R. and the countries of
Eastern Europe. The interacademy exchange programs have had an excellent record
over the years of obtaining access for U.S. scientist and engineers to
scientific personnel and facilities of these countries in a framework of
reciprocity and mutuality of benefit.
