This project addresses the exosphere, the outermost fringe of the earth's
atmosphere. A preliminary investigation of existing terrestrial exosphere models
indicates that errors, in some cases in excess of 2, are likely to have accrued
from the use of simplistic approximations of collision processes. The
traditional concept of the exobase as a boundary between the thermosphere and a
collisionless exosphere appears to have caused major discrepancies. Recent work
by the Principal Investigator of this project on the quantum mechanics of H-H+
collisions shows that the common presumption that charge exchange in non-
scattering process has led to artificially low abundances of H atoms with
satellite velocities. With modern computers, many of the inaccuracies that have
resulted from traditional exosphere approximations can be avoided. Works in
progress to derive quantum mechanically correct methods for computer simulations
of key neutral-ion and neutral-neutral collision process. These tasks are
essential precursors to the accomplishment of the main objective of this
project: the creation of realistic model exosphere distributions of atomic
hydrogen and "hot" oxygen for equinox and solstice conditions over the solar
cycle. The exosphere models to be addressed in this project are produced by
computer simulation, using Monte Carlo methods that have been developing at UTD
since 1973. In an exosphere simulation, the trajectories of a large set of test
atoms are traced from their entry into the exosphere to their escape from the
planet. Throughout the life of each atom, the computer accounts for kinetic and
chemical effects of collisions with atoms, ions, and protons. Statistical data
representing the life histories of the test atoms are converted into
phenomenological hydrodynamic parameters in a process that is equivalent to
Monte Carlo integration of moments of the Boltzmann equation.
