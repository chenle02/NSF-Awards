The principal investigator will study the solubility of certain Na- and Ca-
silicate minerals at elevated temperature and pressure. He will also investigate
the solubility of wollastonite-quartz in NaCl-HCl solutions. This will yield
thermodyanmic data necessary to model fluid-rock interaction during contact
metamorphism and low to medium pressure regional metamorphism.
