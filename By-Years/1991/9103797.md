Ciscoes of the Laurentian Great Lakes once represented the most diversified
incipient species flock of Coregonus in North America. Though the taxonomy of
the coregonine fishes has always been difficult to resolve, the extensive
extirpations and extinctions of ciscoes which have occurred throughout the Great
Lakes system within the last few decades have hampered efforts to classify
remaining stocks of fish and to understand the evolutionary process involved in
their speciation. The proposed study would involve restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of nuclear DNA and restriction site mapping
analysis of mitochondrial DNA, later followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification and sequencing of rapidly-evolving nuclear and mitochondrial genes
from fresh and museum specimens of Laurentian, Artic, and Eurasian ciscoes.
Cladograms constructed from DNA-level homologies will be compared to those
derived from morphological data to deduce genetic relationships among these
fishes. Results of this research may lead to a better understanding of the
evolution of the Coregoninae, reveal underlying genetic principles behind the
evolution of fish species flocks, and enable genetically sound management of
remaining stocks of ciscoes in the Great Lakes.
