Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the application of
molecular orbital theory to a range of chemically important problems. Molecular
orbital theory, as applied by Professor Pople has become an integral part of
chemistry used not only by theoreticians, but also by a wide range of
experimental chemists. His methods have proved to be an invaluable complimentary
tool to much of experimental chemistry. Pople plans to continue his algorithm
development and research in the following three areas: 1) Research will continue
on the foundations of density functional theory. These include further
investigations into density functional theory, where the two-electron density
will be investigated. The aim of this work is to find improved exchange-
correlation functionals. 2)The second area is concerned with extensions of
theoretical thermochemistry. The aim here is to improve on the current model
used to predict energies of small systems. Several areas which form the basis of
the model will be examined and improved. 3) The third involves the use of Object
Oriented Classes in scientific programming. This is a continuation of work begun
in the previous grant period whose aim is to provide a more general
implementation of post-Hartree-Fock correlation theories.
