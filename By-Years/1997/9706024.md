9706024 Drake This project addresses the geochemistry of highly siderophile
elements in silicate systems of Earth's interior. The PIs will carry out an
experimental program to investigate the solubility and mineral/melt partitioning
behavior of noble siderophile elements. The major scientific goals are to
quantify: (1) the geochemical behavior of Re and Os, elements important for
chronology and as tracers of planetary evolution; (2) the geochemical behavior
of the platinum group elements in general. The PIs will target the Re-Os
isotopic system and conduct systematic studies if crystal/melt partitioning of
Re and Os. A second approach involves systematic solubility investigations to
quantify the chemical controls on highly siderophile element solubilities in
lithophile phases. Experiments will be carried out in one-atmosphere gas-mixing
furnaces, piston-cylinder apparatus, and multi-anvil apparatus.
