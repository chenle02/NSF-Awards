The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University will continue
shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel MAURICE
EWING, a 239-foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University. A
significant portion of Lamont's ship operating schedule in recent years and
again in during 1991 is in support of NSF- sponsored research projects. The
Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component and an
ashore component. The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific
personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance, repair, and
calibration of scientific instru- mentation; instruction and supervision of deck
operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going
scientific parties. On shore activities include maintenance, repair, and
calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel
in preparing for field work on the vessel. Shipboard technicians funded by this
award have broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and assistance
needed for the successful completion of research projects at sea. The level of
activity and amount of support are closely related to the size and capability of
the vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.
