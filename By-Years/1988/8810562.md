Species concentrations are mapped within a parallel-plate, plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor during the deposition of silicon from
a helium/silicon hydride plasma. Film properties will also be measured. The
purposes are to examine the relationship among process variables, gas
concentrations, and the amorphous/crystalline transition, and also to determine
kinetics that could permit reactor modeling. PECVD is an important emerging
technology for creating thin films for microelectronics manufacturing, but is
limited to empirical settings for product quality, reproducibility, and new-film
development. Gas-phase (plasma-phase) chemistry dominates, and if the kinetics
were quantitatively predictable for PECVD processes, then existing and new PECVD
processes could be improved. Spatially resolved data such as described above are
critical prerequisites for achieving such a goal.
