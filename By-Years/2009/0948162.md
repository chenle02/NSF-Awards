Intellectual merit. This study aims to identify the controlling parameters for
magmatic diversity in two young rift basins (Salton Sea and Cerro Prieto) within
the on-land extension of the Gulf of California. Despite similarities in basin
structure and tectonic setting, magmatism in both locations differs strongly.
Salton Sea surface and subsurface magmatic rocks are bimodal, whereas
intermediate compositions predominate at Cerro Prieto. Because both magmatic
systems are associated with economically important geothermal resources, dense
three-dimensional sampling exists through geothermal well penetration. Drill
cuttings from geothermal wells are invariably contaminated and rocks were
exposed to intense alteration at high ambient temperatures. Thus, high spatial
resolution uranium series geochronology coupled with oxygen isotopic analysis of
zircon by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) has the strongest prospects for
extracting reliable information on the temporal and spatial patterns of magmatic
variability. Results from Cerro Prieto will complement existing data for the
Salton Sea that indicate episodic rhyolite generation through remelting of
hydrothermally altered basaltic crust since at least 400 ka. The integration of
these results will provide insights into the changes in lithospheric structure
during continental rupture, the composition and thermal state of the lower crust
in rift basins, and the maturation of newly accreted crust during incipient
ocean spreading.

Broader impacts. This research impacts on strategies for renewable energy
exploration, and fosters ties between academics and the geothermal industry.
Users of the UCLA National Ion Microprobe facility will benefit from SIMS method
development tailored to low-yield samples and in-situ analysis. This project
provides opportunities for undergraduate research experience.
