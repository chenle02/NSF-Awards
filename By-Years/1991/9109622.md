This award will assist the University of Wisconsin purchase several pieces of
shared equipment for a group of nine investigators who are involved in basic
plant biology research. The research to be pursued with the equipment includes;
(1) molecular evolution, (2) starch metabolism, (3) molecular biology of plant
detoxification mechanism, (4) salt transport, (5) purine metabolism in plants,
(6) nitrogen fixation, (7) cereal endosperm development, and (8) the molecular
mechanisms of protein turnover in plants. Plant materials used by these
researchers vary from the model organism, Arabidopsis, to soybean, oats,
Brassica and alfalfa. The equipment to be purchased includes plant growth
chambers, an oligonucleotide synthesizer, spectrophotometer, and centrifuges.
These shared pieces of equipment will greatly facilitate advances of plant
biology research at the University of Wisconsin, and will increase already
active interactions among plant scientists in several departments.
