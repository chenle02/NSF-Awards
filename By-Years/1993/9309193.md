The project increases the quality of mechanical products through the
development of methodologies to evaluate and improve the diagnosability (a
measure of the ability to isolate system faults) of these products concurrent
with the conceptual and embodiment phases of the design process. The increase in
quality results from reduced loss of functionality and lower life cycle costs
for products designed using these methodologies. The methodologies are developed
through the functional decomposition and form to function mapping of existing
test bed products, and through the redesign of those products for increased
diagnosability. The procedures are similar to and integrated with the other
aspects of the concurrent engineering process.
