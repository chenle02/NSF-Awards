A structural feature common to apoproteins of all pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)
dependent carboxylases is an active site lysine which forms a Schiff base
between the epsilon amino group and the aldehyde moiety of the cofactor. Dialkyl
glycine decarboxylase (DGD) from Pseudomonas cepacia is probably such an enzyme.
It can catalyze both decarboxylation and transamination reactions. Previous work
with this enzyme suggests that the proton transfer is unusual. DGD catalyzes
proton transfer to the 4' carbon of the cofactor instead of the alpha carbon of
the amino acid. A reasonable hypothesis is that DGD is structurally similar to
other decarboxylases but differs from them by inverting the basicities of
histidine and lysine. This change would place the solvent proton preferentially
on lysine which is closer to the cofactor 4' carbon. In order to test the
validity of this model, mutants will be constucted with alanine substituting for
the lysine at the active site. If the experimental outcome confirms this
hypothesis, it will tell us a good deal about the electric field strengths at
the active site and how such local fields affect the free energy contents of
enzyme-substrates complexes and transition states. Dr. Keller is conversant with
the enzyme and has been well trained. The project would have a fovarable impact
on the quality of undergraduate education at the host institution.
