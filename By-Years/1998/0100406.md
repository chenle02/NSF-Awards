In joint work with Sergiu Klainerman and John Stalker,&lt;br/&gt;we study the
decay rate, pointwise and uniform, of solutions&lt;br/&gt;to a linear wave
equation on a Schwarzschild background metric.&lt;br/&gt;We have preliminary
results for each spherical harmonic.&lt;br/&gt;This is the first step towards
understanding the non-linear stability&lt;br/&gt;of these
metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, this corresponds to the
propagation and decay of an&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic wave near a black hole.
Our work starts with a careful&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of ideas known to
physicists, and plans to&lt;br/&gt;develop new tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
