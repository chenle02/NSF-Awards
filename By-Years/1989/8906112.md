Many fundamental problems remain for the stable isotopic analysis of tree
rings. Although the analyses have great potential for paleoclimatic
reconstructions, separating the various potential causes of isotopic change has
been very difficult. Stable-carbon isotopic compositions of tree rings may be
affected by many parameters, including temperature changes, growth rate,
moisture availability. The PI proposes to separate these various effects by
conducting a series of controlled-growth experiments and by analyzing field
samples at sites where meteorological parameters are continuously monitored.
This research is important because it will provide the fundamental relationships
between climatic variables and tree-ring carbon isotopic composition, and it
will help to develop this methodology into a new calibrated tool for
paleoclimate reconstructions. This proposal has been considered under the
Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
