9523183 Koev This research is to develop a Raman spectrometer based on small-
diameter, long-path length, totally-internally reflecting sample cells. The
cells will be hollow fibers drawn from a transparent amorphous fluoropolymer
with a refractive index less than water. These fibers will act as optical fibers
when filled with any transparent liquid. This will confine the excitation and
Raman-scattered radiation within the sample, increasing the Raman intensity by
as much as 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. Raman spectrometers are used extensively
in analytical chemistry primarily to provide information on molecular
vibrations. The results of this research will make the Raman spectrometers even
more useful to industry by increasing the intensity of conventional
spectrometers and extending their use to essentially all transparent liquids.
