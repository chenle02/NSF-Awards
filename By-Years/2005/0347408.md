The project is concerned with investigating a promising approach to interactive,
large-scale data analysis, called online aggregation (OLA). In OLA, the user is
kept informed at all times of the current estimate of the answer to a query over
the data, along with a statistical estimate of the accuracy of the answer. The
advantage of OLA is that an approximate answer with satisfactory accuracy can
often be computed very quickly and inexpensively, at which time the query can be
terminated.

The project has two goals - technological and educational. The technological
goal of the project is designing and implementing a software system for data
analysis that is fundamentally based on OLA, as opposed to software that
augments the traditional, batched processing architecture with some OLA
capabilities. The project reconsiders data management issues such as indexing,
query optimization, join algorithms, and user interface design in the context of
OLA. Evaluation is via rigorous benchmarking of the software produced. The
educational goal of the project is development of techniques the make use of
direct faculty involvement to help ensure retention of beginning engineering
students. The project will achieve broad impact by developing techniques with
potential to bring about a fundamental change in the $3.5 billion segment of the
software industry now devoted to analytic processing. Also, by investigating
ways to ensure the retention and success of tomorrow's engineers, the project
will achieve broad impact by helping to ensure the technological and scientific
leadership of the nation. The project Web site

dissemination.
