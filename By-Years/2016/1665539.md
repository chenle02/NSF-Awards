The Phenome 2017 Conference will be held February 10-14, 2017 in Tucson,
Arizona. This international meeting intends to be an annual venue to both
showcase and accelerate basic research and the development of novel remote
sensors, imaging technologies, and robotics in the field of high throughput
plant phenotyping. The meeting will bring together scientists with expertise in
fundamental plant systems biology, epigenetics, quantitative genetics, and
metabolic and network analyses with those in the fields of computational
science, and engineering to identify the challenges and needs required to
translate research findings for the public good. Phenome 2017 is a joint effort
of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC) and the American Society of Plant
Biologists (ASPB). As such, the organizers will be able to leverage existing
resources to keep costs low to allow for participation of those with limited
funds. Funding from NSF will broaden the scope of the meeting by supporting
participation of graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, especially
women, minorities, and underrepresented groups.
