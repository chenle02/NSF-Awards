The microbial physiology laboratory, with a basic emphasis on metabolism and
regulation, is an important aspect of undergraduate education in microbiology,
and an area in which we excel at the University of Oklahoma. Our microbial
physiology laboratory is based on the van Niel approach (microbial diversity)
coupled with a major biochemistry component. Quantification of metabolites in
experiments and field samples is critical for a successful laboratory. We are
requesting support for two HPLC's (UV detector and refractive index detector)
and a gas chromatograph for this and other undergraduate laboratories. They are
to be used to quantify substrates, ions, and end-products of metabolism, and
used by the students themselves. Currently, these instruments are not available
in our undergraduate laboratories. This hands-on, quantitative biological
laboratory where students study their own environmental isolates is a very
important part of our major's undergraduate education at the University of
Oklahoma.
