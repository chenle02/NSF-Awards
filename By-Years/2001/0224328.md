Our study investigates landscape change and plague occurrence in the black-
tailed prairie dog and associated species, to understand the human health and
ecological risks of landscape alteration and disease introduction. Black-tailed
prairie dogs have been considered a 'keystone' species of short-grass prairie
ecosystems in the western US. The abundance and distribution of prairie dogs may
influence the occurrence of many native plant and animal species. Blood diseases
like plague spread through contact between black-tailed prairie dogs and co-
occurring alternate mammalian hosts. Through a combination of field data
collection, laboratory studies, and computer simulation modeling, we will
examine ecological relationships of hosts, vectors, and pathogens at the local,
landscape, and regional scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because our study system
includes landscape change and recent disease introduction, it is representative
of problems faced by many ecosystems as habitat fragmentation and disease
transport increase worldwide. By focusing on this host-vector-disease system we
will isolate anthropogenic effects that influence disease emergence and
resurgence. By carefully examining the modes and scales of contact within this
complex community, we hope to discover the potential for ecological and
epidemiological keystone effects of prairie dogs. This discovery will elucidate
whether anthropogenic effects on ecological systems can have predictable
consequences for disease transmission and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
