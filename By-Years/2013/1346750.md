This project is a comparative analysis of labor relations across varying levels
of consent. The study examines relations between domestic workers and their
employers in two sites to understand the effects of culture and social structure
on employee-employer labor patterns and interactions, legal status, and
understandings of legal rights. Analysis is based on in-depth interviews with
domestic contract workers, employers, and representatives of government,
nongovernmental organizations, and recruitment agencies. Broader impacts of the
project include improved understanding of comparative labor relations and the
intersection between labor vulnerability and human trafficking, as well as
graduate student research training.
