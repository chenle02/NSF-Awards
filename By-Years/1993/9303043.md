The goal of this research is the design, implementation, and realistic
application of a functional programming language supporting the development of
scientific codes. Functional languages and scientific computing appear to be
singularly mismatched. The problem is not with the expressiveness of these
languages, which is excellent, but their efficiency, which is poor. Recent
research in functional languages suggests that assignment may in fact be
consistent with referential transparency, if care is taken in the overall
language design. This research uses one such language, the Imperative Lambda
Calculus (ILC), to develop programs in the domain of random process modelling.
Although inefficiency on sequential processors has long been a drawback of
functional languages, their efficiency on parallel processors has been a strong
attraction. An important goal of this research is to obtain an efficient
parallel implementation of ILC. The potential for success in this endeavor is
high because the presence of assignment in ILC obviates the transformation to
imperative form, leaving the compiler to handle only the (well understood)
problems of higher-order functions and lazy evaluation themselves. To fully
exploit modern parallel architectures, especially non-uniform memory access
machines, control over the placement of data and scheduling of tasks needs to be
provided by way of parallel language extensions to ILC.
