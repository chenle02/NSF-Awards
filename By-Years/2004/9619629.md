AST-9619629 The Nonlinear Dynamics of Quasi-Collisional Neutral Gases in the
Solar System (A Case Study of the Triton Tori). Dr. Marconi will carry out a
detailed and rigorous theoretical investigation of the physics of the Triton
torus, a gas ring around Neptune fed by its largest satellite. This research
should lead to a realistic model of the Triton tori which will be of use to
other research groups interested in Triton and Neptune's magnetosphere. The
project has three intertwined objectives. The first objective is to enhance in a
general sense the theoretical understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of quasi-
collisional gas tori in the Solar System. The second objective is to provide a
specific gas model of the quasi-collisional Triton atomic hydrogen, molecular
hydrogen, and nitrogen tori and evaluate their effects on the Neptune
magnetosphere. The third objective is to broaden and enhance the study of
astrophysical gases through all kinetic regimes and to develope consistent
numerical schemes to describe them. ====================================
