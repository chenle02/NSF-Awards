This proposal addresses a novel form of gene regulation in eukaryotes by asking
how a circadian clock regulates the transcription of specific plant genes. The
study of clock- regulated transcription will provide an important insight into
molecular genetic studies. Transcription of the three Arabidopsis Cab genes is
differentially regulated by a circadian clock. The basis for this difference
will be investigated by analyzing the cis- and trans-acting factors that mediate
the circadian response. This will entail detailed in vitro analysis of specific
DNA-protein interactions using nuclear protein extracts prepared from different
time-points during the cycle. The in vivo relevance of these interactions will
be assessed by analysis of sites-specific constructs in transgenic plants. In
addition, novel circadian- regulated marker genes will be identified and
characterized by differential and subtractive hybridization. %%% Knowledge of
how transcription is regulated by cellular clocks will provide insight into a
novel form of gene regulation in plants and will, perhaps, provide information
which can be extrapolated to other organisms.
