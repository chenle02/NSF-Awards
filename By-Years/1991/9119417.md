For streams on the North Shore of Lake Superior, salmon are a recently
introduced exotic species, and may be altering the stream ecosystems from their
historic state. Are salmon migrations into streams a significant source of
nutrients and high quality organic matter for these stream ecosystems? The
importance of migration salmon in nutrient and organic matter flow through
stream ecosystem components will be tested using experimental, comparative, and
stable isotope tracer techniques. It is hypothesized that the presence of salmon
will: 1) result in a shift away from terrestrial sources of organic matter and
inorganic nutrients toward lake derived sources (salmon carcasses and spawn);
and 2) will alter the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation. This shift will
be reflected in changes in periphyton, fine particle and dissolved organic
carbon, grazer, shredder, and collector components of the ecosystem which can be
traced using stable isotopes. It is further hypothesized that, 3) the size of a
patch of salmon carcasses determines the spatial scale of the effect on the
resource within the ecosystem. A combination of experimental and comparative
studies will provide insight into the interdependence of nutrient limitation and
nutrient and organic matter flow through these stream ecosystems.
