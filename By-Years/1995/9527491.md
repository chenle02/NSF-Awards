Abstract: EEC-9527491, New Jersey Institute of Technology, PI-Dr. Anthony
Johnson: This award provides funding to the New Jersey Institute of Technology
for support of a Combined Research Curriculum Development Program entitled,
"Multidisciplinary Optical Science and Engineering CRCD Program at NJIT". The
CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal
value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year program
will institute complementary applied optical science and engineering courses at
NJIT which will (1) provide a unified, multidepartmental optical
science/engineering curriculum and (2) emphasize optics courses which will
provide laboratory and classroom training to undergraduate and graduate students
in emerging areas of industrial and national importance.
