Dualities play a fundamental role in both mathematics and physics. A duality
provides a symmetric correspondence between various objects of a pair of
typically quite different theories. This is important because a difficult
problem in one theory often corresponds, under the duality, to a simpler problem
in the dual theory. Two important and challenging dualities are Langlands
duality, which has origins in number theory, and mirror symmetry, which was
first discovered by theoretical physicists and is playing an increasingly
important role in mathematics as well. Neither of these two dualities is fully
understood. Both of these dualities will be studied in this project. It is
anticipated that the work will establish new and unexpected links between
seemingly unrelated topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will
explore a new approach to the study of exponential sums and integrals over
moduli spaces associated to a wide class of categories. In the case of the
moduli space of quiver representations, the project aims to develop a new proof
of the Kac conjecture as well as a new formula, which involves a potential and
which is closely related to the Donaldson-Thomas invariants introduced by
Kontsevich and Soibelman. The project will also investigate a similar counting
problem for the moduli space of parabolic (vector) bundles on a projective
algebraic curve with punctures.
