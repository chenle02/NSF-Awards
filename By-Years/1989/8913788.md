This planning grant aims to replicate a pilot study, by the PI, of graduates of
historically black and predominantly white colleges and universities.
Probability sampling techniques were use to collect and analyze income, labor
market, and quality of life data on a sample of graduates of HBCUs and PWCUs in
the Atlanta Metropolitan area. In the present study the PI proposes to identify
and spell out the appropriate sampling methodology for a survey that will
include HBCUs and PWCUs from other states and regions of the US. The aim is to
increase the reliability of the survey estimates without resorting to a census.
During the planning period the PI proposes to: 1) Confer with survey research
experts including senior statisticians at ICPSR, the Bureau of the Census and
other Federal agencies regarding the appropriate sampling technique. 2) Develop
sampling procedure. Revise survey instrument and determine optimum sample size.
3) Identify database requirements including software, hardware and programming
support requirements. Establish procedures for creating storing and retrieving
database. 4) Meet with Presidents and Academic Deans of sampled colleges and
universities and obtain permission to sample alumni records. 5) Draft MRI grant
proposal.
