This research program emphasizes the study of unsteady nonplanar modes of
combustion. The objective of the program is to investigate the effects of
preferential diffusion, thermal expansion, stretching, flame front curvature,
viscosity, and heat loss of the limites and mechanisms for the generation,
suppression, and sustenance of flame front corrugations. Three classes of
problems are examined: (1) burner attached flames, (2) stretched flames in
stagnation point flow and counterflow configurations, and (3) spherically
expanding flames. The methods employed are asymptotic and perturbation
techniques as well as methods of stability and bifurcation theory.
