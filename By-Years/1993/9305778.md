The Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona will purchase a Sun
Microsystems SPARC center 2000 computer which will be dedicated to the support
of several research projects in both applied and pure mathematical science.
Specific projects include: (1) mesoscopic modeling of large-scale hydrodynamics;
(2) computational nonlinear optics; (3) numerical PDEs with complex geometrical
boundaries; (4) algebraic manipulation of polynomial and topological invariants;
and (5) computer-assisted proofs for chaotic dynamics. These projects are major
efforts towards solving leading problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics,
Nonlinear Optics, and several fundamentals issues in pure mathematical science.
They have common need for a more powerful local computing facility.
