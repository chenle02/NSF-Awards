9311586 Zuo This ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV-STM) will
greatly improve faculty and student research opportunities in both the
Department of Physics and Astronomy (principally) and the Department of
Biomedical Sciences at Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU). Current
research efforts related to the equipment in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy are molecular beam epitaxial growth and characterization of compound
semiconductors and the related device physics, conducting polymers, and
synchrotron radiation studies of local crystal structures. Research programs in
the Department of Biomedical Sciences include the fine structure examination of
biological specimens. The requested UHV-STM, a very powerful tool in the study
of geometric/electronic structures of surfaces and interfaces with atomic
resolution, will enhance our microstructure analysis capability. Its
availability will not only extend our current research efforts into an important
area connecting electronic and optical properties of materials with their
microstructures, but will also give students a direct experience of frontier
research and better prepare them for entry into graduate study or careers in
various scientific disciplines. ***
