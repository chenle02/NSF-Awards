The goal of this doctoral dissertation project is to understand the impact of
colonialism on the daily activities of Native Americans and their response to
the rapid changes that took place after European contact. Because most
historical documents about this region were written by men, the experience of
Native American women has been neglected. This project addresses this disparity
by focusing specifically on one of the products of the everyday activities of
women and the importance and stability of the networks of learning that
developed among women around the practice of pottery production. This project
emphasizes the stability of these communities and the choices made by female
potters to demonstrate that these women were agents of change and to counter
dominant narratives that depict Native Americans as passive victims of an
unstoppable colonial force. From a theoretical perspective, this work improves
researchersâ€™ understandings of how working groups of individuals - in this case
traditional potters - are maintained in the face of significant political and
social change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These issues will be addressed through the
analysis of pottery from four cultural sites located in coastal Georgia and
South Carolina. The doctoral student will utilize visual inspection of pottery
decoration and attributes related to production. Similarities and differences in
these traits will allow her to identify sites that were occupied by potters who
likely learned to produce pottery together or spent significant amounts of time
engaged in pottery production together. She will also utilize petrographic
microscopy for a more detailed look at how production processes vary between
sites. The pottery samples have been selected specifically to allow researchers
to address how the networks connecting women at the study sites changed or were
maintained through time. Radiocarbon dating will be used to ensure that any
variation that is observed is the result of differences in potting communities,
rather than change through time. This research will be presented to the nearest
descendants of the tribe in question, the Muskogee (Creek) Nation. This offers
members of the tribe an archaeological perspective on their history and
facilitate positive relationships between academic archaeologists and descendant
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
