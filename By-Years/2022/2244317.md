This award will support the renewal of a 10-week research experience program for
eight undergraduate students per year at the University of Wyoming. A unique
aspect of this program is that students work together as a team on a single
research project with each student assigned separate sub-projects within the
whole. The research projects and faculty leads rotate each year, with (1)
speckle imaging of exoplanet candidates from TESS, (2) Hb reverberation mapping
of quasars, and (3) searches for Earth-like planets using ultra-high precision
radial velocity measurements of nearby stars being slated for the following
three summers. The students will carry out this research through their exclusive
access to UWyoâ€™s 2.3 m telescope (70-nights) to gain a truly immersive
experience in observational astrophysics, and they will receive additional
training to prepare them for graduate school and careers in STEM fields. They
will also be given the opportunity to participate in science outreach through
AstroCamp, a 10-day science camp for rising 6th-8th graders during the summer.
This project is jointly funded by OMA and the Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment of participants
will focus on freshmen and sophomore students from liberal arts colleges, two-
year colleges, and public institutions offering little to no research
opportunities. The project will continue to collaborate with the Cal-Bridge
Summer program to target minority students for recruitment. Past success has
increased the participation of these minorities to over 22% in the past six
years. The recruitment techniques that have achieved this balance will be
continued in the current project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
