This research examines phase stability in binary and ternary alloys.
Synchrotron x-radiation small angle scattering is employed to analyze diffusion
and phase separation in thin films. An improved processing method produces
multilayer thin films, which are characterized by analytical electron microscopy
in phase diagram and diffusion experiments. The thermodynamics of the aluminum-
lithium alloy system are examined to determine metastable phase decomposition
reaction that could affect properties. Quantum mechanical prediction of ordering
are being extended to ternary systems.
