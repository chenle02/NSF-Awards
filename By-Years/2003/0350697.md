Although the logistics industry provides critical services to all sectors of the
economy, few studies exist in Economic Geography that attempt to understand the
organizational dynamics of this industry. The aim of this research is to
understand the organizational dynamics of the logistics industry. We will focus
on the following dimensions that are identified as particularly important: use
of information technologies, intensifying global trade, and changing geographic
requirements. We combine an in-depth empirical survey, comprised of a nationwide
mail-in survey and semi-structured interviews of logistics users and providers
in the Boston-Washington corridor, with an exploratory use of agent-based
modeling. The model is designed to push the research beyond collection of
anecdotal evidence and offer a structured and systematic understanding of
organizational dynamics of the logistics industry.

The study will enrich understanding of the interaction between technology and
space through examining the evolution of an industry that plays a central role
in the contemporary economy. Research results will provide little known aspects
of the logistics industry's emerging organizational dynamics and inform
academics and policy makers on the theoretical and practical understandings of
the long-distance coordination of production.
