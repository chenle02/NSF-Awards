With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry,
Vlad M. Iluc of Notre Dame University will study an important chemical
transformation known olefin metathesis, using earth-abundant transition metal
catalysts. The olefin metathesis reaction positively impacts numerous fields in
academic research and industry, ranging from synthesis of value-added compounds
to applications in materials science and biology. Catalysts currently employed
utilize rather costly transition metals such as ruthenium. The proposed research
seeks to fundamentally change this approach and could have a significant
component of sustainable chemistry as an effective olefin metathesis reaction
based upon an earth-abundant metal such as iron would reduce dependence on
precious and toxic metals. Dr. Iluc and his team will integrate their scientific
activities and results with the Center for Sustainable Energy at Notre Dame (ND
Energy) and share their discoveries with the broader research community. The
Iluc research group will work to enhance diversity in science by attracting
women and underrepresented minorities to work on the proposed projects. The PI
and several group members will continue their in person mentorship of teenagers
at the Bashor Childrenâ€™s Home, a non-profit child welfare agency that provides
assistance to troubled children and their families through residential care, and
help with alternative education and other activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vlad
M. Iluc and his team at the University of Notre Dame will work to develop an
alternative manifold for olefin metathesis based upon earth-abundant metal
catalysts. Olefin metathesis reactions are well known for ruthenium catalysis,
but those that utilize iron are only now being discovered. Recent workroom the
Iluc group demonstrating that iron carbenes can mediate olefin metathesis
reactions similar to ruthenium lay the foundation for the proposed work. The
results from this project will likely provide foundational insight to guide
future developments in iron olefin metathesis catalysis. In this project, Dr.
Iluc and his coworkers will investigate the electronic structures and chemical
reactivity of tethered iron carbene complexes and apply this knowledge to the
synthesis and isolation of mono-tethered and untethered analogues for new
catalytic applications. This research program is designed to increase broader
participation in STEM through team-coordinated outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
