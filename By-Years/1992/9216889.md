This research seeks to obtain a comprehensive and innovative set of key
measurements on individual fish larvae that will fully characterize the animal's
size-specific growth, as well as the response of these measures to different
food levels. These values will change with the animal's development, and so the
size-related changes in larval physiology and ecology must be characterized and
understood if their role in population processes is to be known. The typical
values of the measurements, their observed distributions and variability, and
the strength of their relation ship to one another, will be evaluated. The
underlying goals for the work are: 1) to derive baseline information on the
size-specific development patterns in individual marine fish larvae that are
expected to be important in field recruitment process studies, and 2) to
intercompare this set of condition indices to learn the strength of the
relationships among them, and what their relative value would be for indicating
overall animal condition and predicting continued survival.
