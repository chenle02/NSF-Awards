Reliable information about the in-place early-age strength of concrete can be
used to improve the safety and economy of concrete construction. For example,
reliable measurements of in-place concrete strength can be used to determine
when adequate strength has been obtained to allow removal of shoring, transfer
of prestressing, application of post-tensioning, and termination of curing. In-
place strength information allows each of these operations to proceed safely and
at the earliest possible time, leading to more economical construction. The
objective of the proposed research is to continue development of a new test
method, the impact-echo method, for measuring in-place early age concrete
strength. In this study, the impact-echo method will be established between
P-wave velocity and concrete strength. This correlation relationship will be
established using cylindrical concrete specimens is applicable to plate-like
concrete structural elements such as slabs and walls. This work represents an
advancement towards the development of a standardized test for measuring the in-
place strength of concrete using the impact-echo method.
