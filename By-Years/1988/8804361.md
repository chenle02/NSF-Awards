The goals of this project follow those which were achieved for the REU last
year. A realistic and thorough plan is to be implemented which explicitly
delineates the careful recruitment plan, a solid management structure, research
assignments which match the students interest and capability to complete within
the time available, and following plan to promote continual interest in
research. All of these elements are fully described in the proposal. Student
projects will be in four areas of structural and geotechnical research: soil
testing, probabilistic methods, structural testing, and buried pipe line design.
Some of the projects are contractions of those begun during the 1987 REU
Program. The decade long experience and commitment to excellence in
undergraduate education have been enhanced by the REU activity.
