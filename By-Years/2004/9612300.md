9612300 Devasia The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is one of the important
nanofabrication tools used for precision lithography of structures below 100 nm.
As a manufacturing tool, high precision is achieved at the expense of throughput
using low scanning speeds. This project will improve throughput by developing
the theoretical and experimental expertise needed for high-speed/high-precision
scanning probes for STM. The technical approach uses nonlinear inversion of the
piezo actuator dynamics for scan path tracking, and feedback to handle the
modeling errors. The four theoretical and experimental parts of the research
are: (1) piezo modeling and order reduction, (2) inversion-based control design,
(3) high speed scan path design using the inversion based control to minimize
vibration, and (4) feedback control to stabilize the scan path and reduce errors
attributed to unmodeled dynamics. Success of this project will increase the
productivity of current microelectronics fabrication equipment, and will enable
the design of the next generation of machines needed for positioning below 10
nm. This will allow the fabrication of higher performance microelectronic
devices at lower cost.
