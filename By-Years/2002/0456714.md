The present project is in the broad area of geometric representation theory.
The basic goal of the subject is to use relations between geometry and algebra
to get better understanding of each of them. This particular research project
would deal on the geometric side with moduli of representations of quivers,
instantons and sheaves on curves and surfaces. These are related on the
algebraic side with Kac-Moody and vertex algebras, their representations and
more general tensor categories.

Representation theory uses symmetries in the study of various objects. In
particular this project deals with sheaves on curves (which are closely related
to number theory, i.e. the study of integers) and quiver varieties (whose
origins go back to Platonic solids and so predate number theory). The amazing
fact is that solids and numbers have closely related symmetries. Various
attempts at understanding (and exploiting) this connection constitute a large
part of modern mathematics.
