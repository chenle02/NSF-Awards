Microcomputers are being interfaced with laboratory instruments in the general
chemistry program. Student involvement is being maximized in the process of
measurement, data acquisition, and data analysis. The efficiency and precision
of laboratory measurements is being increased, as well as the student interest
and understanding of the nature of the measurements and the principles of
chemistry that the laboratories are designed to illustrate. Four data
acquisition devices, eight microcomputers directly connected to the devices, a
hard disk drive and tape backup for software and data storage as well as a
fileserver system are included. Each data acquisition device serves two student
workstations. The workstations were completed with the purchase of: eight
digital balances for routine mass measurements, three bomb calorimeter systems
for calorimetric studies of foods and fuels, two spectrometers for routine
quantitative analyses as well as equilibrium and kinetic studies, four pressure
transducer systems and eight thermistor thermometer systems for temperature
measurements. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal funds.
