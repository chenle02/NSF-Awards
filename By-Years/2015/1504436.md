The University of Texas at Austin has received an NSF Improving Undergraduate
STEM Education Exploration Track award to develop and utilize an instrument to
measure the extent to which undergraduate life science majors value mathematics
for understanding and answering biological questions. According to expectancy-
value theory, the personal values assigned to a task, such as using mathematics
to understand and make predictions about biological phenomena ("mathematics-
biology tasks"), can influence a student's decision to enroll in future courses
related to the task and their performance on the task. Thus, cultivating life
science majors' value of mathematics-biology tasks is critical to their overall
ability to apply quantitative skills and to the development of quantitative
biologists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this, an existing, validated
mathematics task-value instrument, the Mathematics Value Inventory (MVI), will
be adapted and empirically validated to produce the Mathematics-Biology Value
Instrument (MBVI). The MBVI will measure four dimensions of student value of
using mathematics in biology: enjoyment, usefulness, need for high achievement,
and perceived cost. With guidance from an Advisory Board consisting of experts
in psychometrics, statistical analysis, and quantitative biology education, the
PI team will use an iterative cycle of formative assessment and revision that
will produce a valid and reliable measure for determining the extent to which
life science majors value mathematics-biology tasks. This instrument will be
used to assess the landscape of life science majors' mathematics-biology task-
values, including any differences between male and female, introductory and
upper-level, and majority and minority students at institutions implementing
different types of quantitative biology education reforms.
