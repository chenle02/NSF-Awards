ABSTRACT. Professor Bourdon and his collaborator Joel Shapiro of Michigan State
University will investigate problems arising from the interaction between the
modern theory of linear operators and the classical theory of analytic
functions. The problems to be studied involve norms, decomposability, and
numerical ranges of composition operators as well as the chaotic behavior of
both composition operators and operators commuting with backward shifts.
Insights and tools developed during the course of the project will be applied to
other classes of linear operators on Hilbert and Banach spaces.

Many of the differential and integral equations that physicists and engineers
use to model physical processes may be viewed as linear operators on spaces of
functions. This viewpoint, pioneered by David Hilbert, led to the development of
function-theoretic operator theory, which is the branch of mathematics inspiring
the problems that are the focus of Bourdon and Shapiro's project. A number of
these problems concern the notion of numerical range of a linear operator, an
object that has relevance to quantum physics and that has proven useful to
engineers in determining the stability of certain control systems. Other
problems relate to the chaotic behavior of linear operators. That linear
operators can give rise to chaotic systems is a relatively recent discovery
which has led to unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical
systems. The idea of decomposability--the study of how to break a complicated
linear system up into simpler ones--has been shown to have surprising
connections with such chaotic behavior. The final group of problems involves
norm calculations for composition operators. The norm of an operator measures
how much the operator can stretch the unit ball of the space on which it acts.
Computer experimentation should yield insights and intuition concerning both
composition-operator norms and numerical ranges. Through such experimentation,
undergraduate students at Washington and Lee University will be given an
opportunity to participate in the project. The training and research experience
provided to these students by the project contribute to its human-resources
impact.
