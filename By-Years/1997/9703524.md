*** This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, will explore
the balance between human operator supervision and computer automation in a
human-robot cooperation. The research will do this by finding ways to combine
human high-level visual perception and task- understanding capabilities with a
robot's low-level vision and positioning precision, to optimize the performance
of the human-machine team in vision and manipulation processes. The focus of
this initial exploration is to determine ways to combine prior domain knowledge
and models, and overall vision and scene perception capabilities of the human
operator, with precision and high-speed machine operation in execution of
complex robotic tasks. This investigation offers promise of identifying new
approaches to allocating human and machine roles in cooperative endeavors, which
will be important in a wide range of emerging applications.***
