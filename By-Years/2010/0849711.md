The project will use the submersible ALVIN and the AUV SENTRY to obtain samples
on-and off-axis at the intermediate-spreading Galapagos Spreading Center to
study the effects of variable magma supply on volcanic processes at the
intermediate-spreading Galapagos Spreading Center. The project will obtain
important new constraints on the relationships between magma supply, magma
chamber properties and processes, eruption dynamics and the development of
volcanic landforms at this intermediate-spreading mid-ocean ridge.
