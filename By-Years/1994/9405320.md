9405320 Swisher Available paleontological data indicate that much of our
evolutionary history is recorded in rocks on the African continent. An important
exception to this, is the origin and evolution of Homo erectus. Numerous
specimens of early hominids have been recovered from the Javanese sites of
Sangiran, Perning,Kedungbrubus, Sambungmacan, and Ngandong. Considerable debate
continues, however, as to the taxonomic affinity and particularly the age of
many of these finds. The debate over the age of the Javanese hominids centers
around two questions; the precise stratigraphic placemtn of some of the fossil
specimens and the precise age of these deposits. This project, by the
outstanding geochronology group in the world, will develop a detailed
geochronological framework in order to calibrate temporally the evolution of
hominids in Java. Current age estaimtes for some finds vary dramatically from
slightly over 2 million years ago to as young as 200,000 years ago. They will
1)use incremental laser and resistance furnace heating argon isotope techniques
to date pumice-bearing horizons associated with hominid sites in Java, 2) date
directly hominids and/or associated mammalian fossils that have sufficient
amounts of volcanic material attached for argon isotope dating, and 3) develop
and refine the currently available magnetostratigraphies of Plio-Pleistocene
hominid-bearing stratigraphic sections of Java. The resultant chronology will
permit the construction of a detailed temporal history of Javanese hominids, and
allow for the first time, precise temporal correlation of the Javanese Homo
erectus with hominid and faunal evets in the Plio-Pleistocene of Africa.
