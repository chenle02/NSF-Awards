In Northern Pakistan, a crustal section is preserved and exposed in Kohistan,
NW Himilaya. The island arc section is unique in that a nearly complete cross-
section of the earth's crust may be sampled there. The PI will study, by means
of field and laboratory study, the rock magnetism of this section. The field and
international travel expenses for this project have already been funded by the
Smithsonian Institution (Excess Foreign Currency), and NSF funds are for the
first year of laboratory study. This research will 1) add basic data on the
physical properties of the middle and lower portions of the earth's crust, 2)
provide constraining data on magnetization at depth, for improved geological
interpretation of regional magnetic anomalies, 3) provide a suite of well-
characterized samples for planned future petrophysical and experimental studies,
and 4) foster an atmosphere of international cooperation.
