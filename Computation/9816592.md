The investigator and his colleagues organize a series of annual Copper Mountain
Conferences. The subject of these meetings alternates between multigrid methods
in odd-numbered years and iterative methods in even-numbered years. The Copper
Mountain Conferences provide a forum for the exchange of ideas in these two
closely related fields. The program for a conference in this series consists of
tutorials, invited lectures, and contributed papers, as well as time for
scientific interaction among the participants. Topics of emphasis for the
conferences include advanced architectures, algebraic-type methods, and
nonsymmetric linear systems. This grant provides support for students to
participate in the conferences.

The mathematical description of real-world problems leads inevitably to
equations to solve. Many times the equations are nonlinear ones, arising because
the underlying problem is nonlinear. Often, however, the original problem is
linear and the mathematical equations are too. Such problems arise in all areas
of science and technology, and are of special interest in biology, materials,
environmental studies, and manufacturing. Progress in these areas requires
solution of more comprehensive modeling equations --- such models are usually
more nonlinear than simpler models ---, or more accurate solution of existing
models --- increasing the size of the numerical problem to be solved. Many
problems lead to equations that are not symmetric; computational methods for
such problems offer special difficulties. Numerical methods for solving a
differential equation usually begin by imposing a grid on the region where the
equation holds. From the differential equation, algebraic equations are then
developed; their solution represents the solution of the differential equation.
The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is measured by the fineness of
the grid. Multigrid methods are numerical methods for solving partial
differential equations that systematically exploit the relationship between
approximate solutions on different grids to arrive at a solution whose accuracy
is consistent with the finest grid but for considerably less work. The methods
are often dramatically more efficient than others. The conferences address
advances in iterative methods and in multigrid methods to deal with larger
numerical systems, nonsymmetric and nonlinear systems, and the use of
multiprocessor computers. The methods are of great practical import in
engineering, manufacturing, materials, physics, and fluid dynamics. This project
supports student participants at the Copper Mountain conferences on multigrid
methods and on iterative methods. The students present a talk on their research
in the regular sessions of the conference. The primary objective here is to
encourage student participation in these rapidly evolving areas, and to provide
an excellent opportunity for these students to demonstrate their new results, to
learn more about the field from its experts, and to become a more integral part
of the discipline. Supporting student participation is critical for developing
the next generation of scientists and engineers.
