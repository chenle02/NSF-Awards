*** This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, raises the
question whether it is feasible to develop paradigms for human-robot cooperation
which take advantage of the differing and complementary capabilities of human
and machine, to optimize the cooperative effort. Thus, for example, such a
scheme would combine autonomous low-level planning and control on the part of
the robot with higher level human reasoning and command, so that the pair could
cooperate effectively in accomplishing tasks. Methods will be explored for
smothly coordinating those human and machine functions.***
