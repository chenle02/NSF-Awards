Introductory Botany is being revised so that students meeting the institutional
requirement for a laboratory science course gain a better understanding of how
scientists think and work. The large proportion of students at this institution
who become pre-college teachers particularly benefit from these experiences. The
dissection and compound microscopes are used in new and stimulating "hands-on"
exercises that enrich a curriculum that deals with evolution, biometry,
biomechanics, reproductive strategies, and the interaction and effects of
environmental fluid dynamics on the evolution of plant structures.
