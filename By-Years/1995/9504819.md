9504819 LaConti This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
proposes the development of a low-cost, efficient, stable composite anode steel
electrode that will be especially useful in electrochemical processes where mild
or strongly alkaline electrochemical media is present. The focus of the research
effort will be on improving the adiponitrile (ADN) process, which is used in
nylon-66 commercial manufacture. The present limitation that exists for
commercial producers of ADN is corrosion of the mild steel anode. In addition to
selectivity and efficiency losses, anode corrosion causes the
electrohydrodimerization (EHD) process to be periodically shut down to remove
iron products from the system. ADN producers consider minimizing anode corrosion
to be the top priority for future EHD development.
