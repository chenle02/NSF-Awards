ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Zelevinsky, Andrei Proposal Number: DMS - 0801187
Institution: Northeastern University Title: Polyhedral combinatorics in
representation theory and algebraic geometry

The proposed research focuses on cluster algebras, a class of commutative rings
discovered by the PI in collaboration with S. Fomin. This theory arose as an
attempt to create an algebraic framework for the study of two classical fields:
theory of total positivity, and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups.
Since its inception, the theory of cluster algebras found a number of exciting
connections and applications: quiver representations, preprojective algebras,
Calabi-Yau algebras and categories, Seiberg dualities, discrete integrable
systems, Poisson geometry, etc. The PI explores the structural properties of
cluster algebras, and their connections and applications. He also develops the
theory of quivers with potentials and their representations, motivated among
other things, by the theory of superpotentials in theoretical physics. One of
the main instruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics.

This project has roots in two classical areas of mathematics: representation
theory and the theory of total positivity. Representation theory is a
mathematical approach to studying symmetry; more specifically, it encodes the
symmetry properties of various physical and biological systems that occur in
nature. Total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (square arrays of
numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers. Both theories
find numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other sciences, as well as
in other mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation theory serves as the
mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major
tool for explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. During the last decade,
deep connections were found between the two fields, and the scope of their
applications was greatly extended. This project explores the modern framework of
representation theory and total positivity, with the goal of making its
formalism more explicit and understandable.
