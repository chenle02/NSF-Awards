We live in a world made of diverse materials whose variations in appearance
enrich our visual experience. It is also this variability of materials that adds
daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to
establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual
understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this
challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid
physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular,
spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and
passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that
govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods
that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to
guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a
comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world
images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted
metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat
content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft,
hard, rough, and heavy.

The capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of
scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should
not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what
regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical
diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard
quality food to prevent ill-health. The PIs work with research groups in these
specific application areas to closely integrate the results from this project
into their efforts. The results from this research are also broadly disseminated
via publications, websites, databases, new courses and symposiums.
