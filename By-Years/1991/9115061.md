The supernova explosion of a massive star provides a rich variety of information
to us about the production of new heavy elements in the Universe. To interpret
this information from spectroscopic and light variability observations requires
an understanding of how various atomic ions are excited by both light absorbed
from the supernova and collisions of electrons; this general subject is known as
non-LTE physics. The PI has spent a year in Munich to adapt the world's most
sophisticated non-LTE computer program for dynamic atmospheres of hot stars to
the context of the supernova explosion problem. This work has resulted in an
improved ability to compute synthetic spectra based only on input physics and to
attempt to match these predictions with observed spectra. This work is expected
to greatly improve our understanding the nucleosynthetic history of heavy
elements both just prior to and during the supernova explosion. Eventually, this
effort will lead to an understanding of the origin of the heavy elements (e.g.
iron) that are major constituents of the Earth.
