9352746 Ganezer We have drawn upon our research and teaching experience in
Particle and Nuclear physics to formulate an upper division laboratory. It is
designed to prepare students for careers in academic and industrial research in
subatomic physics. Specific emphasis is placed upon providing students with a
thorough practical and up-to-date background in Particle and Nuclear physics.
The program is designed for a small department with limited infrastructure. It
will complement and enhance a student assisted research program. ***
