Plutons and their wallrocks are an interrelated system in which the regional
strain field and physical condition of the wallrock influence pluton ascent and
emplacement, while the heat, fluids and local strain field of the rising magma
in turn influence wallrock deformation. This project will attempt to better
under- stand this interrelationship by study of magmatic strains, structures and
kinematics in three spatially related plutons in the Sierra Nevada and in the
adjacent wallrocks. The data obtained will yield insight into the nature of
pluton ascent and emplacement in large volume magmatic arcs, and is expected to
be applicable to continental magmatic arcs in general.
