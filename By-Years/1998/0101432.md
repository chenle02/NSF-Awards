With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division and the Solid-State Chemistry Program in the Division of
Materials Research support the ongoing work of Dr. George Whitesides in the
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. The work will explore the self-assembly of components at the
meso-scale (micrometers to centimeters in size), using strategies modeled on
molecular self-assembly. The work will be extended to smaller size, more complex
topography (including 3D), and include electrical and optical functionality. It
will explore the value of molecular and biomolecular concepts and analogies for
the design of meso-scale, self-assembling systems, including analogues of bubble
raft assemblies developed for condensed matter
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work at the meso-scale bridges the gap
between devices with components at normal scale (cm) with those at the molecular
level (nm), using concepts from chemistry and biology. The work is expected to
develop new methods to prepare tiny electronic and optical devices that are
difficult or impossible to make by current methods. Because of its
interdisciplinary nature, it is expected to provide excellent training for the
students involved.
