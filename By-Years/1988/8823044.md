This research is a continuation of a study of two recently discovered active
hydrothermal fields on the mid-Atlantic ridge. The principal focus is the TAG
mound at 26 N. This is the largest active field observed on the seafloor and has
the dimensions and grade of a major ore deposit. This field will be sampled
thoroughly in order to characterize the various water types and to evaluate
their role in the formation, growth, and evolution of the ore deposit. The
southern field, "Snake Pit" in the MARK area 23 N will be sampled to study its
temporal evolution. An attempt will be made to locate the ODP holes to find out
if they had any effect on the hydrothermal circulation.
