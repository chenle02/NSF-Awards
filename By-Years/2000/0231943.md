&lt;br/&gt;NCTM's standards impact research group proposes a research catalyst
conference designed to make progress on understanding the improvement of
mathematics teaching and learning. They will attend to this by hosting a
conference around key questions related to the impact, implementation and
influence of standards in schools (and the related instruction, instructional
materials, assessment, teacher education, and policy issues that follow). The
second intent of the conference is to build and strengthen the possibility for
interdisciplinary research in mathematics education. Consequently, invitees to
the conference will represent many and varied disciplines (including but not
limited to: mathematics, mathematics education, sociology, measurement, and
policy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
