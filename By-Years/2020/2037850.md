This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative: National
Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center). The focus of a spectrum
research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming
systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States
leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science
and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum. In
the last 30 years, most Americans have gone from having no personal wireless
devices to, today, possessing five to ten in a given household. The resulting
spectrum congestion requires a paradigm shift in the way in which spectrum use
is researched, managed, shared, secured, and maintained. Wireless systems of the
future must be adaptive and reconfigurable at all levels, allowing real-time
modifications to policy, spectrum usage, geographic region usage, arrays, and
devices to facilitate coexistence of disparate wireless systems. This project
will enlist a complete leadership team and form a leadership structure for an
SII Center proposal; design a complete research roadmap; and build a complete,
engaged roster of committed collaborators connecting the research with
governmental, regulatory, and industrial processes that will ensure the Centerâ€™s
innovations move forward. The work will also include development of an
undergraduate spectrum engineering course and a graduate course that will be
implemented at five partner universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
focuses on the theme of adaptive and reconfigurable spectrum use. Nine key
research areas will include: (1) real-time spectrum sharing approaches and
algorithms between disparate wireless systems, (2) 5G, 6G, 7G wireless spectrum
needs, (3) adaptive and reconfigurable radar systems, (4) critical passive
systems, (5) propagation assessment and validation for interference mitigation,
(6) reconfigurable circuits and electronics, (7) algorithms for adaptive
systems, circuitry, and arrays, (8) security of spectrum-sharing wireless
systems, and (9) social, political, governmental, and regulatory aspects of
spectrum assignment and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
