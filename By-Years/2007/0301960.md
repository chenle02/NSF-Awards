The goal of this proposal is to explore a nanoscale amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)
thin film transistor (TFT) prepared at a temperature of 250C or below. The
success of this kind of device is critical to many future electronic,
optoelectronic, biomedical devices, and circuits. We propose to investigate the
feasibility of constructing such a functional TFT and to study its device
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, an a-Si:H TFT is mainly used
for low-speed applications, such as in displays, imagers, and sensors, because
of its low field-effect mobility. However, the cut off frequency of the
transistor is inversely proportional to the square of the channel length.
Therefore, the operation frequency of a nanoscale a-Si:H TFT, e.g., channel
length less than 0.2 micrometer, can easily be higher than 1 MHz, which opens
many new and advanced applications. We will investigate the feasibility of
fabricating the nanoscale a-Si:H TFT. The TFT will have a self-aligned n +
structure that is formed by the selective deposition or plasma doping method.
The complete TFT will be characterized with respect to variations of the a-Si:H
layer thickness and deposition processes. All experiments and electrical
characterizations will be done in the principal investigators (PIs) Thin Film
Microelectronics Research Laboratory, which is equipped with state-of-the-art
instruments and facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-disciplinary
research project. Graduate and undergraduate students of under-represented
groups will be actively recruited to participate in the project. Students will
obtain working knowledge and experience of nanoscale transistor fabrication,
device characterization, and nano thickness thin film materials and
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
