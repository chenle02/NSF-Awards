This project provides international travel support the principal investigator's
participation of a meeting in Kyoto, Japan on multilateral investigations on the
use of high strength concrete in construction. The meeting is organized by
Professor Fumio Watanabe of Kyoto University. The objectives of the joint
research are: (1) exchange of technical information on higher strength concrete,
(2) develop theoretical as well as experimental research, (3) study the seismic
performance of structures using such high performance materials and (4)
establish rational design guidelines of such structures. High-strength concrete,
with its superior properties to the conventional concrete, has a good potential
for extensive applications in buildings and other civil infrastructure systems
in the future.
