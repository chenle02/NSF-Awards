This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,
University of Tennessee, directed by Dr. John E. Bartmess. Eight students will
participate each year over the next three years in an ten-week summer program.
The students will be selected from non-Ph. D. granting colleges and universities
in the East and will be able to choose from a variety of research topics across
the fields of modern chemistry. A weekly lecture and seminar series will be
given by scientists from both the University of Tennessee (UTK) and Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL) and will also introduce participants to issues
dealing with scientific ethics. This REU program will run in conjunction with
the comparable Science Alliance Summer Fellowship Program at UTK and ORNL as
well as a Chemistry Division-supported program for visiting faculty from
primarily undergraduate institutions. Students will be required to report
research results in both written and oral presentations
