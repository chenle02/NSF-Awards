In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Shelton of the University of
Nevada Las Vegas will conduct a series of nonlinear laser light scattering
experiments to probe the structure of molecular liquids. Contrary to the
generally accepted view that intermolecular position and orientation
correlations in liquids extend at most a few molecular diameters, second-
harmonic light scattering reveals molecular orientation correlation at distances
of tens to hundreds of molecular diameters in many liquids. The polarization
dependence of second harmonic light scattering provides a uniquely sensitive
probe of long-range polar molecular order. This study aims to measure the
strength, range and form of the long-range molecular orientation correlations in
liquids, and to gain an understanding of the origin and consequences of these
correlations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquids and systems of nanometer scale are
of wide importance and current interest in physics, chemistry and biology. A
wide range of basic and applied chemical research will be impacted by the
results of this investigation of previously unobserved structure at the
nanometer scale in many common liquids including water. Graduate and
undergraduate students will participate in this research, and will be trained in
state-of-the-art laser light scattering techniques.
