Project studies the deep structure of mountain belts, using seismic earthquake
techniques. Investigates evidence for concentrated downwelling of mantle
material beneath the active mountain ranges. Measures mean S wave time delays
from earthquakes in Asia to stations at teleseismic distances to map low
velocity zone under Tibet, and also in Tien Shan. Project utilizes synthetic
seismograms of P and SH phases to constrain fault solutions. Project quantifies
the mantle velocity structure in the asian region.
