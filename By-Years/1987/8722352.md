They plan a number of projects which aim at increasing their understanding of
surface and interfacial magnetism and, at the same time, laying a foundation for
the development of new magnetic materials which might prove important in data
storage applications. They intend to continue their work on
(110)iron/(111)silver heterostructures and superlattices, taking full advantage
of their RHEED facilities. In all cases it is necessary to do careful studies to
determine whether clean, epitaxial interfaces, without significant alloying can
be produced. They have shown that they can produce excellent silver substrates
in their MBE apparatus by deposition of silver on polished silver single
crystals. They can now do Conversion- Electron Mossbauer spectroscopy on such
heterostructure samples. They also propose to use their MBE system to grow
superconducting copper perovskites on appropriate single crystal substrates.
They expect to use a multiple cell effusion system which also permits oxygen
effusion. They hope to be able to produce films which may depart from the normal
1-2-3 phase and which show significantly enhanced Tc over the bulk samples which
they now grow. Attention will be paid to the development of thin film ceramic
technology important to the application of these materials as sensors and
superconducting computer elements. Doping of samples with 57iron to permit
Mossbauer spectroscopic examination of the copper sites is also planned.
