The Department of Chemistry is in its sixth year of a strategic plan to
modernize its academic laboratory capabilities. Recent modernization includes
conversion of the organic laboratories to the microscale. The most limiting
deficiency in the program had been the lack of NMR instrumentation with carbon
13 capabilities. This project allowed for the acquisition of a NMR that has a)
facilitated student hands-on experiences in the second- semester microscale
organic chemistry, b) allowed the creation of an advanced-level microscale
organic laboratory program, c) facilitated the development of new microscale
organic chemistry experiments which are utilized in the program, and d) improved
junior-level biochemistry and instrumental analysis laboratory offerings. The
institution is contributing to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
