The three week physical chemistry workshop is being conducted for 20
undergraduate physical chemistry instructors. Its goal is to introduce the
participants to modern computational chemistry, state to state reaction
dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, physical chemistry of surfaces, and the
principles and applications of superconductors. Each participant is committed to
implementing aspects of the summer workshop during the following academic year
and to reporting on the implementation to fellow participants and to the project
director.
