Understanding the tectonic framework across the West Antarctic Rift system is
critical for deciphering the evolution of the Pacific margin of Gondwana; for
understanding the characteristics of wide and narrow modes of continental
extension; and for determining the geological controls on the dynamics of the
West Antarctic ice sheet, the globe's last great "marine" ice sheet. This award
supports an integrated geophysical experiment including airborne radar and
surface altimetry augmented by satellite imagery, in addition to airborne
gravity and aeromagnetic measurements within a carefully chosen West Antarctic
corridor. This corridor covers the western portion of the Byrd Subglacial Basin
and the easternmost portion of the Interior Ross Embayment. The experimental
objectives will be achieved by imaging the tectonic fabric across the West
Antarctic Rift system and characterizing the distribution of sedimentary basins,
volcanic rocks and important ice dynamical boundaries within this corridor.
