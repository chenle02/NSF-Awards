The purpose of this grant is to partially support the publication of the
proceedings of the 13th International Colloquium on Dynamics of Explosions and
Reactive Systems, to be held July, 1991, in Nagoya, Japan. The colloquium deals
with the interrelationship between rate processes of energy deposition in
compressible media and their flow field, and with the nonsteady coupling between
the flow system and the exothermic reactions in the course of combustion. Papers
will be focused on nonideal detonation phenomena, dust explosions, physical
vapor explosions, explosion safety, ignition dynamics, chemical and dynamical
flame effects, reactive compressible shear layers and heterogeneous combustion.
The Colloquium meets biannually and is an international forum of detonation and
fluid dynamics. The publication of the Proceedings, in English, makes a valuable
contribution to the world literature in these important technological areas.
