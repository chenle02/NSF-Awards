This CAREER project combines a research component--designing a practical
approach to program termination verification that includes both theoretical
study and actual implementation--with an educational component--undertaking the
enhancement, for both undergraduates and graduates, of programming language
education. The research on termination verification recognizes that, in
practice, the programmer often knows for some reasons that a particular program
should terminate if implemented correctly and would therefore find great value
in a termination checker able to detect program errors that cause non-
terminating program execution. Unfortunately, termination checking in a
programming language that supports general recursion is often prohibitively
expensive. In order to design a termination checker for practical use, the
project explores some recent results on the use of dependent types in practical
programming, allowing the programmer to encode into dependent types the metrics
needed for ensuring program termination and then use type-checking to verify
that the provided metrics indeed suffice. The research focuses on providing a
mechanism that truly can be applied in practice.
