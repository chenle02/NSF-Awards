The proposed research by PI Deanna Kingston, Oregon State University, is an in-
depth interdisciplinary project on Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) with
the community of King Island. The proposed research will document TEK of King
Island Inupiat (Eskimo) including research on the cultural geography and
biogeography of King Island. This project not only fits into a growing
literature on TEK, but also examines social science theory on place names,
memory, cultural meaning, and geography. In addition, the researcher proposes to
train young King Island community members, who are by definition from an
underrepresented minority group, in social and biological scientific methods of
data collection and analysis. In this way the PI hopes to stimulate the interest
of young Inupiat in scientific careers.
