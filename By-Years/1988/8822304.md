Understanding the dynamics of cultural transmission can illuminate the means by
which cultures maintain themselves or change over time. This dissertation
research will apply a new body of theory, gene-culture coevolution, to an
investigation of cultural transmission of a significant trait, food avoidances.
Coevolutionary models are an extension of population genetic models reflecting
the characteristics of cultural as opposed to genetic transmission. The Lese,
horticulturalists of the Ituri Forest, Zaire, are relatively isolated from mass
media, making cultural transmission among them a matter of inter-personal
contact -- and ideal situation for this kind of study. The investigator will
interview 300 individuals to elicit their set of food avoidances and food-
related beliefs. He will infer how individuals learn their food avoidances by
estimating mathematical transmission models using this information. He will also
test other hypotheses from the literature concerning the functions of food
avoidances. This research is important because it will test a theory of cultural
transmission by applying the theory to non-Western people. The knowledge gained
from this project will help us understan how cultures are reproduced over time
and the adaptive significance of the pattern of reproduction.
