This award will support an observational project that combines infrared
interferometric imaging with spectroscopic techniques to probe the latitude
dependence and size distribution of spot/spot groups on active stars.
Observations will be performed using the Georgia State University (GSU) Center
for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometer, an NSF-supported
six-telescope optical array on Mt. Wilson, California. This group will make use
of the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC), a facility instrument built by this
group that will be upgraded from 4-beam to 6-beam operation in time for this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to shed light on the
relationship between rotation, magnetic fields, and stellar activity in cool
stars. Such phenomena are well-studied on the Sun, but have not been
investigated in great detail in other stars.
