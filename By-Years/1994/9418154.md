9418154 Chamberlain This project is part of a multidisciplinary study of the
Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Massif of the northwestern Himalaya, Pakistan. The
Principal Investigators wish to assess the recent and still-active processes
responsible for an extraordinary episode of very young high-grade metamorphism,
partial melting, high strain, and rapid denudation focused around the center of
Nanga Parbat. Their ultimate goal is to exploit the excellent exposures and
access to active tectonic processes offered by Nanga Parbat to understand the
mesoscale interaction between petrological and mechanical processes during
collisional orogenesis. To accomplish these goals they propose to integrate a
wide variety of measurements made using techniques of geochronology, petrology,
stable-isotope geochemistry, radiogenic tracer-isotope geochemistry, seismology,
magnetotelluric sounding, structural geology, and geomorphology, and then place
their results into a geodynamic context. ***
