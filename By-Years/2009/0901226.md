Doron Zeilberger proposes to continue to develop methodologies for harnessing
the great potential of Computer Algebra to do research in Combinatorics and
related areas, and design experiments for (rigorous) computer-assisted and
computer-generated research. In particular he hopes to develop a new, computer-
assisted and computer-generated phase, in the theory of permutation statistics;
explore seemingly intractable problems in combinatorial statistical physics from
the point of view of symbolic, rather than numeric, computations; study lattice
paths enumeration, and extend the Wilf-Zeilberger algorithmic proof theory to
handle indefinitely many variables. He also hopes to tackle the intriguing
Razumov-Stroganov conjecture about so-called Fully Packed Loops, that are in
simple bijection with Alternating Sign Matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research should be symbiotic, as it is expected that both the concrete results
and the underlying methodologies, would help computer algebra developers to
improve and enhance their systems. It is also hoped that this research will
contribute to the budding field of Experimental Mathematics, in that it will
help develop a research methodology for conducting computer experiments that
output rigorous (and interesting!) mathematical theorems (and proofs), rather
than just verifying and formulating conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is in the field of Combinatorics, whose usefulness to science and
technology is well-known. In particular, computer science is largely based on
combinatorics, as is electronic communication and the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;
