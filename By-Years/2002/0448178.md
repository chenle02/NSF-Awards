&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the need to increase the
reliability of software by continual analysis. One important approach to
ensuring system correctness is model checking, in which the verification task is
largely automatic and requires minimal user input. Though model checking has
been successfully applied in practice, there are a couple of challenges that
have limited its applicability. First, the representation of the system that the
model checker analyzes is typically very large for most practical systems; this
is often called the state space explosion problem. The second is that model
checkers analyze a formal model of system which is often unavailable or
difficult to construct. In this project, the PI plans to address these
challenges by integrating ideas from computational learning theory and
randomized algorithms to develop model checking algorithms with provably formal
guarantees that can analyze black box systems within available computational
resources.
