Abstract Kasparov

The main objective of this project are applications of operator K-theory to a
number of well known problems in topology, harmonic analysis and index theory.
These problems are the Novikov conjecture on higher signatures of smooth
manifolds, the Baum-Connes conjecture in K-theory of group C*-algebras, the
problem of multiplicities of automorphic forms, index theory for transversally
elliptic operators. Operator K-theory has its origins in the index theory of
elliptic operators, and it is most natural to study elliptic operators,
including transversally elliptic operators, using operator K-theory. Also
operator K-theory is a very suitable tool in applications related to geometric
group actions, which makes it exceptionally useful for problems like the Novikov
and the Baum-Connes conjectures. Multiplicities of automorphic forms is another
topic where operator K-theory gives new approaches to old problems.

The development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century has led to the creation
of the theory of operators in Hilbert space and later to the creation of the
theory of C*-algebras. The theory of C*-algebras is closely related with the
contemporary field theory in physics, as well as with geometry, topology, Lie
group representation theory, etc. Operator K-theory came to the C*-algebra
theory from topology and grew out into a highly powerful tool. Nowadays,
operator K-theory is part of the non-commutative geometry which is a synthesis
of analysis and geometry with wide applications in many areas of mathematics and
theoretical physics. The emphasis of the present project is on the applications
of operator K-theory to several well known problems in analysis and topology.
