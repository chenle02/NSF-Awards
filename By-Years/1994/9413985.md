9413985 Hauri This award provides partial funding for the acquisition and
installation of an ion microprobe system to be operated in the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie
Institution of Washington (CIW) is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for the project. The new ion microprobe facility will be operated by
CIW as a multi-user facility, open to qualified scientists in the mid-Atlantic
region and beyond. The ion microprobe's capabilities for microanalysis of
chemical elements and isotopes with excellent three- dimensional spatial
resolution will be devoted primarily to research in the fields of solid earth
geochemistry, cosmochemistry, experimental chemistry, and high-pressure
materials science. ***
