The NAS-NRC sponsored Plasma Science Committee will organize a study panel
consisting of members with expertise and experience in a wide range of
scientific fields, which will address: - the health of plasma science in the
United States; - selected new opportunities for research and application to
technological advances; - the plasma science community short-term and long-range
goals; and - evaluation of these goals in the context of national needs and
broader issues related to the health of the scientific infrastructure. The
findings of the panel, including recommendations to federal agencies, will be
incorporated as an NRC report, subject to NAS-NRC standards for impartiality and
publication.
