The discovery of endemic communities at deep-sea hydrothermal vents has
promoted the question of how these species are able to persist over evolutionary
time in isolated, ephemeral vent habitats. One possibility is that larvae and
early juveniles of benthic invertebrates are entrained into the buoyant
hydrothermal plumes emanating from vents, and are transported to remote vent
habitats in lateral plumes, several hundreds of meters above the seafloor. Dr.
Mullineaux and associates will examine this hypothesis by sampling larval
distributions in hydrothermal plumes and by using hydrodynamic models to predict
larval dispersal dynamics. Hydrothermal plumes may also transport reduced
substrates (e.g. manganese, iron, methane), microbes, and vent-dwelling
zooplankton up into planktonic communities several hundred meters above the
seafloor. These scientists will investigate whether zooplankton assimilate
chemosynthetically-derived resources, by characterizing their carbon and
nitrogen isotopic composition, and by examining their guts for presence of vent-
derived mineral precipitates. If the injection of chemosynthetically-fixed
carbon into the water column enriches the food resources at level of the lateral
plume, then they should find evidence of elevated zooplankton biomass and
altered species composition in the plume.
