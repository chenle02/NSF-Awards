The purpose of this workshop is to bring together the best minds in materials
technology and optoelectronics in order to identify key technical road blocks in
the eventual fabrication of III-IV semiconductor optoelectronic integrated
circuits (OEICs). Once these problems have been identified, solutions to them
will be solicited. The scope of the workshop is international, covering
government, industrial and university research and is by invitation (in order to
keep the attendance low and hence resulting in an atmosphere more open for
discussion). The sessions are expected to be informal with round table
discussion and moderator-lead debates. Attendees are expected to participate
actively with opportunity for attendees to speculate. The workshop is NOT
designed simply to be a review of current technology. Discussion, exchange of
opinions or ideas, debate, brain storming and candor are expected. Formal
presentations are discouraged. Two reports will be written: 1) a more completed
summary of the workshop for NSF consumption and 2) an abbreviated version which
deals in more general terms (deleting reference to individuals) for publication
is recognized journal such as "Applied Optics." The value of this workshop in
expected to be extremely high in terms of technological progress and U.S. future
competitiveness in high tech industry.
