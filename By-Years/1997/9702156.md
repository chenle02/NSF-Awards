9702156 Taleff The engineering of economical, enhanced-ductility aluminum alloys
requires significant advancements in understanding of three scientific areas,
which are the principal research goals of this grant. These goals are to create
a quantitative, predictive understanding of the following: (1) the effects which
ternary solute additions in Al--Mg materials have on the solute-drag creep
deformation mechanism; (2) the nucleation and growth of cavities during solute-
drag creep as a function of particulate content and solute chemistry; and (3)
the tensile ductility in materials subjected to deformation by solute--drag
creep through a better understanding of the mechanisms of necking and
cavitation, which govern ductility. The CAREER educational activities consist of
four fundamental goals, as follows: (1) a unique instructional approach for
undergraduates in the mechanical behavior of materials by incorporating lectures
on materials theory with hands-on laboratory activities; (2) unique graduate
courses in the mechanical behavior of various classes of materials which utilize
research experience and data as educational examples; (3) incorporation of
undergraduate students into scientific and engineering research as a significant
enhancement to their educations; and (4) the scientific education of high-school
students through association with existing mentoring, outreach, and University
programs. %%% Success of this research activity is expected to have significant
long-term effects in manufacturing. The creation of economical, enhanced-
ductility aluminum alloys will significantly decrease the price of superplastic
forming as a manufacturing alternative. ***
