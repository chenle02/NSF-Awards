Increasingly, automated economic transaction systems in eBay, Google and other
institutions negotiate, buy and sell goods, services, advertisements etc. They
use auctions to make decisions including pricing, allocation and optimization.
As a result, we now have auctions systems far greater in scale than the
traditional "human scale" of negotiations and specialized auctions, and they
impact our lives in sophisticated ways. These systems face many algorithmic
challenges in the interface of Economics, Learning Theory, and Optimization,
which is the focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
researchers will (a) design and analyze models for the various parties (users,
auctioneer, buyer and seller) and their impact on the auctions; (b) design and
analyze mechanisms in the presence of parties with mixed utilities that go
beyond the traditional linear profit; (c) quantify impacts of budgets in
mechanisms on truthfulness, equilibria and utilities, which has been
traditionally underemphasized; (d) study the effect of bounded computational
power and rationality on mechanisms; (e) design richer mechanisms for futures,
combinatorial goods as well as dynamic settings; (f) study privacy, security and
verifiability of auction mechanisms; (g) study the various learning and
optimization problems that are fundamental to the tasks
above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project ultimately addresses the questions of
how various parties with natural knobs (budget, utility) interact with automated
economic transaction systems, how information is learned, used and controlled in
such systems, and how these systems will evolve over the long term. The project
explores these questions via the specific research tasks above, as well as via
training undergraduate and graduate students to work in the interface of
Economics, Optimization and other areas.&lt;br/&gt;
