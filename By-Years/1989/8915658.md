This special award will give graduate student Phillip Atkison additional
flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and research initiation in
sociology. The award will be used to facilitate the collection of archival data
on national economies, particularly related to their exports, as part of a
larger study of the social, political and economic determinants of a nation's
relative position within the world economic system. This award grows out of a
special directorate level program to enhance the graduate education of previous
applicants of minority fellowship programs receiving honorable mention ratings.
This award should strengthen minority research participation in sociology.
