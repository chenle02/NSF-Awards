9531316 Popovici This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
develop and test computational software that offers the same accuracy as full
3-D prestack migration at a much lower cost. Applying prestack depth migration
to 3-D seismic information is the main computational challenge facing the oil
industry today. Cheaper and faster 3-D prestack imaging methods could open up
new exploration venues in extremely complicated geological conditions such as
those that exist in the overthrust region of the Western United States and below
layers of salt in the Gulf of Mexico. The novel imaging algorithm migrates
seismic data to a common offset in a laterally-variable velocity earth, and can
simplify 3-D prestack depth migration, reduce the number of calculations, and
overcome the problems associated with manipulating very large prestack data
volumes. The end result of this research effort is a migration to common-offset
(MCO) algorithm that can be used to process the two main types of seismic data:
marine and land. For marine datasets, MCO coherently stacks data along several
azimuths, and is followed by common-azimuth migration for final imaging. For
land datasets, MCO coherently stacks data for a predetermined number of vector
offsets (fixed azimuth and offset length) and is followed by 3-D Kirchhoff
migration for imaging the reduced size dataset. The new MCO algorithm is of
interest to oil companies and oil-field contractors. The proposed method better
delineates the oil field structure and is used in oil exploration and reservoir
monitoring and characterization. Both the oil companies that process seismic
data in-house and the dataprocessing contractors would benefit from such a
method because it allows sophisticated detailed processing at a much lower cost
and over a shorter time frame.
