9614783 Wyss This research involves testing and development of the hypothesis
that the b-value, the Gutenberg-Richter earthquake frequency magnitude
distribution, is significantly different in crustal volumes associated with
volcanic magma chambers. Small volumes (radii of 1 to 3 km) with high b-values
of about 1.7 are embedded in background activity in the crust with b-values of
about 0.8. Under several volcanos, where the locations of magma chambers are
known from other evidence, the crustal volumes with anomalously high b-values
map out the magma chambers. This work involves the testing of this hypothesis
and the investigation of other possible causes of high b-values such as active
dikes and magma vesiculation along with their associated temporal variations.
