Title: Ionic polarized polymer light-emitting diodes fabricated by ink-jet
printing technology Conjugate polymers are a novel class of semiconductor
materials that combine the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors
with advantages of simple processing and flexible mechanical properties of
polymers. Due to its low cost and ease of fabrication this unique class of
materials will revolutionize many existing electronics and bio-medical
technologies. This CAREER proposal will engage in research and education
activities to lay down the foundation for a consolidated polymer electronics
research center at UCLA. In particular, the research is aimed developing new and
novel polymer light-emitting diodes using an innovative ink-jet printing
technique. the particular innovation of this proposal is the novel and
potentially low-cost fabrication of large-area displays.
