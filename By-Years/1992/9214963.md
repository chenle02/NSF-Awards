This project investigates computer technology in of the representation and
manipulation of mathematical notation by the computer. The long-term goal is to
produce a consistent and constructive representation of a substantial, useful
class of engineering and applied mathematics, driven the needs of significant
applications. Key issues to examine include the use of multiple representations,
and the encoding of geometric, algebraic, logical, algorithmic, and physical
relations in symbolic mathematical computation. The specific topics to study
include: (1) developing new algorithms and representations for manipulation of
functions of a complex variable correctly and with some generality (In
particular both correct manipulations and proofs in analysis must account for
branch cuts.), (2) providing a computing framework for dealing with mathematical
derivations, theorem proving, and manipulation, (3) providing a practical
approach to a bounded-time version of the zero-equivalence problem for algebraic
expressions, and (4) exploring of parallel algorithms for basic polynomial
algorithms and pattern-directed transformations.
