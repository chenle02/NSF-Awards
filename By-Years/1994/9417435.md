9417435 Jain ABSTRACT UCSD MS Program in World Class Manufacturing Engineering
The University of California, San Diego proposes to create a 2-year MS Program
World Class Manufacturing Engineering with a strong international and
information systems focus. In partnerships with ALCOA Electronic Packaging,
Hewlett-Packard, Hughes Aircraft, and TITAN Linkabit, it is targeted toward
displaced defense engineers, particularly women and minorities. Aiming to take
advantage of manufacturing and management strengths overseas, the program has a
unique emphasis on foreign language and culture learning (approximately 50% of
the students) and includes a 9-month internship in a manufacturing firm in the
U.S. or abroad. With good support from institutions with strong international
studies program, it expects a steady state of 30 students per year with
expansion in later years to feed in undergraduates. ***
