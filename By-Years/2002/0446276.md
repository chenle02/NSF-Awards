Numerous studies have shown that prey tend to avoid areas with higher predation
risk, and conversely, that predators tend to prefer areas with more prey. These
are conflicting responses. Surprisingly few studies have looked at spatial
outcomes when both predators and prey are free to respond to the other.
Responses of prey and predator could be positively correlated, negatively
correlated, or show no correlation. Gaining a better understanding of this
'predator-prey space game' is an area of major importance for behavioral ecology
that should yield useful insights for predator-prey population and community
ecology. This project will involve empirical studies and a modeling framework
using genetic algorithms to incorporate complex aspects of reality into
predator-prey games. A series of experiments on space games involving Pacific
treefrog tadpoles, Hyla regilla, and their predators (salamander larvae,
dragonfly larvae) will include experimental and statistical methods to yield new
insights that guide further theory. The project will involve a complex setup of
experimental ponds of predators and prey to quantify the relationship between
space use and predation risk and predator reward.

Broader Impacts. The proposed project will continue the PIs record of training
by involving a postdoctoral associate, 2 graduate student RAs and 2 or more
undergraduate researchers each year. Every effort will be made to recruit women
and minorities into these positions. Because the project includes modeling,
fieldwork, and controlled experiments, trainees will gain an appreciation of the
benefits of integrating a range of techniques. The results should yield valuable
insights for many applied ecological issues (e.g., biocontrol, fisheries,
conservation biology). Project participants will actively disseminate results at
conferences, research seminars, and in publications. Past work from this lab has
been widely cited in the academic literature, and has been featured in several
textbooks, newspaper articles and an occasional interview.
