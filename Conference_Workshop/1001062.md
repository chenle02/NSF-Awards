Mathematics abounds with examples of cross-fertilisation between traditionally
seperate disciplines. One of the most striking is surely the profound
interaction between number theory and representation theory.In its modern
incarnation, this interaction has led to notable advances in the arithmetic of
elliptic curves (such as the proofs of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, the
Sato-Tate conjecture, and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic
curves of analytic rank at most one) and has been instrumental in fleshing out a
unifying vision connecting arithmetic objects (Galois representations, and
motives) to analytic ones (automorphic forms and representations). The time is
appropriate to reflect on the flurry of recent developments at the interface
between number theory and representation theory, particularly those related to
the Gross-Zagier formula.

The conference should help greatly in introducing graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers to these important areas of mathematics, thereby enhancing
collective expertise in a branch of mathematical science which is of great
importance for a modern information-based economy. It should also help
established researchers more fully appreciate the connections between work in
different parts of this domain. The conference will hopefully produce a list of
interesting open problems in the area which may inspire future research.
