This project focuses on the development of children's interpretations of
patterns and variability in data; and their elaboration of key concepts involved
in this process, uncertainty, chance, and causality. The data the children
interpret are data they themselves have collected in the context of
investigations in science. this focus is strategic from a number of
perspectives. It accords with the NCTM's concerns to transform the practice of
mathematics education into a more concept-oriented and applied domain. More
specifically, it fits with how the NCTM recommends teachers begin informal study
of statistics and probability in the early grades: engaging children in data
collection, data representation, and data interpretation, in conjunction with
their exploration of concepts of chance. This research agenda simultaneously
addresses a growing concern within this field of science education that, as far
as possible given developmental constraints, children's science instruction
should accord with the nature of scientific inquiry.
