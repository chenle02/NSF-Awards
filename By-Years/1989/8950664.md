The project will improve the advanced undergraduate laboratory course by adding
a group of experiments in calorimetry and transport properties at low
temperatures. The project will provide students an opportunity to employ current
computer technology for on-line data acquisition analysis using modern
instrumentation. Students will also learn vacuum techniques, and perform
experiments that yield significant physical results.
