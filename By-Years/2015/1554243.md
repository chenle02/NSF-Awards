Advances in high-throughput technologies such as DNA sequencing and mass
spectrometry are profoundly transforming life sciences, resulting in the
collection of unprecedented amounts of biological and medical data. Using this
data to advance our knowledge about fundamental biological processes and improve
human health requires novel computational models and advanced analysis
algorithms. IEEE ICCABS (International Conference on Computational Advances in
Bio and Medical Sciences) aims to bring together leading academic and industry
researchers to discuss the latest advances in computational methods for bio and
medical sciences. The award would provide funding for students and junior
researchers to participate in this international meeting that covers a range of
topics from structure bioinformatics to systems biology and high performance
Biocomputing. The conference proceeding ae made available both online and in
special journal publications.
