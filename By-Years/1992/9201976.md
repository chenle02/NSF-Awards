Measuring the intrinsic cost of herbivore resistance in plants is important
both for assessing the potential for engineered genes to escape and persist in
the environment, and for understanding how natural selection acts on defense
resource allocation in natural plant populations. This study will apply two
genetic approaches to testing the cost of resistance hypothesis. First, the
impact of resistance gene on plant growth and resource allocation will be
examined by comparing the performance of plants genetically transformed for
herbivore resistance with that of control plants of similar genetic backgrounds.
This work will be done in collaboration with the PROSAMO research group at
Imperial College (Silkwood Park), headed by Dr. Michael J. Crawley. Second, the
principal investigator will test for negative genetic correlations among
chemical defenses, growth, and reproduction in the absence of herbivores, and
examine selection effects on defense production in natural populations of a
common weed (Plantago lanceolata). This work, to be done in collaboration with
Dr. Deane Bowers at the University of Colorado, will be one of the first studies
to apply quantitative genetic analysis to chemical assays of plants from natural
populations.
