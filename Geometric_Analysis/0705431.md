The PI intends to study the asymptotics of singular solutions to heat equations
which occur in Riemannian geometry, such as Ricci flow and mean curvature flow,
and also free boundary problems involving fourth order equations. Further
problems of interest to the PI are related to the formulation of the Monge-
Kantorovich mass-transfer problem, and in particular variations thereof which
may appear in medical imaging problems.

Differential Geometry and partial differential equations (PDE) play a central
role in modern science and engineering. The PI is interested both in studying
these subjects from the "pure-mathematics" point of view, and in collaborating
with engineers and scientists to find new applications of geometry and PDE to
practical problems. Particular applied areas of interest to the PI involve the
automated processing of images (brain scans, virtual colonoscopy, etc) generated
in the medical sciences.
