9311638 Rowlen This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing
Program in support of the research of Professor Kathy Rowlen at the University
of Colorado (Boulder). Support is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and
Materials Research. The research is concerned with the surface morphology and
optical properties of thin metal films, specifically silver films. Atomic force
microscopy will be used to measure surface features, absorbance will be used to
characterize plasmon resonance and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy will be
used as an indirect measure of non-linear optical properties. Surface morphology
will be characterized by the distribution about a mean for particle height,
width, aspect ratio, and interparticle distance. These surface measurements will
be used to test existing theory for the relationship between surface morphology
and optical properties. %%% Thin metal films have become increasingly important
in a variety of materials areas such as solar cells, electronic components and
non-linear optical systems. These studies will elucidate the role of substrate
on the surface morphology and ultimate properties of the films. ***
