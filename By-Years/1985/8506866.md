A molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system will be purchased and used to grow
phosphides of the III-V semiconductor family. A new research program in MBE will
concentrate on the growth and characterization of heterojunction structures
employing thin epitaxial films of the phosphides InP, InGaP, and InA1P. The
resulting heterostructures will provide an opportunity for study of unique
heterojunction band structures as well as applications to devices requiring
III-V phosphide layers.
