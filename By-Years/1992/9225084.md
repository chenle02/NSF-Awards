The Principal Investigator will travel to London for a week to xerox the
clinical growth records of the primates at the London Zoo, which is closing. The
records may well become unavailable or lost at that time. The proposers will to
transfer the records to their primate growth data base and to analyze them
within the framework of their continuing study of the development of sexual
dimorphism in different primate species. This is a timely and important project.
Sexual dimorphism is once again an interesting topic in evolutionary studies,
and it is being tied to different mating strategies or alternatively, different
diets. It is also clear that the development of sexual dimorphism (its timing
during growth, etc.) is an important dynamic that has not been adequately
addressed, where most often the focus has been on adult animals.
