1336075&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bimodal and multi-regime combustion
phenomena are common in non-premixed combustion problems, including canonical
laboratory flames and practical combustors. The goal of the study is to develop
and validate predictive models for bimodal and multi-regime combustion dynamics.
The state-of-the-art transported probability density function (PDF) approach is
employed as the modeling framework. A recently developed statistically transient
jet flame is chosen as the main target flame for the modeling and simulation.
The study will advance understanding of bimodal and multi-regime turbulent
combustion physics and should facilitate future model development and validation
for replicating these complicated combustion dynamics. The accurate and
efficient predictive models should enable design of clean combustors for
applications in transportation vehicles and propulsion systems. The proposed
work will enhance computational engineering through innovations in computational
practice and the use of cyberinfrastructure. Integration of the research results
into both undergraduate and graduate courses is aimed to enhance current
engineering curriculum.
