The investigator undertakes a theoretical and numerical study of nonlinear
interactions between waves and vortices in problems spanning several subject
areas, namely atmosphere and ocean fluid dynamics, small-scale engineering
applied to particle mixing, and the dynamics of rotating superfluids in quantum
mechanics. Project topics include energy exchanges between random waves and
vortices in the ocean, the role of wave-induced vortex structures for particle
dispersal in the deep ocean, the design and dynamics of small-scale engineering
devices to model the acoustic mixing of immersed particles, and the peculiar
fluid dynamics that attends the quantum-mechanical interactions between waves
and point vortices in rotating superfluids. A common theme of these problems is
that they involve huge separations of scale between different dynamical
components of the flows. Such separations present mathematical difficulties and
make straightforward numerical simulations impractical.

The investigator takes up several problems that involve analysis of the
interactions between waves and vortices in fluid flows: ocean fluid dynamics
relevant to climate dynamics, small-scale fluid engineering applied to acoustic
mixing, and rotating superfluids in condensed matter physics. The ocean is a
vast environment in which a multitude of dynamical components such as waves and
currents interact, and these interactions eventually determine the present ocean
state and also its future development. Our ability to predict ocean dynamics
hinges delicately on our ability to understand and to model these interactions,
because a direct computer simulation far exceeds our computational resources and
will do so for decades to come. This is so because different dynamical
components of the flows occur at vastly different scales of length or time. The
investigator mathematically and computationally studies the interactions between
waves and vortices, using modern mathematical theory to simplify and thereby to
reduce the complexity of the interactions that must be modelled on a computer.
Similar scale-separated interactions among dynamical components of flows are
studied in other complex systems of technological relevance, such as non-
invasive particle mixing techniques using wave engineering, and the detailed
study of superfluid behaviour that has recently become possible using
breakthroughs in laboratory technology.
