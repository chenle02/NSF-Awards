Professor Pappas will work in arithmetic geometry specifically the theory of
bad reduction of Shimura varieties concentrating on the case of Hilbert Modular
varieties. He will also study the Galois structure of DeRham cohomology groups
of arithmetic varieties. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
