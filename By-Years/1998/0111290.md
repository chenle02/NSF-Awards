ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Kempchinsky &amp; Slabakova 0111290&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
National Science Foundation supports the Workshop on Syntax, Semantics, and
Acquisition of Aspect to be held at the University of Iowa in 2002. The goal of
this workshop is to bring several intellectual threads together and to stimulate
communication across sub-disciplines of linguistics that investigate aspect.
Presenters will be selected on the basis of anonymously reviewed abstracts. The
papers of all presenters will be eligible for inclusion in an edited volume, and
the workshop findings will be disseminated on the web. &lt;br/&gt;
