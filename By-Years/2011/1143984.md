Although many trace metals, such as zinc (Zn), act as vital nutrients for marine
microorganisms, their oceanic biogeochemical cycles are poorly understood. In
this research, chemists from Arizona State University and the University of
Washington would use a suite of experimental, analytical, and computational
research to quantitatively understand the fractionation of stable Zn isotopes
that takes place on mineral surfaces in the ocean. Through advancing our
understanding of the reactions involved in Zn isotope fractionation in the
ocean, future scientists would be able to successfully apply isotopic zinc
cycling to questions of greater oceanographic interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
terms of broader impacts, this study would provide new insights into the
biogeochemical cycling of the micronutrient zinc. One graduate student and one
undergraduate student at Arizona State University would be supported and trained
as part of this project.&lt;br/&gt;
