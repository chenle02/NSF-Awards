Three workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in
the early stages of their academic career. Research and economic analyses expect
the impact of the economic crisis to be more detrimental for females than for
males. The workshops focus on strategies for maintaining visibility and
productivity, including grant application writing for predoctoral, postdoctoral,
and early career scientists, and will take place at the Psychonomic Society, the
Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological Science. The
workshops will take the form of a public forum with invited speaker-panelists to
initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of
women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. By
partnering with these established societies, the workshops will maximize the
outreach potential to a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior
academic positions in the cognitive sciences.
