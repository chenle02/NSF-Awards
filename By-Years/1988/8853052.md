This proposal requests two Hewlett Packard 4145B semiconductor parameter
analyzers and two plotters provide the base for laboratory improvement in the
area of integrated circuit design. The purposes of the laboratory improvement
are to introduce modern measurement approaches to integrated device and circuit
characterization and to improve the laboratory offerings associated with two
recently introduced courses in the integrated circuit design area. One course
emphasizes analog integrated circuit design, and the other emphasizes VLSI
subsystems design and includes their fabrication. These courses were placed
together to provide cross-fertilization between digital and analog design as
well as between MOS and bipolar technologies. The equipment will be used to
measure and plot semiconductor device parameters and the characteristics of
basic circuits such as integrated resistors, amplifiers, sources, level
shifters, logic gates, and nonlinear analog functional circuits. Input/output
and transfer characteristics will be measured for devices and circuits.
