This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I proposal will
overcome the most critical problems associated with the construction of a direct
methanol fuel cell (DMFC): complex, bulky and heavy cell structures, low fuel
efficiency, and high cost. These issues have severely impeded the successful
commercialization of DMFCs for powering portable electronic devices. A
commercially viable local vapor fuel cell (LVFC) will be developed which
features (1) an integrated system design (with a compact, light-weight, and
simple cell structure), (2) a highly efficient fuel conversion (high electro-
catalytic efficiency and low fuel crossover), and (3) low cost. The high fuel
efficiency is achieved by making the anode catalyst operate on fuel vapors at a
higher local temperature.

PEM fuel cells generate electricity from oxygen and hydrogen, and emit only
water and heat as by-products. Fuel cells offer a great combination of high
power generating efficiencies with superior environmental performance (no noise
and pollution). The fuel cell is commonly considered to be the engine that will
drive the future hydrogen economy of the US and the world.
