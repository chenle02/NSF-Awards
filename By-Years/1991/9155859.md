A Computer Environment to Encourage a Conceptual Approach to Problem Analysis We
are developing a computer-based environment called CONPSEP (Conceptual Problem
Solving Environment in Physics) aimed at helping students integrate conceptual
and quantitative knowledge within a problem solving setting. CONPSEP constrains
students to perform a qualitative analysis of physics problems based on the
principles, concepts and procedures that need to be applied to solve them. The
environment is intended to supplement traditional instruction (rather than
supplant it) by providing students with an opportunity to engage actively in
conducting expert-like problem analyses of problems. Thus, implementing CONPSEP
within the traditional introductory physics curriculum does not require major
modifications. Formative evaluations are being carried out from the beginning of
the project, and a summative evaluation will be conducted at the end of the
project. Dissemination activities include publishing and marketing the software,
as well as writing articles in educational journals and giving talks at
professional organizations.***//
