This proposal is concerned with diophantine equations in many variables, in the
context of the theory and application of the Hardy-Littlewood (circle) method.
The proposer intends to pursue a number of investigations whose goal is an
improved understanding of the existence and density of integer solutions of
systems of homogeneous equations, and associated estimates for exponential sums
of use in the circle method. Two themes play a large role in proposed
investigations. In one direction, methods familiar from the application of the
Hardy-Littlewood method to additive diophantine problems will be extended to
handle diophantine equations more closely approximating general homogeneous
equations. Here the proposers methods for handling exponential sums over binary
forms, and over smooth numbers, are significant. In a second direction, the more
elementary diagonalisation methods, originating in work of Brauer and Birch,
will be extended so as to obtain more refined conclusions concerning the density
of rational solutions to systems of diophantine equations.

Number Theory studies the properties of integers (``whole numbers''). Since
Antiquity, the study of diophantine equations (equations to be solved in
integers) has formed a core component of Number Theory, and has recently
influenced the development of codes and cryptosystems (applied, for example, in
data storage systems such as compact disks, communications systems and banking
security).
