MUSE is an integrated software package for the management of natural history
collections. Its functions include data entry, data editing, record keeping,
loan maintenance, label production, user queries and taxonomic updating. MUSE
was developed for the use of the Ichthyology Department of the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Subsequently, it has been adopted by several
other ichthyology collections, including those at the University of Michigan,
Harvard University, and Cornell University. This project will support the
continued development of MUSE for use at other institutions. Funds will be used
to enhance the program's flexibility, add additional functions, provide support
and assistance to those natural history collections that adopt MUSE, and write
documentation and manuals for the program.
