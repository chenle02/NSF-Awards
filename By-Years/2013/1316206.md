Diatoms account for approximately 40 percent of primary production in the
world's oceans and are the most productive marine phytoplankton group. They form
the basis of food webs in coastal and ocean upwelling areas that support
important fisheries and have a major role in global carbon and silicon cycles.
The goal of this project is to understand the impact of ocean acidification, in
combination with other stressors, on the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.
This project will generate a predictive model of expression of all genes of this
diatom that can be used to forecast the diatom's response to projected
environmental scenarios to an acidifying ocean. A combination of laboratory and
field studies will be used; diatoms will be grown under carbon dioxide
concentrations that reflect today's values as well as future predicted
conditions and light levels and nutrients concentrations will also be varied.
Physiological and gene expression responses will be measured and integrated
using computational and modeling methods to gain an unbiased, systems-level
understanding of the response of diatoms to ocean acidification. This combined
approach will enable the forecasting and prediction of the diatom's response to
environmental change and the elucidation and genomic interpretation of
biochemically relevant processes in natural environment. Broader impacts:
Results and the predictive model from this study can be coupled with
environmental models to forecast the role and behavior of diatoms in the
changing seas. In addition to the multidisciplinary training of a post-doctoral
fellow and a graduate student this project will engage 3 high school teachers
and their students. The investigators will continue to develop educational tools
to increase the understanding of global carbon cycles by K-12 students, a
generation that will be increasingly affected by the environmental changes that
include ocean acidification.
