Learning theory is concerned with the rigorous study of concept classes under
well- established criteria for learnability. Most of the current research
focuses on expanding the frontiers of the concept classes known to be learnable.
Two different but related models for learning are the probably approximately
correct (PAC) model and the exact learning model with equivalence and membership
queries. This project derives its motivation from recent results in exact
learning with queries and from practical considerations of limited data
available for inference. Many concept classes which are not efficiently
learnable with queries if cryptographic assumptions hold are possibly exactly
learnable in a model where considerations of time-efficiency are relaxed, but
considerations of limited data are made paramount. Such a model is formalized
along with a discussion of partial results. This project concentrates on the
reinvestigation of the learnability of natural concept classes which have been
neglected in view of known negative results. Where possible, efficient learning
algorithms are developed according to both exact and PAC criteria.
