The overall goal of this project is to investigate the effect of carbon-based
manufactures nanomaterials on the ecology and toxicity of aquatic and soil
microorganisms. The research plan include four objectives: (1) solubility
studies: behavior in natural materials, redistributions, and stability; (2)
enviro-toxicology: protocol development, aquatic bacterial response, chemical
and metabolites, estrogenecity; (3) effects: microbial biomass structure and
function, impacts; and(4) mass balance and fungal utilization. The carbon-based
nanomaterials will include fullerenes, fullerones, single-walled carbon
nanotubes, soluble nanotubes, and silver and gold doped carbon nanotubes. The
educational outreach program will concentrate on the development of modules for
K-12 students and teachers. A website will be developed and promoted to help
teachers, students and the public to understand the environmental fate and
impact of manufactured nanoparticles.
