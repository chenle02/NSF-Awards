0131152&lt;br/&gt;Nolet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this award provide
partial support for purchase of a multi-node computer cluster. With this new
facility, geophysicists at Princeton University will study how earthquakes
influence local crustal stress fields and change the probability of new seismic
events. Further algorithm development should also make significant improvements
in our ability to image the interior structure of the Earth. Such improvements
will incorporate the effects of finite frequency wavefront healing. Mathematical
theories incorporating the effects of wave diffraction for more realistic
seismic tomograms were developed at Princeton but this group has so far lacked
the computational facilities to exploit it fully at resolutions of geological
interest (&lt; 100 km). &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
