Stars, galaxies, and nebulae in the universe consist of matter in a plasma
state. Magnetic fields dramatically impact properties of plasma. Magnetic fields
are thought to be responsible for catastrophic cosmic events such as generation
of super-strong x-ray bursts by collapsing stars and explosion of solar flares.
Understanding of plasma in strong magnetic fields is important for astrophysics,
basic plasma physics, and energy and national defense applications. A unique
combination of the Mega-Ampere current generator and powerful short-pulse laser
at the University of Nevada, Reno allows to investigate plasmas in magnetic
fields that are millions of times stronger that the Earth's magnetic field. In
this project, the impact of strong magnetic fields on high-energy beams of
electrons, and proton beams generated by the powerful laser in a solid target
will be studied. In collaboration with the University of Rochester, three
graduate students will be trained and will perform experimental and theoretical
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electron transport in the solid laser target will be
studied in the axial magnetic field of 1-1.5 MGauss. The pulsed power generator
provides well measured and controlled magnetic fields. Coherent transient
radiation from the rear side of the target will illuminate a spot of the
electron beam and indicate a guiding and focusing effect in the magnetic field.
Enhanced generation of proton beams in the external magnetic field will be
studied with the same experimental configuration combining laser and pulsed
power capabilities. A "proof of principle" experiment will be performed at the
magnetic field of ~1.5 MGauss. The experimental program will be supported by
simulations of electron and proton beams in a strong longitudinal magnetic field
using hybrid particle-in-cell codes. Results of the project are relevant to the
"fast ignition" approach to inertial confinement fusion and for medical
applications. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
