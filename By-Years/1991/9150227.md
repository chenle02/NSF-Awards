The Institute of Science and Society at Central Washington University plans a
series of six workshops during 1991 on issues involving science and technology
which are of current interest in the State of Washington. The purpose of the
series is to inform public officials on critical issues where science plays a
central role. Thus, state legislators, city and county executives, excutives in
key state and local governmental agencies,judges, attorneys, the news media, and
corporate executives will be invited to participate. The workshops will be
conducted at Central Washington University, the state capitol in Olympia, or
other locations which are easily accessible or relevant for the workshop topic
(e.g., hosting a workshop on radioactive waste at the Battelle-Hanford Pacific
Northwest Laboratory).
