9909561&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kathryn L. Nagy, University of
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project: Formation of Kaolinite in Inorganic and
Organic Low-Temperature Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaolinite is a
clay mineral that forms in tropical or temperate weathering environments or
during the burial diagenesis of sandstones and shales. Kaolinite is mined for
its properties such as color and light reflectivity, which are important
characteristics of industrial products such as ceramics and paper coatings. It
is a key mineral used to isotopically trace fluid flow pathways and past climate
change, that alters porosity and permeability in subsurface sandstones, and that
dominates certain soils. Although natural kaolinite has been extensively
investigated using surface and microscopic analytical techniques, quantitative
knowledge of fundamental controls on and rates of kaolinite formation at low
temperatures is lacking. In this project, the roles of dissolved organic
molecules, natural organic materials, mineral substrates, solution composition,
and temperature in controlling the formation of kaolinite will be investigated.
The approach combines well-controlled kinetics experiments, full
characterization of solutions and solids, and empirical molecular modeling of
interactions between dissolved ions and organic molecules with the mineral
surfaces. Organic molecules will represent soluble humic substances and organic
exudates from plants and bacteria. Results will provide a rate law for kaolinite
nucleation and growth that can be used to model natural processes in soils,
sediments, and sedimentary rocks and may also be applied in the related fields
of soils science, petroleum exploration, and industrial mineralogy.&lt;br/&gt;
