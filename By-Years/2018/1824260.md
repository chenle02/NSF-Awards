The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
academic workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arizona State University (ASU)
ADVANCE-IT project will build on its successful transition to an
interdisciplinary institutional structure and extend their operating theory of
public values-based institutional design thinking to issues of equity for STEM
faculty. Public values-based institutional design employs design thinking at all
levels of the institution to enact policies and practices that forward goals in
the public interest. The project will focus on improving outcomes for mid-to-
late career STEM faculty at ASU through three initiatives to: 1) ensure that
procedures on recruiting, promotion, evaluation, and retention explicitly
address how to improve equity and diversity in an interdisciplinary structure;
2) provide appropriate and accessible professional development and mentoring
opportunities; and 3) design, implement, and evaluate digital administrative
systems to monitor equity-related processes, and empower administrators to
intervene to ensure equitable opportunities and outcomes. This work is important
since challenges in science and engineering require new approaches and it will
be important to ensure all faculty - both traditionally disciplinary as well as
those who operate as interdisciplinary scholars - can be successful and are not
disadvantaged as STEM research moves toward more interdisciplinary
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASU ADVANCE takes a life course approach to
support professors from the beginning of the career, into the middle, and
through senior and leadership positions. The social science research component
of the project will use a mixed-methods approach to investigate how
intersectionality and an interdisciplinary institutional structure play out
across the academic life course. ASU is a strategic research site uniquely well-
suited to study how disciplinary and interdisciplinary scholarship may change
over the academic life course. ASU ADVANCE will enable the analysis of how known
bases of difference in the academic life course - gender, race, ethnicity,
sexual orientation, foreign-born status, disability, rank, and discipline -
interact with the interdisciplinary context to create opportunities and barriers
to academic career advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
