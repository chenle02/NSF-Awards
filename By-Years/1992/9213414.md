The focus of this research program is the investigation of various hydrodynamic
effects on shape, speed, stability, and extinction limits of premixed gas
flames. Various modeling techniques will be employed to reduce the study of
pertinent combustion systems to simple approximate problems tractable either
analytically or numerically. Specific study topics are: (1) large-scale dynamics
of premixed flames propagating through isotropic systems of small-scale eddies
and the associated cascade-renormalization concept of turbulent flame speed; (2)
extinction limits of premixed flames propagating through a periodic and a
randomized system of eddies; (3) intrinsic dynamics and pattern formation in
premixed flames and the related questions of flame stabilization and
nonadiabaticity; and, (4) effects of natural convection on the dynamics of auto-
catalytic reaction fronts in liquid solutions and the related questions of
premixed gas combustion. Turbulent combustion is a very important area of
practical interest; results of this work should influence the design of
automotive, aircraft, and rocket engines as well as industrial combustion
devices. The efficient use of fuels and minimization of production of air
pollutants via combustion processes are dependent on development of a good
understanding of the fundamental issues addressed in this work.
