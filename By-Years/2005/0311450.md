Physics (13) The goal of this project is to develop and test new curricular
materials for the introductory physics course that are to be used in large
lecture classes. They are adaptations and modifications of Mazur's ConcepTests,
and consist of carefully sequenced sets of multiple-choice questions, each
focused on a specific topic. These are primarily conceptual questions which
downplay algebraic manipulations, and are designed to be used in the context of
a class organized along active-learning lines in which a classroom communication
system is available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project
contributes to the development of active-learning curricular materials for
large-enrollment physics lecture classes. The strategically sequenced question
sets represent a specific type of modification and adaptation of ConcepTests
that have only been available in substantial quantities from the previous work
of the Principal Investigator and his collaborators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project has among its goals (1)
develop research-based educational materials and creation of a database (of
student response frequencies) useful in teaching; (2) involve graduate
researchers in undergraduate teaching activities; (3) participate in developing
new approaches (e.g., use of interactive lecture instruction) to engage
underserved individuals and groups (i.e., female physics students); (4) make
data available in a timely manner by means such as CD-ROMs; (5) publish in
diverse media (e.g., websites and CD-ROMs) to reach broad audiences; (6)
integrate research on teaching and learning with education activities in order
to communicate in a broader context, and (7) benefit society by increasing the
effectiveness of undergraduate physics instruction.
