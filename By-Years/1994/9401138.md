9401138 ARCHER Uranium is removed from the ocean by precipitation in chemically-
reducing sediments. Here, we present preliminary results from the subantarctic
South Atlantic showing high rates of authigenic U deposition in glacial-age
sediments. There is no analog for such high rates of authigenic U deposition in
modern pelagic sediments. The observed burial of uranium implies that one of two
conditions existed in the glacial ocean: either greatly-reduced oxygen content
of Circumpolar Deep Water (compared to modern levels in excess of 200
micromolar), or greatly-enhanced biological productivity of subantarctic surface
waters. Either condition would represent a significant feature of the carbon
cycle in the glacial ocean. Our hypothesis is that subantarctic sediments hold
the key record which will lead to the long-sought explanation for lower
atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the ice ages. Our goals are not only to
test this hypothesis, but to derive quantitative information about ice-age ocean
productivity and deep- sea O2 content.
