Two, two-week summer workshops will be held to acquaint undergraduate
professors with new curricular ideas in the areas of discrete mathematics,
geometry, and their applications. Leaders in each field, both academics and
practitioners, will interact with fifty participants from all parts of the
Nation to enable them to understand new developments in these mathematical
fields and to prepare applications-based materials suitable for use in their
classrooms. Areas to be discussed are problem- solving strategies using
combinatorics and graph theory, applications of graph theory to social sciences,
graphical algorithms in discrete math. In geometry, emphasis will center on
tilings, combinatorial geometry, and studies in computational geometry. A formal
follow-up session will be held at the national Joint AMS/MAA meeting in January
of 1989, where participants will discuss the impact of the training on their
campuses. This meeting will be preceded by two teleconferences, during which the
participants and the experts can continue their dialogue and refine the
curricula materials developed at the conference. In addition to the NSF funds,
participants' institutions will contribute about 20% in travel costs to the
operation of the project.
