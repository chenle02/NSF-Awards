Richard L. Radtke University of Hawaii at Manoa

Dr. Radtke effectively balances his time between scientific research and
community/youth education in a highly productive way. He engages students,
parents and teachers in his laboratory, in the field, in his global expeditions
and in countless civic presentations, schools visits and public television
programs. Dr. Radtke works with a diverse student body including undergraduate
and graduate students. He has mentored more than eighty youths with physical
disabilities. He has inspired blind youth to paddle canoes; youth with mental
health needs to control their emotions; and Deaf students to share their
observations in American Sign Language. Dr. Radtke is an outstanding role model,
particularly for physically disabled youth, since he too is severely disabled
due to multiple sclerosis and has been paralyzed from the neck down since the
mid 1980's.
