In Phase II, SUNY LSAMP will be building on the infrastructure, research base
and replicable models from Phase I and will scale up those programs with
approaches that work and advance new initiative to address those areas of
greatest challenge. The goals of SUNY LSAMP are to double the number of
underrepresented minority students getting bachelors degrees in SMET
disciplines; to encourage students to graduate study, into the professoriate and
into the SMET workforce; to encourage curricular and pedagogical change in SMET
disciplines and to institutionalize SUNY LSAMP goals. Strong emphasis will be
placed on strengthening the program at key transition points (high school to
college, 2- to 4-year college and undergraduate to graduate study), on
replicating innovative program models, providing comprehensive student support
services, continuing to build undergraduate research experience and
strengthening the SUNY LSAMP Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUNY LSAMP is a
coalition of sixteen four-year and community colleges within the State
University of New York (SUNY) system and program partners. Key program partners
are Computer Associates, BP Amoco, Brookhaven National Laboratory; the New York
State Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP), and the SUNY
Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (SUNY AGEP).&lt;br/&gt;
