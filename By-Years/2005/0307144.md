0307144&lt;br/&gt;Barry&lt;br/&gt;A 3-day workshop will be convened at the
National Snow and Ice Data&lt;br/&gt;Center, Boulder, CO in March 2003 with the
aim of evaluating current&lt;br/&gt;methods of determining the worldwide
recession of mountain glaciers over&lt;br/&gt;the last half-century or longer.
Recent evidence suggests an acceleration of&lt;br/&gt;glacier mass loss in
several key regions and it is imperative for&lt;br/&gt;assessment of ice
contributions to global sea level rise and of future&lt;br/&gt;water resources
from glacierized basins that a more comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;evaluation be made
of glacier changes.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this workshop include:
bringing together&lt;br/&gt;experts from leading groups, with under-represented
young and female&lt;br/&gt;scientists from North America and elsewhere. About
25-30 selected&lt;br/&gt;individuals will be funded and the workshop will be
open to other&lt;br/&gt;interested individuals.&lt;br/&gt;The publication of a
workshop report in EOS will bring the ideas to a&lt;br/&gt;wide scientific
audience&lt;br/&gt;
