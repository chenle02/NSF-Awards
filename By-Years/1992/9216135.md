This research is devoted to the theoretical analysis of various aspects of the
compressive kinking mode of failure in aligned- fiber composite materials.
Specifically, the research will focus on the relation of width of kink bands to
fiber diameter, stiffness, and tensile fracture strength, matrix plasticity, and
fiber misalignment. The project will also model the initiation and propagation
of kink bands form boundaries, notches and holes; and the coupling of other
composite damage mechanisms with kinking an kinking induced damage.
