Measurement of the fluxes of heat and materials that tie geological forcing to
biological response is central to addressing the major questions posed in the
Ridge2000 Endeavour Integrated Studies Site implementation plan. This project
will acquire two sets of complementary observations: the vertical fluxes of
fluid mass, heat and salt rising from the Endeavour segment vent fields and the
lateral transport of fluid mass within the axial valley. The vertical fluxes
from the vent fields will be measured by establishing appropriate control
volumes around them and using the autonomous vehicle ABE, complemented by
precisely navigated CTD observations and a nearby current meter mooring, to
measure the temperature, salinity and velocity fields on their boundaries. The
lateral fluid flux will be measured with a dense array of conventional current
meter moorings and up-looking acoustic current profilers.&lt;br/&gt;
