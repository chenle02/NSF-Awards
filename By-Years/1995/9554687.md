Workshop participants will learn to design courseware modules for undergraduate
courses in science and engineering classroom/laboratories. Participants will
learn about an integrated classroom/laboratory environment that includes
computer-controlled instruments, application software for data acquisition,
simulation and data analysis, and some fundamental issues in learning theory
based on the Kolb learning cycle and Bloom's taxonomy. By the end of the
workshop, participants will design and author courseware modules for use at
their home institution. The modules will be shared with workshop colleagues and
engineering and science departments using the internet. All participants will
get hands-on experience with Bucknell University's Electronic Classroom and
several classroom/laboratories equipped with multi-media PCs, data acquisition
and analysis software, simulation tools and authoring software. The workshop
will include optional sessions on several software packages including C/C++
programming, analysis programs such as MATLAB and Mathcad, and simulation with
LabView.
