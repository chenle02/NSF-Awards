This is a proposal to purchase equipment for animal behavior studies. The
equipment to be obtained includes video cameras, monitors, video tracking
systems, computers and additional image processing and storage devices. The
equipment will allow the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior to pursue
new controlled laboratory studies that had not been possible before. Research
will focus on circadian rhythms, cooperative behavior, mate choice, and movement
patterns. The instrumentation will enable automated monitoring of physiology,
activity and coloration. Image grabbers will also be used to catalogue
representative examples of behavior that can then be used to train students in
classifying behavior and to ensure interobserver reliability. The University of
Minnesota sponsors two programs that encourage undergraduate research: the
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and a research oriented honors.
