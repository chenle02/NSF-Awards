This awards supports the research of two anthropologists in Wales, studying the
underlying psycho-cultural bases of local attributions of Welsh "personhood".
Using techniques of intensive as well as questionnaire interviews, the
researcher will gather information about why some sorts of behaviors are deemed
properly Welsh and other are not. Analyzing the data with a statistical model
which reveals the underlying consensus between informants of ethnicity, and
their distribution across a small sample of informants. This research is
important because it will add significantly to our understanding of how people
attribute ethnicity to their peers. Ethnic identity is a powerful force in the
world (witness the warfare in Yugoslavia at the present time), and increases in
our understanding how to deal with ethnic conflict.
