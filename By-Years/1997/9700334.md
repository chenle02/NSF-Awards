ECS-9700334 Ghosh The proposed equipment's would mainly support research in the
Laboratory for Visionics. The equipment's would mainly be used for low level
image processing, specifically in analyzing sequence of images o three
dimensional indoor or natural scenes for the purpose of navigation, obstacle
avoidance, target tracking an motion estimation. The laboratory is presently
equipped with an INTELLEDEX 386 Vision System and is being used to the limits of
its capability. The proposed MAXSPARC system would be used for visual processing
in the closed loop with feedback to the Motion Planner and Robot Controller.
