This grant provides support for the acquisition of a magnetometer for materials
research and student training at the University of Michigan. This new instrument
will be used for fundamental materials characterization and exploration and will
serve a broad and interdisciplinary community of materials researchers at the
University of Michigan. The instrument will strengthen existing materials
synthesis efforts in the Chemistry, Geology, Nuclear Engineering, and Physics
Departments by providing timely feedback on the relationships between structural
and morphological characteristics, and the underlying magnetic phenomena such as
moment configuration and anisotropy, magnetic order, and other types of phase
transitions. The instrument will also be used to perform fundamental
measurements at low temperatures, high magnetic fields, and high pressures on
materials with strong electronic correlations, molecular magnets, geological
materials, and nanostructured materials. Hydrostatic pressure apparatus for use
in magnetization measurements will be developed, allowing the exploration of
magnetic stability in both geological materials and in quantum critical systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new magnetometer will be the centerpiece of a new
interdisciplinary laboratory course for undergraduates on magnetic materials and
their characterization techniques, which will be taught by faculty members from
the Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Materials Science, and Nuclear Engineering
departments.&lt;br/&gt;
