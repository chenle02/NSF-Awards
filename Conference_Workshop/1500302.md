This award provides funding support to the Conference on Complex Analysis and
Geometry to be held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison on
March 27-29, 2015. The conference is devoted to recent developments in several
complex variables in connections with fields of harmonic analysis, partial
differential equations, conformal geometry, complex geometry, and dynamical
systems. It will feature 10 main speakers who are leading mathematicians or
junior researchers who have made significant contributions to the fields. There
will also be 5 short-talks presented by young researchers who obtained their
Ph.D. recently. The conference will create opportunity for exchange of new
research results and new frontiers, which will benefit the recent Ph.D.'s and
graduate students. The organizers encourage women and members of
underrepresented minority groups to participate in the conference, and partial
travel support will be provided.

The conference will feature recent research results and methods in several
complex variables. The main topics of the conference include the normal form
theory in several complex variables and dynamical systems, extension property of
biholomorphic mappings, d-bar-Neumann problems, the rigidity and classification
of holomorphic mappings between balls, the local and global theory of CR
manifolds, Levi-flat hypersurfaces and the lamination theory in complex
projective spaces.
