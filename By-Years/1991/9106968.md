This project will consider capillarity theory and related geometric problems
including stability of liquid bridges, shape and size estimates for pendent
liquid drops, and discontinuous dependence theorems for capillary surfaces in
the absence of gravity. The project will also examine, through theory and
experiments, axially symmetric fluid container shapes that admit entire continua
of symmetric surfaces which are not stable. This work will contribute to the
theoretical basis for experimental research on contact angle of liquids in space
flights (NASA and European Space Agency).
