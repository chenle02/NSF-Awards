This research project concerns number theory, the oldest branch of mathematics.
More specifically, it focuses on the study of automorphic forms. Automorphic
forms are a very special class of functions that form an important bridge
connecting the discrete objects of algebraic number theory and the continuous
objects of analytic number theory. Automorphic forms are used as tools to study
number theoretic functions, e.g. by measuring their rates of growth, discovering
formulas for them, or proving relations that they satisfy. Classically, special
values of automorphic forms provided the solution to Kronecker's problem for
extensions of the rational numbers that do not lie in the real line. More
recently, automorphic forms played a pivotal role in the proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem. This project aims to further explore the connection of automorphic
forms to other mathematical structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main object of
the proposed research is to further understand and exploit the relationship
between automorphic forms and quadratic number fields. This relationship is
exceedingly rich and unites the study of diverse objects such as Heegner points,
closed geodesics, the hyperbolic Laplacian, Kloosterman sums, L-functions and
class fields. The theory for imaginary quadratic fields is in general better
developed and simpler, especially in relation to class field theory. The
investigators will concentrate mostly on the real quadratic case. In one
direction, they will study some new geometric invariants associated to real
quadratic fields that were introduced recently. These invariants are certain
surfaces that are bounded by modular closed geodesics. The investigators will
study the distribution of the areas of the surfaces, especially as this relates
to ideal classes and also investigate some new geometric problems about the
closed geodesics. They plan to express various invariants for real quadratic
fields (such as surface integrals of modular functions) in terms of the Fourier
coefficients of automorphic forms. This naturally leads to problems involving
sums of Kloosterman sums and to extensions of recent work on uniform estimates
for such sums.
