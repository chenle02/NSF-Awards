Global Position System (GPS) data can now be used to measure movements of
Earth's surface with few-millimeter precision. Using GPS, research has recently
revealed that the solid Earth changes shape due to seasonal change in the
surface distribution of water, snow, and air pressure. This raises the
possibility of using GPS with the Earth as a "weighing machine" to measure
surface mass as it changes in time and place.

By applying a new inversion method, this project plans to use worldwide GPS data
from the International GPS Service (from 1996 to 2004) to produce a movie of
surface mass redistribution around the globe over an 8-year period, with 1-week
resolution. This will be useful to investigators modeling the global water
cycle, as it will provide seasonal to decadal change in the intensity and
geographic pattern of seasonal variation in near-surface water (of all forms).
Determining whether the global water cycle is intensifying is a central science
question concerning global climate change. One likely consequence of an
accelerating water cycle is change in the amplitude of seasonal cycling of water
storage between Earth's reservoirs, which this project should help to quantify.

A secondary goal of this project is to test mechanical models of the Earth.
Current models are largely based on seismology at much shorter time scales, and
they ignore lateral variation in elasticity. To test these models requires
independent information on surface loads, which this project will obtain from
global atmospheric and hydrologic models, and sea level data, as well as data
from remote sensing satellite missions.
