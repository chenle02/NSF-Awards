9725897 Rossman This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a
new Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for structural mineralogic
and petrologic research at the California Institute of Technology. A state-of-
the-art Nicolet FTIR spectrometer will replace Caltech's current Nicolet 60SX
FTIR spectrometer which was purchased in 1984. This new instrument will provide
over an order of magnitude greater sensitivity for analyses of volatile
components (primarily H2O and OH-) within minerals and glasses relative to their
current FTIR spectrometer. Rossman's research focuses on the quantitative
analysis of hydrous components (H2O and OH-) in minerals and glasses and has
shown hydrogen to be one of the most pervasive elements in the crust and upper
mantle. This research has had a major impact on our understanding of the
hydrogen budget of the Earth and has profound implications for the rheology and
electronic properties of the crust and upper mantle. This grant provides the
latest tool for continued research in mineral spectroscopy including studies of
the behavior of water and hydroxide through mineral phase changes and studies of
volatiles in inclusions, mantle silicates, basaltic magmas, experimental high-
pressure run products and synthetic zeolites. ***
