This award provides support for the 29th meeting in the series of Southeastern-
Atlantic Regional Conferences on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), held 16-17
October 2009 at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. The conference encourages
and financially supports participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.
Women and minority beginning researchers are especially encouraged to attend and
to apply for financial assistance.

The meeting includes plenary lectures on topics of current research interest and
also especially encourages lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The
conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research
in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new
researchers to present their work.
