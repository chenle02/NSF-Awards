Laramie County Community College, in consultation with Wyoming's Governor's
Office, Wyoming's Business Council's State Energy Office, the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory's Wind Technology Center, and Wyoming's wind farm industry, is
designing and implementing a career pathway in wind energy technology that
includes (1) a wind energy technician certificate program, (2) a wind energy
mechanic diploma program, (3) a wind energy Associate of Science degree program,
and (4) a summer bridge program for high school students. The project is also
preparing and delivering informational presentations on wind energy technology
for the public. The project addresses the paucity of wind energy technology
educational programs in America and the growing workforce needs of the western
region's expanding wind power industry.
