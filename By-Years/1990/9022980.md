This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division will support an annual workshop in organometallic chemistry.
The participants will be organometallic chemists from academia, industry, and
private and government research organizations. The goals of the workshop are to
facilitate communication among researchers in the different kinds of
organizations and to foster the exchange of new ideas much earlier than is
possible through formal publications. The format of the workshop is designed to
encourage maximum participation by all attendees, and the plan for selecting
attendees will ensure broadly based participation. The topics to be discussed
will span a broad spectrum from synthesis of new organometallic compounds to the
utilization of such compounds as catalysts or as precursors for making new
materials.
