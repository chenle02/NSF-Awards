The goal of this research is the development of an integrated set of tools for
the logical and physical design of sequential circuits with reduced area and
improved performance. The proposed research is developing analytical techniques
for synthesis of sequential circuits by means of functional and physical
decompositions so as to minimize the area and maximize the performance (or find
a trade off between the two). Algorithms to decompose a sequential circuit into
a set of interacting synchronous finite state machines (FSM's) are being
investigated. The approach is to find a set of generalized partitions of machine
states, so that each machine state can be implemented as a separate machine. The
machines corresponding to those partitions interact with each other in a more
complex fashion than those derived on the basis of classical theory of closed
partitions. For example, in this organization one machine may depend on other
machines by using their state bits as primary inputs.
