This project examines contract farming arrangements in the Sao Francisco Valley
of northeast Brazil, It addresses the question of when, where, why and how fruit
and vegetable firms seek to institute contract farming, why and how farming
families become involved in them, and the outcomes for both families and firms.
It tests a series of hypotheses derived from existing literature and from a
preliminary field visit, about the causes and consequences of contract farming.
Some of these hypotheses are about the logic of contract farming arrangements
for firms: they examine the relationships between contracting and labor
intensity of the production process, the destination of crops for processing,
and former firm experience in sharecropping. Other hypotheses are about the
impact of contract farming on the families involved. Structured interviews with
a sample of contract farming families and of wage-dependent families will be
used to test the hypothesis that contract farming provides higher incomes and
more stable incomes; that it decreases the range of income-generating auxiliary
activities that family members perform; and that success of contract farming is
correlated with greater availability of labor resources. In-depth interviews
with firm managers, and with contract farming families will provide additional
data for interpretation and cross-checking of statistical results.
