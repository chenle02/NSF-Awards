The investigator plans to work on three classes of problems involving the
applications of algebraic topology to the study of curvature and symmetry
properties of manifolds. One class of questions deals with the existence of
riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature. The second class of questions
concerns group actions on relatively low-dimensional manifolds, and the third
class concerns the interaction between homotopy theory, surgery theory, and
group actions on manifolds in higher dimensions. Topics to receive special
emphasis include the curvature properties of non-linear spherical spaceforms and
cyclic group actions on 4-manifolds and spheres. Several of these problems
feature the interplay between topology and geometry, the extent to which
geometric properties that do not directly or obviously involve measurement
actually entail restrictions on such metric properties as curvature. Powerful
modern methods have been revealing more and more such situations, with profound
relevance for the physicists' theories about the world in which we live.
