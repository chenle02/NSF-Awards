This award initiates support for research in atomic physics by Dr. Gregory P.
Lafyatis, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Lafyatis will carry out
research on atomic structure using the new technique of trapping neutral atoms
in isolation from perturbing influences. He will also use these techniques to
study the collisions of atoms at very low relative energies.
