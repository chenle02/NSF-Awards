w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9700767 Gwinn This experimental research project
focuses on conducting systems formed by the "edge states" that lie near the
perimeter of quasi- two dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall effect
(QHE). Fundamentally new transport behavior is predicted for sample geometries
that bring multiple edge states into communication. Two sample geometries will
employed in this project. These are a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice pillar with edge
states communicating on a 2D surface sheath; and a gated GaAs/AlGaAs
heterojunction with edge states communicating across a long, narrow "line gate"
barrier. Existing theoretical predictions in these cases will be tested with
measurements to be made using a high-field (19Tesla), low temperature (20mK)
apparatus on samples fabricated from MBE- grown GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. It
is expected that the results will advance general understanding of electronic
transport in quasi-1D- and in anisotropic 3D- materials. %%% This experimental
research project probes electron transport behavior in novel devices based on
one of the most advanced device technologies in microelectronics; that based on
the GaAs- GaAlAs system. This system is used in some advanced electron devices
for computer use because it can lead to faster operation than equivalent devices
made of silicon. The experiments will be based on thin conducting layers
fabricated in the GaAlAs technology which give a confined two-dimensional
"electron gas" in which the residual scattering from impurities and
imperfections is reduced to extremely low levels, so that inherent electron gas
behavior at very low temperatures and at high magnetic fields can be observed,
and compared to recent theoretical models. Results from this research may
include unusual new effects or materials which may find new application in tech
nology. This research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves
graduate students who will be excellently trained to enter positions in
industry, government or education. ***
