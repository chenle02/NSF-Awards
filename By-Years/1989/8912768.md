This award will support an anthropology graduate student who will study low
birth weight in a high altitude region of India. Children born at high altitudes
in South America and the US have been observed to weigh significantly less than
low-altitude children. This project will see if a similar relationship exists in
India and try to explain variations in child health by reference to socio-
economic and other cultural factors. A sample of 300 pregnant women will be
followed and their newborn infants weighed and measured at several intervals
after birth. In addition survey interviews will assess each mother's
reproductive history, socio-economic background, and knowledge and beliefs about
child health. This research is important because understanding the causes of low
birth weight an be of help in the design of measures to improve the health of
such children. Comparative data such as this project will be helpful in testing
theories of the causes of low birth weight.
