The program investigates the mechanisms of coarsening of precipitates in binary
metal alloys. Existing theories predict that precipitate coarsening behavior is
influenced by the volume fraction of precipitate. This effect should be
maximized at low volume fractions. In this research pre-aging treatments are
employed to produce a uniform composition in the metal matrix. This treatment is
followed by an elevated temperature aging treatment to control the kinetics of
precipitate growth and the particle size distributions. Metal alloy specimens
are examined by transmission electron microscopy and magnetic techniques to
measure precipitate volume fraction and growth rate. Related theoretical
considerations take into account effects of coherency strains on the coarsening
process. The metal alloys under investigation are binaries of nickel with
additions of aluminum, silicon or titanium.
