A recently built instrument capable of measuring atmospheric OH (hydroxyl
radical), H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and HNO3 (nitric acid) will be deployed during
the 2001 Summer intensive of PROPHET (Program for Research on Oxidants:
Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport) in Northern Michigan. The measurement
technique is based on chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). In earlier
PROPHET campaigns, measurements using a fluorescence-based technique showed the
surprising result of measurable levels of OH during the night. Deploying this
fundamentally different technique could confirm the occurrence of nighttime OH
under the conditions of the PROPHET site. The measurements of H2SO4 will
complement ongoing aerosol measurements, and the measurements of HNO3 would
complement measurements of other individual compounds in the reactive nitrogen
(NOy) family.
