In this project we will investigate various methods for detection and
classification of buried objects, including but not limited to antipersonnel
mines. Power Spectra Inc. Will supply us with state of the art ground
penetrating radar data, taken in a variety of situations. We will utilize this
data to train, test and refine our algorithms for detection and classification
using spatial statistics and semiparametric density estimation. The final
product will be signal processing algorithms which will have the capability to
analyze Power Spectra's radar data and correctly identify antipersonnel mines.
This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
