The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps VSTEP Digital Health
project is to increase clinician efficiency and engagement with therapy for
persons with neurological conditions such as post-stroke and with Parkinson
Disease. Using off-the shelf hardware and custom software decreases cost both
for equipment purchase and providing care. It also facilitates that clinics of
all sizes can adopt innovative technology in treatment of patients.
Customization of therapy may increase clinician productivity, enhance outcomes
and decrease treatment time. Insights on patient and clinician performance can
help clinics and insurance providers lower costs and provide better care.
Societal impact may be achieved by providing an engaging therapy that increases
socialization and decrease loneliness and most importantly increases activity
and participation in society. The project will facilitate a decision about
whether to pursue further development and commercialization of the technology.

This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of The VSTEP
Digital Health Platform which is an integrated solution for the comprehensive
examination and treatment of balance, mobility, coordination and fitness
deficits of persons with neurologic conditions. These deficits which occur
frequently after neurologic diagnosis, persist when not treated and interfere
with activity and participation in societal roles. The technology integrates
motion and heart rate sensing with activity based engaging therapeutic games
presented in a virtual environment. It also has an examination suite which uses
standardized assessments that guide the therapeutic activities. Customization of
the therapy ensures that the patient's goals are achieved and the clinicians?
insights and reasoning for care are incorporated with the technology.
