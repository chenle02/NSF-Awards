This is a request to support a Chapman conference on "Soil-mediated drivers of
coupled biogeochemical and hydrological processes across scales," to be held at
Biosphere 2, Oracle, Arizona (the University of Arizona), from October 21-24,
2013. This conference will bring together scientists from soil systems sciences,
hydrology, and biogeochemistry to discuss recent findings dealing with the role
and importance of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes occurring in
the soil system and its interfaces with adjacent compartments, such as
groundwater, plants, and the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is
intended to broaden community involvement in Earth science research and engage
young investigators in furthering the development of interdisciplinary Earth
science agenda. The conference is open to all scientists interested in the
proposed topics. Attention will be paid to attracting early career scientists
and Ph.D. students working on topics at the interfaces between the different
disciplines, and specifically target underrepresented groups.
