With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Bordwell will develop new
methods for estimating the magnitudes of bond dissociation energies (BDEs).
These studies are expected to provide quantitative estimates of the relative
magnitudes of BDEs and the corresponding radical stabilization energies (RSEs)
for the species that are formed upon homolytic cleavage of bonds between
hydrogen and other atoms. His work will provide the first quantitative estimates
of the relative magnitudes of RSEs for a large number of radicals. At the same
time, these measurements will serve to extend the dimethylsulfoxide-based
acidity scale, which provides quantitative measures of anion basicities and,
through the Bronsted equation, their reactivities toward electrophiles. %%%
Knowledge of the energies, called "bond dissociation energies", that are
required to cleave particular chemical bonds is important to physical-organic
chemists who seek to develop fundamental structure-activity relationships that
can be used to predict the reactivities of individual chemical bonds in a given
molecule toward a particular reagent. This information, in turn, can be used by
synthetic organic chemists in developing new synthetic strategies.
