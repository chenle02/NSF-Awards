A symposium on "Catastrophic Flooding" will be held on September 26-28, 1987, at
Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. The purpose of this meeting is to present
results of ongoing research to discuss the limitations of it, and to determine
what future research is needed in this area. The national and international
speakers presenting papers represent a diverse perspective on extreme and rare
flood events and include engineers, climatologists, geomorphologists and
hydrologists. A half- day workshop which will take place during the conference,
will provide the attendees with an opportunity to discuss in depth these
hydrologic and geomorphic problems, the type of data needed to assess the risks
of catastrophic floods, the suitability of current models, and the most
promising new areas of research. Proceedings will be published and distributed
to the participants and other interested parties. A summary of the proceedings
will be submitted to the American Geophysical Union for publication. The P.I. is
capable to conduct the symposium and workshop and has submitted a revised budget
that is judged suitable. An award is recommended.
