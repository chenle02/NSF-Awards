In 1987, under the directorship of Dr. John Stachel, Princeton University Press
produced volume one of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein," including the
Einstein's writings and correspondence from 1879 to 1902. This volume was
especially important because of the discovery and publication of the
correspondence between the young Einstein and his fellow student and first wife,
Mileva Maric. Volume two, begun under Dr. Stachel, was published in 1990 under
the editorship of Dr. Martin Klein. This volume included Einstein's publications
from 1901 to 1909, among them a number of works that were absolutely crucial in
the development of 20th century science. Both volumes were accompanied by an
English translation produced under the direction of Dr. Peter Havas. With this
three year grant, Dr. Martin Klein, with Drs. Jurgen Renn and Robert Schulmann,
will complete the preparation of volumes 3 through 7 of the Collected Papers.
Volumes 3, 4, 6 & 7 will present Einstein's writings from 1910 to 1922. These
papers include Einstein's work on his General Theory of Relativity. Volume 5
will present Einstein's correspondence from 1902 to 1914. This grant will also
support the preparation of the accompanying English translation of these
volumes. Dr. Klein is assuming responsibility for the translation as well as the
edition. At the end of the three year period, it is the hope of the Princeton
University Press to have raised an endowment to complete the publication of 29
volumes of Einstein papers. This project will continue well into the second
decade of the next century. In the meantime, researchers will be actively
working on these papers. NSF is pursuing additional ways of expediting this
research.
