Abstract

Award: DMS-9972298 Principal Investigator: Patrick T. McDonald

Successful L2-methods arise to address a wide variety of problems in a number of
contexts (for example, mathematical physics, geometry, and topology). As this is
the case, the methods themselves are often strikingly different. Nonetheless, it
is often the case that these different methods can be used to provide insight
directed towards the same or similar problems. The primary purpose of the
workshop ``L2-methods in Geometry'' is to bring together leading figures in
geometric analysis who have developed different L2-methods for investigating
related geometric phenomena. Topics which will be addressed at the workshop will
include: index theorems, traces and determinants of pseudodifferential operators
and their applications, spectral invariants including analytic torsion and
Novikov-Shubin invariants, and Von Neumann algebra methods in (spectral)
geometry. The workshop will provide the young investigators with a unique
opportunity to interact with distinguished senior colleagues who have developed
a variety of approaches to geometric problems and who will focus their
collective attention on a sharply defined collection of problems.

Analytic methods have contributed immensely to our collective understanding of
many mathematical disciplines, as well as to our understanding of a number of
fundamental topics in physics, some of which have found their way into important
applications (for example, various imaging techniques). This workshop will bring
together a distinguished international collection of scholars who have made
fundamental contributions to the field of geometric analysis. These
contributions reflect a diverse collection of perspectives offerred as
explanations for the same or similar phenomena. Bringing these perspectives
together will foster an exchange of ideas and collaboration on problems of deep
interest to the mathematics community at large. Such an environment will provide
many young investigators with a valuable oppportunity to compare and contrast a
variety of ideas and approaches, shaping the direction in which they will move.
