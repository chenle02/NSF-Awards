This research investigates the genetic basis of pigmentation differences in
fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. It is a part of an effort to develop
Drosophila pigmentation as an evolutionary metamodel. Established metamodels are
necessary for the elucidation of any general rules in evolution. They test
whether certain traits and gene networks evolve in a reproducible fashion.
Previously the regions involved in color pattern evolution in one species pair
were identified, and the genes are in the process of being characterized. This
grant will improve this dissertation through funding an analysis of the
chromosomal regions involved in pigmentation differences in an additional
species pair. This comparative component will be integral to the formation of an
unbiased understanding of the dynamics of convergent evolution in this system.

Metamodels are being actively developed in several systems, such as sticklebacks
and mice. None of these endeavors account for the effect of network structure in
shaping the dynamics of parallel evolution. Within Drosophila this is possible
as most, though not all, genes in the pathway have been characterized.
Furthermore--in addition to its scientific merit--this research generates
opportunities for training in research and includes individuals from
underrepresented groups. Undergraduates from this lab have continued on to
graduate school and participated in local and national research symposia. This
research is also being used to develop to develop lesson plans that promote
engaged learning and improve biology education.
