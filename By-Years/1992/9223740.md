Schlag This research addresses the problem of multi-way partitioning of large
designs onto multiple FPGA systems. The task is challenging because the
partitioning methods must accurately assess and enhance routing so that the
partitions can be successfully implemented on individual FPGAs. Existing methods
result in poor device utilization because they rely on very conservative rules-
of-thumb to ensure the successful place- and-route of individual FPGAs. This
work has the following specific goals: 1. to develop new methods for assessing
the intrinsic routing requirements of system designs with respect to the
architectural resources of FPGAs; 2. to develop effective methods for exercising
the tradeoff between logic and routing resources in heterogeneous FPGA
architectures; and 3. to incorporate these advances within an integrated
routability-driven multi-way partitioning and technology mapping strategy that
will allow effective utilization of the reconfigurable hardware resource. In
addition to new techniques for routability analysis, partitioning and technology
mapping, the research develops new insights into the synergy between system-
level interconnect architecture, FPGA device architecture, routability, and
partitioning.
