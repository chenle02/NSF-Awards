This study seeks to develop a technique to determine exposure ages and erosion
rates of bedrock surfaces by studying, by accelerator mass spectrometry, the
history of production in situ, radioactive decay, and erosional loss of the
cosmogenic radionuclides Be and Al in quartz samples from those surfaces.
Preliminary measurements on a variety of samples indicate that Antarctic bedrock
surfaces retain very high concentrations of Be and Al, apparently a consequence
of very slow erosion rates. This technique is now ready for application in a
systematic way on a suite of 73 samples of quartz-rich rock from the dry valleys
of the Antarctic and from a sedimentary veneer on the Elephant Moraine. Be and
Al concentrations will be measured in quartz separated from those samples to
determine the extent of prior glacial cover of bedrock surfaces now exposed and
the chronology of accumulation of moraine particles on the surface of the
Elephant Moraine. This investigation will be a collaborative effort by
scientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Ohio State University.
