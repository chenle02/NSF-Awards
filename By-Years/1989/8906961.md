This project will convene two technical seminars in connection with cooperative
natural hazards and wind engineering research in the Southeastern Asian
countries. The first will be a technical planning meeting involving researchers
from the University of Hawaii, Tongji University of China, and City Polytechnic
University of Hong Kong to discuss the desirability and plans of conducting
full-scale measurements for wind response data on the dynamic characteristics of
the Bank of China (BOC) building in Hong Kong. The second meeting will be a
consultation meeting with the members of the 1987 coordinating committee of the
US-Asia Conference on Engineering for Mitigating Natural Hazards Damage to
develop follow-up action plans. The project activities will advance the
development and exchange of knowledge concerning mitigation of natural hazards.
