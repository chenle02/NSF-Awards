An interdisciplinary, group effort to synthesize, characterize, and optimize the
properties of photosensitive and non-photosensitive polyimides for use as the
multilayer dielectric for multi-chip module substrates has been proposed. The
next generation of supercomputers will require an increase in speed.
Unfortunately, since the residual stress in the dielectric increases with the
number of layers, the reliability of the dielectric layer based on current
polyimides will decrease. The increase in layers and the decrease in the width
of the circuit paths necessitates the use of photosensitive polyimides which
typically exhibit a reduction in properties. Thus, there is a pressing need to
1) produce polyimides with lower residual stress and 2) learn how to optimize a
mechanical design utilizing these materials using structural analysis methods.
First, DuPont will prepare a number of new, non-photosensitive polyimides that
have low stress. Then, DuPont, IBM, UMass, and UNH will characterize the
elastic, optical, and electrical properties using several new and several well
established techniques. These properties will be used as input to IBM's finite
element model of the multilayer dielectric to predict the stress level and hence
the reliability of the new substrates. The effect of processing variables (heat,
solvents, etc.) on the critical physical properties will also be determined.
Once a suitable range of techniques and properties have been established, DuPont
will synthesize photosensitive polyimides and the properties will be
characterized again. Then, a model substrate will be fabricated by IBM and the
thermo-mechanical performance will be characterized by UNH. The failure modes,
if any exist, will also be observed at UMass using hot-stage optical microscopy.
This combined interdisciplinary effort has been made possible by the recent
advances in experimental methods to characterize thin film materials that have
been pioneered at UNH
