This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research in programming
languages between Benjamin C. Pierce of Indiana University and Davide Sangiorgi
of INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied
Mathematics) at Sophia Antipolis, France. The objective of their research is to
study the use of static type information for reasoning about concurrent systems
through applications of process calculi. Previous work in this area has shown
that systems with subtyping and linearity can be `transplanted` from sequential
programming languages to a pure calculus of message-passing concurrency. These
refinements have benefits in flexibility and detection of programming errors and
can be used to justify useful program equivalences. This work will be extended
to investigations on the role of parametric polymorphism and various forms of
noninterference between concurrent activities. The US investigator brings to
this collaboration expertise in design and implementation of concurrent object-
oriented languages and in theoretical studies of type systems. This is
complemented by the French investigator's experience in concurrency theory and
process calculi.
