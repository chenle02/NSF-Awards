The main objectives of the research are to develop the science base for
intelligent processing of composites and to develop methods for innovative
utilization of composites. Specifically, the research addresses process
monitoring, process characterization, mechanics of processing, processing-
structure relations, structure-property relations, and the synergistic effect of
anisotropy and heterogeneity. The research equipment (an autoclave) provides the
critically needed capability to process composite materials. It will be used to
develop optimum processing cyles, to identify critical manufacturing flaws, and
to fabricate laminates and laminated structures in support of other composites
research. Together with a filament winding machine currently available, the
autoclave will allow the study of new material combinations and new structural
concepts as well. The results of this research may provide the foundation for
the development of integrated computer-aided manufacturing (ICAM) technology for
composites. It is impossible to overemphasize the fact that the nation's
technological leadership in the manufacture and application of this important
class of materials cannot be maintained without a mature ICAM technology.
