This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry. The project fuses
techniques from geometry and quantum field theory to unravel the hidden
complexity of algebraic singularities, to extract new enumerative invariants of
varieties, and to construct novel dualities in representation theory. Five
problems will be studied. The first one aims to construct new algebraic
invariants of moduli spaces and of symplectic singularities. The building and
computation of these invariants requires a theoretical development of the
formalism of shifted symplectic structures in non-commutative geometry. In the
second project a new method is proposed for constructing motivic enumerative
invariants by shifted quantization of the moduli of objects in differential
graded categories of Calabi-Yau type. The third project analyzes the way in
which non-commutative Hodge theory controls the deformations of Landau-Ginzburg
models and proposes a very general unobstructedness theorem. The fourth project
gives a strategy for reformulating and proving the classical limit Langlands
duality as a purely topological duality for perverse sheaves. The last project
will establish the functoriality of the ramified and the twisted non-abelian
Hodge correspondences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resolution of these questions
will consolidate and demystify several existing quantization schemes in
geometry, symplectic topology, and field theory. The project sets the stage for
understanding the basic structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for
pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural
applications to algebraic topology, the work proposed will be immediately
relevant to deep questions in category theory, geometric representation theory,
the theory of integrable systems, string theory, gauge theory, quantum gravity
and cosmology. The project outlines concrete cross-discipline applications to
the physics of mirror symmetry, renormalization group flow, and the quantization
of gauge theories. This project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on
enhancing and building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the
theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This
will be achieved by training a group of young researchers, and graduate students
in mathematics and physics, and by a curriculum development of a course on
derived symplectic geometry, and a course on non-commutative Hodge theory.
Specific research opportunities on the interface of geometry and string theory
for graduate students and postdocs are discussed. The proposed work will be
disseminated through talks at multidisciplinary conferences, research seminars
and publications in peer reviewed scientific journals.
