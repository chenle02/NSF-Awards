McConnell has developed a new way to study Riemannian locally symmetric spaces
and their compactifications, a class of spaces with many important examples
occurring in quite different areas of mathematics, and consequently intensively
studied by a host of strong mathematicians both here and abroad. McConnell's
method lends itself to machine computation, and some of his effort will
accordingly be computational.
