Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, several workstations will
be purchased to help equip a Laboratory for Computational Fluid Dynamics and
Heat Transfer at the PI's institution. The research conducted in this laboratory
concerns transition to turbulence in complex geometries, heat transfer
enhancement by flow destabilization, and thermal issues involved in materials
processing. Applications include cooling of electronic equipmentand turbine
blades, as well as thermal processing of materials.
