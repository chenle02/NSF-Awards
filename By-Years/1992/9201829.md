The PIs propose to estimate distributions of electrical conductivities, neutral
wind profiles, and effective electric fields in the E region through radar
experiments. Secondly, they will infer three energy transfer rates in individual
ionospheric flux tubes, i.e. the net Poynting flux entering/leaving the top side
of the tube, the Joule heating rate in the flux tube, and the energy carried
into the flux tube by auroral particle precipitation. Finally, calculations will
focus on statistical averages of energy transfer rates and their relative
importance with respect to magnetic latitude and local time, season, geomagnetic
activity, solar wind and IMF parameters, and phase of the solar cycle.
