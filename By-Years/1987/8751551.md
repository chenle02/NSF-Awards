The NAEP 1987 High School Transcript Study includes two major components: the
collection of transcript data and the analysis of transcript data. Under the
base period of the contract, a survey organization will conduct in 1987 a high
school transcript study of sample members of the 1986 National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP). In the 1986 NAEP assessment, 38,000 high school
students who were either 17 years old or enrolled in the eleventh grade (or
both) in the 469 sampled schools were included in the assessment. A copy of the
high school transcript for each member of this sample will be collected. All the
collected transcripts will be transcribed into a standard form, edited, and put
on a computer data base for later analysis and reporting. A first edition of the
data tape is scheduled for completion in March, 1988. The reporting of the NAEP
1987 transcript data will be addressed to seven topics: changes in course-taking
from 1982 to 1987, student participation in vocational education, handicapped
students in vocational education, course-taking patterns and student
achievement, student self-reports of course- taking, patterns of exclusion from
NAEP assessments, and international comparisons of school curriculum. The first
three analysis topics are scheduled for FY 1988 and the last four topics for FY
1989.
