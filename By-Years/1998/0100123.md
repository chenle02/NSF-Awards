This grant provides funding to develop a systematic yet flexible approach to
build a series of metamodels for robust design space exploration and
optimization of large systems along a design timeline. Six statistical
metamodeling approaches will be evaluated, namely, response surface modeling,
kriging, multivariate adaptive regression splines, classification and regression
trees, artificial neural networks and wavelets. Both classical and space-filling
experimental designs will be tested with the most promising statistical
metamodeling approaches and verified for use along a design time-line. The
design of families of general aviation aircraft (to verify product platform
development), and the design of vehicle body structures (to verify the
metamodeling and robust design methodology) are used to evaluate the efficacy of
the method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work, if successful, will provide the
proof-of-concept for the development of a formal, generic, mathematically
rigorous method for use in rapidly exploring concepts in the early stages of
project initiation. The outcome is anticipated to have an impact both on the
engineering design community and the statistical community bringing both
communities closer to addressing real problems with tools anchored in a rigorous
and mathematically correct foundation. In addition, the successful use of this
method by manufacturing enterprises will allow them to rapidly and cost-
effectively design product platforms thereby enhancing their
competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
