Individuals' cognitive strategies for controlling anxiety, monitoring progress
towards goals, and protecting self-esteem have been implicated as important to
personality adjustment in many arenas of social life. A strategy of defensive
pessimism-- characterized by a great deal of cognitive effort at "playing
through" events before they occur and preparing for low- probability "worst-case
outcomes" -- provides an interesting contrast with strategic optimism in which
the best is assumed until proven otherwise, and self-esteem is protected only
when necessary after the fact. Both strategies tend to ensure successful
achievement, though in very different ways, and with different consequences for
daily life stress and health symptomalogy, social relationships, and personal
satisfaction and motivation. The present work will investigate the self-
regulatory processes underlying these strategies, as well as the associated
costs and benefits for personality functioning across different life situations
and over time; utilizing a variety of techniques including daily diaries,
experience-sampling methods, family interviews, and experimental studies of task
choice and persistence at tasks. Comparisons with other common strategic
approaches to personally-risky situations (e.g., self- handicapping) will be
made, and the relative costs and benefits of these strategies will be assessed
across a range of college and non-college student populations and environments.
The investigators assume that individuals can shift their strategies to fit the
special demands of a changing environment, and analyses over time and in
different life environments will test this basic premise of personality
mutability. The Principal Investigator is well-known as a highly productive
scholar.
