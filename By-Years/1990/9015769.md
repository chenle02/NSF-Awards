Atmospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants will be studied at a rural
mountain site in the Shenandoah Mountains of Virginia, a region surrounded by
natural hydrocarbon emissions and downwind of the industrialized midwest and the
urbanized eastern seaboard. Measurements of nitric oxide, ozone and UV light
will be co-located and coincident with measurements of non- methane
hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids, particulate and gaseous
inorganic anions and cations, organic nitrates, hydrogen peroxide and organic
hydroperoxides, which are to be measured in clear air, interstitial air in
cloud, and in two descrete size fractions of cloud water. The data sets will be
combined and used to investigate net ozone production and oxidants in clear and
cloudy air at a forested rural site with variable hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide
concentrations. The combined data sets will be further used to elucidate
mechanisms of natural hydrocarbon oxidation. The measurements represent the
first concurrent set of measurements in the gas and aqueous phases of non-
methane hydrocarbons, their partially oxidized products (carbonyl compounds,
carboxylic acids, organic hydroperoxides, organic nitrates), and the factors
controlling ozone and other oxidants in-cloud.
