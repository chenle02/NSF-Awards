This research concerns the hard-core lattice gas model on the integer lattice,
with special emphasis on the square lattice. The project includes the following
problems: (i) To establish a rigorous, quantitative connection between the rate
of approach to equilibrium of certain discrete dynamics and the uniqueness of
(infinite--volume) Gibbs measure for the hard-core model on general graphs (ii)
To analyze the rate of mixing of certain dynamics with the intention of
improving the existing bounds on the critical activity of the hard-core model on
the square lattice. (iii) To investigate the role of percolation and other
techniques in this context. In graph-theoretic terms, one of the objectives is
to generate independent sets of a large n by n grid with probabilities favoring
the bigger independent sets, in particular, with hard-core distribution with
activity > 1. The proposal also includes a student project on estimating the
mixing rates of Markov chains on combinatorial structures, whose counting
function is the nth Catalan number.

The lattice gas model is of independent interest and significance to researchers
in statistical physics, theory of computing, probabilistic combinatorics, and
communication networks. The easiest-to-describe motivation is that of a
telephone (loss) network with Poisson arrival rates and independent holding
times for calls. The hard constraint demands that a call be accepted/active only
if all the neighboring cells (neighborhood according to an arbitrary topology)
are inactive. The PI hopes to contribute to the understanding of the connections
between spatial correlations (i.e. the effect of the presence of a call in one
location on calls at reasonably far locations) and the convergence of the
dynamics (i.e. the rate at which the network approaches, if it eventually does,
a unique stable configuration of active calls).
