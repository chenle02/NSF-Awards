This project involved the construction of a cryogenic high vacuum apparatus for
the use of undergraduate students enrolled in Physical Chemistry Laboratory,
Individual Research Studies, and/or Physical Inorganic Laboratory. The equipment
consists of a cryostat with its corresponding vacuum line, two deposition lines,
a diode array spectrophotometer and appropriate lamp sources for photochemical
experiments. For the two laboratories, the experiments include matrix
investigation on the spectrum of isolated HCl, thermal ozonolysis reactions, and
photochemically induced isomerizations (IR source). In addition, several
undergraduate research projects are being done in the areas of atmospheric
chemistry, laser deposition of thin films, solid state chemistry and lanthanide
chemistry. These experiments provide undergraduates in the areas of chemistry,
physics, chemical engineering and materials science with the opportunity to gain
hands-on experience with vacuum technology, cryogenics and spectroscopic
techniques. The institution is contributing to this project in an amount equal
to the NSF funds.
