Partial funding (50%) is requested for purchasing a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer to
be shared by ten research groups. Michigan State University will provide a 50%
match for the acquisition of the instrument. The spectrometer will be dedicated
to the structural analysis and mechanistic studies of biomacromolecules,
including proteins (H. Yan, W. Wells, R. Hausinger, R. Hollingsworth, J. Preiss,
S. Triezenberg and J. Frost), nucleic acids (K. Dunbar and D. Nocera),
carbohydrates (R. Hollingsworth and F. Dazzo), and metabolites (J. Frost). It
will be located in the Max T. Rogers NMR Facility, a shared resource open to the
University research community. The NMR Facility staff will be responsible for
the maintenance and operation of the instrument. Acquisition of the requested
instrument will greatly enhance the research infrastructure at Michigan State
University. It will impact all the research projects that require NMR
characterization, facilitate development of collaborative research in
biomolecular NMR, enhance graduate and postdoctoral training, and help
recruitment of new faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. It will
also impact the expanding activities in structural biology and biotechnology on
the campus.
