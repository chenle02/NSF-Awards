9450319 Wyche Brown University proposes to expand its Summer Research-Early
Identification Program (SR-EIP) in the biomedical sciences to a year-round
research and career oriented experience for highly motivated Brown
underrepresented minority students in the life sciences and engineering. The
program, Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS) at Brown University, will
involve talented students from the freshman through senior year and expand the
career options for those students during the four-year period of the proposal.
Students will be matched with faculty sponsors who will provide mentorship,
guidance, and a first-rate research environment starting in the freshman year.
During the summer following the freshman year, students will participated in a
nine- week program comprising a continuation of the research experience,
seminars and field trips, weekly research colloquia by Brown faculty and outside
speakers, and visits to industrial companies. During the junior and senior year,
students will be encouraged to apply to Brown's Ph.D. programs and to other
highly selected graduate schools. One measure of the RCMS experience's success
at Brown will be the number of recruits to graduate degree programs. The
program's goal will be to produce a minimum of 15 pre-doctoral candidates by the
year 2000.
