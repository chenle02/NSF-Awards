9801726 Mikhalkin Mikhalkin will analyze how algebraic characteristics determine
topological properties of real algebraic varieties. The subject was pioneered by
Harnack and Hilbert over a hundred years ago; the introduction of modern
topological techniques to the subject by Arnold and Rokhlin resulted in
substantial development of this theory in dimensions 1 and 2 over the past 3
decades. The investigator will continue the study in these dimensions; of
special interest here are curves which arise as visible contours of surfaces. He
will also consider the case of dimension 3 in connection with the recent work of
Kollar introducing the Minimal Model Program into the subject. In Optics,
Mechanics and Robotics, most configuration spaces appear with natural real
algebraic structures; e.g., the configuration space of any mechanical linkage
arises as the intersection of quadratic hypersurfaces. The visible contours of
surfaces appear in computer vision problems. ***
