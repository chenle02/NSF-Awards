The main science goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of
physical processes that occur before, during, and after the eruption of arched
magnetic field structures on the Sun that are filled with plasma, a hot gas of
electrons and ions. The solar atmosphere is a chaotic stew of such arched
magnetoplasma structures that cover broad spatial and temporal scales. The tiny
ones are the size of California; the Earth would be barely noticeable inside a
big one. The arched magnetoplasma structures efficiently confine plasma until
they become unstable and erupt. Some of these eruptions drive extremely intense
energetic events that influence systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth.
To get insight into the eruption processes, highly reproducible arched
magnetoplasma eruptions will be generated and studied in a laboratory experiment
at UCLA. In addition, collaborative efforts between plasma and solar physicists
will be initiated to enhance the impact of this project in broader areas of
physics. This project will also provide educational opportunities to high-school
students and train a graduate student towards his/her
doctorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contemporary models of solar eruptions attempt
to explain initiation and evolution of arched magnetoplasma structures on the
Sun. It is difficult to test these models by solely relying on constraints
provided by remote observations, especially since key elements (such as
magnetic-field and plasma flow in the corona) are not directly measured. In this
project, a series of specially designed laboratory plasma experiments will be
conducted to simulate the eruption of arched magnetoplasma structures under a
variety of scenarios on the Sun. These experiments will provide data with a high
spatio-temporal resolution in three dimensions and will have the flexibility of
testing a variety of models of solar eruptions, such as dynamic injection of
magnetic flux into an arched magnetoplasma and slow-storage of magnetic energy
driving a fast eruption. The arched magnetoplasma will evolve in a large
background plasma produced by another source. Thousands of identical eruptions
will be routinely produced and their evolution will be recorded using movable
diagnostic probes and a fast CCD camera. To complement these studies, remote
observational results on solar eruptions will be compared with the laboratory
results for few selective cases. These research efforts are expected to
contribute to a wide range of topics relevant to the Sun such as coronal mass
ejections, loss of equilibrium due to force imbalance in an arched flux rope,
and excitation of waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere.
