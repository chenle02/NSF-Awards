PYI:Improved characterization of the mehanical properties of thin films and
ion-implanted surfaces will allow optimization of the surface properties
produced by these techniques, leading to improved performance of any number of
optical, electronic and mechanical devices. The goal to perform numerical
simulations of the indentation process and test them with the use of our
nanohardness tester, one of the few in the country. The high precision and
resolution of the nanohardness testers allows one to measure properties on much
smaller scales than a microhardness tester, thus providing the capability of
studying thin layers. Large deformation finite element techniques will be used
to study several effects associated with the testing of the properies of thin
films and implanted layers.
