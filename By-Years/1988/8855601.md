The Brooklyn Children's Museum will create a 3,000 square foot natural science
exhibition, "Animals Eat", that will provide interactive experiences that assist
children in formulating appropriate concepts of living things. The exhibition
and accompanying educational materials will be targeted at children aged 7-10
years old, and will utilize recent research on how children conceptualize
biological phenomena. It will focus on familiar animals and on the processes of
eating because many observable aspects of the natural world are mediated by the
quest for food. The exhibit, capitalizing on existing living collections, will
be developed and designed using a variety of interview techniques and formative
testing of exhibit prototypes to insure that the content is both appropriate for
children and that the exhibition results in successful learning experiences. A
broad range of exhibition techniques, including museum objects, interactive
units, games, and video will be used. The exhibition will reach more than a
million visitors during its five year life. "Animals Eat" will be the first in a
series of new core exhibitions at the museum. NSF's award will be supported by
more than $320,000 in cost sharing.
