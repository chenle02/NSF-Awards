This workshop aims to allow leading and upcoming US researchers in EEID research
to communicate and synthesize current knowledge of epidemiology, ecology and
evolution of infectious diseases in an international arena. By identifying and
assessing major gaps in data, information and knowledge in the EEID, this
workshop is going to contribute to the global community's effort and advance our
ability and skills in predicting and mapping hot-spots, hot-moments, emergence,
spread, and persistence of infectious diseases in the near
future.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts mainly center around the long-term development
of research priority areas and mechanisms for joint research and education
activities in EEID between the US and other international
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
