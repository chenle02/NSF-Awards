This project is comprised of theoretical studies of the excitation, alteration,
and destruction of the class of large organic molecules known as polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These molecules are detected by their
characteristic spectra in observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in our
own Milky Way and other galaxies. Logically, they would have been present in the
original material that formed our Solar System. But the fragility of PAH
molecules implies that they would not have been expected to survive in Solar
System bodies, except possibly in comets. Detecting PAHs in comets would
establish an important chemical link between the ISM and the Solar System. PAHs
have not been unambiguously detected in the observed infrared spectra of comets,
in part because the expected infrared emission spectra and destruction rates of
PAHs in cometary environments are not adequately understood. This is the problem
that the proposal aims to address. The Principal Investigator and a supported
graduate student will study the photoexcitation, photoionization, and
photodissociation of PAH molecules and their ions in cometary comae illuminated
by the Sun. They will calculate, using numerical statistical mechanics
techniques, the emission spectra and destruction rates of 23 representative
specific PAH molecules and their ions, as well as three nitrogen-substituted
PAHs appropriate to nitrogen-rich comets and generic "astro-PAH" models
approximating the interstellar species. The goal is to create a web-based
"library" of the emission spectra and photodissociation and photoionization
rates of PAH molecules as a function of distance from the Sun. By comparing
observed cometary spectra the model spectra from the library, researchers will
be able to constrain PAH production and destruction rates and interpret
observational detections and non-detections.
