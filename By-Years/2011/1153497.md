Two particularly important Earth processes are "hot spot" volcanism, where
plumes of material from deep in the earth produce volcanic islands and chains
such as Hawaii, Galapagos, Azores and Iceland, and the production of oceanic
crust by magmatic and tectonic processes (the intrusion and eruption of melts
and faulting) at mid-ocean ridges. Much about these processes remains poorly
understood because they occur well below the ocean surface. Iceland is an
exceptional locality where the coincidence of the Iceland Hot Spot with the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge has produced exceptionally thick (25 km) crust, and brought the
seafloor to the surface, where it serves as a natural laboratory, and its
tectonic and geologic features can be examined in detail. This project has the
aim of improving, by direct observation, a number of processes that are known to
occur on mid-ocean ridges where they cannot be directly observed; among them are
propagating rift zones, migrating faults and large-scale block rotations. In
addition to improving our understanding of global rift processes, this project
has a number of educational and other broader impacts: training for graduate and
undergraduate students, international collaboration (with scientists in
Iceland), and broad participation on the Syracuse University LAVA Project, and
education and outreach activity.
