This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr. Bradly Baker, South Dakota
School of Mines, to request funds are travel to China to finalize a research
project on the effects of land use change on reactive biogenic compounds in the
atmosphere. He plans to develop a cooperative research proposal with Dr. Jianhui
Bai of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
to compare the effects of developing grasslands into range and cropland on the
regional air quality between the selected sites in Inner Mongolia and South
Dakota. The success of this research can enhance our understanding of regional
air quality as a result of land use changes.
