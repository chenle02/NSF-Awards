The Einstein equations of general relativity govern the gravitational field by
constraining the curvature of a 4-dimensional space-time. This project concerns
a family of generalizations of these equations in the Riemannian setting, where
there is no difference between space and time, with an emphasis on trying to
determine which 4-dimensional spaces carry solutions of these equations. The
project will also help train a group of graduate students in mathematical
research through their participation in activities related to the project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project specifically seeks to discover and elucidate
fundamental links between curvature and topology in dimension four. One focus is
the construction of canonical metrics on compact manifolds, primarily by means
of Kaehler and conformal geometry. Another focus is on understanding the
relevant moduli spaces of solutions, and associated bubbling phenomena. Progress
in this area could have significant repercussions outside of pure mathematics,
especially because many of the geometrical questions to be investigated are
intrinsically linked to problems in classical and quantum gravity, as well to
other areas of theoretical physics. The project also includes training and
mentoring of students and junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
