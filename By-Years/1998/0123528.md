The demand for patent-based indicators has been growing steadily over the past
decades, both for macro and micro-economic analysis as well as for policy use,
as reflected in national S&T statistical publications like the NSF's Science and
Engineering Indicators and the European Commission's Report on European S&T
Indicators. To address a lack of a common database designed to construct
internationally comparable patent indicators, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) will conduct a project that will construct a
database and supporting methodology that will be accessible to Member
governments. This work consists of three broad modules: constructing the
database, developing an internationally agreed upon methodology and organizing a
workshop where a variety of users, data providers, and analysts can contribute
to the project. Major output of the project are: (1) a database available to all
participants in the project, regularly updated; (2) guidelines for calculating
indicators: published as working papers, they will feed into a revised version
of the OECD Patents manual; (3) indicators published on a regular basis by the
OECD and made available to institutions such as the NSF in OECD member
countries; (4) an international workshop in 2002 on patents indicators, with
participation of experts from the institutions supporting the project; and (5) a
compendium of patent statistics published in 2002, collecting new indicators, an
analysis of technological trends drawn from these indicators, and methodological
explanations.
