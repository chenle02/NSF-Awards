This project is building an application-specific computer system for biosequence
comparison. The architecture is suitable for a wide range of sequence comparison
methods, including the Smith- Waterman algorithm, BLAST, profile searches and
dictionary methods. In addition, the architecture is being integrated with
software for the statistical analysis of sequences using techniques such as
hidden Markov models. The core of the architecture is a linear array of SIMD
processing elements, each with a small local memory. A single chip can contain
64 of these elements, so a board with 20 chips will hold 1280 processors. The
processing elements have been tuned to sequence comparison by incorporating a
single cycle add-and-min instruction and a data-path for quickly recording the
results of the instruction. Software, I/O, and algorithms have been considered
in the design of this architecture; the resulting balanced implementation should
result in high performance at low cost.
