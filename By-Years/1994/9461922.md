This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate an innovative new class of
materials which can be applied to molten metal filtration. The proposed concept
utilizes ceramic foams fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as a porous
medium for the filtration of liquid metal. These materials will offer
dramatically increased strength, modulus, and corrosion resistance as well as an
increase in the permeability of the foam filter. The development of this
material will provide a high-strength, high surface area, high-permeability
refractory filter for use in the aluminum and steel production industries.
Reticulated refractory foam produced by CVD will provide the aluminum industry
with a higher strength, finer pore size, greater void fraction filter medium
than is currently available, and the non-oxide refractory materials desired by
the steel industry. CVD technology makes possible the production of reticulated
foams which require only 5-25% solid fraction with 100% open-pore faces, with
pore sizes as fine as 600 pores per linear inch (ppi), compared to the current
30%-35% solid fraction of sintered/bonded particle foams which are limited to 65
ppi. Ultramet will fabricate refractory ceramic foams by CVD and conduct
evaluations with regard to pore size and material choice. Information on the
priming head, molten metal permeability, particle capture efficiency, and
resistance to molten metal corrosion will also be generated.
