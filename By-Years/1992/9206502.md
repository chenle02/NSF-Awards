This project is intended to provide vastly improved chronology, using 40Ar/39Ar
methods for the age and duration of four Mesozoic flood basalt provinces of
South America. The anticipated applications of the data to be acquired include:
1) Precise and accurate dating of the inception and duration of volcanism in
each case to constrain models of flood basalt genesis, and the relations to
continental rifting and hotspots; 2) To test for possible correlations with mass
extinctions, particularly in the case of the Parana which may be related to the
Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event; 3) Precise and accurate temporal
calibration of a Mesozoic Apparent Polar Wander Path for the South American
continent to facilitate tectonic studies and comparison of South America's
motion with position of the Tristan da Cunha hotspot; 4) Calibration of the
Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) in a time region badly needing
improvement. This two-year project will involve joint fieldwork and publication
with Brazilian collaborators at the University of Sao Paulo; additional
collaborators are Dr. Mark Richards (Univ. California, Berkeley) and Dr. Robert
Coe (Univ. California, Santa Cruz).
