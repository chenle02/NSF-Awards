This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is made to
Dr. M. Frederick Hawthorne of the Chemistry Department, University of California
at Los Angeles. The research will focus primarily on the synthesis, structural
characterization, and reactivity of metallacarboranes of main-group and
lanthanide elements. Included will be studies of metallacarboranes incorporating
Mg, Sc, Y, La, Ce, Nd, Gd, Lu, Th, and U. These compounds are expected to
exhibit unusual structures and high reactivity. Difficulities in synthesizing
and characterizing lanthanacarboranes will be overcome by complexing the
lanthanide to porphyrins or macrocycles. Alkyl, hydride, and polyhydride
complexes of the lanthanacarboranes will also be synthesized. New carborane
sandwich complexes of In, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, As, and Sb will be prepared as will
low-valent sigma-bonded carborane complexes of Si, Ge, Sn, P, and As. Finally,
carborane anions will be used as supports for dialkylaluminum cations. %%% The
new carborane and metallacarborane species synthesized are expected to exhibit
new types of bonding and reactivity. Not only will the results increase
fundamental understanding of main group and cluster compounds, but materials
useful for the synthesis of additional complexes of this type will be developed.
Such compounds gain importance when their potential utility for development of
electronic or polymeric materials is considered. In addition, the hydride
species may be effective catalysts for C-H bond activation.
