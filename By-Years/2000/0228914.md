The investigators will use existing coordinated measurements from low-, mid- and
high-latitude instrument cluster sites to investigate the impact of short-period
gravity waves on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. In
particular, the study concentrates on the sources and seasonal variability of
these waves. Instruments to be used include airglow imagers, wind and
temperature lidars, and radars. The investigators will use coincident
observations of gravity waves and height-resolved measurements of the wind and
temperature field throughout the MLT region. By together data available from
several key sites with state-of-the-art modeling capabilities, they will study
the regional effects of wind filtering on the wave flux transfer into the MLT
and identify their dominant sources under differing source conditions. The study
is essential to understand the observed seasonal variability and to help
quantify the regional impact of small-scale gravity waves on the MLT region.
These results will have application to studies of global change and space
weather effects on technical systems.
