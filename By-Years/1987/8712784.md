The exploitation of cell surface receptors for selective cell separation
processes holds great promise for a wide range of applications. The fundamental
engineering principles and underlying biochemical/biophysical phenomena to be
generated by the proposed projects are expected to be generalizable to a very
diverse range of potential cell separation processes. In addition to intrinsic
receptor/ligand (binding molecule) biochemical interactions, there are a number
of biophysical considerations which affect the selectivity and yield of
receptor-mediated cell separation processes. The PIs propose a set of
complimentary projects aimed at a quantitative understanding of the influence of
key parameters on receptor-mediated adhesion of cells to a ligand-coated
surface. Specifically, they will investigate the affects of receptor and ligand
densities, receptor mobility, receptor/ligand binding affinity, temperature, and
fluid shear rate on receptor-mediated cell separations. Model systems will
include antigen-coated polymeric microspheres and cultured neuroblastome cells,
with appropriate antibody and lectin ligand-coated surfaces. This grant
application is an excellent example of the type of cross-disciplinary proposal
we wish to see in the Engineering Directorate's Biotechnology Program. The
Principal Investigators are considered well qualified to carry out the proposed
research and I recommend funding of this proposal for three years in accordance
with the revised budget.
