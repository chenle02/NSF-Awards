The objectives of this research are to better understand the magnitude, depth
and timing of changes in upper intermediate waters off southern California in
relation to decadal to millennial scale climate change and test the relationship
of changes along the California margin to global climate signals associated with
deglaciation events of the late Quaternary. The hypothesis that tropical changes
preceded high-latitude changes will be tested by comparing records of
ventilation changes in intermediate waters with surface water records. The study
will focus on well known transitions and intervals of rapid climate change, such
as Terminations 1A and 1B and interstadials 3, 4, and 5. Multiproxy analyses,
including stable isotope analyses of benthic and planktic foraminifers, Mg/Ca
analyses of benthic and planktic foraminifers and coiling ratios of selected
planktic foraminifers will be done at decadal-scale resolution across the
critical intervals in piston cores recovered from the Santa Barbara Basin.
