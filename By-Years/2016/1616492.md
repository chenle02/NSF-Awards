The ability to understand and manipulate the behavior of cells is currently
limited. In this project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the
Carnegie-Mellon University (US) and the University of Bristol (UK), open source
computational tools will be developed that will permit microscopic images of
live cells (T lymphocytes) that mediate immune responses to be converted into
computer models. These models will capture from the microscopic images the
behavior of the proteins that constitute the signaling pathways and networks
that underlie and control the behavior of the cells, producing a detailed
understanding of the mechanisms by which T cell immune reactions are controlled.
Interdisciplinary training in cell biology and computer science will be provided
to graduate and undergraduate students (including members of groups
underrepresented in science), and open access movies designed to promote
interest in STEM fields will be produced for K-12 students. These movies will be
developed through partnerships with Pittsburgh-area schools serving primarily
students from underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Movies
capturing fluorescence images of proteins (and determination of cell-wide
protein phosphorylation) will be used to develop open source software tools that
will generate and interpret spatiotemporally aligned maps of 35 key molecules
involved in T lymphocyte signaling. The spatiotemporal maps will be used to
infer potential signaling complexes, and the apparent affinities and potential
causal relationships amongst proteins involved in T lymphocyte
signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative US/UK project is supported by
the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council.
