A Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer is acquired. This will be used
to study adsorbates and surface chemistry on submicron nonporous single-crystal
particles of oxides such as alumina or titania. The geometry of these particles
is established by high- resolution transmission electron microscopy; adsorbate
behavior is then observed using FTIR and temperature-programmed desorption. A
similar approach is applied to the study of small metal particles supported on
these oxides. This work is also relevant to the chemistry of ceramic-ceramic
interfaces.
