This project allows students in a two-year technology program to study process
control in a state-of-the-art training laboratory. This laboratory, equipped
with programmable logic controllers, permits students to apply their
understanding of classicsal control theory within a totally integrated
technological setting. These students are being prepared to function in
industrial environments that are increasingly moving toward automated
manufacturing processes. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
