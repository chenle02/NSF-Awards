The focus of this research is to optimize and expand the scope of asymmetric
C-H insertion chemistry by expanding the range donor groups that can be
incorporated into donor/acceptor-substituted carbenoids. First,
vinyldiazoacetates will be used as the carbenoid precursor with subsequent
modification of the vinyl group. Second, methods for in situ generation of
carbenoid precursors will be developed. Third, a combined C-H insertion/Cope
rearrangement will be explored.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Huw M.L Davies of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY at
Buffalo. Dr. Davies will focus his work on the development of methodologies for
metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations. The use of donor/acceptor-
substituted carbenoids to increase the scope of C-H insertion chemistry will be
highlighted by this research. The project has potential broader impact for the
pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries and the work provides an excellent
venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral
associates.
