The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make infrared (IR) thermal imaging more
affordable and widespread. Thermal imaging is used for firefighting, warfighter
night vision, mechanical monitoring, and automotive safety, in particular. The
majority of pedestrian fatalities could potentially be prevented by automotive
night vision cameras; however, current infrared lenses are cost-prohibitive,
limiting their adoption. The proposed project will advance the development of a
transparent IR material that can lower imaging costs. Benefits will include
lighter night vision goggles in defense applications, greater deployment of
thermal imaging in automotive markets, and more accurate machine monitoring for
industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new class of chalcogenide
optical polymers for infrared imaging applications. Most mass-produced lenses,
such as those in smartphones, are made of polymers that are transparent in the
visible but opaque in the IR. The proposed sulfur-based polymer is based on new
chemical synthesis and infrared fingerprint engineering. The proposed project
will address the trade space defined by infrared transparency, encouraging
higher chalcogen content; and thermomechanical stability and processability,
encouraging higher organic content. In addition, the material's plastic nature
enables novel optical designs that could potentially employ state-of-the-art
freeform concepts currently rarely used in infrared imaging. Such designs can
lead to more compact, lighter, and higher performance optical systems for a
range of infrared imaging applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
