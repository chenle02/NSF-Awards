This project focuses on sub-femtosecond pulse compression and sub-cycle pulse
shaping. The essence of the technique is adiabatic preparation of a macroscopic
molecular ensemble in a single coherent superposition-state. This preparation is
accomplished by two transform-limited nanosecond laser pulses, slightly detuned
from the Raman resonance. Then a third, femtosecond laser pulse is applied, with
duration a few times longer than the molecular period. Molecular motion
modulates this pulse to produce a wide spectrum of discrete sidebands, which can
be used to synthesize a short train of single-cycle pulses. The broader impact
involves the education of students and numerous potential applications.
