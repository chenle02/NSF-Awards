The single mathematical theme of this multiple topic research program is
singular integral equations of the first kind, the analysis of which is known to
be difficult. One subarea of the research is concerned with the nonunique
solutions of such equations. In another subarea, the issue to be resolved is the
region of convergence of the iterative procedure devloped by the PI. The
research rersults will have immediate implications on several application areas.
One is the variety of ways in which self-consistent triaxial models of
elliptical galaxies can be constructed from different stellar orbits with the
correct total mass distribution. Another is slow viscous flow past rigid bodies
such underwater submarines.
