This multidisciplinary project at the University of Idaho, in cooperation with
The National Judicial College and The National Tribal Justice Center, aims to
enhance access to the legal materials of American Indian tribal systems through
creation of a nationwide, web-accessible electronic database of tribal court
opinions, tribal codes and constitutions, and related legal materials. The
resultant product, the Tribal Law Reporter digital library, will be fully
searchable and accessible on the worldwide web through its own web address and
by hyperlink from web pages maintained by The National Tribal Justice Center,
and The National Judicial College, and the University of Idaho. In addition to
designing, creating, updating, and maintaining the project database, search
engine, and web interface, the project participants will enter into contractual
agreements with tribal courts and councils for permission to make their court
decisions, codes and constitutions available through the project digital
library. Other legal materials, including selected federal and state court
opinions addressing federal Indian law, treaties, and United States Statutory
and regulatory provisions affecting Indian rights and tribal governance will
round out the legal materials accessible through the digital library. In
addition, the project participants will provide training in the use of the
database and in conducting legal research more generally to tribal court judges
and members of tribal councils.
