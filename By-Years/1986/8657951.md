The PI is a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) and describes her research as
follows: Computer-aided-design (CAD) techniques play a major role in the design
and performance of Millimeter-wave Monolithic Integrated Circuits. Despite the
need, none of the existing CAD capabilities can really work well for designs
intended for very high frequencies. This project aims at developing accurate CAD
algorithms for characterizing shielded-microstrip interconnects such as via-
holes in the mm-wave range. The method to be applied for the solution of the
above problem is a Finite Element Method for Integral Equations. The advantage
of this method over other existing ones is its ability to solve both horizontal
and vertical discontinuities. The above analytical technique can provide a
rigorous field solution for any microstrip interconnect with as many of the
involved physical factors incorporated and possible including: surface waves,
radiation, dielectric losses and n=mutual interactions between circuit elements.
