9553874 Wallace The Arizona Mineral Museum and the Flandrau Science Center at
the University of Arizona will use this planning grant to develop a new
interpretive exhibit "Minerals, Mining, and Mexico: A Cultural Bridge to
Science." The University of Arizona Mineral Museum is about to receive the
Miguel Romero mineral collection which is one of the most complete collections
of Mexican minerals that exists. It contains over 8500 specimens and this
collection plus their present collection will bring into being one of the finest
regional mineral collections available. With it they will develop exhibits and
programming that explore minerals and mining of Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
With this planning grant, they will explore the exhibition and programming
opportunities to realize their vision of creating a "living and engaging museum
that promotes an understanding of basic science principles and an appreciation
for the beauty and economic importance of minerals in the context of the
historical and cultural perspective of the New World." The planning activities
will include meetings of the advisory committee, visits to other museums, and
development of two prototype exhibits. At the end of the twelve-month planning
period they will have an overall script for the exhibit and recommendations for
individual exhibit units, a traveling exhibit version, and curriculum materials
for use by formal educators.
