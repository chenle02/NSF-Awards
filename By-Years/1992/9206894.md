Mammal fossils from 14 sites distributed along the central Mississippi River
valley from southern Missouri to northern Iowa will be used to reconstruct
paleoclimatic changes for the last 20 ka. To accomplish this project faunal
remains (ca. 4500-5000 specimens) from seven sites will be identified and
analyzed. Fossils from four sites have already been identified and analyzed and
data from electronic catalogs can be captured for analysis in this study. An
additional four sites have been analyzed and published; their data will be
encoded from the literature. Taphonomic investigations will assist in defining
the size of the catchment areas for the faunal samples. Radiocarbon dates will
established absolute chronologies. Bone dates will be based on two amino acid
fractions (proline and hydroxyproline) to insure the accuracy of dates and to
directly date individual species of small mammals. Quantitative paleoclimatic
reconstructions will be based upon both Climate Space Sympatry (CSS) and
Response Surface Analysis (RSA). These techniques, or variations thereof, have
provided paleoclimatic interpretations of beetles and vegetation, respectively.
Comparisons of these two techniques for the mammalian database should elucidate
local and regional variations. The mammalian RSA will be directly comparable to
the pollen RSA; therefore, it should provide another means of examining local
and regional climate patterns. Results from this project will document mammalian
responses to global warming in the late Quaternary, but they should also
facilitate knowledge of potential affects for future climate change.
