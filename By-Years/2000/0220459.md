Quantifying the Effects of Swell on the Air-Sea Momentum Flux&lt;br/&gt;W.
Drennan&lt;br/&gt;RSMAS&lt;br/&gt;Field measurements of momentum fluxes and
velocity profiles will be used to help derive a new parameterization of air-sea
fluxes under multiple roughness scales. Near-surface turbulence will be measured
from an air-sea interaction spar buoy (ASIS) at a marine site in the Baltic Sea.
Directional wave measurements will be made from ASIS and two waverider buoys.
Meteorological measurements will be made from a nearby tower. This site was
chosen to provide a regime of swell aligned with the wind field, a wide-range of
atmospheric stability and a low-moderate wind-regime. The data will be analyzed
to derive a better relationship between surface roughness and momentum flux in
swell dominated or mixed sea regions. Incorporation of the new results into
state-of-the-are coupled models should lead to improved forecasts of hurricanes
and tropical storms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
