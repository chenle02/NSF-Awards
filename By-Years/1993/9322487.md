9322487 Shoemaker The impending collisions of the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 on Jupiter are of major interest in terms of testing a wide range of
theories on cometary, collisional, and atmospheric shock conditions and
processes. Dr. Shoemaker will lead a study that will attempt to simulate the
impacts on Jupiter. The model results can be used to predict observable effects
and to compare with observations after the event.
