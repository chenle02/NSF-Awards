This is interdisciplinary research in which applied mathematics and parallel
numerical simulations will be used to investigate pattern formation, transition
to turbulence, and transport for Rayleigh-Bernard convection. The limit of small
reduced Raleigh numbers and large aspect ratio will be emphasized since this
regime is amenable to analysis by singular perturbation methods and has been
extensively studied with high-precision laboratory experiments. Model equations
as well as the Boussinesq equations in two- and three-dimensional domains will
be studied for normal and binary fluids. A novel and central part of the work
will be the development of the convection codes on a 64-node shared-memory MIMD
Butterfly- Plus parallel computer (which is to be upgraded in a year to 128-
nodes of more powerful processors). Issues of parallel large- scale scientific
computing in a shared-memory context-especially algorithmic efficiency, memory
contention, and load balancing- will be examined for spectral-element multigrid
methods, which solve nonlinear partial differential equations with high
efficiency and accuracy on general domains using locally refinable meshes.
Advances in numerical analysis, parallel computations, model building, and the
physics of driven dissipative systems are expected.
