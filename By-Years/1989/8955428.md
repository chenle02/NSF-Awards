The University of Kentucky will initiate a two-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Environmental Science for 24 students entering grade 9. This
project offers promising Appalachian students at the junior high school level
laboratory, field, and classroom experiences in a multidisciplinary setting
related to the study of land forms and land uses, water quality, forest
management, and energy use, especially as they relate to mountain communities.
The goal of the program is to instill and maintain in students a high level of
interest and excitement about science and to provide them with information which
will help them understand and attain the preparation necessary to pursue such a
career.
