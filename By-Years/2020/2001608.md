This project will establish a new framework that connects the physics of certain
two-dimensional physical systems, called conformal field theories (CFTs), with
the mathematics of certain well-studied algebraic objects, called quantum
groups. Establishing such a connection will greatly advance our understanding of
both subjects, and provide novel tools for studying two-dimensional CFTs. In
implementing this project, new research opportunities will be created for
undergraduates and early graduate students. These research opportunities will be
supported by grant funding. The PI will also provide direct support for
preexisting programs which seek to increase access to mathematics among women
and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, one
component of the project is to find an equivalence of (ribbon tensor) categories
between the representation category of the so-called triplet vertex algebra, and
the representation category of small quantum SL(2). Such an equivalence was
conjectured by mathematical physicists in the mid-2000â€™s, and some explicit
progress has been made towards its resolution in recent works of the PI and
others. A positive resolution to this conjecture will provide the first direct
link between logarithmic CFTs and quantum groups, a phenomenon which should be
endemic among the most fundamental classes of logarithmic CFTs. A second
component of the project is the computation of the Balmer spectrum for small
quantum groups associated to arbitrary simple algebraic groups. This computation
will employ and establish new links between support theory and geometric
representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
