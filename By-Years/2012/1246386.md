The Multi-Service Exchange (MSX) platform facilitates an environment where the
advanced network functions are extended throughout campus over a Software
Defined Networking (SDN) solution, e.g., OpenFlow, de facto creating a dynamic
Science DMZ driven entirely by science application workflows. Its architecture
decouples the campus network operational mission from science data flows
dynamically. MSX makes the protocols and interfaces of the wide-area networks,
such as Internet2's ION, DYNES, perfSONAR, and others interoperable with the
campus SDN solutions such as OpenFlow. The MSX platform also provides an option
for data landing solutions, facilitated by a wide array of campus-facing NAS and
SAN storage interfaces. The platform is also made physically accessible to
campus researches for manually initiated, scheduled data
transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the main focus of this effort is to
integrate the advanced network functions with individual science applications,
algorithms and workflows. By concentrating predominantly on science applications
code, the MSX software development team helps domain scientists extricate
themselves from the need to maintain either a deep network-related knowledge or
specialized staff. The integration of the selected science applications with
advanced network technologies lets them treat any network function as a resource
- an integral part of their algorithms and workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
architecting the Multi Service Exchange in the most flexible, adaptable way, MSX
will establish a platform applicable to any campus, providing them with a point
from which to develop new (or terminate existing) services and make them
available to on-campus and off-campus researchers.
