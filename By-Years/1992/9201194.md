A quantitative study of submarine hydrothermal upflow zones with theoretical
reaction path modeling. The PI will use hydrothermal breccias from Mid Atlantic
Ridge, Hess deep and Troodos, in addition to the results from Hole 504B, to
study the relationship between actively venting hot springs and mid ocean ridge
and observed rock alteration styles within upflow zones in modern oceanic crust
ophiolities.
