This workshop will bring together approximately 25 ecologists and scientists in
related disciplines to discuss the response of ecological systems to large-scale
spatial and temporal variation in their environment. It will focus on: 1) the
basic research that is required to understand and predict the responses of
ecological systems to environmental change, and 2) the practical application of
ecological knowledge to address the serious changes in the environment of the
earth caused by the growing human population. The goal of the workshop is to
reach a consensus on a modest number of areas where increased research support
may be expected to result in major advances within the next decade. These
finding will be presented in two publications: 1) a scientific article in a
major interdisciplinary journal, and 2) a non-technical booklet designed for
distribution to government officials and funding agencies.
