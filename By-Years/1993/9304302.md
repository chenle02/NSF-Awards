9304302 Kappelman PI and an international team of collaborators will study the
paleontology (principally mammalian, including hominids), paleoecology,
paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and sedimentology, magnetostratigraphy, and
geochronology of the Miocene Sinap Formation of central Turkey. This well-
preserved, 6+-million-year- long section provides a key to large-scale
correlation in Europe. The biogeographical position of the strata as a
crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa will permit intercontinental
correlations and a calibrated sequence of Neogene mammalian evolution. ***
