ABSTRACT DMS-9706891 Nussbaum Nussbaum proposes research to gain insight into
the solutions of nonlinear functional differential equations or "FDE's".
Functional differential equations are equations in which the derivative of a
function x(t) is a specified function of the history of x up to time t. An
example which plays a central role in this proposal is ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)),
r=r(x(t)). Here f and r are specified functions, and a is a positive real. Under
natural assumptions on f and r and for a small, there exists a slowly
oscillating periodic solution x(t), dependent on a. Nussbaum will seek to
describe precisely the limiting shape of the graph of this solution x(t) as a
approaches zero. Nonlinear functional differential equations (sometimes called
differential-delay equations) have been suggested as models in a variety of
areas, particularly in biology. For example, A. Longtin and J. Milton propose
such equations in studying the human eye's pupil-light reflex; and M. Mackey and
J. Milton are led to consider nonlinear FDE's in their studies of oscillations
in the human body's red blood cell population. Considered from a pure
mathematician's viewpoint, the equations which arise are highly nontrivial. In
this proposal, Nussbaum studies classes of nonlinear FDE's which are, in part,
motivated by examples from biology; and we seek to understand the behaviour of
solutions of such equations.
