This project seeks to sponsor electrical engineering students to attend the IEEE
Power Engineering Society National meetings. The goal is to develop an
opportunity for students to be informed about the most recent developments in
research, engineering, construction, and operation in the power industry.
Opportunities for student attendance will be advertized nation wide, and women,
minorities and disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply for
sponsorship.
