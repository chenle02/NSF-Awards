This project by Feigenson and Carr will continue work on the volcanic rocks of
Central America. Although numerous inroads have been made towards understanding
arc magmagenesis, and an extensive sample set collected and analyzed, several
important aspects of arc petrogenesis remain to be developed. Volcanism in
Central America needs to be understood in terms of a workable geophysical model.
A recent development in this area can be tested with data from this arc, and
perhaps applied to convergent margin petrogenesis in general. Isotopic and trace
element data collected to date have documented the important role of a subducted
slab component in the source of Central American lavas. Other potential
components need to be carefully characterized to understand their importance.
Finally, a comprehensive suite of arc lavas analyzed for major and trace
elements and radiogenic and stable isotopes will be vital in understanding
intra-arc variations, as well as providing an important arc reference suite to
be used by other researchers for world-wide comparisons.
