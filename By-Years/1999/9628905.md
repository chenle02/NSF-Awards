This fellowship supports research and training in the area of metabolic
biochemistry. It addresses the important question: how do chloroplasts in the
cytoplasm of plant cells communicate with the nucleus? The proper development of
plant cells relies upon this communication. The mechanisms for this
communication are unclear even after many years of investigation and progress.
There is evidence that signals are relayed by the chloroplast and received by
the nucleus thus regulating specific genes. The project focuses on the identity
of these signals.
