Douglas 9707040 The investigator begins a study of multigrid methods for
computers whose performance is highly dependent on the cache utilization. The
project includes both algorithm development and realizations in code. For
structured problems in two dimensions, effective new algorithms can be devised.
For general, unstructured problems in either two or three dimensions, this is
much harder and requires a completely different approach. Two approaches are
planned. One is based on localizing graph connections of a sparse matrix
associated with the grid based problem. A second is based on a software tool
that re-orders the computation at run time to use the cache efficiently. In
addition, the investigator develops new nonlinear multigrid algorithms that can
robustly solve real applications. A new methodology is developed to coarsen
adaptively refined grids for problems in which current algorithms fail to
converge. Real world simulations of complex science and engineering problems
like climate, ocean, petroleum reservoir, and pollutant tracking modeling
require enormous amounts of computer time. Computers today have separate memory
modules that run at vastly different speeds. Normally, programs run at the speed
of the slowest memory in a computer. The investigator examines how to use the
faster memory modules instead of the slowest memory for the solvers needed to
run complex problems much faster.
