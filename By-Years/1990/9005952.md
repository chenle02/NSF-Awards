This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Alex
Nickon at the Johns Hopkins University. This investigation will afford new
insights into the structure and reactivity of highly reactive chemical
intermediates. The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Nickon will
center on rearrangements of carbenes to alkenes. The study will employ reactants
that are doubly labelled with carbon and deuterium to evaluate stereoelectronic
requirements for the rearrangements. The research will also focus on the
photochemical rearrangement of alkenes to carbenes, a process that is the
reverse of the normally observed pathway. This rearrangement is believed to
proceed via Rydberg excited states, which may have partially twisted geometries.
This reaction of strained reactants may provide a method for direct access to
anti-pyramidalized alkenes.
