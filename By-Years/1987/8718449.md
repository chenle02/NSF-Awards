The research efforts deal with the relationship between cardiac output and
pericardial pressure in swimming sharks and continues preliminary findings of
positive pericardial and enhanced venous pressures during activity. Using
indwelling catheters we will measure blood pressures and determine respiratory
blood gas levels in resting and active sharks and determine rates of
anaerobiosis as indicated by lactate levels. Finally we will begin to examine
effects of P0 , temperature, and swimming speed on the oxygen consumption rate
of swimming Triakis and determine its aerobic scope for activity. The research
deals with the energetics of locomotion in sharks using a water tunnel treadmill
that has been adopted for simultaneous measurement of bloodflow, oxygen
utililization, swimming motions, heart rate, etc. at various swimming speeds.
The results are important to our understanding of biomechanics of swimming in
fish. Dr. Louis E. Burnett (University of San Diego) plans to study blood gas
transport in a number of fish (mainly sharks) during exercise in a water tunnel
treadmill/respirometer. Particular emphasis will be placed on the role of pH and
carbon dioxide levels in regulating oxygen delivery to the tissues.
