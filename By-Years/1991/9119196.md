The application of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to the study of
rock deformation has been disappointing is spite of its apparent potential. The
limitations of this method are due to (1) incomplete or no characterization of
the dominant magnetic phases and (2) incomplete or no separation of the
contribution of ferri(o)- and paramagnetic minerals. The present approach
overcomes these limitations by (1) careful optical studies and (2) new methods
to measure components of the magnetic fabric. Complete characterization of the
magnetic mineralogy and textural relationships is a crucial element of the
project and will be carried out using optical (transmitted and reflected) and
(analytical) electron microscopy (SEM, microprobe), anisotropy of magnetic
remanence (pARMA) and low-temperature susceptibility.
