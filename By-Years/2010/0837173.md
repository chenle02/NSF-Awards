Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creativity has often been associated
with the arts, although creativity is also essential for innovative discoveries
and applications in science and engineering. An engineer should be innovative
and humanistic in addition to being technically competent. This project is
designed to actualize that vision. An overarching question that guides this
project is: How may the cognitive capacity of artistic, creative thinking inform
the development of creative problem solving in environmental engineering, which
is increasingly called upon to propose solutions for complex human and
environmental systems? This project focuses on both research and education to
address this concern by developing and implementing an interdisciplinary
sequence in the engineering undergraduate curriculum centered on synthesis and
design studios, and a series of faculty development workshops to help faculty
integrate creativity into their classrooms. The intellectual merit of this work
lies in framing this project within current research in psychology, cognitive
science, education, and engineering education. This project has broader societal
impacts as it is furthers understanding of how to teach students to be creative
and innovative thinkers so that they can be better prepared for tackling large
scale issues.&lt;br/&gt;
