Research will be carried out in rare kaon decay at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. Muonium to anti-muonium conversion will be studied at Los Alamos
National Laboratory and at the Paul Scherer Institute in Switzerland. These
experiments will probe the Standard Model and its possible extensions.
Sensitivities to the masses of particles that may mediate some of these decays,
extend to hundreds of TeV. In addition, experiments and the associated
instrumentation will be developed for radiative hyperon decay studies at the
Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility.
