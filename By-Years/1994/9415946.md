9415946 Beach This award will complete a previously-funded project in which the
authors built a new fiber-optic sensor and deployed it in two field experiments
to monitor sediment transport in the swash zone. This award will support
analysis of the data, to determine (1) the balance between erosion (by
infragravity waves) and accretion (by incident band energy); (2) the role of
microtopography, (3) the short-term distribution of resuspended sediment, and
(4) the importance of supercritical flow. The results will contribute to
understanding sediment erosion and redistribution on beaches. ***
