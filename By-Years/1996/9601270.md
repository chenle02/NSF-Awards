Hopkins, Lewis U of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign This proposal is for research
which examines the ways in which developers respond to information revealed
through government plans specifically for transportation. A model will be
developed which examines the plans for a light rail system in Metropolitan
Portland, Oregon. Measures used to evaluate responses include spatial and
temporal changes in land sales, land values, building permits, and land
improvements. A parcel level, date stamped data base is developed in which
transactions on landowner decisions and land values over time are recorded. In
the analysis of the impact of government plans, an animated GIS capability is
invoked over time to explore spatial and temporal lags among plan information,
regulatory or infrastructure actions, and private development decisions. The
research is grounded in a theoretical model and focuses upon the temporal
interrelationship between the decisions of developers and local governments as a
dynamic Stackleberg model of urban development. The proposed work also includes
a rich variety of empirical analysis options. The research will extend
understanding of the impact of government actions upon developers' behavior and
will also deepen the theoretical literature on urban development.
