Proposal: DMS-9971705

Principal Investigator: Alan Reid

This proposal is concerned with the structure of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.
Our interests are in so-called hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. In
dimension 3 some of our main aims are to study the existence and properties of
certain surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Other parts of the proposal deal
with interactions between number theory and algebra with hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
Previous work has shown how certain invariants arising from algebraic data
associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the geometry and topology
of the 3-manifold. In dimension 4 we will explore constructions of hyperbolic 4-
manifolds and how 3-dimensional manifolds can immerse in them. This is closely
connected to problems in cosmology.

Manifolds are fundamental objects which appear naturally in many places in
mathematics and physics. At present the study of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds
and the interplay between them is fundamental. For example, recently, the theory
of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds modeled on hyperbolic spaces has become central
to understanding the spatial geometry of the Universe. Our work hopes to reveal
more about these spaces. A major tool that we use in our studies comes from
number theory. As in the case of the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, the
interaction between number theory and our hyperbolic spaces is significant. It
is our intention to explore these connections.
