ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to produce a definitive descriptive
grammar of the Alabama language--a Native American language of the Muskogean
family of the southeast currently spoken by several hundred people on the
Alabama-Coushatta Reservation in East Texas. The grammar will include a
description of the phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, and
elements of the discourse structure of the language. Information on the language
will come from the investigator's own research, conducted since 1980, and from
continued field work with native speakers. In addition, information concerning
higher-level syntax, semantics, and discourse structure will come from the
analysis of a number of recordings including the following: recordings made from
1957- 1962 by an Alabama speaker, who elicited from elders historical and
cultural texts, as well as traditional myths and folktales; publicly recorded
speeches, possibly the first recordings of the language; and my own recordings
of contemporary stories, jokes, and conversations. This little-studied language
is one of the few remaining aspects of the heritage of the Alabamas and the
grammar will help in its preservation. The grammar will serve as a companion
just to the completed Alabama Dictionary as well as to a planned collections of
texts.
