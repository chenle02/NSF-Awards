This award funds an innovative research project to test for possible unintended
consequences of policies designed to achieve equity. It will use economic theory
and field experiments to test whether not hiring for jobs that are considered
“dangerous” (paternalistic discrimination) results in systematic and general
discrimination in the labor market. It also tests for whether this paternalistic
discrimination creates segregation into certain jobs. This research will provide
insights into the mechanisms through which hiring practices which may have
started with good intentions end up hurting the people they were intended to
help. The results of this research will provide inputs into the design of
policies to achieve equity in the labor market. The results will also improve
efficiency of the labor market, and thus increase economic growth and improve
the living standards for all Americans. The results would also help establish
the US as a global leader in using market mechanisms to achieve equity.

This award will fund an innovative research that combine a theoretical model of
paternalistic hiring with two field experiments with real applications to hiring
decisions for a night-shift job. The researchers experimentally vary whether
employers or workers are informed about safe employee transport home, thereby
observing both supply and demand responses to perceived increases in female
employee safety and welfare. The researchers complement the experimental results
with survey data to assess the: (i) effect of paternalistic discrimination on
horizontal and vertical general segregation, (ii) role of paternalism as a form
of systemic discrimination that restricts labor potential and work readiness,
and (iii) the potential of various policies to increase female employment across
different industries around the world. The results of this research will provide
inputs into policies to improve the functioning of labor markets, increase labor
productivity and economic growth, as well as reduce discriminatory hiring
practices. The results would also help establish the US as a global leader in
using market mechanisms to achieve equity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
