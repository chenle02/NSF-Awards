In Batson v Kentucky (1986) the U.S Supreme Court held that attorneys are not
allowed to make peremptory challenges based on race, however, research shows
that prosecutors continue to strike Black venirepersons at a higher rate than
White venirepersons (Rose, 1999, Sommers & Norton 2007). To date, we know little
about the psychological processes involved in making racially biased jury
selections. This project examines these processes using two studies. In one
study, the co-principal investigator examines whether prosecuting attorneys make
racially biased jury selections because of discrimination against Black
venirepersons or, whether this is a trial strategy to remove pro-defense
venirepersons. The second study examines whether stereotypes about the legal
attitudes of Black venirepersons or expectations of in-group/out-group bias
cause prosecuting attorneys to strike Black venirepersons more often than White
venirepersons.
