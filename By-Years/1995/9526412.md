9526412 Dry This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made to support
research in the location of cracks in structures, particularly leaks in pipes.
The method to be studied is to pass light through liquid filled hollow optical
fibers. The size and type of image that comes out the end of the broken fiber
can be correlated with the location of the crack. This project is to evaluate
the sensitivity of the method. ***
