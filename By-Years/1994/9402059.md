9402059 Carey Deep-sea cores provide the basic raw material for studies in
paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, sediment dynamics, and chemical
oceanography. The curation facilities provide an invaluable service to the
marine geology and geophysics and chemical oceanographic communities. Funds are
provided for the continued support for three years of the core repository at
URI. These funds will defray the costs of core handling, description, curation,
sample distribution and data management.
