This research develops a novel approach using pulse transmission technique to
measure in situ stress in deep geologic strata through boreholes. The study
develops a predictive model for stress distribution and stress-attenuation
relationships for various types of rocks. A Boreholes Ultrasonic device will be
designed and constructed. The device has multiple ultrasonic transducers
arranged in a drill stem with spring loaded coupling between the transducer and
the drill hole wall. Alterations of compression waves will be measured along the
points on the borehole surface and in situ stress distributions will be
calculated.
