9505200 Yanco This project will adapt general mobile robotics research to the
specific problem of a wheelchair robot. A wheelchair robot kit, with a notebook
computer providing the platform for the user interface, will be utilized to
create a low-cost, general-purpose wheelchair robot that can be used as a
navigational assistant in wheelchair accessible indoor environments. The system
is planned to be easy to use and to increase the efficiency of the user's travel
in the wheelchair. Seven women students at Wellesley College will be involved
with the Principal Investigator in the project. Since women are underrepresented
in computer science and engineering in general and in robotics in particular,
this project is particularly appropriate in the opportunity it provides to
expose women undergraduates to possibilities in research activities and to
encourage them to continue with further study in this area. With the planned
complementary educational activities, the project will also bring new technical
breadth to their computer science education at this liberal arts institution.
