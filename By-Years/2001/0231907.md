Drawing on the experience of the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban
Schools, especially through its work in Detroit's middle schools over the past
five years, a cornerstone experiment is proposed. A classroom-based study will
examine the use of palm-sized computers, in comparison to pencil-and-paper, in
supporting students carrying out two key science learning activities - concept
mapping and explaining. While there are good reasons to believe that these
learning activities, uniquely supported by the palm-sized computers, may well
lead to student achievement gains and improved attitudes toward science, the
data from this study will be most revealing. The proposed experimental study,
then, should help researchers and practitioners of the educational community
develop a deeper understanding of the educational costs and benefits of the
emerging handheld technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
