This research program is concerned with the analysis of various physical
problems whose mathematical formulation involves a singularly perturbed integral
equation. It will focus on (1) the development of systematic methods for
obtaining an asymptotic solution to such problems, and (2) the application of
the new methodology to a variety of relevant problems in science and
engineering. The research results will have an impact in technical areas such as
thermal and chemical diffusion, combustion, mechanical vibrations, epidemiology
and some electronic devices.
