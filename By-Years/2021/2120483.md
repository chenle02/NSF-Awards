This workshop seeks to develop and identify convergent research areas that will
improve digital and precision agriculture. The workshop will bring together
academics from a diversity of disciplines including humanities, economics,
genetics, computer science, quantum computing, communication, and social
science. Partners from other agencies and entities from across the US food
industry will also be participating in the workshop. The outcomes of this
workshop including a report will assist in identifying potential deliverables
and areas of convergent research that will benefit society by ensuring
resiliency of the U.S. food chain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will
incorporate the synthesis of key convergence research questions, engagement of
participants from a diversity of perspectives to develop approaches that are
best suited in identifying a pathway to deliverables and prototypes that will
enhance agricultural productivity. A report that summarizes the results of the
workshop will be presented and used to identify agricultural practices that take
advantage of recent advances in digital precision
agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
