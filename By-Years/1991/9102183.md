This Study will conduct a marine geophysical, geological, geochemical, and
chronological investigation of 19 seamounts in the Magellan, Marshall, and Wake
provinces in the western Pacific ocean. The goal is to document the Cretaceous
Expression of the South Pacific Isotopic and Thermal Anomaly. Laser fusion
40Sr/39Ar dating will provide the age control on the samples. Radiogenic isotope
geochemistry of mineral Separates of phenocrysts will be used to avoid seawater
alteration effects. Gravity data will be inverted with respect to elastic
thickness of the lithosphere and magnetic surveys will serve to determine the
magnetic paleopoles. Thus this work will provide constraints on the Cretaceous
extent of South Pacific Isotopic and Thermal Anamaly on Pacific plate motion
prior to 100 Ma, constraints on the Cretaceous apparent polar wander path, and
identification of potential hotspot chains.
