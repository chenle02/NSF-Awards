9355871 Clark This project, the Women's Triad Project for Science Education, is
directed toward enhancing gender equity in science education for teachers,
scientists, and San Francisco Unified School District students. The strategy
through which this mission will be accomplished centers around the establishment
of science clubs for middle school girls. Each club will be coordinated by a
team of two University of California, San Francisco women scientists, and one
woman middle school teacher who will all serve as mentors for the students. The
girls will gain hands-on experience in science investigation and use of tools,
as well as opportunities to apply their skills and knowledge to group projects.
The scientists will develop teaching and communication behaviors that foster
gender equity in their own interactions with students and colleagues over the
course of their careers. Workshops on gender equity will also be provided for
other science teachers, male and female, at all grade levels, improving the
overall climate for gender equity in the District. ***
