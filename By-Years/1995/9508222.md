The Pangean fit of South to North America leaves no space for the crust of
present southern Mexico and Central America, thus these areas formed after the
breakup of Pangean or arrived from elsewhere. Present information indicates that
these terranes have discordant geologic histories suggesting that their early
histories are unrelated. The Chortis block is the only terrane on the Caribbean
plate with a known Paleozoic and possible Proterozoic history, and is considered
an important key to solving the puzzle of Caribbean tectonics. This project will
conduct geochronologic analysis of the Chortis block to place structural events
in a firm temporal framework. These data, combined with available geologic,
structural and tectonics constraints, will allow testing of hypotheses relating
Chortis crust to specific sources in North America, and to test hypotheses
relating Tertiary tectonic transport of the Chortis block to the development of
the Caribbean plate.
