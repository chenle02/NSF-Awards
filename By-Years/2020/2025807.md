This award is partial support of the 2020 Symposium on Stakeholders Perspective
on the Bioeconomy as part of the meeting of the USDA S-1075 Multistate
Committee. The biobased economy has potential to produce biofuels and
bioproducts in an environmentally sustainable way. This consortia of researchers
from 35 land grant universities address barriers to a bioeconomy including
challenges in feedstock logistics and conversion
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annual meetings of the S-1045 multistate
committee are held to coordinate and share research from land grant universities
across the nation. Symposiums are organized with leading researchers and
speakers from funding agencies to share the latest research knowledge and
coordinate future research. The 2020 S-1075 Multistate Committee annual
symposium will be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The meeting is
planned to occur on July 9-10, 2020. The goal of the 2020 symposium is to
develop an understanding of the key challenges when trying to commercialize
bioenergy and bioproduct technologies. NSF funding will be used to support
graduate students to attend this symposium and to meet with member researchers
from approximately 35 land grant institutions. This is a meeting where the
students can interact with the entire sector of the bioeconomy including
researchers, producers, processors, financial sector and government agencies.
This will help in orienting the next workforce generation to challenges and
opportunities in the bioeconomy. The proceedings from the symposium will be
published in both hard and soft copy formats and distributed widely to
interested audience by S-1045 members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
