Smith, Harding 96-17126 Dr. Smith will continue his program of observational
studies of the relationship between dusty active galactic nuclei and luminous
starburst galaxies. The two phenomena starbursts, where rapid formation of
massive, hot, young stars produces high luminous energy output, and active
galactic nuclei, thought to be powered by gravitational energy as a massive
compact object accretes material at the nucleus of a galaxy -- are found
together in many galaxies and there is evidence that there may be a causal or
evolutionary relationship between them. Images will be obtained of galaxies to
determine the distribution of emissions and to separate extended emissions, so
that models for these galaxies can be constructed and theories about the
evolution of these systems may be directly tested.
