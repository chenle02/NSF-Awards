This project is concerned with free resolutions. The principal investigators
will study finite resolutions, with particular emphasis on the multiplicative
structures they may support and their role in linkage theory. Families of
resolutions will be investigated including resolutions of objects such as
algebras in the linkage class of a complete intersection, algebras defined by
residual intersections and powers of perfect ideals, canonical classes and other
class group elements, and modules of finite length over rings of a fixed
dimension. Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects arising from
the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest
and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics. It has widespread
applications in mathematics, computer science and physics.
