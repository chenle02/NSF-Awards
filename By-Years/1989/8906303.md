Partial funding is provided to support purchase of a Huber goniometer and to
upgrade X-ray detection equipment used for thin film studies. The equipment will
allow high resolution X-ray scattering studies of order and structure in various
types of thin films, including thin liquid crystalline films, ceramic and
superconducting films and amorphous magnetic films.
