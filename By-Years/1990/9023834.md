Little is understood of how environmental and social factors, particularly
territorial aggression, affect the breeding of migratory arctic birds.
Relationships between reproduction and environmental induced stress, where they
play an important adaptive role, are virtually unknown in high latitude species.
Many species arrive in the arctic,establish territories and eventually feed
their nestlings in a fraction of the time for temperate birds. Adherence to this
rigorous schedule, pairs must ignore environmental conditions that would
normally inhibit or delay breeding at temperate latitudes. Dr. Wingfield
proposes that these constraints have been met by adaptations of the endocrine
system in arctic birds. This study proposes to continue examining the
relationship between two potentially antagonistic hormones: corticosterone,
which directs behavior away from reproductive activities and towards survival
activities and testosterone, which mediates the aggressive behavior associated
with territoriality. In both hormone-behavior systems, Dr. Wingfield suggests
that the endocrine responses of arctic-nesting birds will show decrease
sensitivity to environmental stimuli, allowing more prolonged opportunities to
breed. The endocrine adaptations to be investigated in this research program may
elucidate physiological mechanisms by which polar animals avoid delays and/or
conflicting behaviors which might reduce their chances for successful
reproduction.
