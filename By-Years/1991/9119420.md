This project will provide a wide-ranging and detailed investigation of cellular
automata (CA) models as descriptions of ecological interactions in space and
time. CA models are essentially discretized versions of reaction-diffusion
models; they are closely related to patch-occupancy models for metapopulation
dynamics. The research program will construct models for competition, predation,
and predator-mediated coexistence. It will extend the usual CA approaches to
include substrate heterogeneity and disturbance size distributions. The analysis
of these models will include a range of non-spatial or mean-field properties
(state and species frequencies, mean alpha and beta diversities, interspecific
associations, and turnover rates) as well as explicitly spatial methods (fractal
dimensions, other scaling relationships, and wavelet analysis). The models will
be applied to a number of specific problems, including the relationship of
biotic and substrate heterogeneity, the contrast of CA models with the
corresponding spatially averaged patch-occupancy models, and the conditions
required for pattern generation in the ecological analogs of excitable media.
This research will provide new insights into spatial relationships of many basic
processes in population and community ecology.
