Professor Schoen is proposing research in the areas of Differential Geometry and
General Relativity. He is proposing to study solutions of the constraint
equations which are not time symmetric with an eye to the study of the general
Penrose inequality as well as an analysis of the stability of the constraint
manifold. The latter topic is important for understanding numerical stability
for the vacuum Einstein equations. Professor Schoen is also proposing to study
the construction of submanifolds which are calibrated by the special lagrangian
calibrating form. He plans to apply ideas from geometric measure theory to this
problem. He also plans to study hamiltonian stationary submanifolds in dimension
greater than two; in particular, the hamiltonian stationary tangent cones will
be studied. Professor Schoen intends to investigate stable minimal surfaces
which remain stable under coverings with the hope of showing that these are
holomorphic in general situations. Finally, he intends to study geodesic
completeness properties of hypersurfaces in Minkowski space of constant Gauss-
Kronecker curvature.

Professor Schoen's project will lead to a better understanding of solutions of
the Einstein equations of General Relativity. A better theoretical understanding
is essential for the success of accurate numerical modeling of solutions.
Numerical modeling is important for predicting the nature of the gravitational
radiation which arises from dynamic situations, and NSF currently has a large
project, LIGO, which is attempting to measure this radiation. He believes that
the theoretical work of this project will be helpful for the numerics. The
remainder of Professor Schoen's proposed work involves the use of geometric
methods to understand the behavior of surface interfaces, such as soap films and
soap bubbles, of varying dimension which arise in physical situations. These
natural geometric objects can be used to describe subtle properties of the
spaces in which they reside. These spaces arise in physical models such as
string theory where they play a basic role.
