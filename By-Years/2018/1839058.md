This award provides funding for US participation for the conference "Recent
Advances in Functional Analysis", which will be held at Kent State University,
Ohio, USA on October 11-14, 2018. The conference focuses on recent developments
in Analysis, especially in the field of functional analysis. Presentation and
discussion will concentrate on the specific topics of operator theory and
geometry of Banach spaces, weighted bounds for Calderon?Zygmund operators,
properties of Lipschitz mappings, asymptotic geometry of normed spaces, and
probabilistic methods in functional analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers
not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
More information will be made available at the conference webpage:
http://www.math.kent.edu/RAFA2018/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
