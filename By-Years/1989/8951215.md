The goal of this project is to provide state-of-the-art instruction is computer
interfaced high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. This
project allows the expansion of the capabilities of Central Florida to teach the
principles and practices of modern chromatographic separation techniques.
Student interest in the laboratory is raised to a high level because of the use
of microprocessor controlled HPLC interfaced to computers. This equipment is
used in organic, analytical, and biochemistry laboratories. Students are better
prepared for both industrial positions as well as graduate school as a result of
applying these techniques in the laboratory. The university will match the award
with an equal amount of funds.
