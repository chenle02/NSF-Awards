The conference "Geometry, Topology and Complexity of Manifolds, and applications
to Biology" will be held at the University of California, Berkeley, during 20-22
May, 2016. The aims of this conference are to bring together mathematicians,
computer scientists and biologists to discuss recent developments in
understanding geometry of three dimensions and related algorithms, and how these
ideas can be applied to biology.

There have been many advances in the last few years in the area of 3-dimensional
topology and geometry, algorithms to solve geometric problems and to understand
their complexity, and applications of ideas from topology and geometry to
biology. In order to make these developments known to a larger mathematical
audience and to establish connections, this conference will bring together
leading experts in these various fields along with early career mathematicians
and scientists. The conference web page is at
