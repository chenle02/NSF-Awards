This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
a low cost micro droplet generator for use in creating large scale micro arrays
for biotechnology applications. Conventional methods are expensive and require
cleaning operations and chemicals which can be eliminated with the disposable
pump unit thereby reducing the costs for pumps, chemicals, cleaning hardware and
associated operations. Principal aspects of the development plan are insuring
that drop volume and shape are of highest quality among disposable pump units.

The commercial application of this project will be in the potentially large
market for production of microarrays.
