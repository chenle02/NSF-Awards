Laboratory experiments are being integrated into the undergraduate math
curriculum. In particular, two courses are being affected - Applied
Computational Mathematics and Fourier Series and PDEs - and changes are being
made in other undergraduate courses on mathematical modeling, dynamical systems,
and control. For example, 1) students are able to take experimental data which
they have collected themselves and program and implement the routines to analyze
it using discrete Fourier transforms; 2) students who have solved a PDE by
separation of variables can see their solutions evolve in time and understand
better the physical phenomena the equations describe; 3) students are able to
compare separation of variables solutions of such problems as the Euler-
Bernoulli beam and the vibrating drum head to experimental data.
