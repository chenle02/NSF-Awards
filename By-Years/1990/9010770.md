A Bayesian formulation of optimization and search problems that are
distinguished by very lax assumptions is adopted in this research. The
optimality criterion for algorithms is the minimization of dispersion of the
conditional probabilities with respect to the observations. The research
addresses the theoretical issues of consistency of optimal myopic algorithms,
characterizations of algorithms, and the development of efficient algorithms
that are not sensitive to probabilistic assumptions. Problems of optimization
and search with partial information abound. A common situation is to start with
minimal information about the function to be optimized or the object to be found
and then make observations that improve our information. An efficient choice of
observations is a difficult and important problem since some choices may be much
more informative than others. While problems that fit this description are
commonplace, there is very little theory to guide in planning sensible
strategies since the strong assumptions needed for most optimization or search
methods can not typically be justified.
