Connectivity will link this medical school's major teaching hospital (Barnes
with 1743 beds) and several other units within the medical center into a single
"seamless" TCP/IP array of Internet resources. The likely benefits of the
proposed connections are great at this premier research institution. The local
infrastructure is very strong, and the network expertise is excellent. The PI is
a leader in medical information research and is in a position to promote
connectivity; substantial outcomes are likely to result.
