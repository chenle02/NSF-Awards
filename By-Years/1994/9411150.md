ABSTRACT CTS-9411150 Leslie Bauman Mississippi State University The Career
Advancement Award will permit the PI to apply her Knowledge of experimental
techniques for magnethohydrodynamics to develop diagnostics for combustors and
incinerators. Emission absorption lineshape fitting will be developed as a tool
for measuring temperature profiles. Velocity profiles will be determined using
multi-wavelength crosscorrelation of light emission. The combination of these
techniques will permit simultaneous temperature and velocity measurements with
applications to high speed and high temperature flows.
