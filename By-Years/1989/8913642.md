The purpose of this grant is to provide funding to allow the principal
investigator to spend time reorienting the original proposal so that its aims
are more consistent with current National Science Foundation programs.
Additionally, some funds for foreign travel are requested so that the PI can
attend the NATO workshop, "Nonparametric Functional Estimation and Related
Topics," to which he has been invited and which is very germane to the proposal
topic.
