This award will support a program of research in heavy ion nuclear physics at
the Nuclear Structure Laboratory, State University of New York at Stony Brook,
using a superconducting booster accelerator in conjunction with a model FN
tandem accelerator. Together with the experimental equipment and measurement
techniques developed by the Stony Brook group, this capability makes possible an
unusually sophisticated and diverse range of experiments. Continued development
of research equipment, including superconducting accelerator technology, will be
carried out in parallel with the nuclear science program. Collective excitations
of nuclei at high excitation energies, and giant resonances, in particular, will
be studied with observation of the decay gamma radiation. These studies probe
shape changes as a function of nuclear temperature. The properties of nuclei
having very high angular momenta will be measured using an array of Compton
suppressed, high resolution Ge detectors. This work probes changes in shape and
microscopic nuclear structure as a function of angular momentum. Laser
spectroscopy will be used to study nuclei far from stability. Laser spectroscopy
provides information on nuclear sizes and shapes via hyperfine structure
measurements. Anomalous enhancements in the cross section for subbarrier fusion
of heavy nuclei will be studied through measurements using a new Bragg curve
spectrometer. Measurements of particle-particle correlations will be made and
analyzed to study nucleus-nucleus reaction dynamics. A special detector array
has been assembled for this purpose. The research will be carried out by five
faculty members, fifteen graduate students and five post-doctoral fellows.
