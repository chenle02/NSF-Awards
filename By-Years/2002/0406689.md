Open clusters are collections of stars with similar ages and compositions, and
as such provide a vital observational foundation for much of stellar
astrophysics and stellar dynamics. The key for entry into these astrophysical
laboratories is knowledge of the cluster membership, for stars in front of or
behind a cluster appear to be within it. Since all stars gravitationally bound
to a cluster move with very similar speed and direction, the path to identifying
the members of a cluster is to measure the velocities for all stars visible
within the cluster boundaries through proper motion and radial velocity
determinations. This project is carrying out an exceptionally comprehensive and
reliable census of the stellar and binary star populations in five rich old open
clusters. The interface between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics is being
explored through complete descriptions of the cluster mass functions, binary
frequencies, and binary orbital elements as a function of radius, permitting
detailed comparisons with n-body numerical simulations that include both
dynamical and stellar evolution. The complex interplay between radiative and
hydrodynamical processes within stellar cores is being explored through
detailing the morphologies of main-sequence turnoff points.

Broader Impacts: This project is enhancing the research and teaching skills of
future scientists by integrating graduate student dissertations, undergraduate
theses, and research experiences for other undergraduate students. This work is
associated with the NSF Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and
Learning at the University of Wisconsin. A trilateral Taiwan-Baltic
collaboration assists in the training and education of students in recently
disadvantaged countries.
