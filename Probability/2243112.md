Central to research in modern probability theory is the study of how complex
random systems behave. Besides being of fundamental interest, studying the
behavior of such systems improves understanding of how heat flows through a
medium, how tumors grow, how water waves propagate, and how traffic jams form
and dissolve. This project focuses on a particular aspect of the behavior known
as large deviations, which is about small-probability events occurring in the
systems of interest. The theory of large deviations is one of the pillars of
probability theory; understanding how it manifests itself in different types of
systems is a practical and important task. Further, the study of large
deviations has applications to understanding excursions between meta-stable
states, analyzing phase transitions, and benchmarking numerical algorithms. The
research aims to advance understanding in these and other areas. The project
also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

In concrete terms, this project will study the finite-dimensional and sample-
path large deviations of asymmetric interacting particle systems and of
nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. They exhibit large
deviations in various regimes, including the short-time, intermediately-long-
time, and long-time regimes. The main goals of this project are: i) establishing
the short-time large deviation principles of various systems; ii) studying how
the large deviations in the short-time regime converge to the (mostly
conjectural) large deviations in the long-time regime; and iii) investigating
the large deviations in the intermediately-long-time regime. These goals involve
the mathematical study of various physical phenomena, including the
correspondences between soliton waves and shock waves, the spontaneous
generation of soliton waves, and dynamical symmetry breaking. The goals of this
project will be achieved by a combination of stochastic analysis and integrable
structures using the Feynman-Kac formula, the connection to quantum-many-body
systems, and the inverse scattering transform of integrable partial differential
equations.
