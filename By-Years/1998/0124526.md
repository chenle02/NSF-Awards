This proposal seeks funding for an advanced network connection in order to
facilitate research and education in the following ways: Computational
Astrophysics-Use of remote supercomputer for large-scale, 3D simulations of
supersonic gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics to study star formation (funded
by NSF Career Award, NASA and NSF Awards); Observational Astrophysics-Survey for
High Proper-Motion Stars-This will speed up the investigation and cataloging of
millions of stars and answer some fundamental questions about the nature of
white dwarf stars based on terrabytes of data at the Johns Hopkins' Space
Telescope Science Institute (funded by NSF, NASA); Digital Library Project-
Sharing of Museum Data (32 million specimens and cultural artifacts) to the
scientific community at large; Comparative Genomics/Evolutionary Biology-
Multiple projects (funded by NSF, NASA) High resolution Virtual Specimens for
Morphometrics-Dissemination of very large 3D specimen object datasets over high
speed networks to provide a database of virtual objects (funded by NSF) ; Center
for Biodiversity-Various Projects including humpback whale research, remote
sensing research taking place worldwide, including Vietnam, Madagascar, Bahamas
(funded by NSF, NASA, Private) ; Geology-Improve the remote operation of a
microprobe, housed at AMNH, from Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia
University (funded by NSF) Interdepartmental Labs-Remote collaborative work via
remote operation of telescopes and microscopes; Hayden Planetarium-Development
of new Digital Dome shows which involves the acquisition of images, remote
supercomputing for rendering of visualizations, remote collaboration in
development.
