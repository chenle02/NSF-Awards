This proposal focuses on the installation of an enhanced Fabry-Perot
Interferometer (FPI) located in the CEDAR optical facility at Millstone Hill
Observatory. The improved FPI will enable the observation of several different
nightglow emissions as the new instrument is integrated into the observing
program at Millstone Hill. The PIs will emphasize (1) continuation of existing
F-region studies using the atomic oxygen 630 nm line and (2) observation of D-
and E-region emissions (e.g. oxygen, OH).
