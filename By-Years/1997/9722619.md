9722619 Haus This U.S.-Mexico award will support collaborative research between
Prof. Joseph Haus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Prof. Javier Sanchez
Mondragon of the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica (INAOE)
in Puebla, Mexico. The researchers propose to complement experimental and
theoretical investigations on birefringent fiber interferometers for sensor
applications and applications of linear and nonlinear phenomena to optical
fibers. Advances in the fiber development for sensors, communications and
optical information processing are giving rise to more practical applications of
nonlinear phenomena to new devices, useful in processing information. For this
research the INAOE will contribute experimental optical facilities and
theoretical support while the U.S. side will contribute its expertise in ultra-
short pulse propagation in fibers and mode-locked fiber laser designs. ***
