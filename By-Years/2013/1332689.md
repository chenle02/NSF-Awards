This project supports the efforts of the National Academy of Sciences Board on
International Scientific Organizations (BISO) to advance U.S. international
interests through the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the Pacific
Science Association (PSA). BISO works to strength U.S. participation in
international scientific and engineering organizations and builds the capacity
of these organizations to contribute to international scientific cooperation.
BISO accomplishes its work by organizing, managing, and evaluating activities of
ICSU within the United States. A key aspect of BISO?s mission is to provide
oversight to more than 20 National Committees to ICSU member unions and
interdisciplinary bodies, thus supporting and building the international
infrastructure for science. By working with the U.S. National Committees, BISO
aims to provide a coordinated U.S. voice within the ICSU community. BISO also
resolves issues related to the conduct of science and responds to opportunities
to reduce barriers to international collaboration in scientific research.
