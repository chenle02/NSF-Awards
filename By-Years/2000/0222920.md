Graph drawing and information visualization tools are essential in many fields,
including telecommunications,databases, and software engineering, where the
models contain millions of objects and relationships. Even though graph drawing
is a rich discipline, the promising new concepts and algorithms in the field
have had too little practical impact in application areas. &lt;br/&gt;This
project presents an integrated research and education plan focusing on graph
drawing and information visualization techniques for large data sets and graph
processes. &lt;br/&gt;The research component of this work focuses on the design
and implementation of efficient data structures and algorithms for visualization
of large graphs with the goal of impacting real-world problems in application
areas. This problem is especially relevant because recent technological advances
have brought about increased data volumes and increased data complexity. The
theoretical aspects of this work include designing scalable force-directed
methods, hierarchical graph decompositions, alternative visual representations
for graph processes, external memory algorithms, and data structures that
support efficient navigation operations. &lt;br/&gt;The theoretical results will
be used to develop practical tools that will be packaged in a software library
and an Adaptive GrAph Visualization Environment, AGAVE, that uses the new graph
modeling standard GraphML. Through industrial collaborations, the new methods
will be calibrated and tested using real-world data.&lt;br/&gt;Alternatives
graph representation methods and techniques for visuazalizing dynamic graph
processes will also be investigated. The educational component of this proposal
includes: (1) Creation and management of the already funded new Graphics and
Visualization Lab; (2) Design and implementation of educational tools for
visualization of large graphs and graph processes; (3) Supervision of graduate
and undergraduate students; (4) Active involvement in outreach and integrative
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
