This Americas Program award supports travel and related expenses of 11 U.S.
scientists to participate in a workshop on dynamical systems to be held in
Montevideo, Uruguay, March-April, 1995. Organizers are Dr. Sheldon Newhouse,
Michigan State University, and Dr. Jorge Lewowicz, of the Universidad de la
Republica, Uruguay. The objective of the workshop is to bring together experts
in the mathematical field of dynamical systems for the purpose of discussing
recent results and studying significant problems in this area of mathematics.
The field of dynamical systems has had an impact on many fields of science,
including physics, biology, economics and chemistry. By bringing together
experts from the U.S., Uruguay, and other countries in Latin America and Europe,
this workshop is expected to increase communication and collaboration in a field
that has seen important developments over the last twenty years.
