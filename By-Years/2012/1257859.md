Male gametes are the most morphologically diverse cells in the animal kingdom,
ranging from very simple cells to sperm with missing or multiple flagella and
conjugated sperm that form cooperative units. To understand how this diversity
evolved, it is necessary to investigate gamete morphology from an evolutionary
developmental perspective, an approach widely applied to questions of embryonic
development in whole organisms but that has never been applied to cellular
morphogenesis. The proposed research will exploit the uniquely long spermatozoa
in fruit flies of the genus Drosophila (up to 5.8 cm) to further investigate
previously identified candidate genes for sperm length. Drosophila also present
an especially elegant system due to their experimental and genetic tractability.
These genes will be validated as potentially important in spermatogenesis, and
their molecular evolution across the Drosophila lineage will be investigated.
The research will also explore how these genes function during spermatogenesis
using in vitro culture methods that allow cell development to be observed and
manipulated in the controlled environment of a culture
dish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will greatly inform the
scientific community's understanding of how gamete diversity has evolved at the
developmental, molecular and cellular levels. Sperm are functionally important
evolutionarily (affecting reproductive fitness and speciation), as well as
biomedically and economically (informing fertility and in vitro fertilization
practices in humans and domestic animals). Studies of the genetics of sperm form
may also improve our understanding of general flagellar and ciliary development,
including ciliopathies involved in human disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis,
polycystic kidney disease).
