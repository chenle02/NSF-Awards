The award is to renovate research and research training facilities in three
structures at the Nova University Oceanographic Center: the Schure, Forman, and
Mellon Buildings. Renovations include installation of fixtures and furnishings
for 8 biological laboratories. The Oceanographic Center forms a department level
division of Nova University. Its mission is to perform quality scientific
research and to deliver high caliber scientific education. Academic
responsibilities have increased considerably in the past two years: the
Oceanographic Center faculty is now responsible for all undergraduate science
offerings as well as graduate programs in Oceanography. Community outreach is
also a priority. New Center faculty have been added and more are planned to meet
the Center's growing research and education mission. Most current biological
facilities required for this mission are either inadequate or non- existent.
Renovations will promote faculty and student research activities. Improved
laboratories will enhance research efficiency and will allow students to become
directly involved in active research projects. It is anticipated that
renovations will attract more and higher quality undergraduate and graduate
students into Nova's programs in marine and biological sciences.
