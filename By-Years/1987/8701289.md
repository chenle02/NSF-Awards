One of the major challenges in theoretical research in atmospheric chemistry
for the remaining years of this century relates to the development of accurate
and reliable models of the chemical and physical processes controlling the trace
composition of the atmosphere as well as its temporal and spatial variability.
In recognition of this fact, the report from the Global Tropospheric Chemistry
Panel of the National Academy of Sciences and the recently completed UCAR report
on Global Tropospheric Chemistry: Plane for the U.S. Research Effort identified
theoretical studies and modelling as one of five major research efforts needed
to be undertaken in atmospheric chemistry. One of the major objectives
highlighted for theoretical studies in these reports was the development of a
new class of models that can couple meteorological and chemical processes. To
provide a realistic simulation of the transport, transformation, and ultimate
removal of selected species on a global and/or regional scale. This research
project is aimed at the development and validation of a chemical transport model
capable of simulation the transport, transformation, and deposition of
combustion sulfur from the North American continent. Time-series measurements of
radon-222, lead-210, sulfur dioxide and sulfate surface concentrations and wet
deposition rates will be used to guide in the development and validation of
parameterizations for boundary layer transport, wet and dry removal, and the
homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate. These
parameterizations will then be used in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
(GFDL) general circulation/transport model to simulate the export and deposition
climatology of anthropogenic sulfur produced on the North American continent. Of
particular interest will be the fate of the approximately 75% of the North
American sulfur emissions which cannot be accounted for in wet deposition over
the continent.
