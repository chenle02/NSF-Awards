This award will provide funding for instrumentation to support the establishment
of a new Human Factors/Ergonomics Teaching Laboratory. This laboratory will
focus on educating students in the use of environmental monitoring equipment and
the importance of environmental parameters to the creation of healthful and
comfortable indoor climatic conditions, and on the use of human motion analysis
in determining the dynamic anthropometric and biomechanical requirements of
movements commonly observed in everyday working and living situations. The
establishment of this laboratory is a major teaching innovation which emphasizes
the importance of human factors/ergonomic considerations in the design of modern
built environments. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with
funds from non-Federal sources.
