ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 0850774&lt;br/&gt;PI: John
Bransford&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2009 Inter-Science of Learning Centers (iSLC)
Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 Inter-Science of Learning Centers
(iSLC) Conference is the second annual conference for students and postdoctoral
fellows from the six NSF Science of Learning Centers (SLCs). This is a venue for
participants to meet at one of the SLCs on a rotating basis, to discuss common
research interests, methodologies, challenges and career development. The goals
are to facilitate information exchange, collaborative synergies and sharing of
resources (people, ideas and tools) between the centers. The 2009 meeting will
be hosted by the Learning in Informal and Formal Environments (LIFE) Center at
the University of Washington, and attended by approximately 90 students and
postdoctoral fellows. This annual iSLC Conference is a step towards breaking
down disciplinary barriers and creating a common framework for the scientific
study of learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
