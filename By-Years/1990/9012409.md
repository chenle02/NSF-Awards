This is a two-year collaborative research project between Drs. Russell Elsberry,
Chih-Pei Chang, Roger Williams, and Malinda Peng, Naval Postgraduate School, and
Professors C. Y. Tsay and George Chen, National Taiwan University supported by
the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science Program. This proposal plans to study the
behavior and properties of typhoons in the vicinity of Taiwan using the data
collected by the Western Pacific Tropical Cyclone Motion Field Experiment (TCM)
sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. The TCM experiment collected
extensive data on large-scale air flow associated with typhoons in the western
Pacific. The U.S. scientists involved in this study are leaders in this field
and plan to use the collected data to develop models of tropical cyclones. This
project is useful to the U.S. meteorological communities and can provide an
important understanding of the behavior and properties of typhoons in the
western Pacific. This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan
National Science Council.
