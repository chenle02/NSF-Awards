This project, submitted by the Texas A &amp; M University on behalf of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) requests funds to
support the activities of the UNOLS Fleet Improvement Committee. The Committee
will produce a report in 1989, which will contain: an updated plan for the
orderly replacement and improvement of the research fleet; an analyses of future
science requirements for research vessels (R/V's); plans for upgrading existing
ships; some alternative ship designs; and advanced designs for two large R/Vs.
The ocean sciences community will be extensively involved throughout the
committees' deliberations. The Project Director, Dr. Worth D. Nowlin,
Distinguished Professor, TAMU, is chairman of the Committee. He is a highly
respected member of the community and is quite capable of directing this project
having had considerable experience in overseeing similar activities. This
project will provide valuable information and guidance to the NSF, other federal
agencies and the ocean science community. Partial support is being supplied by
the Office of Naval Research.
