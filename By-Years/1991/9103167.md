This study actually consists of two research programs. The first, and probably
most important, is an attempt to corroborated the possibility that the maximum
sediment thickness in the Bengal basin exceed 22km, rather than the 16km
generally cited. The second is the study of two aseismic ridges aligned about
N.S in the Bay of Bengal, the Ninetyeast Ridge and the 85 E Ridge. Existing
magnetic and seismic reflection data will be combined and extended with gravity
network to understand the state of isostasy in the region.
