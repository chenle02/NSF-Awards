This research aims to study the upper atmosphere using ground-based optical
measurements. The areas of investigation are: 1) measurements of upper
thermosphere dynamics under geomagnetic conditions ranging from quiet to
disturbed, 2) extension of the upper thermosphere wind and temperature field
determinations to the middle atmosphere region, 3) correlation of the neutral
atmosphere motion with those of the ionospheric plasma, and 4) comparisons of
the measured behaviors in all these cases with predictions of ab- initio and
empirical models. The instruments used for the observations include two Fabry-
Perot Interferometers (FPIs) at Millstone Hill and Laurel Ridge operated bi-
statically, a new all- sky Doppler interferometer at Laurel Ridge, and a fourth
FPI at Arequipa in Peru. The measurements will be combined with models to
account for the observed behavior of neutral winds in the upper atmosphere.
