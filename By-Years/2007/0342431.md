Many of the deepest unsolved mysteries in molecular genetics and genomics
concern the mechanisms responsible for the differential proliferation of introns
(intragenic non-coding spacers) in the protein-coding genes of various lineages
of eukaryotes. Although introns impose numerous costs upon their host genomes,
it has recently become clear that natural selection has exploited their presence
in some genomes for various management aspects of messenger RNAs, including
nuclear export and mRNA surveillance. However, the molecular source of introns
and their rate of turnover remain virtually unknown. The general goals of this
project are to develop an understanding of the molecular and population-genetic
mechanisms that drive the dynamics of birth and loss of introns and to elucidate
the phylogenetic distribution and history of the components of the spliceosome
(the molecular machine involved in the cytoplasm), the exon-junction complex
(the machinery involved in messenger RNA transport), and the nonsense-mediated
decay pathway (a surveillance mechanism for removing defective messenger RNAs).
These goals will be achieved by performing comprehensive bioinformatic surveys
of the completely, or nearly completely, sequenced genomes of diverse
eukaryotes. Although purely bioinformatic in scope, this project has the
potential to answer many of the unresolved questions regarding the basic
evolutionary biology of introns. In addition, the project will enhance the
training of graduate students and a postdoctoral associate in bioinformatics and
lead to the refinement of valuable whole-genome analysis
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
