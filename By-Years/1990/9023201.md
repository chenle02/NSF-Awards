During the past decade, a host of new techniques and methods have been
developed to answer a variety of module-theoretic questions. Such methods
include homological, categorical, finite dimensional, set-theoretic, integral
representation, and geometric techniques. The power of these tools has not yet
been fully realized, due partly to the diversity of topics encompassed by the
phrase "module theory", and partly to the lack of a forum in which the pioneers
of these techniques can explain the power of their methods to others. This grant
will partially support a conference on Methods in Module Theory to be held at
the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, May 29 - June 1, 1991, which
will provide the necessary forum. The cross-fertilization philosophy of the
conference, together with the expository nature of the principal lectures, makes
this conference an appropriate setting for graduate students and recent Ph.D.s,
as well as the more experienced researchers.
