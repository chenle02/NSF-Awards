ABSTRACT The research explores the availability and usefulness of linguistic
cues to verb meaning that might help the child learner to choose among the
multitude of hypotheses consistent with observation of world events. This
approach, known as syntactic bootstrapping, involves the use of syntactic
information about verbs to constrain inferences about their meaning. One line of
research looks at the judgments of adult speakers of English to ask what
inferences from syntax to semantics are supported by the language. Subjects will
make judgments of semantic similarity between verbs, building up a picture of
semantic relatedness within a set of verbs. Other subjects will judge sentences
for acceptability, providing information about the structural properties of the
same verbs. Statistical comparisons of these two data sets will determine
whether various syntactic distinctions among verbs match semantic differences. A
second line of research explores what children know about syntax/meaning
relations, and whether they will make form-to-meaning inferences in interpreting
novel verbs. Preschoolers are shown video-taped scenes, and asked to interpret a
nonsense verb used to describe them. The question of interest here is whether
their interpretations of the same scene change depending on the sentence
structure in which the nonsense verb is presented.
