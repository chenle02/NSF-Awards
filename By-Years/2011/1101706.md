Mechanism design lays the economic foundations for the design and analysis of
economic institutions, social and computer protocols, service provisioning, and
other applications where participants may act selfishly in their own best
interest. A common paradigm for real-world mechanism design is trial and error:
a mechanism is proposed, it is executed, then changes are made to it based on
its performance. In order to make these changes an econometric analysis must be
undertaken, i.e., the participants' actions in the mechanism (assumed to be in
equilibrium) must be reverse engineered to obtain the participants' preferences.
Using these inferred preferences, potential changes to the mechanism can be
evaluated and ranked. While mechanism design theory for the most part relies on
knowledge of the market, real world mechanisms tend to do some market analysis
on the fly. The PIs research will combine econometric inference with mechanism
design theory to investigate the econometric properties of mechanisms and design
mechanisms that are simultaneously good at market analysis and exploiting that
information to attain an objective specified by the mechanism
designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will introduce econometric
techniques to computer science and will bring together topics from computer
science and economics that have yet to be studied together. For example, these
issues are very important in practice especially in the rapidly growing areas of
sponsored search and targeted display advertising where auction mechanisms have
been deployed for pricing and placement of advertisements and a major challenge
is in adjusting the mechanisms in response to past data.
