The University of Denver will initiate a three-week, commuter and residential
Young Scholars project in Engineering for 50 students entering grades 11,12.
This project encourages capable high school students to elect an engineering
career by immersion in an expose' of the profession. This national program
covers all engineering disciplines but focuses on electrical and mechanical
engineering. During the summer portion, students discuss engineering careers and
professional ethics; visit with engineers in industry, university research and
government; use the computer as an engineering tool; and practice engineering
analysis and design. Special Academy periods provide year-long motivation and
guidance.
