A generalized framework for characterizing the quality degradation and
predicting failures among critical components within several computer
numerically controled machine tools will be investigated. "Failure" in this
context refers to degradation of the critical components within a machine tool
and/or the quality of the finished product. This framework will integrate
sensory devices with real-time knowledge bases and simulation models. The
implemented framework will provide an integrated environment for a maintenance
supervisor to understand the quality degradation process for various critical
components within a machine tool and obtain early warnings about their failure
time intervals. Although the framework is general, the implementation will be
restricted to diagnosing quality degradation in grinding machines. The research
will focus on building a tested knowledge base for characterizing the quality
degradation process within grinding machines, and reducing the response time in
providing decisions using knowledge bases and simulation. Technology transfer of
the results will be achieved through interaction with industrial sponsors.
