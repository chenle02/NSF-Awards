The American Institute of Physics will carry out a project to improve
instruction in college and university physical science courses for preservice
elementary school teachers. Instructional modules for a college course in
physical science will be produced based on materials developed by the Operation
Physics project. The course will emphasize the teachers' acquiring a better
understanding of the physical science concepts they would be required to teach,
an awareness of both their own and children's naive ideas about physical science
phenomena, and a repertoire of techniques and strategies which they can use in
their classroom to help children better learn and understand physical science
concepts. A group of outstanding physics and chemistry educators will contribute
to the writing and field testing of the materials. An extensive program of
college faculty enhancement will be undertaken to educate faculty in the best
practices of teaching physical science and how the materials should be used with
prospective teachers. Field test instructors will be solicited both through AAPT
and ACS publications. The cost-sharing will be 24% of NSF's contribution.
