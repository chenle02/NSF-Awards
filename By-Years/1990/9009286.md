Many theoretical models in modern finance, organizational economics, information
economics, and game theory rely heavily on how individuals react to risk. The
purpose of this proposal is to analyze risk preferences by the use of
experimental methods in a laboratory setting. Specifically, experiments will be
designed and run with human subjects to determine the factors that govern the
experimentalist's ability to induce particular risk attitudes for an
experimental commodity, and then to compare this ability to induce preferences
to various techniques for the direct measurement of preferences over monetary
gambles. A better understanding the role of risk preferences is important not
only from a theoretical, but also from a practical standpoint. Recently, a
plethora of institutional changes, ranging from computerized trading and new
financial instruments to new regulatory rulings on trade inequities, have
emerged. The evaluation of these institutions has immense, practical import,
given the magnitude of resource transfers that occur in these institutions.
