Algorithm animation, the use of dynamic graphics to illustrate program behavior
and enhance understanding, has been successfully utilized as a pedagogical aid.
Typically, algorithm animation involves post-mortem program augmentation:
graphics are designed and developed for already working programs. The techniques
used in algorithm animation systems could be adapted for use during program
debugging. The objectives of this research are to use the abstract mental models
developed by program designers as a basis for program visualizations and to
develop a framework that allows programmers to quickly and easily (without
graphics coding) create an animated visualization of a program prior to testing
and debugging. Such a framework then could be used to examine program behavior
and identify errors in a uniquely different manner than traditional textual
debuggers. The intended deliverables include (1) a description and
implementation of a methodology for mapping program data and actions to dynamic
graphics, (2) a prototype animation-based visual debugger, and (3) an analysis
of the effectiveness of such a system.
