The work proposed is in collaboration with the laboratory of Andreas Dress of
the Mathematics Department of the University of Bielefeld, Germany. William
Atchley of the Department of Genetics at North Carolina State University will
also be a participate in the research. The combined groups will explore new
computer methods to discover relationships of protein and nucleotide sequences
to he control of DNA transcription. The results of the research are of
importance to all types of research having to do with human and other genomes.
The research results will also make possible population studies of disease and
normal processes. The collaboration combines the many years of experience of the
U.S. researchers in molecular evolution of transcription factors with Dress's
mathematical expertise, and his specific experience in analytical methods for
efficient handling of biological data.
