This award supports a workshop to bring together scientists involved in the
International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (ITASE). Since 1999 the US
has supported a program of traverses across both East and West Antarctica (US
ITASE). US ITASE is part of the ITASE multi-national effort to understand the
past 200-1000+ years of climate change over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
ITASE is organized under the auspices of Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) and now comprises twenty-one countries. The international
representatives from ITASE have met several times in the past to discuss
national traverse plans; coordinate efforts; synthesize results; and develop
statistical and other techniques for the interpretation of data. The workshop
will provide additional momentum to the process of synthesizing the Antarctic-
wide ITASE reconstruction of past climate. An emerging compilation of all ITASE
and other ice core sites is available through the Ice READER database sponsored
by SCAR and one workshop goal is to update this metadata listing. The workshop
will also focus on identifying the characteristics of climate change that have
impacted the Antarctic and surrounding ocean in the past 200-1000+ years in
order to provide a basis for assessing the dramatic changes expected as a
consequence of the ~4-6 degrees C warming projected for this region by the
Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Results from this workshop
will also form the basis for future collaborative efforts between ITASE ice core
researchers, meteorologists, oceanographers, and climate modelers stemming from
international initiatives such as the International Partnerships in Ice Core
Sciences (IPICS) and the International Polar Year (IPY). Finally, workshop
findings will be included in the forthcoming document: "Antarctic Climate Change
and the Environment" initiated by SCAR.
