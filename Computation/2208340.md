The objective of this research program is to develop consistent and
theoretically validated machine learning algorithms for high-stakes decisions.
The project will study randomized feature networks as a simpler but equally
powerful alternative to fully-trainable neural networks for high-dimensional
function approximation. The long-term goal is to develop methods that integrate
machine learning and dynamical systems, a challenging new frontier in data
science for scientific problems. This project also provides research training
opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral
fellows.

The main goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for data-driven
function approximation, with the goal of using learning techniques for
scientific modeling and dynamics. The focus is on the construction of randomized
algorithms with complexity, accuracy, and/or stability guarantees. Rigorous
algorithmic design and modeling is at the core of this scientific computing
project, where we leverage advances in machine learning to augment simulations
and extract better features for approximating dynamical systems. This project
introduces a family of new algorithms based on randomized features with adaptive
thresholding procedures to improve accuracy without overfitting. By
incorporating various structural information, this has the potential to avoid
the curse-of-dimensionality for several physical problems of interest. The main
test problems focus on scientific models, high-dimensional systems, and high-
dimensional dynamical systems. In addition, by understanding random feature
models, we provide one avenue toward a better understanding of neural network
models.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
