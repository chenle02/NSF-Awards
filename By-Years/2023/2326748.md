This research project aims at the development of a quantum sensing platform for
biomolecular analytics. If successful, this work will pave the way to a quantum-
enabled biosensor that can detect different protein binding events. Such a novel
quantum sensing technology will form the basis for a new generation of
biomedical devices capable of monitoring the concentration of thousands of
proteins in blood and, thereby, detect diseases before their clinical
manifestation. The convergent aspect of this research program will furthermore
train a next generation of quantum scientists and engineers that are able to
venture beyond the current boundaries and bring quantum technology into the life
sciences.

Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a powerful technology
sensitive enough to detect the EPR spectrum of individual biomolecules. By
combining NV-based quantum sensors with DNA-aptamer protein binding assays, this
project explores a new robust bio-analytics platform that can spectroscopically
differentiate between different protein binding events. The project pursues the
following four key scientific challenges that will form the basis for such a
quantum-enabled bio-analytical device: (i) engineering of a DNA-aptamer â€“
quantum sensor interface, (ii) understanding and controlling noise inherent to
biological interfaces, (iii) integrating diamond photonics in biosensors, and
(iv) engineering transduction of biological events to quantum-detectable
signals. As a result, this work will demonstrate the fundamentals of a quantum-
enabled bioanalytical device that is capable of interfacing intact proteins with
a coherent quantum sensor and that is able to distinguish specific single-
protein binding events with a low false-positive rate.
