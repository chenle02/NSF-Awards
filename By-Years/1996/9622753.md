Gonek 9622753 Professor Gonek will study various problems concerning the
distribution of zeros and the mean values of the Riemann zeta function. He hopes
to show that certain analogues of the zeta function defined by Dirichlet series
have a positive proportion of zeros off the critical strip. He also intends to
study various moment problems for the zeta function. He will also study additive
divisor problems and theorems of Barban-Davenport-Halberstam type. This project
falls into the general area of number theory. Number theory is one of the oldest
areas of mathematics and yet every generation returns to these problems again.
