The NSF-funded LIGO instruments are rapidly approaching their design sensitivity
goals. At the same time, NASA is rapidly moving forward with research and
development on the space-based antenna LISA, with the goal of a launch around
2010. This award will support Hughes' work in gravitational-wave astrophysics
and astronomy, looking to the time when detections are routine and these
detectors can truly be regarded as observatories. This award will support work
in aspects of radiation reaction, gravitational-wave generation, black hole
parameter measurement, neutron star disruption, and stellar collapse relevant to
gravitational wave detection.

The research supported by this award is very timely in light of the rapid
progress that LIGO has recently made, and the explosion of interest in NASA's
LISA mission. The PI regularly speaks to broad scientific audiences on the
promise of gravitational-wave science and its impending importance for
astronomical studies. The travel funds in this award will make it possible to
continue this outreach, as well as making it possible to reach out more broadly
to the interested public. The award will also support graduate and undergraduate
students. Scientists trained in gravitational-wave astronomy typically develop a
broad range of skills, making them valuable members of the scientific community.
