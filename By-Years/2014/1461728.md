Savanna ecosystems cover vast areas of the earth's land surface and play a key
role in biogeochemical cycling by providing habitat for wildlife and resources
for rural communities. Empirical evidence and modeling efforts suggest that many
of these grass-dominated ecosystems are becoming woodier over time and that
these changes will have profound effects on a wide range of ecological and
socio-ecological processes of their regions. This research project will analyze
the ecological mechanisms and spatial interactions that underpin the process of
woody cover change in grassland and savanna systems over the past two decades.
The project will provide new perspectives about the impacts that changes in
these ecosystems will have in altering their functions including soil moisture
dynamics, radiation, soil temperature and nutrients, and carbon cycling and
storage. The insights from this project will advance basic understanding about
the fundamental forces driving woody cover change across a wide range of
environmental settings. Project results will help guide policy makers,
governmental agencies, and resource administrators in assessing appropriate
courses of action. This project also will strengthen international research
collaborations among U.S. and African scientists and institutions.

Interactions between grassland and woody vegetation in a savanna ecosystem
depend on the spatial context where even a small change at a fine-scale may have
large-scale landscape-level ramifications of modifying entire vegetation
distribution patterns. Using remote sensing methods, fieldwork, and spatial
modeling, the investigators will seek answers to three core sets of questions:
(1) What role do spatial processes play in determining woody cover dynamics at
neighborhood scales? (2) Are these spatial processes resource- or disturbance-
driven, and do they shift across climate gradients? (3) Do woody cover changes
exhibit gradual or abrupt transitions (regime shifts) over time, and how are
these dynamics related to fine-scale spatial structure and resource and
disturbance gradients? Project findings will lead to a better understanding of
the impacts that widespread increases in woody cover are having on habitat
structure for wildlife, ecosystem function, and economic activity.
