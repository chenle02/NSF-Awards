This dual-institution research seeks to follow-up earlier work that
demonstrated shear-wave splitting in the subcontinental mantle. It will
investigate this splitting on a much more detailed scale utilizing 3-component
digital equipment along a line between the western Superior province and the
Black Hills in central North America. An experiment of this sort lies at the
state-of-the-art in field and analysis technique, and represents the best use of
PASSCAL portable instruments for study of the earth's crust and upper mantle.
This research will have important application to the structure of the crust and
upper mantle, and because it develops the capability for investigation of shear-
wave splitting, currently believed to be an important phenomenon during the
process of preparation for an earthquake, it has important application to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
