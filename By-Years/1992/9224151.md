It has been assumed for a long time that feeding strategies influence behavior,
and that behavioral variations may lead to the divergence of species. This study
of two closely related primate groups that live in the same area and have
somewhat different diets, will provide a direct test of how food preferences
(fruit eaters vs. leaf eaters) may influence the adoption of distinct activity
patterns and species-specific behaviors, including different territorial
behaviors. The groups are two species of Indriids occupying nearly indentical
ranges in eastern Madagascar.
