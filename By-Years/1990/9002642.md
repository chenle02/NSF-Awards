This research will focus on harmonic analysis. The emphasis will be on the
orbit method of C(star)-algebras, including applications of these algebras to
dynamical systems, to topology, and to the geometry of manifolds. One project is
to develop new results on orbital integral formulas, symmetric spaces, and
multiplicity questions in dynamical systems. The other project is a study of
equivariant index theory, operator algebra invariants, and representations of
discrete groups. This research is in the general subarea of modern analysis
which examines the representation theory of algebras of functions.
