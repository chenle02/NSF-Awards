Continuous trading models have been the central tools in modern financial theory
ever since they were used to establish the Black-Scholes formula for correctly
pricing options. Unfortunately, the continuous trading models rest on economic
foundations that can be questioned. The object of this project is to put
continuous trading models on a sounder economic footing. The most fundamental
difficulty addressed is the meaning of continuous trading. The `obvious`
interpretation of continuous trading is as a limit of models in which trading
occurs at a finite number of discrete times, but the interval between trading
times becomes very short. It can be argued on the basis of counter examples,
that there is a serious economic difficulty with this interpretation. The aim of
this research is to seek a more satisfactory interpretation. The second set of
difficulties addressed concerns the nature and existence of equilibrium. Most of
the analysis of continuous trading models is non-equilibrium in nature; for
example, the Black-Scholes analysis takes the process describing security prices
as given and solves for option prices by arbitrage arguments. Other analyses
simply assume the existence of a suitable equilibrium. From an economic point of
view, assuming the existence of such an equilibrium is generally unsatisfactory.
It is particularly unsatisfactory in the continuous time setting because the
existence of equilibrium is very much in doubt in many cases of interest, and
because even when the existence of an equilibrium satisfying regularity
conditions is guaranteed, there may be many other equilibria. This research will
seek to establish the existence of equilibrium and to rule out equilibria not
satisfying regularity conditions.
