9523476 Powell The proposed study is to operate and maintain the Coordinating
Office of the Scientific Steering Committee of US GLOBEC. The Office has four
main functions in the central role of scientific planning, coordination, support
and communication for the overall project. The most important of these four are
scientific planning and coordination which includes logistics and support for
the US GLOBEC Scientific Steering Committee. A major task for the Office is
coordination with the federal agencies that fund GLOBEC. Finally, the Office
supports and conducts communication with the large and diverse GLOBEC community
in the US and overseas. The Coordinating Office is located in the Department of
Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.
