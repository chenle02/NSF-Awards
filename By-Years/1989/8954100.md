This proposal represents a pilot program for testing methods of encouraging
interest in scientific careers in minority children and their mothers. Two
weekly biological science programs, one for children, the other for mothers, are
being held at the University of Hartford for three groups of Hartford inner-
city residents: public school third and fourth graders attending alone; mothers
of third and fourth graders attending alone; third and fourth graders attending
with their mothers. The effectiveness of these three approaches in improving
attitudes toward science, scientific careers, and achievement in the children
and in their mothers, and also in encouraging a desire in the mothers to seek
further education and/or scientific employment is being compared. The content of
the program is focused on physiology, anatomy, nutrition, and, for the
children's program, experimentation. Guest speakers who serve as role models for
various scientific careers are included.
