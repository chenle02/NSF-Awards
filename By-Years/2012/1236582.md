A moving liquid spreads across a solid by displacing the surrounding gas. The
recent discovery that, under certain circumstances, the energy stored in the
liquid shape can be converted into the energy of liquid motion - as in the
droplet "walking instability" - represents a heretofore unknown pathway of
energy conversion of potentially vast significance. The objective of this study
is to map out the circumstances where this new pathway is operative by
developing theoretical stability predictions and by testing these predictions
against experiment. The approach that enables achieving our objective is jointly
based on fresh mathematical techniques (for prediction) and recent innovative
methods to tailor solid surface properties in the lab (for testing). The
intellectual merit of this study lies in the new techniques for prediction and
those to bring to life the predicted behavior. Broader impacts of this study
will accrue for both human resource development and technology. On the side of
technology, in the manufacturing arena, immersion lithography for semiconductor
processing and casting of wide-format silicon subtrates for solar panel
applications stand to benefit while, in the agricultural sciences arena, new
paradigms for droplet atomization will enable better localization of pesticide
spray while, in the health-care arena, tunable droplet actuation stands to be of
benefit to lab-on-chip diagnostic devices. On the side of human resources,
female graduate students will be trained as technical leaders through the
development of an outreach module that brings the excitement of liquid shape-
change motions to high school students and their parents and thereby also works
to broaden female participation in the science, technology, engineering and
mathematics disciplines.
