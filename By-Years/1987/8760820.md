This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of chromatography.
The goal of this research activity is to determine the feasibility of developing
an ultra-high speed chromatograph with which complex samples can be very rapidly
analyzed. To accomplish this, open tubular chromatographic columns having inside
diameters in the range of one to fifty micrometers will be examined to determine
the optimal diameter that will enable preservation of separation efficiency
while maximizing the speed of analysis. Deactivation, coating, and evaluation
methods will be developed for use with these microbore capillary columns, and
new sample introduction systems that are compatible with them will be developed.
Finally, optimized, compatible detectors and associated fast-response
electronics for use with these ultra-narrow-bore capillary columns will be
developed and evaluated. The successful completion of this Phase I activity
should demonstrate whether subsequent instrument development would lead to a gas
chromatograph which would be capable of quantifying fifteen-to-twenty sample
components per second. The availability of such an instrument would impact
broadly in numerous scientific and technical areas and could, for the first
time, make gas chromatography the method of choice for many applications which
require immediate analytical data for process and quality control.
