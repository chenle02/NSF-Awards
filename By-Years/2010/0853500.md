This proposal aims to develop a live, single-cell somatic and stem cell surgery
tool enabling high efficiency intracellular manipulations, such as the delivery
of small molecules, macromolecular structures, and organelles like mitochondria.
The long term goal is to enhance capabilities in stem cell biology for the
repair of damaged or worn out tissues due to congenital dysfunction, aging, or
the ravages of disease, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.
Developing this ability is one of the main challenges in the stem cell research
community. To approach the problems associated with organelle/small molecule
delivery and intracellular manipulations of live, fragile federally-approved
embryonic stem cells, they propose to develop a novel cell surgery device. This
device integrates conventional microcapillary techniques with plasmonic
photothermal technologies to precisely control nanoscale cell membrane damage
near the tip of a microcapillary pipette. This fine control is realized by
utilizing the unique photothermal effect of metal nanoparticles or thin films
coated on the tip of microcapillary pipettes, which can therefore utilize a
larger bore pipette diameter for efficient and non-shearing transfer of larger
items such as mitochondria into somatic and stem cells.
