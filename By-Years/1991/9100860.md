Understanding the importance of dispersal to populations of patchily
distributed species is critical to the fields of population ecology,
evolutionary biology, and conservation biology. Dispersal can influence
population fluctuations through differences in immigration and emigration rates
and, through gene flow, can have a major influence on the genetic structure of
populations. In addition, the regional persistence of a species prone to local
extinction can depend on levels of dispersal high enough to allow frequent
recolonization of vacant habitat patches. This area has a strong theoretical
basis, but there has been relatively little empirical research directed at
answering the important questions. This study examines the role of dispersal in
the population dynamics and genetic structure of a patchily distributed
butterfly species, Euphilotes enoptes. The interplay of patch quality and
isolation with the dynamics of local populations by coupling experiments with
observations of individual behavior and year-to-year population fluctuations
will be studied. Patch isolation and size will be related to gene flow and the
allocation of genetic variability through a survey of mtDNA markers. Finally, by
studying two metapopulations, The generalizability of results from a single
metapopulation of a species will be examined.
