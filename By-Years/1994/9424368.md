Hejhal DMS-9424368 Hejhal will use high-performance computers to investigate
three topics: analytic number theory, automorphic forms and the Selberg trace
formalism, and quantum chaos. In number theory, the PI will be seeking a better
understanding of the zeros of various kinds of zeta functions. He will be
focusing on the asymptotic spacing pattern in the zeros and seeking to reconcile
this with certain statistical ensembles arising in random matrix theory. This
work has important application to fundamental and long-standing questions in
number theory. It also leads to new uses of supercomputing in the more
theoretical areas of mathematical analysis, both as an experimental tool and one
which can give sharp probability estimates in situations where precise
information is too difficult to extract from the functions definitions.
