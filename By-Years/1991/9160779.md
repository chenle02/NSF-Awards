The presence of excessive standing phase angle difference across open circuit
breakers which connect transmission stations cause significant delays in power
system restoration. During the initial phases of restoration when the power
system is primarily under manual control, these phase angle differences are
reduced by the time consuming process of trial and error adjustments of real
power generation. Determination of timely adjustments of the correct amount of
real power generation at the right power plants are difficult tasks for the
power system operator to perform, particularly under pressure of time. The prime
objective of the proposed research is to develop an algorithm which would
minimize the amount and the number of adjustments in real power generation to
reduce the excessive standing phase angle differences and allow closures of
circuit breakers for a quick and orderly restoration of power systems following
a major disturbance. The methodology has additional values during emergency
operation, such as the unloading of large transformers overheated by
Geomagnetically Induced Currents, or the reduction of power flows in the
overloaded transmission lines.
