The Institute of Standards Research of ASTM will be conducting an
interlaboratory testing program for rock properties. Specifically, funding is
sought for purchasing, transporting, logging, cutting, coring and distributing
samples of the rocks to be tested. The overall project objectives are: to obtain
reliable estimates of precision of selected properties of rock to be
incorporated into existing standards; identification of desirable modifications;
and dissemination of information collected among parties of interest in
industry, government and academe, and between producers and users.
