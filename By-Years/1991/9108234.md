The proposed research will include the synthesis of available piezocone data
compiled from previous efforts, the collection of additional field and
laboratory data, and development of a theoretically-based methodology for using
complementary sets of piezocone parameters to profile the in situ stress history
of natural clays. The database compilation will be used to calibrate and guide
the selection of applicable piezocone parameters for the detailed profiling of
overconsolidation ratio, or other relevant measure of stress history.
