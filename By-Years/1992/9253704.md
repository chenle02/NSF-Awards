The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of surface microscopy.
During the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Hamers and his students
will utilize scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques to
observe, understand, and control the surface chemistry of solid state materials
at an atomic level. These important goals will be pursued by using STM
techniques to identify molecular surface species; through the integration of STM
with other chemically sensitive techniques such as infrared absorption
spectroscopy; through the development of novel scanned probe techniques which
could provide new methods for achieving elemental and/or functional group
identification on nanometer distance scales; and by making use of the STM tip as
an active tool for inducing chemical changes in this distance domain. %%% The
successful attainment of the goals of this project should give rise to new
techniques for the atomic-scale characterization of solid surfaces as well as
innovative chemical insights regarding surface reactions which are of immense
technological significance. Additionally, this Presidential Faculty Fellowship
should significantly assist Professor Hamers in the continuing development of
his vital and productive program of research and research training.
