Modern neuroscience laboratory experiences are being developed for
undergraduates at all educational levels. A core neuroscience laboratory with 5
neurophysiological workstations will allow students to explore neurobiological
phenomena ranging from the physical basis of the nerve cell resting membrane
potential to understanding the somatotopy of the vertebrate brain. First year
graduate students are being trained in the use of the equipment to enable them
to be effective T.A.'s for the undergraduates. Students will acquire first- hand
familiarity with the scientific method and experimental design, experience with
complex electronic instrumentation, and planning skills inherent in the
successful acquisition, analysis, and presentation of laboratory data. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
