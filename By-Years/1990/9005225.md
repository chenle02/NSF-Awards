The goal of this proposal is to examine the regulation of replication and gene
expression of the tobacco mosaic virus(TMV) as a representative of viruses that
express genes through subgenomic mRNAs. A series of systems has been developed
that provide altered replication and altered gene expression that can be
utilized to dissect mechanisms of regulation. The experimenters will focus on
regulation of the 30K and coat protein genes. The regulation of replication will
be examined through the use of a two component system. The promoters of the
regulated genes will be dissected. The replication parameters will be determined
by using variations of the 2 component system. Understanding the regulation and
replication of this model virus will provide useful information relevant to
other viruses that use sub genomic RNAs.
