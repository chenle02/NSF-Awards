The aims of this proposal are to employ biochemical and biophysical methods to
further characterize a class of cofactor-containing enzymes called
quinoproteins. The research will focus on the mammalian quinoproteins, plasma
monoamine oxidase, kidney diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase. All of these
enzymes had been thought to contain the bacterial cofactor, pyrroloquinoline
quinone, PQQ, but this conclusion is now in doubt. The objectives of this
proposal are 1) to characterize the active site cofactor-containing peptides of
diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase. It is possible that these enzymes have the
same cofactor as plasma monoamine oxidase, i.e., 6-hydroxydopa; 2) to clone the
genes and develop an expression system for plasma monoamine oxidase and kidney
diamine oxidase; 3) to characterize the proximity of the Cu2+ and cofactor sites
of all three enzymes using a variety of biophysical methods; and 4) to initiate
an investigation of the biosynthetic origin of 6-hydroxydopa. These studies will
provide a clear understanding of the mechanistic and structural features of
these metalloquinoproteins and lead to a consensus concerning the nature of the
carbonyl cofactor in quinoproteins of mammalian origin.
