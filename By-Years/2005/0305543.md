What is novel and unique in this proposed research is the proposed design of
knowledge-based prediction systems based on optimal vector space representations
of proteins that have previously been represented by character strings. If an
optimal representation of a character string can be found by a numerical
sequence, then a great variety of methodologies from disciplines such as
optimization, pattern discovery, and machine learning can be readily applied to
new understanding of protein tertiary structure and function.&lt;br/&gt;For
this, kernel based nonlinear classifiers and nonlinear dimension reduction as
well as visualization methods will be developed to provide scalable and elective
prediction systems.The prediction systems will be specially tailored for several
problems related to protein structure discovery such as protein secondary
structure, relative solvent accessibility and disulfide connectivity, as well as
prediction of protein-protein interaction. &lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the P.I.s
describe how they intend to accomplish this, so that their preliminary results
can be extended to the more general structure and protein-protein interaction
prediction problem. All results obtained will be made available to the research
community in order to facilitate further research activity. Using existing web
servers, the results will be made available to teaching faculty and graduate and
undergraduate students in a suitable tutorial form. This will allow those
interested to tailor the material for use in graduate and undergraduate research
and class projects. The authors will incorporate the results into current and
future course material as well. Special efforts will be made by the two women
PIs to provide opportunities for women graduate students to participate in the
proposed research and for development of the&lt;br/&gt;related software, which
has long range social impact beyond the scientific
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
