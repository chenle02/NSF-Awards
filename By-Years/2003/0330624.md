Houston PBS with Windward Media is planning to develop a one-hour documentary
for NOVA entitled ?Trouvadore, the Last Voyage of an African Slave Trader." The
film will chronicle the scientific archaeological excavation of an illegal slave
ship that wrecked in the British West Indies in 1841. Planning activities will
include archival research and consultation with archaeologists, DNA and
curriculum specialists and local descendents of the slave ship. Deliverables
will include an advanced treatment for the documentary and script outline.

Intellectual Merit. The Trouvadore will be the only slave ship ever recovered
that was actually carrying slaves at the time it sank in 1841. The project will
show how modern science can help uncover and interpret this event as well as the
trans-Atlantic slave trade of which it was part. The PI will work with
archaeologists from Ships of Discovery (Corpus Christi, Texas) and the Turks and
Caicos National Museum. DNA studies of possible descendents will be carried out
in cooperation with the National Human Genome Center at Howard University.

Broader Impact. Because NOVA has indicated its support for this project, the
documentary that results from this grant will have the potential to reach
significant audiences. In addition, the products of this planning process will
further efforts to produce a web site, a traveling exhibition and ancillary
materials. A report summarizing the results of the research during this phase
will make the findings available to others as well.
