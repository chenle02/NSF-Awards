This award addresses the need for less time-consuming simulations of larger
biomolecular systems, for example water-membrane systems of more than ten
thousand atoms. The recent availability of implementations of the three-
dimensional fast multipole method presents an opportunity for the rapid
implementation of enhancements to a molecular dynamics package. Highly suitable
is a computer program of the investigator and his collaborators called MD, which
interfaces to the data files and processing routines of a popular macromolecular
modeling package. The program MD has been used to test computational methods, to
advance science, and to benchmark computer systems. The PI will incorporate code
into MD that implements the fast multipole method, will parallelize this code,
and will combine it with distance class techniques and simple higher order time-
integrated schemes.
