This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in nuclear
physics between Arnold Honig of Syracuse University and Jean-Pierre Didelez of
the University of Paris, Orsay. The objective of their research is the
construction of polarized hydrogen and deuterium (HD) targets for use in
nuclear/particle physics experiments at the Brookhaven Laser Electron Gamma
Source and in a higher energy facility to be built at the Grenoble synchrotron.
Polarized hydrogen and deuterium may be used as fuel for inertially confined
fusion. Recent progress in the development of solid HD targets will now allow
the physics community to use them in beam scattering experiments. The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration considerable expertise in studies of
the properties of polarized frozen hydrogen and deuterium and polarization
techniques. This will be complemented by the French investigators expertise in
developing extraction and transport techniques which are necessary to enable use
of HD targets. The proposal combines unique expertise and allows for cost-
sharing and sharing of techniques.
