9301216 Hanlon This award supports a 5-day meeting with the following goals: i)
to highlight recent exciting research in a setting which gives the speakers
ample time to explain the work and the listeners ample time to absorb and
discuss what they hear; ii) to promote participation and involvement by people
early in their careers; iii) to include a broad scope of mathematical subjects.
100 participants are expected to attend. 15-20 graduate students are included in
this number. The NSF support will be used to help defray the expenses of the
speakers, as well as providing partial support for graduate students and very
recent Ph.D. recipients who are conference participants.
