In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Klemperer will investigate the properties of relatively
strong bound molecular complexes in their ground electronic state, but excited
to high energies in the range between 10,000 and 15,000 cm-1. This work will
provide quantitative data on the potential energy surfaces of hydrogen bonded
molecular complexes. Studies will be performed on complexes formed with He and
H2, the rotational spectroscopy of high-energy isomers will be carried out, and
the spectroscopy of high overtones will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will develop new areas of the spectroscopy of hydrogen bonded molecular
complexes. Students and postdoctoral research associates will participate in
this work. They will receive training in theoretical and experimental techniques
of high resolution molecular spectroscopy in preparation for advanced studies or
entry into the scientific/technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
