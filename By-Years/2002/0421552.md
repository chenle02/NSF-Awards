The purpose of the informational meeting is to share with the community the
goals and scope of the focus area. By including presentations from researchers,
vendors, and applications experts, this meeting will enable attendees to get a
sense of the state of the art in sensor networks, and the key challenges facing
the focus area and sub-areas thereof. It will help the community better target
proposals; PIs will be able to conserve efforts by understanding which proposals
would be completely out of scope. Finally, it will start to build a community
for the focus area, perhaps encouraging early collaboration and potentially
strengthening the pool of submissions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
