SBER-9500196 Patricia P. Gilmartin Elizabeth S. Nelson University of South
Carolina Dissertation Improvement Research: Assessing Theories of the Mental
Representations of Maps This research will examine the major theories pertaining
to the mental representation of knowledge and determine which theory best
describes the mental representations of map knowledge. The influence of specific
encoding processes on these mental representations will also be explored. Human
subjects will be used in a computer-based experiment which will evaluate their
ability to complete a series of recognition tasks involving a set of maps. The
importance of assessing the mental representations of map knowledge is essential
for Geographers to understand in order to improve the map communication.
