ABSTRACT 0204193 Kreitz, Christoph Cornell U

Interactively guided proof assistants have been successfully used in the formal
design, verification, and optimization of software and hardware systems. Because
of their expressive logics, they are more generally applicable than fully
automated tools, yet at a much lesser degree of automation. The main goal of
this project is to combine the expressive power of proof assistants with the
automatic reasoning capabilities of proof search procedures, proof planners,
decision procedures, model checkers, etc. and to use the enhanced system in the
formal design of reliable software. In particular we aim at providing proof
automation for the Nuprl proof development system, a tactical proof environment
that has been used in numerous applications. It offers a proven basis for
solving mathematical problems and for designing reliable hardware and software
systems. The newest release of Nuprl features one of the most exible
architectures for interacting with external problem solving devices. Our
experience with connecting Nuprl with JProver, a theorem prover for first-order
intuitionistic logic, has shown that Nuprl supports interoperability between
formalsystems in a way that makes our goal feasible.
