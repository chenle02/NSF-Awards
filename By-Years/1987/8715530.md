Dr. Barker at the University of Michigan will conduct a laboratory research
program to investigate the properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
In particular, the experiments will be designed to investigate the production of
infrared emission from PAH molecules which are excited by the absorption of
visible and ultraviolet light. In the last few years, infrared astronomical
observations have shown that many celestial objects exhibit a distinctive set of
emission features which have become known as the unidentified infrared emission
bands. It has been suggested that these emission bands are due to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon-like species in interstellar space. If this is true, then
PAH's could be an abundant and very important constituent of the interstellar
medium. Much laboratory work remains to be done to understand the properties of
PAH's before they can be confirmed to be the sources of the observed infrared
emission bands. Dr. Barker's research is an important component of the Earth-
based laboratory effort.
