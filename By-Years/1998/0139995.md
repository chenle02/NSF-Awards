Cold atom interactions and dilute Fermi degenerate atomic gases have become very
dynamic areas of research. One of the most intriguing new frontiers is the
creation of quantum degenerate dipolar fermionic gases. Such gases are predicted
to exhibit exciting new phenomena including dipole-induced mean field effects
and, perhaps, BCS superfluidity. Ultracold dipolar gases could also play a role
in the construction of a robust quantum computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dilute
Fermi degenerate atomic gases have numerous features that need to be explored.
Similar to their charged particle counterparts (electrons), their behavior in
the condensed state will be varied and depend crucially on the subtleties of
their interactions. Very little is known about ultracold dipolar Fermi systems.
One promising route to the study of such systems is through evaporative and
sympathetic cooling of magnetically trapped atomic
gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research proposal is to investigate
the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of Fermionic atoms, the
interactions between cold and ultracold atoms, and the possible creation of
atomic Fermi degenerate gases with high magnetic moment. This will be
accomplished using magnetically trapped metal atoms (such as chromium).
Spectroscopy will be used for detection of the trapped species. Precise
determination of elastic and inelastic collisional cross sections will provide
important information about these systems. Fermi degeneracy will be pursued
through a combination of laser cooling and evaporative cooling of magnetically
trapped co-resident bosonic and fermionic isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;
