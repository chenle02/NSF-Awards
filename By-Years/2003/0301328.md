AST-0301328 Finn, Rose

Dr. Finn is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst. The primary research goal of this project is to measure the amount
and radial dependence of star-formation in galaxy clusters as a function of
redshift in order to investigate the dominant physical processes that affect
star formation and galaxy evolution in cluster environments. She is developing a
technique to use narrow-band, near-infrared imaging to derive star-formation
rates for these distant galaxies from the H-alpha emission of ionized hydrogen.
The project will target galaxy clusters between redshifts of 0.5 and 0.8.

In addition to her research, Dr. Finn will design and teach a project-based
undergraduate course on observational techniques consisting of three modules on
distance indicators. One module on Cepheid Variables will be adapted for use by
high-school students and will be transferred to teachers through an existing
teacher-training program. ***
