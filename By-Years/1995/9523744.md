Under the direction of Dr. Paul Fish, Mr. John Carpenter will collect data for
his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze mortuary remains which were excavated
many years ago near Guasave, Sinalo in Northern Mexico. The mound, which was
originally believed to be an habitation, proved in fact to be a burial mound
which contained almost 200 human skeletons and associated grave goods. These
materials, which are housed in the American Museum of Natural History, have
never been fully analyzed. Mr. Carpenter will conduct a detailed examination and
in particular will focus on the variation among individuals. On this basis it
will be possible to determine the extent to which the society itself was
socially stratified and the degree of social complexity it achieved. These
materials are very poorly dated and radiocarbon determinations will be made to
determine exact chronological placement. Extensive archaeological research has
provided detailed information on the rise of complex prehistoric cultural
entities in the U.S. Southwest and massive ruins such a Chaco Canyon in New
Mexico attest to the level of social organization attained. Likewise much is
known about the civilizations of Central Mexico. However the area between these
two centers are poorly known from an archaeological perspective and
archaeologists wish to understand whether this region served as a bridge between
the North and South, whether it was a hinterland or whether it followed an
independent cultural trajectory. The research by Mr. Carpenter will provide
insight into this question. This work is important for several reasons. It will
shed new light into the development of New World civilization. It will provide
data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of a
promising young scientist.
