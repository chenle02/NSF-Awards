O-stars play a crucial role in the energetics of galaxies and the interstellar
medium, but their formation and early evolution are poorly understood.
Churchwell, a world leader in the study of these objects, will investigate the
environments of newy formed O- stars utilizing high-resolution radio and
infrared techniques, to develop models to understand the complex structure of
the gas clouds from which these objects are formed. The models will be tested by
their predictions of molecular and atomic lines which would be observable in
these clouds. Kinematics distances and proper motions will also be obtained for
some of these objects.
