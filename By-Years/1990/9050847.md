The theory and practice of mass spectrometry is an important component in the
training of modern chemists about the atomic and molecular structure of organic
and inorganic substances. The acquisition of a gas chromatographic/mass
spectrometric/data system allowed the chemistry department to improve its
curriculum in the theory and practice of mass spectrometry and, at the same
time, gave young, undergraduate student scientists hands-on experience with one
of the most powerful analytical methods for the rapid separation of complex
mixtures encountered in the real world. Experiments using the system have been
designed for and are used in Honors General Chemistry, Analytical Methods,
Organic and Advanced Organic Chemistry, and the Research and Honors Research
programs. The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to the
NSF funds.
