ABSTRACT -- CTS-9312379 Bayazitoglu The proposed research is directed at
developing a solution to the problem of heat transfer in liquid metals placed in
an alternating magnetic field. A method of relocating the sample within the
field using non-contact methods will be developed, along with a method for
determining the forces exerted by an arbitrary magnetic field on a conducting
body. In this way, the problem of heat transfer from the molten sample along
with its dynamic interaction can be addressed. Upon completion of the modeling
portion, a laboratory prototype of the relocation module will be constructed and
evaluated. The results from this evaluation process will then be compared with
the analytical model to verify it and determine its viability.
