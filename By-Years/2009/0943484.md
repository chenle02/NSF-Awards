ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;28 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0943484&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Kniffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the
vessel operated by the University of Miami; namely the R/V WALTON SMITH. The
requests specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF
inspections, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred
by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve
safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due
to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards
normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of
the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on
past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally
funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico
in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations,
the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing
oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite
connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises. The
WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete over 70 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
