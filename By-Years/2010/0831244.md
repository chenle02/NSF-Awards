ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project advances the understanding
of security and privacy in pervasive healthcare by testing technological methods
of securing implantable medical devices and by evaluating human factors through
patient studies. The most fundamental question is how to balance the opposing
goals of safety and effectiveness with security and privacy of wireless,
implantable medical devices.&lt;br/&gt; Future pervasive healthcare devices ---
including prescription-based devices like pacemakers, drug pumps, and
neurostimulators --- will not only contain long-range wireless capabilities, but
will have sophisticated processors and the ability to interact with other
devices on the person or in the person's environment. These innovations could
vastly improve healthcare, but also introduce unique security and privacy risks
not well understood from the perspectives of cyber security, medicine, public
policy, and society. A primary challenge is understanding how to overcome the
fundamental tension between security and privacy and traditional goals of safety
and effectiveness. A second challenge is learning how to design usable,
intuitive security mechanisms that patients and doctors will accept and
understand. Approaches include novel, zero-power security mechanisms that do not
drain the healthcare device's battery, and surveys of patients and other users
of pervasive healthcare technologies to learn about patient perceptions and
expectations.&lt;br/&gt; Blending computer science with healthcare, the project
prepares computer science students for interdisciplinary security research via
both research and coursework. Further demonstrating broader impact, the project
reaches out to under-represented minorities and women in computing at community
colleges in Western Massachusetts.
