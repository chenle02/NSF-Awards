Late Cretaceous marine deposits of the U.S. Western interior afford
unparalleled opportunity for study of thoracican cirripeds, which are far better
represented than suggested by the published record. Remains of these organisms
have received scant attention, partly because of minute specimen size and partly
because disarticulated skeletal elements bear close resemblance to fragments of
associated ostreid bivalves. In the study area cirriped remains occur in rocks
of wide lithologic variety from many stratigraphic horizons, and are preserved
abundantly in the articulated state. At key localities well.studied
stratigraphic sections will be searched systematically for cirriped specimens,
which will be the basis for taxonomic, biostratigraphic, and paleoecologic
analysis. Common occurrence and local great abundance of fully articulated
thoracican cirripeds in targeted formations is unique among Upper Cretaceous
stratigraphic sections of the world. Taxonomic and biostratigraphic evaluation
of such materials will aid immensely in expanding scientific knowledge of Late
Cretaceous cirriped evolution, which is at present very poorly understood.
Analysis of preservation, abundance, orientation, substrates, associated
fossils, and accompanying sedimentary structures will enable us to evaluate the
role of thoracican cirripeds in marine communities of the Western Interior Sea.
