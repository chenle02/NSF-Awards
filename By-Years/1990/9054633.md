Recently we have been developing a new paradigm for learning concepts of
probability and fractals which focuses on a form of Guided Discovery in which
cues are placed in such a fashion that the student is able to follow in the
footsteps of a researcher. In order to learn more about this alternative route
to learning science, we propose to hold a workshop to bring together both
phy7sical scientists and cognitive scientists, as ell as high school teachers
and students. In the first phase of the meeting, participants will work with the
hands-on activities and the computer software and cecome familiar with their
content and format. Next, specialists in cognitive science will propose research
methodologies that can be used to determine what students who use these
materials are learning, and how their learning process differs from that in a
more traditional science class. Does the introduction of multiple
representations lead to the development of higher order thinking skills? Can a
visual representation in a computer simulation provide an alternative route to
learning science for the student who does not deeply understand mathematics?
What features of the educational setting can lead to a revolution in high school
science teaching? How could answers to these questions affect the development of
further games, activities, and computer programs, both at Boston University and
elsewhere? Finally, what resources must be assembled to carry out this program
of study and research? The outcome of the workshop will be an over-arching
vision, a research strategy, and a set of tactics.
