9409202 Wang Several different types of rhythmic oscillations can be recorded
from the surface of the brain during different behaviors, particularly during
different stages of sleep. Oscillations of about 7-14 Hz occur during early
stages of sleep and slower oscillations of 0.5-5 Hz occur during later stages of
sleep. It is known that the 7-14 Hz oscillations arises from the thalamus and
there is some evidence that the slower oscillation may also be a thalamic
oscillation. However, it is not known exactly how the neurons of the thalamus
produce these oscillations. In this study from a young physicist, mathematical
and computational modelling studies of these rhythmic oscillations will be
carried out. The role of connections between the thalamus and cortex and the
role of properties of individual thalamic nerve cells in the production of these
oscillations will be examined. These theoretical studies should provide insights
into the original of these oscillations as well as those that occur in the brain
during sensory perception and those associated with other behaviors.
