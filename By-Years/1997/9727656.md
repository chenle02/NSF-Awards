This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of New Mexico. The student will conduct ethnographic research in
a forested area of Paraguay, among the Ache Indians. The research will evaluate
models of costs and benefits of social foraging, to test hypotheses concerning
gender, the role of variance in food intake and other factors, on local
residential group size and composition. Methods include participant observation,
a sample survey of individuals, focal follows on foraging and hunting
expeditions, and measurement of food output. This research will provide
theoretically significant data on how and why people hunt in this environment
which will be useful in improving our understanding of hunting as a mode of life
in general. There are ever fewer opportunities for empirical research on real-
life hunting societies. In addition the project will contribute to the training
of a young social scientist, and add to our knowledge about this important
region of the world.
