9632294 Abrahams This grant continues DMR's long-standing support of this
distinguished PI. The work proposed here falls in the general area of strongly
correlated fermions (and bosons). The list of projects includes several highly
complex problems of current interest in the community. Each of these projects
involve close collaboration with experiments and also need significant
breakthroughs in conceptual and mathematical development. The list includes:
various aspects and consequences of Marginal Fermi liquid theory, consequences
of odd-in-time magnetic correlations, large magnetoresistance in perovskite
manganates and inelastic scattering in bosons and its effect on Bose-Einstein
condensation. The research is expected to have impact on materials science,
condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. %%% This grant supports research
in the general area of theory of novel materials with unusual magnetic or
superconducting properties. Many of these materials need fundamentally new
conceptual advances for a clear understanding of their properties. The examples
are: new magnetic metals, heavy fermion materials (compounds based on Uranium
and Cerium) and high Tc superconductors. ***
