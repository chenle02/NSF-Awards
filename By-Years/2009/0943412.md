Increasing numbers of scientific projects leverage mobile devices to monitor and
at times interact with elements of the natural environment. This important
emerging trend however is not paired with an adequate forum for publication and
exchange of information among researchers as that of other disciplines. This
workshop gathers a representative sample of researchers and practitioners with
expertise and interest in human-environment, mobile-based interactions. It
provides a forum to present current technology trends in areas such as
networking, communication, sensing, data mining, data visualization and robotics
as well as discussions on synergistic applications. In addition to the
presentations, the workshop participants are meeting to identify and plan
sessions for presentations at future conferences.

Impacts of this workshop are expected in mobile and sensing technologies as well
as in application areas including biology, agronomy, environmental science,
public health and citizen science. The workshop invitees are drawn from diverse
areas and social-ethic backgrounds. The presentation abstracts of the workshop
will be disseminated through the workshop website, http://hembi.media.mit.edu.
