The proposed research will involve the critical evaluation of pollen, primarily
using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, from those gymnosperm
groups suggested as closely related to angiosperms and implicated as possible
ancestors. Only a paucity of data has been reported on pollen from the
gymnospermous plants proposed to be investigated. A small database is currently
in existence for dispersed gymnosperm pollen as well as pollen with possible
angiosperm affinities. The proposed study, however, will principally address the
nature of in site pollen grains from the various gymnosperm groups. Such a
narrow focus, employing electron microscopic techniques, allows for the
accumulations of significant data regarding specific pollen characters and
provides the opportunity to perform phylogenetic analyses using many more
characters from the specific taxa in question as well as to address numerous
correlative and mechanistic queries concerning in situ pollen. Funds are
requested to defray the costs of travel by the student investigator to two
selected domestic paleobotanical collections of gymnosperms and one foreign
collection in order to collect in situ specimens for investigation.
