Under the direction of Dr. Linda Schele, Mr. Matthew Looper will collect data
for his doctoral dissertation. He will study the stelae erected between ca. 720
to 810 AD at the Guatemalan Mayan site of Quirigua. Stelae are large stone
plaques with carved inscriptions and produced and erected by ruling kings to
proclaim their victories and legitimize their power. They thus contain a wealth
of political and historic information. The site of Quirigua covers approximately
4 square kilometers and contains a large number of such remains. With National
Science Foundation support, Mr. Looper will study the Quirigua stelae and with a
professional photographer make a detailed and complete record of them. Copies of
all photographs will be given to the government of Guatemala and to the
University of Texas at Austin where they will serve as a permanent archive and
record available to all researchers. In recent years great strides have been
made in decoding this previously unreadable language and the results have
provided a wealth of information for archaeologists. Mr. Looper wishes to
understand how the many Mayan states developed and Quirigua, because of its many
stelae provides an excellent test case. Work done to date indicates that this
small polity grew rapidly between ca. 720 and 810 AD and that a number of
monumental buildings were erected during this period. The stelae appear to
record this process and the wars which the Quirigua people fought and apparently
won. Through analysis of the writing Mr. Looper hopes to gain insight into how
this occurred. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide
data in the form of high quality photographs which will be of value to many
researchers. Mayan artifacts are often stolen for illicit sale and such a record
is essential. The project will also serve to increase our understanding of how
Mayan peoples developed state level organization in a difficult lowland tropical
environment. Finally, it will assist in the training of a promising young
scientist.
