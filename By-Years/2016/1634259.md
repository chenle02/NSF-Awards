The use of virtualized, cloud infrastructure has transformed the nature and
scope of modern enterprise computing. Large corporations today, in place of
investing in dedicated computing infrastructure, effectively rent compute
infrastructure by taking advantage of both free and pay-as-you-go cloud
offerings. From an economic perspective this creates a win-win situation: it
lets "buyers" pay for what they use and scale their infrastructure seamlessly at
low cost without investing to buy or maintain resources while creating
profitable businesses for "sellers" or providers. Cost-savings are derived from
effectively pooling resource needs across a number of buyers of cloud
infrastructure; these cost-savings are in principle shared by providers and
consumers of cloud infrastructure. However, as it stands currently buyers end up
buying resources from one provider only leading to inefficiency. The goal of
this project is to address the operational challenges to enable an efficient
market for the enterprise cloud infrastructure. The principle investigators are
committed to the mentoring of individuals from underrepresented and minority
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on two parallel research
thrusts: buyer-side -and seller-side problems. A key element of both these
problems is the role played by uncertainty and the challenge in adopting either
stochastic models (which tend to be highly unstable in this domain) or
adversarial models (which tend to ignore the copious amount of historical data
typically available). As such, project introduces a data-driven model that
generalizes a broad class of models with a rich history in the statistics
literature. This model treads the line between stochastic and adversarial
modeling. In the context of this model, two important classes of problems are
studied. On the buyer side, a natural version of what has become known as the
k-secretary problem is studied. On the seller side, a Network Revenue Management
model of demand is studied. In all of these, the guiding objective is to advance
science required to develop out-of-the-box software that can be deployed by
practitioners without the need for model fitting or calibration. The project
will potentially lead to open-source system that allows buyers to achieve a
dramatic reduction in costs taking advantage of spot markets.
