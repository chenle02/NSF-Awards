This project will conduct a quantitative and systematic investigation of the
processes controlling the inner magnetospheric magnetic topology during
geomagnetic storms. Selected storm events will be simulated with several
numerical models and the results will be compared with each other and with
observations. The data and model comparisons will make it possible to estimate
the storm-time distortion of the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere and
to determine what current systems are responsible for which aspects of this
distortion. The codes include the following: the Hot Electron and Ion Drift
Integrator (HEIDI), the Inner Magnetosphere Particle Transport and Acceleration
Model (IMPTAM), and the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF, and the models
coupled therein). This study will include extensive data analysis, particularly
of magnetospheric magnetic field measurements and near-Earth plasma data
(especially from Polar, Geotail, FAST, GOES and LANL geosynchronous satellites,
and IMAGE), and ground-based magnetic perturbation observations. The primary
objective of the study is to quantify which of the major current systems cause
what aspects of the inner magnetospheric field distortion during storms. The
project will examine specific storm events with physics-based numerical models
to understand the flow of plasma leading to the current systems that dominate
the magnetic field distortions. The relative contributions to the inner
magnetosphere by convective or inductive electric fields will also be examined.
The role of the plasma sheet density, temperature, and structure will be
assessed to determine the influence of localized injections on the magnetic
field distortions. The project involves an international collaboration and
promoting underrepresented groups by bringing a woman scientist, Dr. Ganushkina
of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, to Michigan to work directly with the
Principal Investigator (PI).
