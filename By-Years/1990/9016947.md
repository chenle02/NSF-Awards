In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Buchanan will prepare synthetic analogues of the active
sites of non-heme oxo-iron proteins. These proteins are capable of functions
ranging from oxygen transport and activation to phosphate ester hydrolysis, yet
little structural information about them is firmly established. New oxo-bridged
diiron complexes containing polyimidazole ligands will be synthesized and
characterized. Physical methods will include X-ray crystallography,
electrochemical measurements, electronic spectroscopy, magnetic and Mossbauer
studies, EPR, and NMR. The binding of dioxygen, hydro- peroxide, and selected
anions to the models containing open coordination sites will be examined. The
oxygenase chemistry of the binuclear complexes towards alkanes will be explored.
