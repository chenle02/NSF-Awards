A series of topics in probability and statistics will be studied which are
unified by the geometric techniques that are employed. Contact sets will be used
to study questions of robustness in Bayesian estimation. The question of
reconstructing a subset from finitely many central projections, knowing that it
comes from a given population, will be examined. The results will be applied to
problems in tomography. A further goal is a better understanding of the
structure of finite dimensional moment spaces induced by the class of all
measures on a given polyhedral region. Further aims are generalized confidence
intervals subject to a preassigned smoothness condition and probability
densities having given moments and possessing a maximal degree of smoothness. A
new minimal entropy method will be studied to achieve a partition of data into
relatively homogeneous blocks or clusters.
