Ongoing breakthroughs in nationally important research areas like Verification
and Artificial Intelligence depend on continuing advances in high-performance
automated theorem proving tools. The typical use of these tools is as backends:
application problems are translated by an application tool into (typically very
large and complex) logic formulas, which are then handed off to a logic solver.
Different tradeoffs between linguistic expressiveness and the difficulty of
solving the resulting problems give rise to different logics. Solver
communities, formed around these different logics, have developed their own
community research infrastructures to encourage innovation and ease adoption of
their solver technology. Such infrastructure includes standard formats for logic
formulas, libraries of benchmark formulas, and regular solver competitions to
spur solver advances.

Currently, these different infrastructures are all developed separately, at
significant cost in equipment and support. These costs are paid again and again
for the different services, since there is currently no global piece of
computing infrastructure suitable for the logic solving domain, which all these
communities can use. This project is building a simplified proof-of-concept of a
single piece of shared computing infrastructure, which could eventually be used
by many different logic solver communities. The award also provides other
support for soliciting research community feedback on the prototype and the
design of a comprehensive infrastructure.
