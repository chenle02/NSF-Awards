Christopher Bardeen of the University of California-Riverside is supported by
the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Division of
Chemistry to carry out research to probe how exciton structure impacts excited
state dynamics in molecular crystal systems, with an emphasis on processes
relevant for organic photovoltaic materials. The research plan is designed to
accomplish three objectives. First, the team will continue their collaborative
work on using time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy and theory to characterize
delocalized exciton states in polyacene molecular crystals. Second, the dynamics
and reaction mechanism of singlet fission, a process whereby a absorption of a
single photon leads to the creation of two excitons, and potentially two
electron-hole pairs, will be studied. Crystalline tetracene will be a model
system for clarifying how this unique relaxation process works. Third, energy
migration in organic systems, which plays an important role in determining solar
cell efficiencies, will be studied using a modified version of the optical
transient grating experiment. The goal will be to measure exciton diffusion
lengths of 20 nm or less by using a combination of standing waves and high
dynamic range detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall thrust of this
research is to generate fundamental insights into how exciton properties like
delocalization can affect singlet fission and exciton diffusion, thus providing
a way to assess the ultimate potential of crystalline organic materials for
photovoltaic applications. This understanding in turn could aid in the design of
improved materials for solar cells and address an important societal problem:
the need for clean, inexpensive, and renewable energy. Graduate students and
postdoctoral associates will be trained in technologically vital areas. Outreach
activities to local elementary schools which enroll a majority population of
students from underrepresented groups in science will also be initiated.
