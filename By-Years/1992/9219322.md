The rapid retrograde degeneration of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) following damage to the visual cortex in adult mammals precludes
subsequent axonal regeneration and restoration of function. In young animals of
many species, LGN neurons also degenerate after damage to the visual cortex but,
in contrast to adults, some neurons are spared and are able to establish new
pathways resulting in remarkable behavioral compensation. Recent evidence
suggests that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) may prevent neuronal death.
However, the lack of a suitable delivery system for administering trophic
factors or their genes to non-dividing neurons has been a major obstacle in
determining their efficacy in vivo. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
will permit the development of a Herpes simplex viral vector carrying the bFGF
gene. This vector will be used to determine whether the production of bFGF in
LGN neurons will prevent their degeneration after damage to the visual cortex in
adult rat. These studies have the potential for improving the technology for
gene therapy not only for treating damaged neurons in the visual system, but
also neurons affected by damage, disease or genetic abnormality in any system in
the mammalian brain or peripheral nervous system.
