This project enhances the robotic control track of the Electrical and Computer
Engineering curriculum. Under this curriculum, the students are provided with
state-of-the-art laboratory equipment that satisfies the demand for the next
century. The program accommodates all students of the College of Engineering,
including Electrical and Computer Engineering students, as well as Mechanical
Engineering and Materials Sciences. The new equipment promotes enthusiasm among
the students to learn the basics of robotics. *
