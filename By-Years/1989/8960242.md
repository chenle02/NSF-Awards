This project is funded as a Phase I award under the 1989 Small Business
Innovation Research Program solicitation. The purpose of the research is to
develop two software products. Both will enable users of micro (personal) and
mini (small office size) computers to access and analyze data from social
science archives. Archives used include those already amassed at Sociometrics
Corp., and others from government sources such as the Census Bureau and NSF-
supported archives including the General Social Survey and the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics. Programs will include systems to convert files to machine-
readable form, and then to permit analyses using the standard SPSS and SAS
programs. Collection of social science data is increasingly centralized, due to
difficulty, cost and other factors. Access to these data by educational
institutions, business and government will depend increasingly upon data sharing
such as these products are designed to facilitate.
