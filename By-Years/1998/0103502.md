The 2001 Aspen Winter Physics Conference will devote one week, February 4-10,
2001 to gravitational waves and their detection. The winter series began in 1985
and the first gravitational wave session was held in 1995. This conference has
grown to be one of the most important for the gravitational wave community.
Experimental and theoretical results and plans for the future will be discussed
with an emphasis on recent progress in building and operating several gravity
wave interferometers in the US, Europe and Japan.
