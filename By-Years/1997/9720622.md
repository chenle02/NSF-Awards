9720622 Kieffaber In this project, the nighttime airglow from neutral atoms and
molecules will be observed at four wavelengths which originate at four different
heights in the atmosphere. An existing all-sky imager will be upgraded by
incorporating a cooled CCD device which produces digitzed images. The all-sky
images will record the detailed structure of airglow emissions while an eight-
channel photometer measures intensities at four airglow wavelengths. These data
will be analyzed to determine wavelengths and speeds of gravity waves passing
through the airglow layers. The small scale structure and fluctuations will give
information about turbulence and energy dissipation caused by the passage of
gravity waves. The photometer also measures the intensity of the airglow
continuum at four wavelengths; analysis of these data can enhance understanding
of the photochemical and dynamic processes occurring at these atmospheric
heights. The research will add to an existing data base covering eight years and
three latitudes. This project is supported by the POWRE program, which will
allow the PI to spend a sabbatical focusing on this research, and involve
undergraduate students in the project. Despite being at an undergraduate
institution, the PI has maintained strong ties to the CEDAR (Coupling,
Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) community but has not been able
to devote significant amounts of her time to research.
