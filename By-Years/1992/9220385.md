Development of accurate, computationally efficient simulation models for
hydrologic processes and vegetation is needed for use in global climate models.
Methods for validating such models need to be broader in scope and easier to
implement on various time and length scales. The objective of this study is to
develop and test a watershed simulation model which includes simulation of the
response of vegetation to changing hydrologic conditions. An important objective
of this study is to find out whether the hydrologic status of watersheds can be
assessed accurately by using remote sensing observations of vegetation and
simulation models. Our approach involves development of a watershed simulation
model which integrates existing ground-based, airborne, and satellite
observations of a watershed in the Uinta Mountains. The vegetaton distribution
will be based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's digital vegetation
database. The model will be used to simulate the response of vegetation (i.e.,
transpiration, assimilation, leaf growth the abcission) to environmental
conditions and model values of soil moisture, soil temperature, streamflow,
transpiration, surface temperature, leaf area, and assimilation will be compared
to measured values. We will make new field measurements of soil moisture,
temperature, transpiration, and photosynthesis. We will also use operational
meteorological and hydrologic data for model initialization and validation.
Finally, the sensitivity of predictions to model parameters will be
investigated.
