Work will focus on needs for new theory in three-body recombination (both
charged-particle and neutral-particle) at ultralow energies, relevant to the
formation of anti-hydrogen and to Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) experiments.
Several significant and basic collisional mechanisms need to be described. Areas
of concern include Stark-mixing transitions, collisional transitions,
vibrational quenching and collisional re-dissociation.
