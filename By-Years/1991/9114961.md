An investigation into the ignition of aluminum-based water slurries by
ultrasound is proposed. This technique may circumscribe the problems associated
with atomization and the protective oxide layer on the aluminum particles.
Ultrasound has been shown to be capable of producing temperatures above 3000 K
and pressures up to 500 atm due to high speed interparticle collisions. A 2 kW
generator ducted through a catenary-shaped horn to produce an intensity of 20
kW/cm2 will be used to produce an estimated 10 kW thermal power. Ferric oxide
will be added to the slurry initially because it will increase the heat release
by aluminum oxidation, with the hope of stabilizing the reaction. The award is
made through the SGER program. It offers the opportunity to prove the concept of
acoustic ignition for energetic, continuously flowing slurries, which could
provide a concentrated energy source producing highly elevated temperatures.
