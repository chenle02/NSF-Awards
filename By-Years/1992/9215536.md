Real-time recognition of speaker-independent connected speech has proven to be a
difficult problem for electronic systems. Low-precision highly parallel analog
neural networks have been shown to recognize speaker-dependent small-vocabulary
connected speech using standard components. This project will research and
develop massively parallel custom integrated circuits that will perform this
task, using integrated delay lines and analog computing networks. Phase I has
included the design and fabrication of test chips to prove the feasibility of
our development; the Phase II effort will continue this development through
design, fabrication and testing of full- scale prototype systems. The approach
utilizes standard readily available CMOS Bulk integrated circuit technology so
products arising from this research can be fabricated reliably and economically
by a number of vendors. Phase I culminated in the fabrication and testing of an
expandable, programmable single-chip speech classifier. This chip operates at
over 100 MIPS and enjoys a 50x improvement in performance over DSP chips
(normalized to the same silicon area usage). The P.I. has also shown the
feasibility of using floating-nodes to provide nonvolatile storage of analog
voltages. These voltages can be used to control the operation of the chip thus
implementing the capability to learn or be trained in the field. During Phase
II, the P.I. will investigate the mapping of learning algorithms to efficient
silicon circuits. This proposed research applies the P.I.'s experience to the
challenging and important problem of real-time speech recognition and may lead
directly to inexpensive products with wide commercial applicability.
