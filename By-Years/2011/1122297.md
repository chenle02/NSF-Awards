This project develops and uses mathematical tools to study the dynamics of a
variety of cellular physiological processes. The specific projects include a
study to better understand how the electrical signal that coordinates cardiac
activity is transmitted from cell to cell, including the effects of ephaptic
coupling; how random fluctuations of ion channels can lead to spontaneous
electrical activity in nerves; how dividing cells coordinate the separation of
their duplicated chromosomes; how proteins are made, sorted into vesicles,
transported and processed, (recycled or destroyed) in a well-controlled manner,
and how bacteria build their flagellar motors to well-defined specifications.
All of these projects employ nonlinear partial differential equations and/or
stochastic differential equations while the tools of mathematical modeling,
dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, stochastic
processes, and numerical simulation are all used in this work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the biological problems to be studied are quite
diverse, they are unified by their many common mathematical features. Thus, this
work has the two-fold goal of using mathematical modeling approaches to
understand specific complex cellular processes, and to discover common
principles and transferable concepts that are in operation in many different
areas of biology. In this way, this work contributes to the development of a
fundamental and unified theory of how biological processes work, and in doing
so, will contribute to our understanding of many issues relating to human health
and medicine.
