Increased attention to human-induced environmental change has highlighted the
need to understand more completely the nature and rate of responses of critical
systems to changing environmental conditions. Among the relationships for which
greater knowledge is needed are responses of hydrologic systems to changes in
the land uses within drainage basins. This project will analyze the dynamics of
watershed response to during the last century in southwestern Georgia, where
rapid deforestation occurred in the mid- to late-1800s, leading to a deep,
intricate system of gullies and canyons. In recent decades, however, logging and
agricultural activity in the area have diminished substantially, causing less
dramatic but nonetheless significant changes in runoff regimes. Fieldwork in the
area will provide information for more accurate dating of land-use disturbances
and fluvial responses. Sediment samples of valley fill and terrace sequences
will be dated through dendrochronologic and aerial photographic analyses. Land-
use changes will be identified using tax records and aerial photos. Data from
these investigations will be related to topographic and climatic data using a
modified hydrologic model. This project will contribute to both theoretical and
empirical understandings of the conditions that promote fluvial geomorphic
instability. It also will contribute to new knowledge about the lag times of
response and recovery when watershed characteristics change through human
activity.
