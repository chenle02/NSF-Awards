Humans have dramatically altered the earth's nitrogen (N) cycle. Anthropogenic
introduction of reactive N into the biosphere now exceeds natural sources of N
to terrestrial ecosystems. This results in substantial negative human and
environment health effects. The only process that permanently removes reactive N
from the environment is denitrification (reduction, by bacteria, of reactive N
to non-reactive N2 gas). Denitrification occurs in almost all terrestrial,
freshwater, and marine ecosystems, but fragmentation of the science has impeded
quantification of this critical process. This project will develop an
international coordinated network (RCN) of denitrification scientists from a
wide array of disciplines, from molecular biology to ecosystem science, and from
soil science to oceanography. Through interdisciplinary exchange it will advance
quantification of denitrification, and models to scale-up site specific
measurements to ecosystem, regional and global scales. Mechanisms to achieve
this include workshops, targeted integrative special sessions at major
scientific meetings, and a website with contact information and on-line
training. &lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: Interdisciplinary education of
undergraduate, graduate students and post-docs is an important function of this
project. It will contribute knowledge to future management of the global N cycle
to meet objectives of both food security and environmental quality. Knowledge
will be shared between "academic" denitrification experts and individuals who
are using the denitrification process for practical applications (e.g.,
wastewater treatment facilities, human engineered wetlands).
