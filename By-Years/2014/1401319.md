The interplay between finding solutions to sets of equations and questions in
geometry has been very fruitful in Mathematics. The PI's research fits into this
way of thinking about both topics. The study of linear algebraic groups and
homogeneous spaces provides a unified plank to understanding distinct
interesting objects in algebra, geometry and number theory. Extending the
classical study over number fields, for example the rational numbers, to
function fields, which includes the class of simple functions such as
polynomials, which is part of the PI's proposal,is useful from the geometric
perspective. Engaging graduate students on topics related to algebraic groups
and homogeneous spaces, an area ripe with questions accessible to students, via
seminars and workshops, will be part of the activities of the PI during this
project execution.

The study of quadratic forms and their zeros over function fields over number
fields and p-adic fields is an example of the objects studied during this
proposal period. The PI plans to investigate questions related to the study of
homogeneous spaces with special reference to quadratic forms and Brauer groups.
The PI shall study the period-index questions for the Brauer group of function
fields of curves over number fields with a view to bounding the u-invariant of
such fields. It is an open question whether quadratic forms in sufficiently many
variables over function fields of curves over totally imaginary number fields
have a nontrivial zero with conditional results dependent on the Hasse principle
for twisted moduli spaces over curves over number fields; the PI will
investigate the obstruction to the Hasse principle for such spaces. Higher
reciprocity obstructions using the Bloch-Ogus theory will be used to study the
existence of rational points on homogeneous spaces over function fields. The PI
also proposes to study G-trace forms, via construction of invariants, towards
answering realisability questions.
