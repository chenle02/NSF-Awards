Abstract Pilot Study: Carbon Isotope Composition of Aptian Plant Fossils from
the Arundel Formation, Western Maryland A. Hope Jahren, Johns Hopkins University
Current literature reflects interest in a new potential player in the carbon
cycle: methane hydrates are solids composed of methane and water that result
from bacterial activity in marine sediments. In order to assess the importance
of methane hydrates in long-term global climate, we propose to study the
biogeochemical consequences of a methane release event during the early Aptian
(~117 million years ago). Toward this, we will obtain a carbon-isotope record of
plant fossils from sequences located within the Arundel Formation (within the
Potomac Group) of Western Maryland. This record will be compared with a record
recently obtained from terrestrial sediments from Colombia, South America, which
shows a dramatic change in carbon isotope value during the early Aptian (~117
Ma).
