J.D. Tygar's research interests focus on computer security. He was the co-
designer and implementor of ITOSS, the Integrated toolkit for Operating System
Security, and has designed and implemented a number of new security techniques
and algorithms. He is currently developing techniques for realizing "self-
securing programs", programs which are able to run securely and efficiently in
environments which provide only minimal security support. He is conducting the
following research: -To develop a family of randomized algorithms sufficient for
implementing self-securing programs. -To build a library of software routines
which allow software engineers to transparently implement self-securing support
for their application programs. -To demonstrate the utility of these ideas by
implementing them cleanly on the Camelot transaction processing system running
under the Mach operating system. -To document, test, and distribute the code
developed as a result of this implementation. He is also interested in visual
programming of security constraints and in the inventing of algorithmic
techniques for detecting security flaws in running operating systems.
