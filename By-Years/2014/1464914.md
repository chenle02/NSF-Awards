Abstract

In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Pat Dussault of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Prof.
Keith Kuwata of Macalester College are developing new approaches to the
synthesis of ethers. Ethers, which contain a Carbon-Oxygen-Carbon linkage, are
an important functionality present in medicines, natural products, solvents, and
organic materials. The research pursued under this award is anticipated to have
impact both in chemistry and in associated fields such as drug discovery and
materials science. Dussault and coworkers are also creating a practical and
widely accessible knowledge clearinghouse related to the synthetic application
of organic peroxides, that is encouraging wider exploitation and safer
application of the rich chemistry of peroxides. Other broader impacts of this
work include the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in
experimental and computational research methods and the mutual enrichment of
collaboration between a research university and a primarily undergraduate
institution.

Existing methods for the introduction of the ether group are predominantly based
upon reaction of nucleophilic oxygen with electrophilic carbon. The research
under this award employs both experimental and theoretical approaches to explore
a new mode of synthesis based upon attack of carbon nucleophiles on the
electrophilic oxygen atoms within organic peroxides. The research is organized
around two major research aims. Aim 1 combines experimental and theoretical
approaches to develop improved methods for ether synthesis by the reaction of
peroxides with carbanions. Emphasis is placed on understanding the factors that
influence peroxide reactivity, the mechanism of the bond-forming step, the scope
of C-O bonds that are approachable via this strategy, and control of selectivity
in attack on unsymmetrical peroxides. Aim 2 investigates intermolecular C-O bond
forming reactions as an approach to specific classes of functionalized ethers
and intramolecular reactions as an approach to cyclic and spirocyclic ethers.
