This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro in the purchase of a modern 300 MHz multinuclear NMR Spectrometer.
This equipment will be used in the following areas of research: alkene-CO
copolymerization using palladium catalysts, kinetic and mechanistic studies of
benzocyclobutenyl-functionalized oligomers and polymers, NMR investigations of
chemical exchange processes in organic and biological systems, synthesis and
alkene polymerization studies of new metallocene catalysts, and structural and
mechanistic studies of coordination complexes of redox-active heterocyclic
ligands. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
