9409985 Tu The award is for the development of motorized, ball-bearing, high-
speed spindles with active bearing thermal load monitoring and regulation, and
with adequate spindle stiffness maintained throughout a wider operating speed
range as compared to current practice. Techniques to characterize, monitor, and
regulate the bearing thermal load will be developed and result in design
improvements and better spindle operation. The results of the work would be of
use to the aerospace and automobile industries which have employed high-speed
machining. Advances in spindle technology resulting from this work would
complement advances in cutting tool materials and result in improved
productivity.
