This award provides partial support for participation by US scientists in the
17th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics to be held in
Grenoble, France in August 1988. Theoretical and applied mechanics is a well-
established field which includes among others, turbulence, hypersonic and
transonic flow, magneto-hydrodynamics, dynamic plasticity, biomechanics,
geophysics, fracture mechanics and composites. US has been allotted a
significant portion of the invited and contributed papers in these topics. The
US National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, which is part of the
National Research Council, will administer a travel grant program for US
participants using this NSF award as well as funds from the Army Research
Office, Office of Naval Research and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
