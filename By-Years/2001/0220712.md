This project examines the vulnerability of 120 of the nation's largest cities to
natural hazard events. The research will identify and integrate within a
geographical information system, those specific biophysical, social, and built
environment variables that either increase or decrease vulnerability in cities.
Three questions drive this research: 1) What underlying factors produce human
systems (or social) vulnerability and what metrics are most appropriate for
measuring it? 2) Can we develop a consistent and robust comparative measure that
allows us to compare the overall vulnerability of one metropolitan area to
another using hazard, social, and built environment indicators? and 3) Does the
relative importance of the three key indicators (hazard, social, and built
environment) change over time and space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will
utilize existing hazard and demographic databases as well as those created by
the investigator through prior NSF-funded research. For each metropolitan area
we will develop a series of composite indexes that allow us to paint a picture
of the vulnerability of the natural, social, and built environment in each city.
The availability of historic data enables us to monitor changes in vulnerability
during the past 40 years (1960-2000). By using a geographical information
system, we will be able to map not only the geographic differences in
vulnerability, but also the historic changes as well. In this way, we should be
able to determine which urban areas are the most vulnerable and why.&lt;br/&gt;
