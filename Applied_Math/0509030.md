The chronological calculus (CC) is a tool for computation and analysis of time-
varying nonlinear vector fields and noncommuting flows. It is based on the
classical technique of lifting dynamical systems to the space of linear
operators on an algebra of smooth functions. This project will use the CC to
investigate the geometric and algebraic foundations of fully nonlinear control
systems as they commonly appear, in particular, in models in the bio-medical
sciences. Typical items are the curvature of optimal control, and ideal
structures in Zinbiel algebras. One challenge is to merge the formal work in
combinatorics and nonassociative algebra with rigorous justifications how these
formal objects map onto analytic and geometric structures. A key objective is to
understand how the underlying geometry affects and limits the structural
behavior of dynamical systems that model diverse applications. Moreover, the
algebraic and combinatorial tools developed in this project also yield compact
algorithmic tools that lend themselves to high performance computation.

This project will have diverse broader impacts, both horizontally and
vertically: The tools and methodologies to be developed are immediately
applicable in a diverse set of disciplines, basically everywhere where it
matters in which order actions are taken. The classes of systems considered in
this project have uses that include quantum systems, high performance numerical
computation, operations research, and many areas in the biomedical sciences,
from population dynamics to pharmacokinetics and molecular biology. Motivated by
applied problems, this project develops new mathematical tools, and makes them
available to the applied sciences, thereby strengthening interdisciplinary ties.
Complementing the horizontal impacts, this project will also enhance the
vertical integration and the local infrastructure by developing an attractive
control curriculum that acts as a pipeline to funnel new talents from all
backgrounds into becoming active participants in the discovery process.
Principal means for this are exciting problems that connect control theory and
the biosciences, and the highly experimental nature of using interactive
visualization tools in this project. Both of these allow undergraduates to start
meaningful participation with only minimal formal prerequisites while seamlessly
leading to advanced theoretical work.
