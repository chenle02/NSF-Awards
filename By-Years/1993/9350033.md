9350033 Sobol New York's Statewide Systemic Initiative will develop an Urban
Networks project to implement the state's comprehensive, systemic reform effort,
the New Compact for Learning, by beginning implementation in the state's six
largest urban school districts (New York, Buffalo, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester,
and Yonkers). The Compact was adopted by the Board of Regents in March 1991 and
specifies high expectations, standards, and outcomes for grades K-12. The
Compact is an open-ended plan for continuing school district reassessment and
innovation. A common RFP will be developed and schools in each of the six
districts will be selected as Research and Development (R and D) schools to
provide high-level content and assessment for all students, and long-term
teacher development programs. Districts will establish local partnerships with
the mathematics/science communities, parents, and business and industry in
support of the initiative. The State will provide additional resources to
support the effort through State field-based assistance teams, staff
development, a new school accreditation program that focuses on teaching and
learning, and coordination with existing programs aimed at at-risk students.
Results and strategies from the R and D schools will inform future State policy
action. ***
