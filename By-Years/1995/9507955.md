This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. Julie Irwin of New York University
(SBR 9510914). The PIs propose to test a new model (the social judgment scheme
model) of group decision making. This model pertains to decisions concerning
continuous variables such as money or other quantities. In the experiments to be
performed by the PIs, the issues to be decided will include decisions about
public hazards that inspire the feeling of dread. The PIs will manipulate a
number of procedural aspects of mock panels or committees in order to ascertain
the influence of these factors. Such factors will include the group decision
rule (e.g., unanimity or majority), group size, accountability of the group to
other constituencies, and framing.
