The Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium (KNAC), consisting of the astronomy and
astronomy/physics departments at Colgate University, Haverford College,
Middlebury College, Swarthmore College, Vassar College, Wellesley College,
Wesleyan University, and Williams College, is upgrading the laboratory
experiences of its astronomy students. The departments are bringing new CCD
technology for imaging and spectroscopy to introductory and intermediate level
students by purchasing spectrographs, X-terminals, computer memory, and hard
disks for existing CCD cameras and workstations. They will then be able to teach
image processing techniques to classes as well as introduce the important
astrophysical technique of spectroscopy to all levels of students. Exercises
include: cluster H-R diagrams; supernova, stellar, and asteroid light curves;
parallax of asteroids; astrometry of asteroids; using planetary moons to
illustrate Kepler's Laws; taking spectra and observing the binary system Albireo
in the B and V filters to show how the magnitude with each filter correlates
with the observed color differences and spectral type; and identification of
stellar spectra.
