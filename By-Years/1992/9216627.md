This proposal is a request for funds for 1993 to continue analyses presently
underway addressing issue of sediment transport on the Amazon continental shelf.
This sediment transport program is part of the AmasSeds project (A Multi-
disciplinary Amazon Shelf Sediment Study) which began in 1989 and is scheduled
to end in December 1992. We are requesting an additional year of support
because: 1) the success of the field program has exceeded expectations and has
resulted in not only a large data set but one that has revealed other important
sedimentary processes (not considered in the original proposal) which also
should be addressed; and 2) an additional year will provide time to synthesized
the findings and integrate results with those of the other four research groups
involved in the project.
