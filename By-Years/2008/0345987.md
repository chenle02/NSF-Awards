In this renewal award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. John R. Lombardi of the City College of New
York will conduct research studying the resonance Raman spectra of mass-selected
transition metal clusters. The systems to be studied include heteronuclear metal
dimers, as well as trimers and tetramers. Many of these systems are of interest
as potential catalysts for industrial processes. Results from these
spectroscopic studies will also be used to infer information about the bonding
in these systems. The mass-selected molecules will be embedded in rare gas
matrices at low temperatures or deposited onto semiconductor quantum dot arrays.

These studies will help shed light on certain catalytic systems, as well as
provide benchmark experimental values with which to test computational methods
dealing with heavy metal atoms. In addition, they will provide valuable research
experience to students coming from groups traditionally underrepresented in
chemistry.
