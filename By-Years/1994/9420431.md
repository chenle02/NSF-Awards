9420431 Akay ABSTRACT The proposed curriculum development program will transfer
new research results to undergraduate engineering students at Carnegie Mellon
University in the context of new discovery-oriented Open Laboratories and
Design-Form-Research projects. Students at the Freshmen through Senior levels
will learn about, use, and further develop theoretical and experimental findings
from a team of established researchers. Technical results will be drawn from
research programs, institutes, and centers at Carnegie Mellon, including the
Engineering Design Research Center, the Data Storage Systems Center, the
Robotics Institute, and the Environmental Institute. ***
