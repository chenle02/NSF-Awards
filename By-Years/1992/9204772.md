Proposed research in the Devonian of the western United States involves three
broad areas of endeavor. 1. Brachiopod systematics: especially Siluro-Devonian
spiriferid brachiopods at the genus, family, and subordinal levels, their range
events, and biogeographical significance, in connection with preparation of the
revised edition of the Brachiopod Treatise. 2. Brachiopod and conodont
biostratigraphy of the Middle Devonian and conodont biostratigraphy across the
Frasnian-Famennian boundary. In these sequences Great Basin depositional history
is being investigated with a focus on eustatic events of deepening (Middle
Devonian) and platform exposure (Upper Devonian). 3. Investigation of the Upper
Devonian faunal sequence, with emphasis on brachiopod-dominated communities and
zones integrated with the conodont zonal scheme, will continue to build on
published research that has made known the Lower and Middle Devonian sequence.
