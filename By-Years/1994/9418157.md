9418157 Rutherford This project continues experimental work directed at
understanding conditions and magmatic processes in calc-alkaline magma systems.
The overall objective of this research is to better understand the evolution of
these magmas, and the controls on their degassing, mixing, emplacement in
crustal magam chambers, and eruption. These objectives will be achieved by
determining crystal melt equilibria for assembalgges in equilibrium with a
C-O-H- (+ S + Cl) fluid of fixed or measureable compositions. Of equal interest
are solubility measurements of the various C-O-H-S species in melts, and
establishment of equations of state which describe changes in fluid phase
fugacities with P, T, and composition.
