Earth Systems Science (40) We are integrating GIS technology into most field,
laboratory, and classroom courses in a new Earth and Environmental Sciences
(EES) program at Virginia Wesleyan College. Our project includes a request to
equip an enhanced laboratory/lecture classroom and a small GIS laboratory, and
acquire two pieces of environmental monitoring equipment capable of collecting
digital data for import and use in ArcView . Although GIS has established itself
as an important tool for the manipulation, analysis, and display of spatial
data, it is not always easy for students outside of geography to gain exposure
to, and proficiency with, this technology. To help narrow the gap, we are
integrating GIS into nearly all courses of the existing EES curriculum. We are
adapting parts of exemplary programs at Sul Ross University, Lewis and Clark
University, Washington and Lee University, Richard Stockton University, and
Miami University. Students just beginning their college career become familiar
with only a small number of spatial manipulations in their lower division
courses, benefiting mostly from the visual aspects of GIS, whereas EES majors
close to graduation become quite proficient in all aspects of spatial data
analysis. Because the available data exist in almost limitless variety, equally
diverse classroom situations are being employed to encourage hypothesis building
and testing, discussion of cause and effect, and cooperative learning. Future
K-12 teachers and students taking EES courses to fulfill general studies
requirements are also discovering that GIS components in lecture and lab make
the experiences more interactive, visually stimulating, and fun.
