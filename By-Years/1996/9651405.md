The widespread availability of economical, digital technology is changing how
society views machines and communication. In the future, work in speech
recognition and analysis will be an essential component of person-machine
interaction. Thus, in the coming years, successful phonetics scientists and
engineers will need to understand and appreciate speech production and speech
acoustics. Traditionally, engineers have had limited instruction in speech
production, while those studying linguistics and speech production have had
limited training in speech acoustics. This project addresses these needs by
developing an undergraduate phonetics laboratory. The laboratory serves as the
basis for three new courses: an introductory lecture course, an introductory
laboratory course, and an upper-level undergraduate analysis course. A key
feature of this project is the expansion of an existing collaboration with
Haskell Indian Nations University. The Department of Speech-Language-Hearing has
been operating the Native American Training Program (NATP) in collaboration with
Haskell. This project builds on that collaboration by expanding instruction in
basic science. In addition to cross-listing courses at both universities, this
project is developing laboratory assignments that utilize both English and
Native American language materials. These materials are being developed by NATP
students working with faculty from the Department of Linguistics who have
expertise in Native languages. This cross-cultural collaboration holds great
promise for recruitment of Native American students into science-related
careers.
