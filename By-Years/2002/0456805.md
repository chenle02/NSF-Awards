An Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) planning meeting
has been awarded to determine the feasibility of the University of West Virginia
with the Georgia Institute of Technology of establishing a new I/UCRC for Vision
Enhancement Technology. West Virginia University brings a core team of
researchers in this field, a close working relationship with state agencies, a
model virtual environments laboratory, and clinical research and outreach
facilities. The Georgia Institute of Technology has engineering faculty with
expertise in electrical engineering, rehabilitation engineering, industrial
design, optics, computer science and other disciplines that will bring their
resources together to focus on the needs of the low vision and blind
populations.
