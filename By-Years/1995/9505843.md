9505843 Kodama This project will test a new low -temperature demagnetization
technique for isolating single domain magnetization from multi-domain-like
behavior in magnetite from rocks of the Grenville province in Canada. The
isolated magnetizations will then be compared to those isolated from a standard
demagnetization experiment, and will be dated by comparison with 40Ar/39Ar
spectra from feldspar gains from the same rocks. The results of this study will
be significant for all paleomagnetic experiments. They will also help refine the
Precambrian polar wander path for the North American plate, which significantly
improve understanding of late Precambrian plate tectonics.
