Phase-Directed Architecture Optimization and
Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A program's execution
typically exhibits time-varying behavior, where architecture resources needed to
obtain peak performance for the application can vary significantly over time. We
have found that this time-varying behavior has a repetitive pattern for most
applications, which allows a program's execution to be broken up into phases,
and we can then tailor a program's execution to each
phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concentrates on developing efficient
run-time architectures to capture and predict phase information. We will examine
creating phase tracking and prediction architectures for power and energy
architecture optimizations as well as to perform hardware code specialization
based on phases for trace cache optimizations. Energy consumption can
potentially be saved by dynamically re-partitioning many components in a
processor (e.g., caches, issue and decode width, branch predictors) on an
application specific basis, or selectively using different implementations of
these components based upon the phase behavior seen in an application. In
addition, trace cache compiler optimizations will be performed for different
phases to exploit phase-based behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For broader impact,
our phase-classification algorithms will allow researchers to efficiently
identify, classify, and predict phase-based behavior in programs and use this
information to guide their phase-based hardware, compiler, and operating system
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
