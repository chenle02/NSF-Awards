9720159 NIEBAUM This award provides funding for computer network equipment and
services to establish the Great Plains Network (GPN), a north- south
communications corridor linking scientists in six central EPSCoR states. North
Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas have formed an
alliance, with each participating state committing non-federal matching funds to
help establish the GPN as a regional virtual community and provide researchers
in those states with access to high-bandwidth networks and high performance
computing capacity. This important research infrastructure will enhance research
in a breadth of basic and applied areas but the initial focus of the GPN is on a
central theme of Earth System Science. The network is expected to foster
collaborations among researchers in the central plains states and lead to
recognition of this virtual community as a center-of-excellence in spatial data
analysis technologies applied to the biospheric sciences. The GNP will be
governed by an Advisory Committee of nationally recognized experts who will
provide guidance for the three functional teams - a Management Team, a Technical
Team, and an Earth System Science Team. A conference of the members of the Earth
System Science Team and other invitees is planned for 5-7 November 1997 at the
EROS Data Center, a U.S. Geological Survey facility in South Dakota.
