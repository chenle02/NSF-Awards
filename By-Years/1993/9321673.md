9321673 Murty This grant will support an International Symposium on Mathematical
Programming. It is expected to draw over fifteen hundred participants from all
over the world. This is the fifteenth such meeting and will bring together
researchers in all facets of Mathematical Programming and its applications. It
is expected that over twelve hundred talks will be presented at the symposium.
The symposium is particularly important in that it will facilitate the exchange
of new theory and technology between American scientists and scientists from
other countries about technology which is not well known in the United States.
It will also include support and participation from industry.
