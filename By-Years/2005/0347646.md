The goal of this research is to develop algorithms with rigorous performance
guarantees for core machine learning tasks. Although the most common guarantee
in the current literature is that of local optimality in the solution space,
this project aims to use stronger performance criteria, such as quantitative
bounds on the ratio by which the cost of the learned solution exceeds that of
the global optimum, both to guide the development of new algorithms and to
compare existing ones. This project will focus on two canonical unsupervised
learning tasks: hierarchical clustering and learning the structure of directed
probabilistic (Bayesian) nets. Both models are already in widespread use for
analyzing massive data sets; better algorithms will increase their effectiveness
and reliability, and will involve technical tools that are likely to be of
broader use for other machine learning and statistical tasks. The results of
this research project will be integrated into a new course that focuses on
algorithmic aspects of machine learning; the resulting educational materials
will be made available to the academic community.
