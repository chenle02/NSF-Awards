This project is directed at the processes of active mountain-building in Taiwan.
As a region of young tectonic activity, Taiwan exhibits high rates of
deformation, uplift and erosion. These high rates are advantageous to studies of
deformation associated with the mountain-building process. This study is focused
on the fold-and-thrust belt of western Taiwan where crustal material from the
Asian plate is incorporated into the Taiwan orogen. The investigators are using
apatite fission track dating and U-Th/He dating of apatite to determine low-
temperature cooling rates of rock throughout the fold-and-thrust belt. Geologic
mapping provides structural context for the dating, permitting dating of
exhumation of individual thrust sheets. The cooling is related to the rates
timing of fault motion and provides information on the kinematic pattern of
crustal deformation. To quantify this pattern, the investigators are using
structural reconstruction software combined with thermal modeling to relate
cooling data, fault motion and temperature history. The use of commercial
software with thermal modeling, calibrated to low temperature thermochronomety
represents a new innovation in thrust belt interpretation.
