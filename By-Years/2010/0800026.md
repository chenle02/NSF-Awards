Pawel Danielewicz and Filomena Nunes plan to conduct research on nuclear
reactions, with particular emphasis on theory that applies to and can be tested
by experiments at current accelerator facilities, such as of the Michigan State
University and of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In the latter context, the
proposal aims at advancing the theory for reactions with rare isotope beams and
for learning on bulk nuclear properties at different bombarding energies.
Specific goals in those respective areas include the study of breakup effects in
reactions with weakly bound nuclei and advancing of the quantum transport theory
for central reactions.
