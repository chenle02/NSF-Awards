The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the best example of a climate
variation on earth that is produced by an internal feedback in the climate
system. With a quasi-periodic oscillation of 2-6 years, it is also a climate
variation that has important human impacts. The history of ENSO is well
documented for about the last 50 to 100 years from direct observation and the
last 500 years from historical and other written anecdotal evidence. It is
important to understand how this internal feedback may affect future climate
change. In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to extend the record
of ENSO climate change back in time to understand how the system responds to
varying climatic states. This proposal will result in a record of ENSO dating
back to about 622 AD. It will be based on the record of Nile River discharge
measured at Cairo, Egypt. This research is important because it will provide
direct observation of natural climate variations on annual and decadal time
scales. The results will be most useful for understanding how the earth responds
to short-term internal perturbations and how these responses might be affected
by climate change.
