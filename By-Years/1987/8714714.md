Many of the principal aims of complexity theory are served by an examination of
the problems solvable by abstract computers under tight resource bounds.
Research will be continued on such complexity classes as L (those problems
solvable with memory proportional to the logarithm of the input size) and NC1
(those problems solvable by Boolean circuits of polynomial size and logarithmic
depth). In particular, the ramifications of recent work on branching programs
and non-uniform finite automata will be explored.
