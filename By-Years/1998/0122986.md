The St. Ambrose University CSEMS Program provides 30 low-income
or&lt;br/&gt;disadvantaged computer and information science majors the
financial, academic, social, and peer&lt;br/&gt;support they need to persist to
graduation. We offer four eligible majors: bachelor's degrees
in&lt;br/&gt;computer science (CS), computer and information science (CIS), and
computer network&lt;br/&gt;administration (CNA) and a new master's degree in
information technology management (ITM).&lt;br/&gt;Students are selected based
on financial need and academic promise. Students selected for the CSEMS program
will receive the following support: enrollment in learning communities (for
first year students); assignment to peer, professional and faculty mentors;
monthly professional seminars (e.g., college transition for entering students,
career planning and placement for upper level students); and academic support
(tutoring). Upper-level students will participate in job shadowing and either an
internship or practicum to get on-the-job experience and for career preparation.
