The overall objective of this project is to complete characterization of the
hemolytic agent(s) from the human blood parasite Schistosoma mansoni. First it
is planned to determine the chemical identity of the lytic agent(s) as well as
its metabolic precursors using HPLC techniques and radioactive precursors.
Previous studies suggest that the lytic agent can influence the organization and
dynamics of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, therefore, it is proposed to use
fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques to determine changes which occur
in the RBC membrane during the lytic process. Finally, the localization of the
lytic activity within live schistosomes will be determined. Through this study
it is hoped to increase our knowledge on factors influencing red cell membrane
dynamics as well our knowledge on direct interactions between a human parasite
and the cells of its host. The interactive component will involve lecturing in
the regular parasitology course offered to Harvard graduate students, presenting
a seminar series for graduate and undergraduate students on "Careers for Women
in Science," and participating in the Women in Academic Medicine Network." In
addition, Dr. Kasschau will discuss careers in Biology and medicine with
interested high school students. This project furthers VPW program objectives
which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in
engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to
encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
