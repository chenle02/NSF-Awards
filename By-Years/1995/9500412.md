ABSTRACT CTS-9500412 A Calvet-type microcalorimeter capable of operation from
ambient to over 800(C is acquired. The instrument is to be used to measure heats
of adsorption and heats of reaction in research in heterogeneous catalysis,
adsorption, and polymer science. It will be used to study olefin alkylation
reactions catalyzed by sulfated zirconia and sulfated titania; the role of
hydrogen in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes on platinum; catalysts based on
surface aggregates adsorbed on high-surface-area supports; the adsorptive
storage of hydrogen and methane on fullerenes, and the admicelle polymerization
of styrene-diene monomers on silica. ***
