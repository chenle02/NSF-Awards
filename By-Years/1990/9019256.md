The principal investigator will study the origin and movement of fluids which
have interacted with high-grade metamorphic terrances in the East Humboldt
Range, Nevada, utilizing field, petrologic, and isotopic techniques. He will
attempt to constrain relationships between porosity, flux, and time, and will
use isotopic information to assess relative porosities, and to establish a
qualititative and quantitative scale of effective permeability in crustal
lithologies. Results will help geologists understand the role of fluids during
the metamorphism of rocks in the Earth's crust.
