9413942 Barkatt This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment to
be used in conducting research on environmental conditions that result in
degradation of materials when they are subjected to stress caused by
environmental pollutants. Project targets for study include fiber-reinforced
plastics that are used in road and building construction, conditions that result
in the deposition of corrosion products in industrial boilers and power-
producing steam generators, and glasses that are being studied for potential use
in the immobilization of radioactive wastes. This proposal was submitted in
response to the Instrumentation Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF
93-172, Academic Research Infrastructure Program. Results of this award are
expected to improve the accessibility of modern research instrumentation for use
by this institution's faculty in educating students and in conducting research
on important topics of environmental significance. ***
