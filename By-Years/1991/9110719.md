The research is on synthesis of custom and semi-custom analog integrated
circuits (IC's). The focus is on developing macromodeling techniques applicable
to higher level analog and mixed analog/digital circuits. These macromodels
predict the behavior of a circuit for a set of input performance parameters. The
approach is to explore statistical experiment design techniques to generate high
quality models efficiently. A set of models and modeling techniques that help in
predicting the behavior of circuits synthesized by a hierarchal design tool is
being developed.
