The project will address the controversy surrounding the impact of base level
change on channel response, on the magnitude of the upstream influence, on the
nature of valley-filled deposits associated with base-level rise, and on the
nature and distribution of sedimentary deposits on shelves of different slopes,
by a series of experimental studies in large flumes and in a rainfall-erosion
facility. The objectives are to determine: a) the effect of base- level change
on meandering and braided streams; b) the effect of the rate and magnitude of
base-level change; c) the effect of subaqueous slopes on channel response; d)
for different magnitudes of base-level changes, the upstream progression of
erosion and deposition for valleys of different slopes and widths; and e) the
long-term effect of grade-control structures on valley morphology, channel
stability, and sediment yield. The results will be applied to erosion control
measures that can reduce sediment yields and stabilize actively eroding
steeplands for long periods of time.
