The objective of this research project is to establish a state-of-the-art
magnetron sputtering capability to find a single unifying indicator parameter
relating internal chamber conditions (e.g., ion flux) to external parameter
changes (e.g., power, gas pressure). Direct current magnetron sputtering is a
physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique which allows for the coating of almost
all elements in the periodic table. Even though sputtering is a commonly used
industrial technique, current practices rely mostly on trial and error
approaches which significantly limit its broader use. By using a combinatorial
design of equipment and experiments, we will enhance the general knowledge in
sputtering deposition systems, which will lead to the processing of materials
such as multilayers and nano-grained films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of
this research will allow for the processing of highly engineered microstructures
which can be used for innovative applications in the fields of materials
science, nanotechnology and renewable energy. Such contributions will make this
PVD technique a serious contender for&lt;br/&gt;use in the scaling up of
materials with enhanced properties (e.g. electrical, mechanical).
