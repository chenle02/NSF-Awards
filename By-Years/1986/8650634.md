In response to the increasing significance of lasers in scientific research as
well as in various industrial and communications applications, Carleton College
is offering a new course, Quantum Optics, at the advanced undergraduate level
dealing with the principles of operation of lasers. The Physics Department will
buy a pulsed tunable dye laser system and associated fast, sensitive detection
and analysis apparatus to support the laboratory work in that course. The
students will study the details of the operation of the four major parts of the
system, the nitrogen pump laser, the tunable dye laser, the amplifier, and the
frequency doubling crystal. Two other courses that will be enhanced
significantly by the equipment are Contemporary Experimental Physics and Project
Laboratory. In those courses students will perform laser-based experiments in
atomic and molecular physics.
