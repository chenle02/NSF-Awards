This effort involves the use of artificially fabricated semiconductors to reduce
the frequency width of the radiation emmitted from a semiconductor laser. Not
only is this of great importance for the efficient utilization of semiconductor
lasers for a variety of applications, it is also of fundamental importance. The
limitations on the linewidth of such lasers is not yet clearly understood.
