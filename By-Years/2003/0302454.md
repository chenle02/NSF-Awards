0302454 Tesh This award to Skidaway Institute of Oceanography in the State of
Georgia provides instrumentation to significantly improve the oceanographic
research capabilities of the research vessel Savannah, operated by SkIO as part
of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The
award supports acquisition of sensors to be used in the vessel's surface mapping
system and on its CTD system, as well as two new acoustic Doppler current
profilers (1200 kHz and 600 kHz), upgrade of the existing 300 kHz ADCP, a new
computer for acquisition and display of ADCP and CTD data, remote data display
stations, meteorological sensors, and a liquid scintillation counter. All of
these are shared-use capabilities that are available to all funded users of the
R/V Savannah. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine
scientists during 2003 and future years. ***
