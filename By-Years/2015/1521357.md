The 2015 Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials &amp; Devices (WOCSEMMAD)
will address research areas in III-V compound semiconductor field. SiC and GaN
device concepts for high power switches and demonstration of high power
switching capability with superior properties, as well as new processing and
materials possibilities will be major areas on which the Workshop will focus. It
is one of the few workshop format meetings where the latest results can be
debated and discussed in a relatively open format. WOCSEMMAD has played a key
role in identifying new directions for research. The workshop will be held
February 16-19, 2015 at Wild Dunes, Isle of Palms, South Carolina and the
project will support student participation. WOCSEMMAD's broader impact will be
on the design and development of novel new devices and materials. Along with
these new materials and devices, new industries and jobs will be created with
lasting impact on science and economy.
