Research will be conducted on equilibrium phase transitions in both two-
dimensional arrays of Josephson junction in a magnetic field and in absorbed
systems such as hydrogen and oxygen on tungsten. Studies will also be undertaken
on the stability and growth of solid layers on a substrate. A model developed
for the stability of strained epitaxial layers will be extended to superlattices
and elastic substrates.
