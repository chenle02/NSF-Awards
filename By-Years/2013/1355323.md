The objective of this study at Harvard University is to examine the impact of
ITEAMS (Innovative Technology-Enabled Astronomy for Middle Schools) intervention
strategies on student persistence in high school STEM course-taking and career
expectations, and the value that students place on STEM careers. The central
research questions are: 1) does ITEAMS participation boost students' STEM
course-taking and their interest in, and valuation of, STEM careers throughout
their high school years; 2) to what extent did students' ITEAMS experiences, in
terms of knowledge and disposition, have an effect; and 3) which ITEAMS
strategies or attributes have been most effective in bringing about positive
outcomes? Special focus is on the predictors of persistence for girls and
minority students.

The project utilizes a mix of interviews and surveys with current high school
students who in previous years participated in ITEAMS (DRL-0833378) as middle-
school students, and who are now juniors and seniors. The project surveys a
randomly selected cohort of 75 former ITEAMS participants who were enrolled in
ITEAMS for two or three years. The project-specific survey instrument includes
pertinent demographic questions. The random selection of up to 15 surveyed
ITEAMS students for in-depth interviews is also included.
