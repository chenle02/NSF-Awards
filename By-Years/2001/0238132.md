Computing devices and applications are rapidly infiltrating every aspect of our
everyday lives. The move of computing from the office desktop to ubiquitous
presence in homes, in communities, and at play poses a challenge to human-
computer interaction, because many of the attributes that are most important for
workplace computing such as efficiency, problem-solving functionality, and
standardization, are less central for other parts of our lives. Designing
everyday computing applications that are appropriate for everyday life requires
rethinking and adapting our methodologies; otherwise, we risk making all of our
life like work. In this project, the PI will exploit cultural theory to analyze
the cultural context of everyday life and develop appropriate computer science
technologies and methodologies that support open-ended activity, user
reflection, variations in style of living, personal meaning, and everyday
values. These themes will be studied within the context of three applications: a
system that monitors a home's emotional climate and provides users with open-
ended feedback about it; information appliances for the home that support
awareness of consumption; and an affective wearable device that explores
emotional issues in backpacking. The project integrates activities across the
disciplines that make up Cornell's new Information Science program, and supports
the consolidation of the currently fragmented interdisciplinary community of
researchers working in this area. It will also educate students from a variety
of backgrounds and interests to integrate technical and cultural perspectives
through interdisciplinary courses and involvement in the PI's research.
