Goff 9304926 The focus of this project is the detailed characterization of
bovine lactoperoxidase active site structural and reactivity properties. The
enzyme utilizes hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate ion to generate an oxidized
bacteriostatic product. Hence, further characterization of oxidized thiocyanate
intermediates will be of importance to a general understanding of peroxidase
antimicrobial action. Specific objectives of this project include: (1)
definitive assignment of the unusual heme structure of lactoperoxidase; (2)
determination of active site structural modifications associated with peroxidase
metabolism of thiocarbamide derivatives; (3) full description of lactoperoxidase
compound I (doubly oxidized) electronic structure; and (4) identification of a
newly discovered lactoperoxidase-mediated SCN- oxidation product. %%% Mammalian
heme peroxidase enzymes provide the major non- immunologic protective response
to invading microbes. Leukocyte and exocrine fluid peroxidases utilize hydrogen
peroxide and halide or pseudohalide ions for oxidative defense against bacteria,
parasites, and viruses. The studies proposed will characterize the mechanism by
which these peroxidases generate this oxidized bacteriostatic product and to
some extent characterize this product. ***
