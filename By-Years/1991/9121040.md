This is the fourth international conference on quasicrystals and the first to
be held in the United States. Topics to be discussed include understanding the
geometry and chemical decorations of the quasicrystal structures, detailed
structural studies on large, single quasicrystals, and the formation, stability,
and physical properties of quasicrystals. New frontiers in quasicrystal research
are covered, including diffraction and dynamics of synthetic non-periodic
structures. %%% While similar to crystals in many respects, quasicrystals have
important differences that may lead to novel behavior. Some models suggest
exotic electronic properties. Unusual magnetic behavior may result from the
extremely high symmetry about certain atomic sites.
