Proposal Title: Collaborative Research; CT-M: Computer Systems
Vulnerabilities&lt;br/&gt;and the Efficacy of Defensive
Mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-San
Diego&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/12/08&lt;br/&gt;Longitudinal studies of
network systems are very difficult to conduct when systems are&lt;br/&gt;large,
heterogeneous, highly interconnected, and open; yet, the importance of
these&lt;br/&gt;studies cannot be underestimated. This project focuses on an
18-month longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;study on server-side vulnerabilities in the
campus network of the University of California&lt;br/&gt;at San Diego and on
client-side vulnerabilities the University of California at Davis.
The&lt;br/&gt;issues concern the efficacy of security measures at the campus-
wide networks and its&lt;br/&gt;implication for security of networked systems at
universities, government facilities, and&lt;br/&gt;commercial
enterprises.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
