This proposal is for the study of electric field effects on meteor trails in the
equatorial region. Additionally, the PIs seek to understand any deviation of the
radar scattering properties of a meteor trail from traditional specular
reflection processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scientific goals require the
upgrade and continued operation of an existing meteor radar at Piura, Peru (5S,
81W). The upgrade at this site consists of installing a complete all-sky meteor
radar system, so that the angle-of-arrival of meteoric backscatter can be
unambiguously determined. In addition, archive data from Christmas Island will
be analyzed for meteor winds as well. As a byproduct of this work routine mean
wind, tidal amplitudes and phases, and meteor decay statistics will be available
to the scientific community via a web server.&lt;br/&gt;
