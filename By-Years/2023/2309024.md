The award supports research on the origin of black hole mergers discovered by
NSF's LIGO gravitational-wave observatory, in collaboration with the Virgo and
KAGRA gravitational wave detectors. The discovery of gravitational waves opened
a new window on the Universe, providing information on cosmic events that
previously proved inaccessible. Black hole mergers can elucidate where
Einstein's general theory of relativity might break down, how stars and other
astrophysical objects evolve, and how the Universe is expanding. During the
award period, LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are expected to observe an unprecedented
number of black hole mergers, far exceeding all previous detections combined,
enabling new probes of the underlying processes. It will also provide
opportunity for the detection of special events that make up a small fraction of
mergers but carry unique information about parts of the Universe.

The research will probe the origin of black hole mergers utilizing an
observational fingerprint that can help distinguish between different
astrophysical formation scenarios: orbital eccentricity. The project will carry
out the full range of tasks needed to gain astrophysical insight from recorded
gravitational wave data: it will search for eccentric mergers during LIGO-Virgo-
KAGRA observing runs throughout the award period; it will examine the
recoverable properties of the discovered events to establish their possible
eccentricity; and it will compare observed events with expectations from
multiple formation scenarios to uncover the astrophysical origin of the detected
black hole mergers. A significant part of the work will be carried out by
students, helping advance the education of a globally competitive STEM
workforce. Students will acquire strong computational and data science skills
and will contribute to the national cyberinfrastructure required for multi-
messenger observation campaigns.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
