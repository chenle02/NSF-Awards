This four-week project offered at Ball State University will give 40
outstanding biology teachers from throughout the nation the opportunity to
update their knowledge of human genetics, bioethical decision-making skills and
teaching methodologies. They will thus be qualified to become part of the
National Network to Implement Human Genetics and Bioethical Decision- Making in
our Nation's Secondary Schools. With this project, this Network will be expanded
to include members from the 20 states not currently represented, making it a
nationwide entity. The summer workshop will be followed by an academic year
component designed to assist participants in achieving project goals.
