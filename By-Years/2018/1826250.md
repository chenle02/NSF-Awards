Myelin is a specialized membrane that acts as an insulator for axons (the
connecting structure of nerve cells) and that allows the nerve signals to be
transmitted quickly throughout the body. Despite the importance of this membrane
to healthy nerve function, little is known about the structural dynamics or the
interactions between the various molecules in the membrane. Improving this
understanding will open up new strategies to better understand myelin-related
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and potentially engineer ways to repair or
replace damaged myelin. In addition to this societal impact, the research team
will host an art show themed around nano-patterns and nano-structures related to
myelin membranes as well as disseminate the knowledge through new graduate-level
courses and to the broader public through connections established with Akron-
area high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hypothesized that
relatively subtle changes in the composition of myelin lipids or proteins can
significantly alter the phase behavior of the myelin system and the formation
dynamics of lipid domains. These changes, in turn, lead to larger changes in
membrane adhesion, rigidity, and integrity that can cause the myelin sheath to
unravel and become dysfunctional. This hypothesis will be tested with advanced
surface science techniques, including a surface force apparatus, a Langumuir
trough coupled with fluorescence microscopy, and a streaming potential
apparatus. The research will significantly advance the mechanistic understanding
of how the lipids and proteins in the myelin membrane interact to affect the
organization, fluidity, and rigidity of the myelin
sheath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
