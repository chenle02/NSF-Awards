This award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference:
Research at High Pressure, June 23-28, Kimball Union Academy, Meriden, NH. This
interdisciplinary Conference addresses new developments in fields such as
physics, chemistry, earth and planetary science, materials science, and biology.
Recent advances in high-pressure methods have led to the creation of new
materials, and to opportunities to study physical, chemical and biological
processes under high-pressure conditions. The Conference will feature invited
talks in exciting new areas such as shock wave techniques, materials syntheses,
high pressure liquids, nanomaterials, high pressure biochemistry, sampling the
deep Earth, new synchrotron and neutron experiments, high-pressure
superconductivity, and new metallic behavior at high pressure. Opening and
closing sessions will feature provocative talks to provide challenges and
opportunities for theory and experiment in high pressure research. The NSF
funding will facilitate participation by students and junior scientists, as well
as "newcomers" to the high-pressure field. The Conference is supported by the
Condensed Matter Physics Program, the Solid State Chemistry Program, and the
Petrology and Geochemistry Program.
