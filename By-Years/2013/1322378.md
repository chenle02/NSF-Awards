A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168 foot general purpose research vessel operated by
Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated
by the&lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501
(c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution
incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island
of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The
RV Atlantic Explorer has 149 days funded in 2013, all of which are for NSF. With
this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fume Hood $20,075&lt;br/&gt;
Transmissometer $7,600&lt;br/&gt; Van Veen Grab $5,525&lt;br/&gt;
$33,200&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal
Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
