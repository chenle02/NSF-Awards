In 1990 California established a state insurance program titled the California
Residential Earthquake Recovery Fund. This research deals with the impacts of
this state- mandated, non-catastrophic earthquake insurance program on the
propensity to purchase voluntary, catastrophic earthquake insurance. The
research continues a longitudinal study of a sample of home owners and will
monitor changes both in the behavior of individuals and their changing
perception of the earthquake hazard. The study will address such specific issues
as the impacts of the combination of prior attitudes, direct experience with an
earthquake, and mandatory coverage of a small portion of the home value at risk
on the adoption of catastrophic earthquake implications for earthquake hazards
reduction throughout the country and the results will be made available to
relevant decision makers.
