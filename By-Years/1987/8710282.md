This research project examines the relationship of cloth as wealth woven by
women, and political hierarchies, represented by chieftancies among the Owe
Yoruba of Kabba, Nigeria. The student will examine why women's handwoven cloth
production continues in situations of rapid social, political, and economic
change. This study is important because it clarifies the roles of both men and
women in the political process and illustrates the deep significance of cloth as
wealth and as a continuing symbol of traditional cultural values that persist in
the face of social change. The importance of cloth in West African societies has
long been noted by social scientists yet few scholars have investigated the
political role of this form of material culture nor tried to understand its
social significance. In societies with political organizations that include
hierarchies of titled chiefs, cloth is used to establish and maintain the
ranking of individuals and groups. It is used as a symbol of legitimacy for
title holders, a visible link to the past. This project will help advance our
knowledge of the processes and problems of cultural and political change in
developing nations, aesthetics in cross.cultural perspective, and issues
relating to gender.
