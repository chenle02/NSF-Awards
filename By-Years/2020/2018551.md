The goal of this project is to enhance high performance computing resources at
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to support a variety of research and
education activities. Specifically, current campus facilities do not provide
sufficient GPU or storage resources needed to enable work with large data sets.
Additionally, SIUE campus IT staff participation increases experience supporting
cyberinfrastructure resources to better support faculty, students, and
collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hardware directly supports ongoing
projects and teaching activities which include: the use of machine learning
models to predict complex phenotypic traits, development of high order accurate
numerical methods for problems governed by hyperbolic partial differential
equations, understanding the mechanism behind the quantum phenomenon in chemical
reactions, drug interactions, and cybersecurity. Additional activities include
faculty outreach in incorporation of high-performance computing into classroom
exercises and curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commitment to sharing this
computing environment through the Open Science Grid (OSG) and other
collaborative efforts increases awareness and adoption of other shared resources
by the SIUE community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
