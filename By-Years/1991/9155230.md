This purpose of this project is to produce a cadre of 96 exemplary high school
biology teachers for a cluster of urban, minority school districts. Through a
four week summer workshop, six Saturday sessions and two classroom visits by
university personnel, these teachers will acquire 1) a strong knowledge and
laboratory skills base in cell and molecular biology and in industrial and
environmental microbiology; 2) an understanding of science process; 3) training
in innovative instructional methods and curriculum design for teaching biology;
and 4) a greater understanding of the barriers to achievement in biology faced
by urban, minority students. It is proposed that the teachers engage in a guided
research experience during the summer workshop and in their classrooms. It is
also proposed that the teachers will develop and use new curricular materials
that will foster student interest in biological sciences careers and prepare
students to pursue a college major leading toward such a career. The curricular
materials will also be made available for replication in other districts. Cost
sharing equals 11.2 % of the NSF award.
