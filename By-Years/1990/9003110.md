The goal of this research is development of a new database to aid researchers in
automatic recognition of continuous speech. Dr. Cole will conduct controlled
experiments to determine the effect of phonetic context on human recognition of
speech excerpts. Initial studies will make use of phonetically labeled excerpts
from the widely used TIMIT speech database. Human phonetic recognition will be
measured with varying retention of preceding and following phonetic cues. Dr.
Cole will also attempt to design neural-network classification algorithms that
match human phonetic classification performance.
