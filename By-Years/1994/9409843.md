9409843 Peters In 1992, record numbers of women successfully won seats in the
U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, making these institutions more
descriptively representative of society. Previous research points to policy
differences between female and male officeholders. Largely unexplored, however
are questions about the institutional impact and political leadership styles of
women. The steady rise in number and the increasing tenure of women in state
legislatures now make these questions accessible. This Doctoral Dissertation
research project seeks to explore the experiences of women committee chairs in
the 50 state legislatures. The objectives revolve around three questions: First,
do female committee chairs differ in background, leadership behavior , and
outlook from their male counterparts? Second, how are gender-related leadership
styles expressed in different settings? Third, as women increase their
representation, do gender styles transform institutions? The 343 women chairing
state legislative committees represent an important and sizeable leadership
cohort to study. This investigation will contribute not only to gender insights
but also to knowledge of leadership behavior in legislative committees and
cross-jurisdictional generalizations. The research consists of three
complementary elements: 1) a survey of male and female committee chairs, 2)
focused peer group interviews with women committee chairs, and, 3) participant
observation in three state legislatures. The support provided by the National
Science Foundation will allow the student to undertake the second and third
components. This will greatly enhance the ability to generalize findings from
the survey and to explore cross-jurisdictional implications.
