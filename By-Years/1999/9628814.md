This multi-disciplinary SGER project involves collaborative research in the
areas of biochemistry, surface chemistry, and algorithm design. The main goal of
the project is to develop an approach to computation and information storage,
using DNA sequences. Although this approach is both ``novel'' and ``high-
risk'', there is a high potential that this new DNA/biomolecular computing
approach will yield ``solutions'' to intractable/NP-complete problems. To this
end, the project concentrates on: (1) Developing and characterizing complex
mixtures of DNA molecules attached to surfaces, by characterizing, for the
absorbed DNA molecules,(a) the attachment chemistry, (b) the hybridization
chemistry, and (c)the enzymatic activity, using a variety of spectroscopic and
biochemical methods; (2) Optimizing the use of the manipulations of DNA
sequences in developing molecular computing strategies for solving NP-complete
problems; (3)Developing new algorithms for solving the NP-complete problems; and
(4) Investigating surface-based methods for high density storage and retrieval
of information by DNA hybridization chemistry.
