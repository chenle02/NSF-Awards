One of the most fundamental questions in the field of statistical mechanics is
to explain the observed increase of a system's entropy in an irreversible
process in terms of the underlying microscopic dynamics of the constituent
particles. Recent work in dynamical systems theory (often called `chaos` theory)
has allowed for considerable progress in this direction and for quantitative
predictions to be made for both the quantities that describe the irreversible
behavior of the system, such as transport coefficients, as well as the
quantities that describe the system's chaotic behavior, such as Lyapunov
exponents and dynamical `entropies`. The purpose of this research is to apply
techniques of statistical mechanics to calculate both transport and dynamical
quantities for systems of physical interest, and to relate them to each other
and, in some cases, to the thermodynamic properties of the system. This will
lead to a deeper understanding of the connections between the Second Law and
microscopic dynamics. For quantum systems, this will also lead to further
understanding of the behavior of some solid state devices of considerable
current interest.
