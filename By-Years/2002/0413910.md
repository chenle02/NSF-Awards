This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop workable composites from plant based materials (such as rice hulls,
bamboo and jute), using expoxidized soybean oil as a polyurethane bonding resin.

The commercial application of this project will be in the manufacture of
household and office furniture. The bio-based composites are expected to be
mechanically strong, cost effective, lightweight and resistant to fire and
water.
