9526402 Hegg Atmospheric aerosol particles are believed to influence the earth's
radiation balance either directly by scattering and absorbing incoming solar
radiation, or indirectly by altering cloud microphysical properties. This
project addresses the effects of heterogeneous sulfate chemistry on cloud
droplet number concentrations and size distributions (the aerosol indirect
effect). The study uses computer modeling to develop a parameterization of the
impact of cloud heterogeneous chemistry on the optical and water active
properties of cloud-processed sulfate aerosols. The parameterization utilizes a
transfer function to allow estimation of the impact from an array of prognostic
variables that are components of standard, bulk-paramerized cloud models. The
regional scale modeling approach is a new method for evaluating the influence of
cloud heterogeneous chemistry on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and optical
properties, a refinement not currently possible with existing global climate
models (GCMs). The results from the project will provide needed improvements in
the current ability of models in generating realistic treatments of
cloud/aerosol interactions on a regional scale. This parameterization study will
be a key, fundamental step in developing similar parameterizations for GCM's.
