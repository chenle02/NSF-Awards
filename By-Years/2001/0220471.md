Analysis of existing finestructure and microstructure data will be conducted.
The data, derived from two recent investigations of ocean mixing processes: the
Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment and the study of Circulation in the
Romanche Fracture Zone, consist of vertical profile observations from the High-
Resolution Profiler and moored current meter measurements. Several signals in
these data will be explored, documented, and presented in the scientific
literature that address (1) the nature of the finescale shear and strain and the
associated turbulent dissipation in the abyssal ocean above rough bathymetry (at
subtropical latitudes and on the equator), (2) the flow within a mid-ocean ridge
fracture, (3) the intensity and spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in
a field of equatorially trapped deep jets, and (4) the intensity of the mid-
depth internal wave field and associated mixing at tropical latitudes away from
the immediate vicinity of the equator. The projects are related by the common
goal of improving understanding of mixing and diapycnal transport in the deep
ocean.
