Large enrollment introductory science courses often share several structural and
procedural problems, such as lectures that survey topics found in encyclopedic
biology textbooks, a tradition of "covering" an ever-expanding body of
knowledge, an emphasis on memorization and passive learning, and computer
assisted learning that provides little more than drill instruction in taking
multiple-choice examinations. The objectives of this project are to: 1) increase
active learning through wide-spread use of informal writing projects in
recitation, lecture, and lab, with students writing sample exam questions,
article summaries, or concept definitions, 2) upgrade the course's computer
facility to accommodate word processing and networked conversational software,
so as to encourage creativity, and support collaborative learning, and 3) relate
biological principles to relevant social and political contexts through specific
reading/discussion/writing assignments. Graduate teaching assistants are trained
to lead discussions and organize students into collaborative writing/learning
projects, and advanced undergraduate majors are employed in the course's
computer center as peer tutors and leaders of computer-assisted collaborative
writing and learning. The effectiveness of this effort in enhancing learning by
students at this urban university, which enrolls a large number of women and
minorities, will be evaluated, and the results disseminated to other
institutions in the region and nationally.
