This is a proposal that is considered as a continuation of previous work on the
geochemistry of Hawaiian volcanoes. There are three principal components: (1)
analyze samples of Loihi lavas obtained by ALVIN, (2) obtain additional samples
of Loihi by diving with Pisces V submersible, (3) dredge and analyze (a) samples
of what appear on GLORIA surveys to be large "flood basalts" from Kilauea and
Loihi, (b) basalts on the Hawaiian arch that may be the very initial phases of a
volcano, and (c) samples from Mahukona seamount. This proposal is being
supported at a reduced level. The emphasis will be on analyzing existing samples
from Loihi and Mahukona and new samples obtained by Pisces V. Loihi is the
youngest Hawaiian volcano and the results obtained from this study will be
important for understanding 'hot spot' volcanism and its temporal evolution.
