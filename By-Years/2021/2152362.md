This project is fundamental research on mathematical models that describe
complex interactions, growth, and motion in an irregular environment with
stochastic unpredictability. The goal is to discover general mathematical laws
that govern such systems. These systems appear quite different at small scales
and large scales. So it is important to understand how different rules for
small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale, system-wide behavior. Real-
world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion
of vehicles, packets in communication networks, fluid particles in a tube, fluid
spreading in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, and the
fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Laboratory experiments have
demonstrated that these mathematical models capture essential features of
physical reality. Over the long term, understanding complex interactions has
profound implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.
Mathematical systems of the kind described in the proposal are intensely and
concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists,
and engineers. This project provides research training opportunities for
graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates
mathematical models of growth and motion in random media. Examples include
first-passage percolation, the corner growth model, random walk in random
environment, directed polymer models, and stochastic partial differential
equations. The objectives of this work are mathematically rigorous descriptions
of the behavior of these models and the development of robust tools for their
analysis. Specific goals include regularity of limit shapes, properties of
optimal paths such as their length, fluctuations and geometric features, ergodic
properties, descriptions of large scale limits in terms of variational formulas
and entropy, and descriptions of probability distributions of complicated random
geometric objects such as trees of geodesics and competition interfaces. The
methods employed in this work are those of rigorous mathematical research, aided
by experimental computer simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
