ABSTRACT 9725088 MCCARTHY This collaboration project joins two
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) together in a "TIE"
project "Biodegradable Microlayered Polymer Composite Systems." The two Centers
involved in this two year study are the University of Massachusetts Lowell's
I/UCRC for Biodegradable Polymers and the Case Western Reserve University's
I/UCRC for Applied Polymers. The I/UCRC for Applied Polymers will generate
micro- and nano-layered composite structures using its co-extrusion technology.
It will also study and characterize the composites produced for degradation. The
I/ UCRC for Biodegradable polymers will study the degradation of kinetics
resulting from its soil and compost respirometry tests. The results obtained at
the I/UCRC for Biodegradable Polymers will guide the development of composite
structures at the I/UCRC for Applied Polymers.
