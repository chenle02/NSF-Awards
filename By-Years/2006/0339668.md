This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a novel
biological and chemical agent detection system that utilizes optical resonances
in nanowires to probe pathogenic species on the molecular and submolecular
levels. The project will study the detection of pesticides using functionalized
gold nanowire substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis.
Arrays of high-aspect ratio nanowires will be engineered and functionalized to
detect a target molecule. The project will combine the techniques of
immunoassay, Raman spectroscopy, and nanoengineering, with the goal of
developing a detector with unprecedented sensitivity. SERS is well a known and
extremely accurate detection method that can be employed to identify single
molecules, antigens, nucleic acid sequences and protein structure. The goal of
the project is to develop enhanced nanowire SERS substrates for integration into
a multiple channel fiber-optic nanowire heterostructure optical detector with
diode pumped lasers and a charge coupled device sensor to make a rugged,
compact, portable, highly accurate, and field -ready biological or chemical
agent sensor.

The commercial application of this project will be in the detection of low-level
quantities of pathogenic chemical or biological agents in the environment. It
will be used environmental monitoring, medical testing, and monitoring for
release of biological weapons. The device is being designed to identify
virtually any molecular or cellular species by its unique Raman signature.
