ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biogeochemical Aftermath of Neoproterozoic Ice
Ages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to critically test the
celebrated Snowball Earth hypothesis, which predicts that several times in the
Neoproterozoic (543-1000 million years ago), the entire planet was blanketed
from the poles to equator with continental glaciers and sea ice. To overcome
such extreme conditions it has been suggested that over millions of years
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration must have risen to over 100 times its
present inventory, eventually building up enough greenhouse gas to warm the
frozen planet. On one hand, the materials required for the enigmatic carbonates
(which cap these Neoproterozoic glacial sediments worldwide) may have come from
the intense weathering of the continents under such a CO2-charged atmosphere.
Alternatively, the source of these materials may have derived from the deep
ocean where sulfate-reducing bacteria dominated the water column - similar to
the present-day anoxic Black Sea - during widespread, yet less severe and
shorter glacial epochs. Testing the validity of either of these end-member
hypotheses will require detailed study of the elemental, mineralogical,
textural, and stable isotopic compositions of the cap carbonates. Samples from
the Otavi Group in Namibia (where the critical evidence for global glaciation
was first amassed), and in demonstrably equivalent strata from the Bambui and
Macaubas groups of Brazil will be analyzed. Regional mapping and high-resolution
stratigraphic studies of the thick, carbonate-dominated Brazilian successions
will aid in the evaluation of models that seek to explain these severe
oscillations of Precambrian climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
