This grant, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will study a highly sensitive and selective means for
detecting and quantifying the chemical elements found in solid materials. A
laser will vaporize a small portion of the solid, and then a second laser will
selectively ionize one element of interest. Isotopic information will also be
obtained. All work will be done by undergraduates under the direction of the
principal investigator. %%% This research, supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study the fundamental
physics and chemistry of Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry for elemental
analysis. Condensation dynamics which have limited this technique's sensitivity
will be investigated, as will mass transport from the vaporization region to the
mass spectrometer. Quantification of elements and their isotopes in inclusions
in solids should be improved by the success of this research.
