Communication in Science Inquiry Project (CISIP) is a five-year project that
creates and disseminates professional development materials for science and
English faculty at middle level schools (grades 5-8), high schools and community
colleges. The collaborators include faculty from Maricopa Community College,
Arizona State University and an external evaluation team who will combine to
work with public school districts to develop, pilot, field test, research and
evaluate the materials. The science content that is the basis for the material
at each level includes physics, chemistry, geology/earth and space sciences and
life sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of CISIP is to create professional
development materials in the context of science inquiry that equip faculty to
integrate scientific writing, writing-to-learn processes and science language
acquisition techniques into their instruction. Through the use of these
materials science and English faculty will increase teacher and student
understanding of scientific concepts and capacity to write scientifically with
greater fluency and complexity, especially by students who are English Language
Learners. In addition to the research findings, the deliverables include an
integrated curriculum model, twenty-four exemplary lessons, writing-to-learn
processes and scientific writing illustrations, sessions about language
acquisition with defined applications for each level, facilitator materials and
participant resources.&lt;br/&gt;
