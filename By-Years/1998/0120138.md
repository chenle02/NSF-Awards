ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information Technology Workforce
(ITWF)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Id: EIA-0120138&lt;br/&gt;Investigator:

California Lutheran U.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Stretching Horizons: Upward Bound
Programs in Stimulating Information Technology Education and Career Aspirations
among Underrepresented Minorities &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal provides
support for California Lutheran University to conduct a research project to
examine why so few male and female African American and Latino students are
studying computer science at the college level. The three cohorts, Upward Bound
students, Math Upward Bound students and non-Upward Bound students, will be
studied as to their experiences, opportunities, attitudes and aspirations with
respect to information technology (the federally-funded Upward Bound program is
made up of two different programs, the traditional Upward Bound program and the
Math/Science Upward Bound program). The sites of the study are schools in the
three-county Southern California region IX of Upward Bound, Los Angeles, Ventura
and Orange Counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
