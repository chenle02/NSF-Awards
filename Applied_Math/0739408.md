This award supports travel and subsistence for participants in the fourth annual
Southeastern Atlantic Mathematical Sciences (SEAMS) Workshop, to be held in
September 2007 at the National Institute of Aerospace in Hampton, Virginia. The
two-day meeting is part of an ongoing conference series, centered on
participation of junior researchers, previously held at the College of
Charleston and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Speakers will be
primarily advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. There also will
be opportunities for contributed presentations in a poster session. The meeting
encourages and supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and
members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.

The research topics of the workshop reflect the main active research programs at
the organizing institutions, and include -- Scientific Computing; Computational
Fluid Dynamics -- Integrable Systems; Nonlinear Dynamics; Nonlinear Evolution
Equations -- Control; Optimization -- Bio-mathematics; Molecular Transport and
Motors; Stochastic Differential Equations -- Turbulent Transport; Mixing;
Simulations of Turbulent Flows -- Fluid Dynamics; Geophysical Fluid Flows;
Averaging and Homogenization -- Materials; Polymers; Non-Newtonian Fluids;
Molecular Dynamics Simulations -- Nonlinear Optics; Laser Propagation in Random
Media; Porous Media Flows -- Numerical Linear Algebra; Markov Processes;
Approximation Theory Electronic files for talks and posters are collected after
each workshop and posted on the workshop web site http://www.chachadays.org
