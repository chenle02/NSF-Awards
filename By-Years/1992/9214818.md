Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) will be carried out in a study of the effect
of compressibility on several vortex dynamics phenomena in turbulent shear flow.
The study is focused on vortex reconnection, vortex core dynamics, and the
interaction between organized vortex structures and disorganized background
turbulence. A novel feature of the research is an analysis of the effect of
initial condition on numerical compressible flow simulations. This research
impacts both the technology of high speed flows and the technology of simulating
these and other turbulent flows numerically with greater accuracy and economy.
