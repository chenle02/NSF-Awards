This project creates an educational software infrastructure by broadening the
support for the successful BusTracker.edu API to support computer programming
projects that use real-time Web-based data to better engage and better train
introductory computer science students. Examples of real-time data accessible
over the Web include stock values, traffic information, weather, public transit,
flight information, inventory overviews, and many others. The infrastructure
ensures the requisite data availability, integrity, and accessibility, as well
as automates grading techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By bringing real-world,
real-time data of intrinsic interest to students in introductory classes, more
students are expected to be recruited into and retained in the computer science
major. The new programming projects also provide an opportunity to introduce
students earlier to advanced concepts such as distributed computing and cyber-
physical systems, thereby better preparing them to meet the emerging challenges
of the IT workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the infrastructure, the
project will produce a set of programming assignments using the infrastructure
suitable for CS 1 and CS 2 courses. Evaluation encompasses both the new system,
as well as the effect of its use on student learning outcomes and on retention.
The infrastructure will be available through a dedicated website and a number of
workshops will assist faculty in learning to use the new system in their
courses.
