Increasingly in basic research and many other sectors, there is a need for
quick-look visualization of large datasets in order to (a) conceptualize the
nature of the data, and (b) begin identifying data patterns to guide more
computationally costly deep-dive analysis. High-end tools for data basing and
graphing exist, but usually entail a large overhead in time and effort
associated with: importing the data; correctly specifying meta-data; keeping
track of a large number of variable names; issuing and scripting commands for
graphing; plotting pairwise variables over many iterations; filtering out bad
data; re-rendering plots to restricted data ranges; representing multiple
variables at once; and so on. This team has developed Filtergraph, a web based
tool that allows rapid and intuitive visualization of massive, multi-dimensional
datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web-based tools developed by this team will
allow researchers to instantly visualize any dataset in many dimensions at once,
and will permit researchers to move through the data rapidly, and quickly filter
and slice them. This visual interaction will occur without the need for
cumbersome meta-data specification, without the need to remember details of the
data structure, and without the need to write scripts to render sophisticated
visualizations. The tools developed will be a means to an end: A new, highly
visual way of transcending preconceptions about the data and instead let the
data speak for themselves. This mechanism would free researchers to creatively
and collaboratively engage their expert intuition as they visually and rapidly
explore massive datasets for unexpected patterns or outliers that signal
important discovery.
