The proposed work will develop a general framework for the ecological and
evolutionary dynamics of "disease communities". Surprisingly, the possible
interaction between unrelated infections has not received much attention. A
mechanism for interaction between (antigenically) different infections is
proposed: following an acute infection, individuals are temporarily unavailable
to contract other diseases (because of quarantining during convalescence).
Hence, the number of potential "hosts" for a pathogen is affected by the
dynamics of other diseases; this is even more pronounced if infection is
associated with mortality, with some hosts removed permanently. This mechanism
leads to "disease interference". This proposal aims to develop this framework,
answering fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions. Do all infections
interact with all other infections? The answer is clearly no. The strength of
interaction between infections depends on the degree similarity in the cohort of
hosts infected. For human infections, this would be determined by the overlap
between the distributions of host age at infection. Does interference affect
evolutionary dynamics? A central hypothesis is that interference selects for
increased pathogenicity. Can we explore interference effects when genetic
diversity is well established (eg Dengue)? The interference mechanism provides a
null model for the study of infections with multiple strains. Is this work
likely to have public health implications? Preliminary work suggests
interference effects may be beneficially used to eradicate infections using
fewer vaccine units than conventional estimates. This proposal also aims to
construct statistical tools whereby the signature of interference may be
confidently detected from data. &lt;br/&gt;
