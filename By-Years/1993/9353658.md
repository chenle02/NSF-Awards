93-53658 Connolly Research Experiences for Undergraduate and Minority Students
in Biology and Chemistry The Kentucky Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research proposes to initiate two pilot programs to expand its
activities into human resource development. One of these programs is an
undergraduate enrichment program in biological sciences at the University of
Kentucky. The other is a minority fellowship program in chemical catalysis at
the University of Louisville. Each program will have at least equal matching
funds provided by either the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the University of
Kentucky, or the University of Louisville. Each of the projects is closely
related to the research clusters already supported by the NSF/EPSCoR advanced
development grant. However, they represent a new direction for the clusters as
they are designed to encourage talented undergraduates to seek careers in
biological research, and for minority students to work in the commercially
important area of chemical catalysis.
