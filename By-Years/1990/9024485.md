In an earlier research poject supported by the National Science Foundation, a
triple-path denuder (TPD) assembly for ambient sampling of sulfate and/or
nitrate compounds was constructed. This device contains a series of denuders and
filter packs which is intended to permit sampling and protection of sulfate
nitrate particles obtained from polluted urban atmospheres for species analysis
by x-ray diffraction techniques. In the current project, further laboratory
tests are planned: 1) the ability for this TPD instrument to collect
artificially prepared aerosols of nitrates and sulfates; 2) to determine the
lower limit of detection of these materials; and 30 to assess the extent to
which the denuder systems of the TPD protect the samples from artifact
reactions. Additional sampling at Denver, Colorado, is planned to test the
system in actual field conditions where significant urban chemical products of
this nature are known to occur. The proposal also includes quantitative analysis
of the collected particulate matter by x- ray reference intensity and x-ray
fluorescence procedures.
