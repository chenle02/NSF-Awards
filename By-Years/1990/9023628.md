Compile-time analysis techniques to aid the development of software in
sequential and parallel programming environments will be the focus of this
research. There are two trusts: (i) the maturation of work in designing
incremental data flow algorithms for semantic impact analysis of source code
changes in software systems, and (ii) the investigation of how compile-time
analysis can aid the compilation and debugging of programs that have implicit
and/or explicit parallelism. In debugging of concurrent systems, compile-time
analysis is used to help programmers debug software written with explicit
parallelism. Typical problems include races in shared memory machines,
indeterminately ordered accesses to the same memory location where at least one
access is a write, and deadlocks, non-terminating computations which cannot
continue because of improper synchronizations. For detection on shared memory
machines, use of interprocedural data flow information and good internal
representations of parallel primitives are being explored, as well as a case
study analyzing Ada rendezvous mechanisms. It is intended to combine compile-
time analysis with run-time testing for these problems, using the former to
guide the latter. This work will culminate in development of prototype software
tools demonstrating the techniques on actual Ada and Fortran programs. Desired
extensions include studying the applicability to a broad range of
synchronization primitives and classifying their properties with respect to
these problems.
