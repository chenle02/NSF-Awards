This project, funded in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program, provides for continuation of studies on bimetallic complexes
that are encapsulated in a macrocyclic ligand such that one metal ion is six
coordinate and serves as an electron reservoir and the other metal ion is four
coordinate and can coordinate dioxygen or an oxo ligand. The ultimate goal is to
find systems that can cause four- electron reduction of dioxygen and to use
products of such reactions to catalytically oxidize organic substrates. Initial
studies have suggested that five and six membered chelate rings formed by
complexation of the macrocyclic ligand donors to the metal ions lead to high
strain and prevent the formation of complexes with the desired stereochemistry.
In this phase of the investigation new ligand designs that will result in the
formation of seven membered rings will be tested with the expectation that
steric effects will be reduced and the desired product stereochemistry will be
realized. The proposed ligands will also allow for the incorporation of
asymmetry and thus will allow for possible asymmetric oxygenations. %%% Whereas
many biological oxidants use molecular oxygen effectively for oxidation of
organic molecules scientists have been much less successful in performing
similar reactions in the laboratory. Success in this endeavour could be of
significant industrial consequence as molecular oxygen is a readily available
and inexpensive reagent and biological oxidations are typically highly
selective. Studies such as those planned by Professor Bosnich are designed to
provide the fundamental information that will ultimately be required to develop
the necessary technology to use molecular oxygen for selective oxidations on an
industrial scale.
