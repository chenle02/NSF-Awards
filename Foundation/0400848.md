This project supports research by Buss and his graduate students on
computational complexity, proof complexity, algorithms, and numerical methods.
Buss investigates proof theory and proof complexity, especially aspects that are
closely connected to open problems in computational complexity including the P
versus NP problem. The relevant proof systems include bounded arithmetics, which
are first-order theories tailored to have logical strength related to feasible
computability, and propositional proof systems, which have rich connections to
bounded arithmetic and circuit complexity. Buss will work to establish lower
bounds on proof complexity based on complexity assumptions such as the existence
of provably secure cryptographic systems. He will work to prove new independence
results and separation results for weak proof systems. He will investigate what
kinds of computational content can be extracted from proofs. Buss will
investigate the proof complexity of propositional systems such as Frege systems,
cutting planes systems, Nullstellensatz proof systems, counting axioms, the
polynomial calculus, and intuitionistic proof systems. Buss also works on
numerical and geometric algorithms arising from computer graphics. He will work
on simulation methods for rigid multibodies using higher-order approximation
methods over manifolds, on symplectic algorithms and other energy-conserving
algorithms for physical simulations, and on collision response algorithms.

The main part of this research lies at the interface between mathematics and
computer science and is motivated by open questions concerning the fundamental
limits of computation. These open questions include the P versus NP problem, the
mathematical feasibility of secure cryptographic coding, and the optimality of
particular algorithms and circuits for solving combinatorial problems. This
project addresses these questions by investigating computational complexity and
proof complexity. Lower and upper bounds on proof complexity are closely related
to upper and lower bounds on the hardness of computation. This in turn is
closely related to the mathematical underpinnings of crytography.
