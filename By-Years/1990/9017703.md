This project will support planning an activity-based statistics course for
undergraduates that draws from recent experiences at the secondary level and in
industry, where statistics has been made relevant by focusing on the analysis of
data of interest to the participants. A laboratory-type course will be planned
that emphasizes modern data analysis and graphical techniques, student projects,
case studies, technology, and innovative teaching practices that treat
statistics as a laboratory science. It is expected that the project will provide
model data analysis lessons, resource reviews, and a network of contributors and
potential users so that a laboratory-type course in statistics can actually be
written and implemented. Through its advisory committee, this planning project
will be connected to other major efforts designed to improve the teaching of
statistics across the country.
