This proposal seeks funds to organize the third and fourth Marine Geoscience
Leadership Symposia , following symposia run in 2009 and 2011. These are 5-day
events held in Washington. The aim is to provide leadership skills to a cohort
of 25 early career scientists capable of participating in collaborative research
and science planning. The symposium will include formal presentations, group
discussions, and mentoring. The goal is to increase the effectiveness of early
career scientists as they enter the marine geosciences community, not only in
the classroom and laboratory, but also as leaders in the broader effort to
increase geoscience literacy.
