The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or "TeraGrid," involves nine resource
providers operating high performance computing, information, and visualization
facilities, interconnected with a dedicated optical network and integrated with
a set of common software that presents the user community with a cohesive set of
resources and services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF will conclude a three-year
construction effort to create this distributed environment and will transition
into an operational state. This proposal outlines a set of services to be
provided at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) as part of the TeraGrid
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists are facing an increasing deluge of data
for which they need the ability to manage, curate, analyze, mine, and synthesize
into information and knowledge. SDSC is bringing a powerful set of compute and
storage resources to TeraGrid, with a focus on moving traditional supercomputing
deep into the data-intensive domain. Examples include providing both powerful
dedicated database and I/O servers and extending all computational nodes with
direct Storage Area Network (SAN) attachments and database client
software.&lt;br/&gt;
