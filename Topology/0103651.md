Concrete issues proposed in this project are the study of 2-variable elliptic
genus and chiral deRham complex for non-singular and singular varieties,
mathematical foundations of the second quantized elliptic genus and orbifold
elliptic genus, ODE and PDE appearing in mirror symmetry, the Chern classes of
mirrors and the topology of the complements as well as the study of the
fundamental groups of the complements.

The goal of this project is to analyze from mathematical point of view several
methods and techniques which were used in theoretical physics, more precisely in
string theory. Such mathematical investigation should lead to new results in the
physical theories involved and produce a broader understanding of the reasons of
effectiveness of the methods used by physicists. Particular problems which we
are planning to solve are motivated by dualities in string theory and more
specifically by mirror correspondence. One of the problems is to find new
properties of mirror correspondence and its characterization. This involved the
study in topology, algebraic geometry and differential equations.
