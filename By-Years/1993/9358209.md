9358209 Davis This is an award to support research through a National Science
Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the Principal
Investigator who was nominated and selected through procedures contained in NSF
92-116, Young Investigator Awards FY 1993 Program. This investigator's research
plan includes an investigation of the use of photocatalytic oxidation processes
to destroy contaminants of water that are recalcitrant to destruction by use of
conventional processes. The contaminants of water this investigator plans to
work on include organic-complexed metals, pesticides and residues from
production of dyestuffs and explosives. Successful application of photocatalytic
oxidation toward their oxidation may provide an efficient, low-cost/maintenance
process for engineering design of systems to decontaminate water containing
these substances.
