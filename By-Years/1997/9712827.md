Since 1991, the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) has held a series of
highly successful workshops for women graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. The
AWM will hold six additional workshops in conjunction with major mathematical
meetings during 1998-2000: each of the annual joint meetings of the AMS and MAA
and each of the annual SIAM meetings. The workshop participants will be selected
by a panel of mathematicians on the basis of a competitive application process.
They will be asked to present their research at the workshop in a manner
suitable for a general mathematical audience. They will have the opportunity to
meet and interact with each other and with assigned mentors, as well as with
other established women mathematicians. The workshops will also include panels,
discussions, an informal luncheon, and a dinner. In addition, a minisymposium is
planned for the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics
(ICIAM) in Scotland (summer 1999). The minisymposium will consist of research
presentations by four outstanding women mathematicians who have received the
Ph.D. degree within the past five years.
