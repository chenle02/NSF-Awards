Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate glacial advance and
retreat of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet through the Eocene-Oligocene transition,
a major episode of ice growth. In Prydz Bay, East Antarctica, a 130-170 m thick
Eocene-Oligocene transition interval of glaciomarine sediments was cored in
drillholes of the Ocean Drilling Program at Sites 739, 742 and 1166.
Correlations between the Prydz Bay drillholes have recently been made through
well-log and multichannel seismic interpretations. Recent drilling on the Wilkes
Land margin of East Antarctica recovered earliest Oligocene sediments overlying
a major regional unconformity in two drillholes. The PI will study the
lithostratigraphy and weathering history of cores in the five drillholes, to
establish a unique Eocene-Oligocene transition record within Antarctic
continental margin sediments of glacial advance and retreat cycles, the onset of
physical weathering, and glacio-isostasy and self-gravitation processes with
implications for the margin architecture, sediment routing, and off-shore
sediment dispersal. Cores from the five drillholes will be re-examined through
detailed core description using an updated classification scheme, so that
lithofacies can be compared between drillholes. Samples will be collected for
detailed laser particle size and bulk major element geochemistry via ICP-AES to
determine the degree of chemical alteration of the sediments. Phases of major
ice growth will be recognized as marker beds of physically eroded sediment and
will be correlated to isotopic records documenting Antarctic ice growth offshore
in the Southern Ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This
project will benefit a large minority undergraduate student population through
the availability of up to two paid laboratory internships, a classroom exercise,
and the availability of research equipment supported by this award. The project
also allows support and training of a graduate student.
