Global climate change and its potential societal impacts have become one of our
era's greatest challenges. Climate science is experiencing tremendous data
growth (~100s of exabytes by 2020), yet our ability to learn from such data is
limited because most of the existing data science methods are not well-suited
for the noisy, heterogeneous, incomplete, and spatio-temporal data in climate
science. This project will develop novel data mining methods to enhance our
ability to learn from large and complex datasets with scientific and societal
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will focus on
foundational advances to traditional pattern mining by incorporating information
from multiple uncertain and incomplete datasets to discover statistically
significant patterns in continuous data with an application to oceanography. We
propose the notion of "spatio-temporal redundancy" where patterns are discovered
in multiple related datasets to offset the lack of target labels in the data.
This approach will address two major challenges in Big Data analysis for
scientific discovery. First, as the size and complexity of the data grow, the
likelihood of false discoveries increases significantly. Second the lack of
ground truth verification data makes objective validation a challenge. Finally,
we rely on First Principles and domain theory to constrain our data mining
approaches to produce tractable and scientifically consistent results. These
methods can generalize to various domains where no ground truth data are
available but one has access to several information-rich, yet uncertain
datasets.
