A Complete approach to uncertainty management requires support for interactive
and incremental problem formulation, inference, hypothesis ranking, and decision
making. Current approaches concentrate primarily on inference, and provide
little or no support for the larger issues in reasoning under uncertainty. This
proposal presents a plan for research into the use of multiple representations
of uncertainty as the basis of a complete computational foundation for
resource.bounded reasoning and decision.making under uncertainty. The research
is organized into two phases. The first phase is continued development of a
combined symbolic/numeric representation for small.scale problem model
formulation and evaluation. This framework provides basic capabilities to
support incremental model construction, evaluation, and revision, but does not
address issues of resource bounding which become critical in reasoning with
large.scale models. A second phase of the proposed research will address
problems which are intractable for the small.scale model approach, by developing
representations and evaluation strategies for decomposing a large.scale model
into a set of small.scale models.
