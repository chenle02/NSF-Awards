9423636 Chapman and Bailey Morphological and anatomical characters have
traditionally formed the basis for the taxonomy of the coralline red algae and
have resulted in numerous difficulties at all levels of classification from
species to order. Evolutionary convergence in structure and environmental
effects on shape and form are the suspected culprits. Mr. Jeffrey Bailey under
the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Russell Chapman at Louisiana State
University is generating an independent molecular data set to test the array of
conflicting hypotheses of relationships among ca. 40 genera of coralline red
algae. An associated study includes the first analysis of a unique type of host-
parasite association, adelphoparasitism, found in the coralline red algae
(although known in other Rhodophyta). New molecular data, nuclear ribosomal DNA
sequences, will be integrated with traditional morphological characters in a
focused study of species and genus relationships among the coralline red algae.
