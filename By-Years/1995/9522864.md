9522864 Chuang Fundamental linear and nonlinear gains and their polarization
dependences in strained semiconductor quantum wells will be investigated
theoretically and experimentally. We will design strained quantum wells such
that (a) the gain of the TE (parallel to the quantum-well planes) polarization
is dominant, (b) the gain of the TM (perpendicular to the planes) polarization
is dominant, and (c) the gains of both polarizations have nearly the same
magnitude using InGaAs/InGaA1As and InGaAs/InGaAsP material systems. Samples in
which the light-hole subband is aligned with or above the heavy-hole subband can
be designed such that the gain of the quantum-well active region becomes
polarization insensitive. Nonlinear optical gain processes such as band filling
and spectral and spatial hole burning effects in strained systems play important
roles in these inverted media and will be investigated. Strained quantum wells
have important technological applications in optoelectronic devices including
semiconductor optical amplifiers and lasers for optical communication systems.
With our comprehensive study of the linear and nonlinear gains, polarization-
insensitive semiconductor optical amplifiers using strained quantum wells will
be designed using both InGaAlAs and InGaAsP systems. ***
