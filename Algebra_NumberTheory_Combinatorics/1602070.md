Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are among the oldest and yet most
active disciplines in mathematics. The fields have strong ties to diverse areas
of mathematics, and are also used in a wide variety of applied settings. This
research project will explore important open questions in these fields, aiming
for a deeper understanding of the singularities of varieties over positive
characteristic number systems. These systems, those where a prime number
vanishes, include the finite fields at the heart of essentially all electronic
computation. While carrying out this research program, the investigator will
also organize research seminars, support and supervise graduate student
research, and conduct activities, including an annual symposium, to promote
undergraduate research.

Explicitly, the investigator plans to continue study of singularities of and
invariants defined via the Frobenius map in positive characteristic commutative
algebra. In particular, the research will focus on the circle of ideas
surrounding F-signature, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, and test ideals, in two very
different directions. First, in a fixed characteristic, the project aims to
expand upon recent progress in computing these invariants, and to approach some
long standing important open questions about them, such as the equivalence of
weak and strong F-regularity. Second, the research aims to show these invariants
have limiting values under reduction to positive characteristic. Here, it is
hoped that the limits as the characteristic tends towards infinity have simpler
interpretations and values, and can be related to geometric measures of
singularities for complex algebraic varieties. The interaction with geometric
methods in characteristic zero stemming from complex algebraic geometry is
central to the project, and one of the main objectives of the work is to better
describe the geometry and broader connections of F-invariants.
