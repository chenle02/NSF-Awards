Structurally simple, highly dispersed, supported metal catalysts are prepared
and characterized. The catalysts are prepared from organometallic precursors
which are converted into organometallic clusters of defined structures on the
surfaces of basic supports (magnesia and lanthana); subsequent decarbonylation
gives clusters of supported metal atoms with the same number of atoms as the
precursors. The metals used in this study are iridium and platinum. Samples are
characterized with infrared spectroscopy, extended X-ray adsorption fine
structure (EXAFS), and transmission electron microscopy; catalytic activities
and selectives are measured for hydrocarbon conversion reactions. This is a
fundamental study of the effects of dispersion near the upper limit (or,
equivalently, the effects of cluster size in small clusters) on the catalytic
properties of metals. The issue is a critical one for the optimization of
systems employing rare-metal catalysts for a variety of industry energy and
environmental purposes.
