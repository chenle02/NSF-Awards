9724271 Geist, Robert Dawson, Darren Clemson University Acquisition of a Silicon
Graphics Workstation for Modeling, Simulation, and Virtualization of Physical
Phenomena Clemson University is acquiring a graphics supercomputer to support
modeling, visualization and simulation of physical phenomena research conducted
by the departments of computer science, electrical and computer engineering, and
mechanical engineering. Specific research projects include materials research,
wireless communications, mechatronics and design, visualization and geometric
computation. The supercomputer facilities will be available to both
undergraduate and graduate students pursuing research in all of the areas
described above. Clemson University also has plans to distribute information on
research results regionally via a Web site, VHS video and a Supercomputer
information brochure.
