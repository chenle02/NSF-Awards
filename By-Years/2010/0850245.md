This project is providing scholarships for associate and transfer students
majoring in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Chemistry, Environmental
Science, Forensic Science, Pre-Engineering, and Mathematics. Project goals are
to increase the number of majors in these areas by an average of 20% over the
four scholarship award years, and by relieving the financial burden on
scholarship recipients, to allow them to have more extensive participation in
academic and support activities that can foster success and retention. The two-
year college in which the project is housed is building upon the successful
support structures in its Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement
(MESA) program and other programs serving minorities. Scholars are being
recruited from traditional and non-traditional populations, the MESA program,
and area high schools for early enrollment. A formal network with a local high
school that is a designated center of excellence for science, mathematics and
engineering, and that enrolls a high percentage of students from
underrepresented groups, is a major mechanism for recruitment of academically
promising high school students. Evaluation of the factors contributing to
success in recruitment and retention is expected to expand the knowledge base
that can be drawn from in designing programs to increase the numbers and
diversity of STEM graduates.
