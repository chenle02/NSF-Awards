The age of autonomous mobile systems is dawning -- from autonomous cars to
household robots to aerial drones -- and they are expected to transform multiple
industries and have significant impact on the US economy. Through wireless
coordination, these systems create a whole that is greater than the sum of its
parts. For example, vehicle "platoons" increase both highway throughput and fuel
efficiency by traveling nearly bumper-to-bumper, using a wireless coupling to
brake and accelerate simultaneously. Similarly, vehicles or drones can speed
around blind corners using the sensing capabilities of the agents ahead of them.
However, wireless communication is still considered too unreliable for safety-
critical operations like these. This research is creating new techniques for
safe wirelessly coordinated mobility, which is becoming increasingly important
with the proliferation of autonomous mobile systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach is to develop a framework for joint modeling and analysis of motion and
communication in order to find provably safe coordination paths. This includes
new models that can predict the effect of motion paths on the wireless channel,
together with new formal methods that can use these models in a tractable manner
to synthesize control strategies with provable guarantees. The key innovations
include new methods to assess the validity of a Radio Frequency model, new
methods for tractable probabilistic reasoning over complex models of the
wireless channel and protocols, and new control strategies that achieve provable
safety guarantees for states that would have been unsafe without wireless
coordination. If successful, this research will allow mobile systems to realize
the performance benefits of wireless coordination while preserving the ability
to provide provable safety guarantees. The focus is not on improving the
wireless channel reliability; instead, the aim is to provide safety guarantees
on the entire mobile system by modeling and analyzing the channel's dynamic
properties in a rapidly changing environment.
