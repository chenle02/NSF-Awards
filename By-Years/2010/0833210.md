The American Physical Society and the American Association of Physic Teachers
are cooperating to increase the number of qualified physics teachers via the
Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) teacher preparation program. At
each of the six participating PhysTEC institutions, program components include:
(1) a close collaboration among science and education faculty and local school
systems; (2) the utilization of a master teacher in residence; (3) the redesign
of targeted introductory physics courses and science methods courses; and (4) an
active mentoring and induction effort. These programs emphasize active
engagement and inquiry-based instruction grounded in physics education research,
and provide early teaching experiences for prospective teachers. Approximately
thirty new physics teachers are expected to result from the five year project.
