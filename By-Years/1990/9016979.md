A methodology will be developed for comprehensive and quantitative mathematical
simulation of warning systems for rapid-onset natural hazards. The methodology
will encompass all major factors that determine the performance of a total
warning system: geophysical, technological, organizational, behavioral, and
economic factors. Next, mathematical models of warning systems will be developed
for two types of hazards: flash floods and riverine floods. The purpose of the
models will be to provide a scientific basis and analytic means for engineering
design, operation, evaluation of performance, and benefit-cost analyses of
warning systems. Engineering usefulness of the models will be tested through
representative applications.
