This REU site award at Lafayette College brings together six student
researchers for work under faculty supervision in five possible areas of
mathematics. The work involves investigation of problems from applied operations
research leading to traffic flow applications, boundary crossings in the strong
law of large numbers, an area of probability theory, and polynomial invariants
of graphs. In addition, work on short periods of the convergents of continued
fraction moduluo m in number theory and the study of k-terminal networks arising
from reliability problems in network theory will be considered. Outside speakers
will be interspersed with faculty and student presentations during the two-month
activity. The students will work in groups of three, but each will be
responsible for producing independent research. Write-ups of the work at the end
of the project is required.
