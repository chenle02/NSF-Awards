The main researcher for this project will be a post-doc to the principal
investigator. The researcher will continue his work on the random fields.
Infinite dimensional probability spaces provide excellent models in the study of
Eucleadian quantum field theory and equilibrium statistical mechanics. The
probability spaces providing the models have parameters that correspond to
temperature, momentum cutoff and coupling constants etc.. Various phenomena such
as phase transition, symmetry breaking and consequences of renormalization can
be predicted by varying these perameters. Except in very simple situations, the
proofs of these predictions are difficult to accomplish rigorously. The
researcher will try to attack some of these intriguing problems via the use of
techniques from nonhomogeneous Gaussian processes associated with the free
Markov field.
