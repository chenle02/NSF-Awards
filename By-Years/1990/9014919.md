This award will support a U.S.-Australian workshop "Early Steps In The
Flowering Process" to be held at the East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii on
February 10-15, 1991. The organizers are Dr. Carl McDaniel, Department of
Biology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Dr. Rod W. King, Senior Principal
Research Scientist, Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO) Plant Industry, Canberra, Australia. The workshop will bring together
U.S. and Australian experts who represent the full range of research on
flowering, that is, the reductionist, molecular genetic approach and the
physical, whole plant approach. The workshop will contribute to improved
understanding of seed plants, the most important modern-day group of organisms
in terms of energy capture and agriculture. Collaborative interaction between
Australian and American scientists is expected to be strengthened by exploring
areas where future cooperative research may be beneficial.
