9405948 Masters This research is to continue an investigation of long-period
body wave data in order to resolve aspherical elastic and anelastic structure in
the mantle. The main areas of focus will be 1) the measurement and
interpretation of global datasets of body-wave attenuation - special emphasis
will be on constraint of lateral variations in Q structure which will complement
other studies that use surface waves. An attempt will also be made to constrain
the form of the absorption band in the earth; 2) the use of body-waveform
modeling to handle triplication regions of the seismograms - the method employs
a 3-D ray tracer which is also useful for looking at non- linear behavior of
travel-time perturbations and 3) modelling of entire global datasets including
various geodynamical prejudices. ***
