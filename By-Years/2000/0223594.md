The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National
Science Foundation (NSF) will continue the AAAS/NSF Fellowship Program for a
third year. Up to seven Fellows for the 2002-2003 year will be selected and
placed in offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the
Fellows and the host directorate or office. Fellows will learn how NSF funds
science, while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues
relating to NSF's mission support of fundamental science and engineering
research and education. Fellows will work with staff involved in planning,
development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of fundamental
research. Assignments may involve significant interagency, congressional or
international activity, as well as involvement with the National Science Board,
NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an orientation on executive
branch and congressional operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on
issues involving science, technology and public policy.
