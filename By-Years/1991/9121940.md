Legal institutions are used increasingly in modern society to mediate disputes
and resolve conflicts. Previous research and portrayals in popular culture,
however, suggest that lawyers in the U.S. have a serious "image" problem and
that clients are generally dissatisfied with the quality of their legal
services. Dissatisfaction with lawyers and legal services can be disfunctional
for society because it hampers the resolution of particular cases and may
discourage the the use of law to resolve future conflict. This grant will
provide a comprehensive examination of public opinion about legal remedies to
disputes, and assess the extent, causes and consequences of client
dissatisfaction with their legal services in disputes related to divorce, torts,
and criminal complaints. While focus groups and personal interviews will be used
in the early stages of the research, the primary data will be derived from
telephone surveys of a national probability sample of 1000 citizens. The survey
gives particular attention to clients' perceptions of the style of lawyering and
social power strategies used by their attorneys and how these factors influence
ratings of procedural justice, satisfaction with legal services, and future
intentions of using legal methods of dispute settlement. The results of this
study will fill an important empirical gap in our understanding of public
perceptions of lawyers and the use of legal remedies to redress disputes. Also,
the results will contribute to theoretical discussions about the future utility
of traditional legal solutions to interpersonal disputes in modern society.
