.Robust automated natural language processing has the potential to revolutionize
the way people interact with machines and the way machines process information.
To date, the major bottleneck inhibiting the creation of robust and accurate
natural language processing systems is the problem of linguistic knowledge
acquisition, in particular how a machine can obtain the linguistic
sophistication necessary for accurate processing of language. In this proposal,
work is described which will help break this knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
As an alternative to manually providing a machine with linguistic knowledge,
methods will be explored for automatically learning linguistic knowledge from
on-line text corpora. Methods of extending a recently developed corpus-based
learning algorithm called transformation-based error-driven learning will be
explored. Extending this algorithm and carefully studying the strengths and
weaknesses of this and other approaches to corpus-based learning should lead to
very powerful programs for automatically learning the linguistic information
necessary for highly sophistic ated natural language processing systems to
become a reality.
