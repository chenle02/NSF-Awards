This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I submission proposes to design
and produce nanofiber-based corneal tissue scaffolds to treat corneal diseases,
the second most common cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 10-15 million
people. This innovative approach uses electrospun mats from biocompatible
polymers, which will be characterized for mechanical and optical properties.
Candidate mats will be functionalized using a unique poly(acrylic) acid
chemistry, conjugating extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin to
the highly porous, high surface area nanofiber mats. Mats will then be
sterilized, seeded with cultured human limbal stem cells, and attached to the
scaffolds via laminin and fibronectin protein ligands. Cell viability and
adhesion will be studied to determine the optimal transparent, biocompatible,
pathogen-free, corneal scaffold for implantation in the eye.

The broader impacts of this research include other ocular transplantation needs,
such as corneal endothelial cell and retinal pigment epithelial cell
transplantation (for macular degeneration), as well as tissue engineering for
virtually all body tissues, from cardiac valve leaflets to tendon repair. Newer
partial keratoplasty procedures, such as the rapidly evolving Descemet?s
stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), would similarly benefit from a
transparent tissue scaffold seeded with human endothelial cells. Worldwide, the
need for healthy donor tissues far exceeds the available supply. This corneal
transplant market is in excess of $22 billion annually worldwide. Experience
gained from ocular bioengineering will translate into customization of other
stem cells on nanofiber scaffolds for applications in diverse areas of the human
body, broadening the impact of this technology for an aging population.
