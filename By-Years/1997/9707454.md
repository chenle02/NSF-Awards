This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the
University of California-Los Angeles. The student will study the illness
management practices of a tribal society in the Peruvian Amazon area, to
investigate how people choose between medical alternatives. The student will get
information on how illnesses interrupt the daily routines of patients and their
families, how people perceive their experiences when ill and how their
cognitions change over time, and the effects of cultural knowledge,
interruptions of daily routine and social-economic conditions on medical
treatment choice. This research is important because it will advance our
knowledge about the micro-processes of change in people's beliefs as they
undergo medical treatment. By focusing on health seeking behaviors, the project
will advance our understanding of key indicators and priorities that determine
the initiation of health action as well as factors affecting treatment choice.
In addition the research will add to our information about this important area
of the continent. รก(
