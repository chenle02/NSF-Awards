There exists a wide-spread notion that political polarization today is
considerably larger than it was a generation ago. Many observers are concerned
that this leads to increased gridlock in a given political system, which could
threaten the functioning of government and thus, ultimately, the economic
welfare of a nation and the stability of its democracy. Understanding which
political and economic causes drive polarization, as well as what the effect of
polarization on voters and parties is, therefore represent central questions for
our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, precisly identifying the notion of
increased polarization in scientific terms is conceptually challenging because
measuring candidates' positions and comparing them over time is difficult. Since
the pertinent policy issues in two different campaigns are usually very
different, directly comparing the difference between the candidates' platforms
is not a feasible approach to the measurement
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, the PIs provide a fundamentally new
method for estimating changes in platform divergence over time, using data from
opinion polls on the ideal positions of voters regarding different issues, as
well as on their preferred candidate. Based on a spatial model of policy
preferences, this project shows how changes in candidate positions affect voter
behavior, and how changes in voter behavior provide information about candidate
positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will also analyze the question of
"voter polarization". The existing literature is somewhat vague about what
exactly constitutes polarization and how to measure it. Based on their model,
the PIs provide a new measure of this concept and are able to disentangle the
two effects that might be responsible for increased polarization: voter
"radicalization" (i.e., a change in the distribution of voter ideal points) and
"sorting" (an effect arising from more policy divergence between
politicians).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This method can also be used to identify the
different ideological types of swing voters and their demographic composition.
Moreover, one can identify which ideological and demographic voter types are
underrepresented in the electorate because of abstention, and thus, the effect
of changes in participation rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of the
U.S. political system are the primaries in which voters select the candidates of
their respective parties. The second part of this project will analyze a dynamic
model of policy divergence and polarization, based on the interaction between
candidates and policy-motivated primary voters who select them.
