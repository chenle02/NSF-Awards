The investigator intends to focus on classifying certain kinds of manifolds
using a combination of geometric methods and stable homotopy theory. In
particular, he would like to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of positive scalar curvature metrics, and give a diffeomorphism
classification of Dupin hypersurfaces and complete intersections. Classification
of manifolds with nice geometric properties is as old as the Greeks. Here the
properties under consideration are more modern, but the basic idea is much the
same.
