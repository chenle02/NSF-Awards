This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop methods
for wireless integrated circuits. The linearization method can be summarized as
a "bad amplifier" is added to a "good amplifier" to form a "much better
amplifier." This new technology enables complete implementation on a single
integrated circuit, leading to cellular radio and wireless systems with lower
cost, smaller size, and smaller batteries. Competing technologies are not
applicable to radio receiver designs and not suitable for integrated circuit
implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target market is primarily cellular
phones, at 300 million units per year. Commercialization feasibility and
strategies will also be evaluated for target markets. &lt;br/&gt;
