This project deals with electric power system security. The specific innovation
to be studied is the use of integrated decision support systems utilizing sensor
fusion techniques. The immediate goal is to provide the theoretical foundation
for designing more effective and accessible decision support systems and new
indicators for power system management. The project is an outgrowth of automatic
contingency selection and voltage collapse studies. At present, energy
management systems (EMS's) use various performance indices and models for
evaluating system security. Systems are usually designed for the most stressful
load demand schedules. The proposed support system will coordinate all the
performance indices used and approximate system performance models using data
fusion methodologies. The expectation is that the method will permit an advanced
approach to allow the operator to master the complex system conditions under
heavy load conditions. The novelty of this approach lies in the use of sensor
fusion techniques within the framework of statistical decision theory.
Architectures for the practical implementation of the technique will also be
studied.
