This project addresses the challenge of infusing computational thinking (CT)
into a wide array of undergraduate courses from many different disciplines. It
is addressing NSF calls for "computer science for all students" and also will
contribute to the NSF call for infusing computer science into other STEM (and
non-STEM) courses [CS+X]. Based on prior work at the precollege as well as post-
secondary level, it is building and testing a promising model of change at the
institutional level at the University of Delaware. This model has the potential
to be a national example for the infusion of computational thinking (CT) into a
general undergraduate curriculum. It also introduces and, potentially, tests the
effectiveness of four important initiatives designed to further CT in the
curriculum: 1) a model for change; 2) effective faculty professional development
practices; 3) incorporation of peer mentoring; and 4) formative and summative
assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This change model builds on significant prior
knowledge and experience and uses evidence-based approaches for ongoing faculty
professional development, supported by trained undergraduates who act as
Learning Assistants to create a functional learning community. It incorporates
carefully-designed assessments of changes in faculty practice, general education
courses, student learning outcomes and the impact of the structure on the change
itself, building on the Association of American Colleges and Universities VALUE
Rubrics, particularly the Quantitative Literacy Rubric.
