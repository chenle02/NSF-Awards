Proposal ID: DMS-0229028 PI: Casella Title: Conference on Functional Data
Analysis

The Department of Statistics at the University of Florida hosts its Fifth Annual
Winter Workshop on January 10-11, 2003 in Gainesville, Florida. The workshop
focuses on recent developments in functional data analysis (FDA), which is
emerging as one of the most important new statistical methodologies with diverse
applications in all areas of statistics ranging from image analysis to
bioinformatics. The workshop provides a forum for interaction between
theoretical developments and advances in applications of FDA methods. Besides
the impact on development of human resources, the workshop will generate an
impetus for the wider dissemination and use of functional data analysis
techniques. In addition to invited sessions, the conference will include a
contributed poster session.
