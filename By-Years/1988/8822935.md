The intent of this project is the procurement of a symbolic computation facility
to support research at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
in the area of nonlinear motion and control of structural and dynamical systems.
The facility comprises an Apollo computational workstation that supports
MACSYMA, a symbolic manipulation tool developed at the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory of MIT. This equipment will be used in the nonlinear analysis and
control of structures and dynamical systems in general and large flexible
structures in particular. Four current projects will benefit from this facility.
Two are supported by the Air Force, one by NSF, and one by ONR. The Air Force
projects combine theoretical and experimental techniques to investigate the
nonlinear dynamics and control of flexible and SDI structures, the NSF project
addresses theoretical and experimental techniques for the nonlinear response of
dynamic systems to multifrequency excitations, and the ONR project addresses the
nonlinear motion and hydrodynamics of ships.
