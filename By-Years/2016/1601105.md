This award supports participants in the Texas-Oklahoma Representations and
Automorphic Forms (TORA) conference series will take place at the University of
North Texas (UNT) in Denton, TX, April 8-10, 2016; at Oklahoma State University
(OSU) in Stillwater, OK in Fall 2017; and at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in
Norman, OK in Fall 2018. Each TORA conference will feature three plenary guest
speakers consisting of two outstanding leading research mathematicians from
outside the Oklahoma-Texas region as well as a recent Ph.D. or a graduate
student nearing completion of a Ph.D. In addition, regional graduate students
and researchers will present their work. These weekend conferences will provide
ample opportunities for collaboration and interactions among the students and
researchers in the region, specializing in number theory, automorphic forms and
representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are basic objects
of study in modern number theory. The interplay between automorphic forms and
representation theory has seen a number of very exciting new developments
recently which also fuel applications to several other fields. J. Arthur's work
on endoscopic classification of representations of the orthogonal and symplectic
groups is an example of such new developments. Research faculty from over a half
dozen universities in the Oklahoma and North Texas region work in automorphic
forms and representation theory. The TORA conference series has been successful
in bringing together researchers from the region and beyond, as well as their
students, and propel innovation and exchange. TORA VII-IX will continue this
success in collaborations and exchanges not only between institutions, but also
among mathematical areas. The webpage for the 2016 conference can be found here
