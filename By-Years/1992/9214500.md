9214500 Shapiro The Harvard College Observatory provides a broad research
program in astronomy and astrophysics, collaborating with the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in comprising the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics. The Harvard College Observatory also provides substantial support
to the Harvard Department of Astronomy. Staff and students participate in a wide
range of research activities that involve ground-based radio and optical
observations of cosmic sources, balloon-borne devices for x-ray observations,
and theoretical and laboratory astrophysics. The Institute for Theoretical
Atomic and Molecular Physics, of the Center for Astrophysics, attracts visiting
scientists and talented graduate students to pursue research in atomic and
molecular physics. High School students are afforded the opportunity to learn
astronomy by enrolling in Project STAR, a pre-college program at the Center for
Astrophysics, designed to teach physics and mathematics using examples from
astronomy. Current climate conditions at the Harvard Observatory, an
interconnected complex of six buildings, constructed between 1846 and 1972, have
been a major impediment in conducting research. Funds have been requested to
upgrade the twenty year old chilled water plant and distribution system of the
Observatory. The modifications of the facility will consist of: repiping the
chilled water system, recommissioning the reheat system, installing a direct
digital control system for sensing control and monitoring of the chilled water
and heating systems, installing circuit chillers and pumps, and replacing fan
coils. The upgrades will provide effective year round cooling and climate
control to the facility, creating a productive research environment for staff
and students. ***
