This award by the National Science Foundation provides core support to the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute located at Berkeley, California. The
fundamental goal of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is to
stimulate and invigorate research in the mathematical sciences by bringing
together, in a programmatically focused scientific environment, the top
mathematical scientists nationally and internationally in given research
subjects. The interaction of senior and mid-level scholars and the very best
postdoctoral fellows in a given field produces an intensely stimulating and
exciting environment where new ideas can be exploited and developed. The MSRI
places a high priority on the training of postdoctoral researchers, and the
scientific structure and budgetary allocations of funds reflect this commitment.
Normally, two academic-year scientific research programs take place each year.
In addition to these academic year programs, the MSRI conducts workshops,
conferences, and microprograms which complement the year-long activities. The
MSRI also supports summer research and training programs for graduate students.
Every effort is made to schedule programs of timely research interest and
opportunities exist for cross-programmatic collaboration and scientific
exchange.
