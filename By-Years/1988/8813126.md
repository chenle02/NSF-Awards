A new program of theoretical research will be initiated by Professor Dray. His
research crosses the traditional boundaries separating mathematics, physics, and
computer science. It involves the development of programs for symbolic
computation of the symmetries in certain geometries of interest to gravitational
theory. This will help provide coordinate independent classification to
solutions of Einstein's equations for the gravitational field.
