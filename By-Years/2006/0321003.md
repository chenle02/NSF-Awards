Proposal No. CTS-0321003 Principal Investigator: S. Post, Michigan Tech
University

This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant is to purchase a high speed
imaging system that will record one-megapixel digital images at frequencies as
high as one million frames per second. Standard microscope lenses can be
attached to the camera, allowing for micron-scale spatial resolution. The
electrically-powered camera is portable, requiring only a standard power outlet
to operate, so that it can be transported to different inter-disciplinary labs.

Research faculty and graduate students from various departments across Michigan
Technological University (MTU) will be utilizing the camera system in their
research to resolve small time and length scale processes. The research
activities that will use the high speed imaging system will address issues
dealing with spray drop coalescence, fabrication of nano-materials from drops of
liquid-solid suspensions, chip formation in machining, coalescence of viscous
polymer materials, the spreading kinetics of low viscosity liquids, and
collisions in sprays. Specifically, these projects will provide new insights
into the details of liquid-solid and liquid-gas-liquid interfaces under
transient conditions. This system will also aid in the development of new system
for direct writing technology on the nano-scale level. Such technology could
lead to improved quality and speed for fabrication of small sensors. In all the
proposed activities the camera system is expected to yield significant insight
into the relevant fundamental processes. With continuously growing research
activity at MTU, it is anticipated that the proposed camera system will be
utilized to its fullest capacity to investigate the behavior of materials at
microsecond time scales and micrometer length scales.

The digital high speed imaging system will be incorporated into the PI's
research labs, where it will enhance the educational experience of both graduate
and undergraduate students working in the lab. The imaging system can also be
used for senior design projects and undergraduate research projects.
