The Principal Investigator plans to continue his study of Anabelian geometry and
of Field Arithmetic, as well as the interaction of these two subjects with other
aspects of mathematics in general, and with arithmetic geometry and algebraic
geometry in particular.

This study will be guided in part by possible extensions of the known anabelian
phenomena, and of the known facts from field arithmetic, to which the PI has
made major contributions. The PI expects to prove the pro-l abelian-by-central
birational anabelian Conjecture for function fields of tr.degree >1 over
algebraic closures of finite fields, of global fields, and even more general
algebraically closed fields. The PI expects to obtain the pro-l abelian-by-
central form of the Ihara/Oda--Matsumoto conjecture, which would have a major
impact on understanding the Galois structure of the field of rational numbers
(and other fields). The PI expects as well to make progress on Grothendieck's
(p-adic) Section Conjecture and its relation to (an effective) Mordell
Conjecture --Faltings' Theorem. The PI expects to make progress on better
understanding the class of large fields, and of the cohomology of fields as
related to the Freeness Conjecture.

Positive answers to the questions mentioned above would have a very significant
impact on the progress of modern Galois theory, and on some of the very
fundamental questions in arithmetic geometry and algebraic geometry. The results
will be widely disseminated to the mathematical community via talks and
publications in scientific journals. The PI is co-organizer of, and senior
invited researcher at, activities which plan to do both: first, to create a
broad basis for international cooperation, training, and scientific exchange at
all levels, and second, to have special activities for graduate students and
young researchers, thus enhancing teaching and technological understanding.
