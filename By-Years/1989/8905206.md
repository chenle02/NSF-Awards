This award will support in part the International Conference on Elastic and
Diffractive Scattering to be held at Northwestern University on May 2-6, 1989.
This is the third "Blois Workshop" initiated in Blois (France) in 1985. The
topics include the presentation of new data from the Fermilab Tevatron Collider
on the forward nuclear scattering amplitude. It will also include results on
diffractive production of jets as well as cosmic ray results and theoretical
confronta- tion of QCD with soft processes.
