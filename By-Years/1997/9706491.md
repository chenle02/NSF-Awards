Recent empirical studies have shown that self-similar traffic models, which are
rooted in chaos theory, may be more appropriate than the models typically in use
for network traffic. Without an understanding of the causes of this self-similar
behavior, it is difficult to say how widely applicable these models are, or what
if anything should be done to mitigate the will explore whether network
protocols themselves can make traffic appear chaotic over time scales of
engineering interest, and if so, whether protocol modifications might help. This
will be achieved by simulating realistic models of a variety of networks,
present and future. In each simulation, a well-behaved (non-chaotic) model for
input traffic will be employed, and it will be determined whether the network
protocols can turn this well-behaved input into chaotic or self-similar traffic
flows.
