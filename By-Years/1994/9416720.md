This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in physics
between Roberto Mancini of the University of Nevada and Jean-Claude Gauthier of
the Ecole Polytechnique's Laboratory for the Utilization of Intense Lasers. The
project combines complementary modeling and experimental work in the area of
femtosecond laser-produced plasmas and in the generation of ultra short- X-ray
pulses. They will study the effects of time-dependent atomic kinetics and hot-
electron production and attenuation. The project brings together complementary
resources. The University of Nevada offers expertise in theory and modeling
research in laser-produced plasmas. This will be complemented by experimental
work performed on a state-of-the-art laser facility at the Ecole Polytechnique.
The French research group will focus on experiments of irradiation of solid
targets, diagnostics, complementary hydrodynamic modeling of target evolution,
and Monte Carlo simulations of hot-electron transport. Results from these
experiments will drive kinetic models developed at the University of Nevada. The
project will advance understanding of dense plasma physics that will be
beneficial to research in astrophysics, materials science, and studies on matter
in extreme conditions.
