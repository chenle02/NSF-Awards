This Symposium presents original papers on the relation of artificial
intelligence to the mathematical theory of computation. These papers by
distinguished authors cover the relevant aspects of this topic. They are mostly
research papers and some are historical papers tracing the development of the
field. A volume of proceedings of the Symposium is to be published by Academic
Press. The Symposium is expected to make a contribution to the field of
artificial intelligence by extending extant work on artificial intelligence
theory and by bringing together diverse strands of it. This event is held at
Stanford University on September 6 and 7, 1991. One of the leading pioneers of
artificial intelligence is Professor John McCarthy. The Symposium recognizes his
important contributions to the field and many of the presenters are his students
and colleagues.
