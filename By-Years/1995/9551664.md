This project is purchasing a 200-MHz Fourier Transform nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment allows for the implementation of
more sophisticated experiments, through the cumulative development of concepts
during the laboratory sequence. This project is also developing new experiments
for organic, inorganic, and physical teaching laboratories. This equipment
purchase addresses a number of problems related to the use of NMR as a teaching
tool. NMR is often considered an organic technique, and students are generally
not exposed to its utility in other areas of chemistry. In addition, non-
chemistry-majors often do not use the technique after a general introductory
structural determination experiment during which, with few exceptions, advanced
techniques are not introduced.
