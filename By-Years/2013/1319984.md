Many distributed applications in the current Internet are massively replicated
to ensure unsurpassed data robustness and scalability; however, constant data
churn (i.e., update of the source) and delayed synchronization lead to staleness
and thus lower performance in these systems. The goal of this project is to
pioneer a stochastic theory of data replication that can tackle non-trivial
dependency issues in synchronization of general non-Poisson point processes,
design more accurate sampling and prediction algorithms for measuring data
churn, solve novel multi-source and multi-replica staleness-optimization
problems, establish new fundamental understanding of cooperative and multi-hop
replication, and model non-stationary update processes of real
sources.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The now omnipresent cloud technology has become a
vast consumer and generator of data that must be stored, replicated, and
streamed to a variety of clients. This project focuses on understanding
theoretical and experimental properties of data evolution and staleness in such
systems, whose outcomes are likely to impact Internet computing through creation
of insight that leads to better content-distribution mechanisms, more accurate
search results, and ultimately higher satisfaction among everyday users.
Furthermore, this project blends a variety of inter-disciplinary scientific
areas, reaches out to the student population at Texas A&amp;M to engage them in
research activities from early stages of their careers, trains well-rounded PhD
students knowledgeable in both theoretical and experimental aspects of large-
scale networked systems, engages under-represented student groups in STEM
fields, disseminates information through two new seminars at Texas A&amp;M, and
shares data models and experimental results with the public.
