There are celebrated cases where individual moral decision making in computing
has mattered greatly, but there is little systematic work on how moral decisions
are made by individual computer professionals. The literature on organizational
issues in computing has focused on variables such as status, power, and
organizational imperatives. It leads us to focus on situational parameters. This
important perspective ignores or underestimates the influence of the individual
decision maker in the process. This study explores the life stories of moral
exemplars in computing in two cultures, those of Britain and Scandinavia. These
two cultures are an interesting contrast because the associated countries have
been heavily involved in computing research and design, but their national
cultures differ markedly in their approach to workplace values. This case-based
study, based on in-depth interviews and questionnaires, examines how particular
moral exemplars in computing develop over time in their moral reasoning and
action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be done while the investigator is
in residence at the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR) at De
Montfort University, Leicester, UK. A panel of experts in computing ethics
refines criteria for selecting moral exemplars in computing in British and
Scandinavian cultures, and then helps develop a snowball sample of those moral
exemplars. Once selected, the moral exemplars are asked to participate in
interviews using a format called the "Life Story Interview" in which
interviewees are asked to relate narratives of important episodes in their life
(e.g. a peak experience, a nadir experience, a turning point). The interviews
are transcribed and coded to identify important developmental milestones and
influences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research breaks new ground by combining
developmental work in moral psychology with concern for moral values and
behavior on the part of computer professionals. It will be of interest to
psychologists studying moral reasoning and action and to the interdisciplinary
field of computer ethics. Scholars in the related field of social informatics
will also be interested. Finally, this exploratory research will provide an
excellent foundation for a continuing research program in the moral development
of computer professionals. Much effort has been expended in talking about
teaching computer ethics and we have various curricula as guidelines for
teaching computer ethics. If we knew something about what actually motivates
computer professionals to be ethical, it might well change what (or how) we
teach computer &lt;br/&gt;
