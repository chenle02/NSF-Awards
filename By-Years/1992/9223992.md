This award is for support of a three year investigation to characterize seismic
reflection facies of temperate glaciers in order to help infer climatic,
glaciologic and marine conditions associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
advance and subsequent retreat in Glacier Bay, Alaska. The study will use the
R/V Alpha Helix for collection of data by seismic reflection profiling, side
scan sonar, and piston and gravity coring. This work will provide critical data
for modeling the depositional systems of glacial grounding lines. This is a
collaborative research project between Northern Illinois University and
Appalachian State University.
