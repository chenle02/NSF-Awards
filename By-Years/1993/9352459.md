Valencia is in the process of implementing a Computer Integrated Manufacturing
(CIM) Training Facility to provide students with the opportunity to enhance
their skills and to participate in applied research projects. The implementation
includes acquisition, installation and testing of additional electronics
equipment used in manufacturing and supported by curriculum revision. As a
result of the additional equipment, students study a fully automated Surface
Mount Technology (SMT) assembly process. The process can simulate almost any
automated assembly or test requirement. Electronics Engineering Technology (EET)
and CIM students at Valencia will, as a result of the additional equipment, be
more independent in their critical thinking and decision-making in electronics
engineering. Pre-engineering students on a professional career track will be
able to enroll in courses that will teach the application of sophisticated
instrumentation that will assist them in performing applied research and expand
their vision for design potential, manufacturing potential and quality
potential.
