A new era is emerging, namely, that of "smart materials", ie., materials that
have the ability to "direct" the growth of biological tissue around them in a
way to strengthen the tissue-implant interface. This proposal suggests a novel
approach involving implanting sensors and sensing materials into an artificial
hip which can respond to stimuli and invoke bone growth as is needed to support
the prosthesis. If successful, this type of research could revolutionize
manufacturing of prosthetic devices and other tissue-material interfaces.
