9417292 Sloan Lander University requests support from NSF for connection of its
campus network to SunBelt Net. SunBelt Net is one of the midlevel networks
located in the state of South Carolina. It will provide operations management
and information services and it will give Lander University connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The university needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
