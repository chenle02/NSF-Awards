9725371 Miller The basin and range province of western North America, is
produced by major coastal extension in which generally E-dipping historic
faulting rotates crustal blocks with a top to the west reuse of motion. Miller
and Dumitru in the proposal not that there is an increase in fault block
rotation and in faulting complexity from west to east. They have also found
evidence that this faulting youngs from east to west toward the relatively large
and stable Sierra Nevada crustal block. However, the timing and mechanisms by
which the Sierra Nevada block is being eroded is not well known. This study will
use fission track data and detailed mapping to determine the timing and
magnitude of exhumation by fault slip, and to help constrain pre-and syn-
extensional temperatures and geothermal gradients within the crust. The results
of this study will address the fundamental question of how crust extends and to
what extent temperature or thermal structure of the crust controls the
distribution of faults or their displacements.
