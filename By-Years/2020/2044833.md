Understanding the solutions of polynomial equations is a fundamental problem
with applications throughout the basic sciences. Over the most familiar number
systems—real numbers and complex numbers—one can think of these solutions sets
geometrically via Cartesian coordinates. It is important for various reasons to
also consider polynomial equations over more exotic number systems. For example,
computer data and arithmetic are built on a system of two numbers (zero and
one). The main research goal of this project is to develop new tools to study
the small-scale behavior of systems of polynomial equations, both over familiar
number systems (of characteristic zero) and over more exotic number systems (of
positive or mixed characteristic). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI
aims to extend aspects of the theory of differential operators for smooth
varieties of characteristic zero, such as holonomicity and Bernstein-Sato
theory, to singular varieties in characteristic zero and positive
characteristic. The PI will also apply Buium and Joyal's notion of p-derivation
to the study of singularities in mixed characteristic. The main educational
goals of this project are to increase participation in mathematics by high
school students and members of the growing Hispanic community in Nebraska, to
foster international academic relationships among graduate students,
particularly between the United States and Mexico, to create connections between
traditionally different areas of mathematics themed around emerging problems,
and to train graduate students, both directly and more broadly through
dissemination of pedagogical materials. These will be pursued in a range of
activities, including the formation of a high school math circle, cross-topical
graduate workshops, and visits from senior and junior mathematicians from Latin
America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
