Intellectual merit: The US National Congress of Computational Mechanics has
become a premier conference in the field of Computational Science and
Engineering, not only in the USA but also internationally. It encompasses a
broad range of disciplines and has evolved into a confluence of
multidisciplinary ideas. For students and post-doctoral researchers, this is an
ideal platform for exposure to the state of the art developments in a broad
range of fields. The conference provides an excellent platform for younger
researchers to showcase their ideas and research progress, to experts in various
fields and gain instant recognition.

Broader impact: Students and post-doctoral researchers will participate through
presentations in technical sessions and poster sessions. Furthermore, panel
discussions are planned with experts from industry, academia and government (Air
Force, Army, Navy and DOE labs) to provide future directions. The organizing
committee will try to encourage underrepresented minority and women students to
participate in this congress by awarding travel scholarships.
