The proposed scope of work for the next 4 years is focused primarily
on&lt;br/&gt;better defining the role and organization of a future fully
developed CIDER&lt;br/&gt;Institute (Cooperative Institute for Deep Earth
Research) (see&lt;br/&gt;http://www.deep-earth.org/ for further
details).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following on the successful CIDER summer program
held at the Kavli Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara,
CA from July 13 to August 6, 2004,&lt;br/&gt;the institute will hold three CIDER
summer programs, in 2006, 2007 &lt;br/&gt;and 2008 respectively. Each program
will last 3 weeks and comprise &lt;br/&gt;overlapping "tutorial"
and&lt;br/&gt;"research workshop" parts. The tutorial part will involve 30
graduate students&lt;br/&gt; and post-doc's, who will stay for the whole
duration of the program, and 10&lt;br/&gt;instructors, who may stay for 2 or 3
weeks. The research workshop part will&lt;br/&gt;also involve about 15 more
senior participants. Each summer program will be&lt;br/&gt;organized around a
specific interdisciplinary theme and will be held at or&lt;br/&gt;close to an
academic institution. The 2006 program will be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Kavli
Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) in Santa Barbara, CA, on
the&lt;br/&gt;theme: "Constraints on the fluxes of mass, heat and chemicals in
the &lt;br/&gt;mantle, with a&lt;br/&gt;particular focus on the upper mantle and
transition zone". Location and&lt;br/&gt;themes for the subsequent two workshops
will be determined in coordination&lt;br/&gt;with the CIDER Steering Committee.
