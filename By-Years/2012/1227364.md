There is a growing interest among policy makers and education researchers in the
effectiveness of incentive payments as a means for improving educational
outcomes. Over the last decade, various field experiments were implemented in
the U.S. and in other countries to evaluate the impact of incentives provided to
students and/or to teachers based on student test score performance.

The effects of incentive programs have usually been found to be modest,
regardless of whether the student or teacher receives the incentive. The Behrman
et. al. (2011) study is an exception. That study analyzes a three-year field
experiment conducted by the Mexican Ministry of Education in 88 Federal high
schools. The experiment found no statistically significant effects of offering
incentive payments to the teachers alone, but large and statistically
significant effects of offering incentives only to students and a still larger
effect of offering the payments to both the students and teachers.

A question in implementing any incentive system is how to optimally design the
system, whether it is optimal to reward teachers, students or both and by how
much. A limitation of field experiments is that they are only informative about
the effects of incentive schemes implemented and not about alternative designs.
A key question raised by the Mexican experiment, for example, is why teacher
incentives were only effective in combination with student incentives, whereas
student incentives were also effective on their own.

This research develops and implements a framework for studying the mechanisms
underlying the experimental effects and for analyzing alternative incentive
designs. To this end, the project develops a model of student achievement in
which students and teachers make effort decisions that affect learning outcomes.
These choices, along with other teacher and student characteristics, jointly
determine test score outcomes. The model can explain the pattern of incentive
effects found in the Mexican program.
