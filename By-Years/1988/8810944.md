The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Hans Frauenfelder of the University of Illinois and Dr. Lajos Keszthelyi of
the Biological Research Center, Szeged, is to study the influence of electric
fields on protein functions and the generation of electric signals during
protein action. Efforts will address proteins that emit measurable signals after
light absorption, specifically membrane-bound retinal proteins and the water
soluble protein myoglobin. Results of the joint research should contribute to
our general understanding of the electric phenomena of living cells. Specific
contributions are expected in basic knowledge of protein kinetics and changes
due to external electric fields as well as the dynamics of proteins, through
determination and classification of functionally important motions. This project
in biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge
by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
