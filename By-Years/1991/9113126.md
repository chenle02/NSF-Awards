South Carolina State College requests support from NSF for connection of their
campus network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give South Carolina State College a 56 thousand
bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
per second) National Backbone network. The University needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
