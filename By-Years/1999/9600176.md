9600176 Covault This proposal intends to create the first step in making a
ground-based air Cherenkov detector for astrophysical gamma rays in the energy
interval from 20 to 200GeV. It intends to adapt and utilize a portion of the
very large solar and to install a receiving device (PMT's) in the existing solar
furnace tower. The educational project portion also seems attractive and
sensible. He will involve a graduate student and several undergraduates in the
research on what seems like a sensible time scale and at appropriate levels.
Additionally, there is a classroom/laboratory component to his proposal.
Building on the work of others (most notably Eric Mazur) he intends to introduce
the "rapid feedback" lecture method of Mazur's "Classtalk" into a course for
non- science students he will be teaching. This idea has been successful in
several places but would be new to Chicago. It requires some hardware,
installation and shakedown use but he has accounted for that (see below). He is
also proposing to introduce CCD "photography" methods into the Chicago advanced
undergraduate labs. Both of these projects seem valuable in advancing
instruction there and to be of manageable scope. The proposer has had experience
appropriate to this work from both a particle physics and astrophysics
perspective. He has worked in both astronomy and in particle astrophysics and
has been an active participant in the preliminary work for STACEE. ***
