This project, acquiring a high performance computing cluster, provides a
computing platform with substantial computational capability to faculty and
students to investigate several computationally complex problems. With the
objective to carry out computations that will solve equations that simulate and
model phenomena in nature, the facility aims to provide a simulation node for
visualization of data generated by experiments and parallel codes in the system.
Parallel programming techniques and message passing paradigm are employed to use
the computer as a flexible laboratory and research platform while solving the
problems associated with the given phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project brings into existence a platform for
high-performance computing to a historically black serving institution providing
a basis for high-end computational research as well as a laboratory for modeling
and simulation tha, coupled with data visualization, enables practical
instructional activities. Moreover, it enables training in parallel languages,
grid computing, and parallel algorithm design and contributes to educate other
faculty and students.&lt;br/&gt;
