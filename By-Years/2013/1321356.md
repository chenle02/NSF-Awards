The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated platform for
investigating small networks of dissociated neurons, based on monitoring their
electrical activity. The targeted platform is a multielectrode array (MEA) tool,
distinguished by very accurate patterning of neuronal networks using mechanical
and chemical methods. By virtue of its superior signal-to-noise ratio, this tool
will have transformative impact in all fields of cell-based sensors and
neuroscience by enabling repeatable and sensitive experiments. This tool can be
used for investigating the highly complex processes of learning and memory in a
systematic and simplified manner within cultured cells. It can be also used in
the pharmacological industry as a test bed for examining the influence of
pharmacological agents on neurons. Alternatively, it can be used as a cell-based
sensor, in which changes in electrical activity may be indicative of the
presence of neuroactive compounds. In this project, it will also be used as a
training tool in bioengineering labs and as a demonstration unit for a summer
program targeting middle school girls to increase the number of female
engineering students at Lehigh University.
