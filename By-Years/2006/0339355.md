This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop
numerical methods and corresponding computational tools for modeling the fluid-
particle flows in gas fluidization of multi-sized particles. This work involves
the combination of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to describe the continuum
flow of the fluid and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to describe the discrete
flow of the solid particles. The aims of this project are: 1) to develop and
validate at the particle level computer models that can satisfactorily describe
fluid-particle flows under different conditions; 2) to quantify fluid-particle
and particle-particle interactions and their effects on the fluid-particle flow
via detailed micro-dynamic analysis; 3) to apply the fundamental findings to
support the continuum modeling through typical case studies; and 4) to produce
high-performance, state-of-the-art software packages capable of simulating the
dynamics of the fluid-particle systems. Such simulations will be extremely
computationally intensive and it is therefore imperative to use the presently
most advanced computational technique, i.e. parallel computation. The parallel
computing algorithm with options of Serial, PVM or MPI to accommodate any types
of machines will be implemented in the fluid-particle solver to exploit the
unlimited power of parallel computers.

The potential outcomes of this project will be to provide a CFD model that can
reliably simulate the fluid-particle systems that occur often in chemical,
pharmaceutical and mineral industries, and to obtain a comprehensive
understanding of the fundamentals of fluid-particle flows that can lead to
improvement of the fluidization technology.
