This is a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award. The project will investigate
the relationships between socio-economic status, disease specific mortality, and
mortality decline. This will be accomplished through the comparison of
demographic variables between the Erie and Niagara County Poorhouses and their
respective general populations in western New York state. The data available
span nearly one hundred years, allowing for a complete study of mortality from
the time these institutions opened in the late 1820's until they ceased to
operate in the second decade of the twentieth century. This study will
contribute to the research on disease-specific mortality transition and
mortality decline by providing insight into a population (the institutionalized
poor), which has been largely overlooked in demographic studies. Also, the
historic poorhouse records of these two counties provide data to study mortality
prior to 1850. This is important because there are few state or nationwide data
available to study mortality during the early decades of the nineteenth century.
This research is also an important contribution to anthropological demography in
that it addresses the issue of socio-economic differences in patterns of disease
specific mortality and mortality decline.
