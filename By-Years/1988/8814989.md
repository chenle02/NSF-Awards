The proposed research is based on an object-oriented semantic association
model, which has been used in a prototype development of a distributed data
administration system for supporting the integrated manufacturing facility of
the National Bureau of Standards. This research aims to extend the model to
allow user-defined operations and knowledge rules, which model integrity and
security constraints, deductive rules, and domain specific expert rules, to be
defined in object classes and instances. Thus, knowledge rules associated with
objects are integrated with their data so that rules are readily available when
associated data are being processed. A high-level object-oriented knowledge
manipulation language will be developed. It allows the user to specify complex
semantic patterns as search contexts and to concentrate on the objects of their
interest without having to explicitly specify the traversal paths in queries. A
mechanism for applying relevant rule-based knowledge while processing a
transaction in a match-modify-execute cycle is proposed. The proposed functional
integration of database and reasoning components allows tailoring of techniques
such as query optimization, transaction management, integrity and security
control, and concurrency control for use in the knowledge base management system
environment.
