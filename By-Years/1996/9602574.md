9602574 Fausch This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Kurt Fausch, Colorado
State University and Dr. Colin Townsend, University of Otago, New Zealand. Dr.
Fausch requests funds for travel to New Zealand. The primary objective of this
project is to understand salmonid invasions worldwide. The tasks are to analyze
the characteristics and mechanisms of salmonid invasions, to test the
predictions based on invasion ecology theory and available data, and to develop
new models for predicting effects of specific introductions. This project is
important in the area of ecology and can lead to significant advances in our
understanding of salmonid invasions worldwide.
