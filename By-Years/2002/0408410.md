The overall goal of this project is to better understand, and eventually to be
able to predict, the thermodynamic and transport properties that ultimately
control complex geological processes involving crystalline, glassy and molten
silicate materials. The approach taken in the proposed research is to identify
important problems where critical details of short- to intermediate-range
structure are needed and can be elucidated by spectroscopy, make accurate
measurements in appropriately simplified systems, and determine the consequences
of the results for fundamental parameters such as configurational entropy, free
energy, component activities, diffusivity, and viscosity. The primary research
tool will continue to be solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which is
particularly useful for measuring the extent and nature of disorder and dynamics
in silicates and oxides. This research will be a critical part of the scientific
training of several Ph.D. students, and has close ties to other fields such as
materials science, physical chemistry, and the physics of disordered systems.
