Andreas Ortmann SBR-9511535 This proposal was submitted under the Career
Development Program. The research plan is to extend prior experimental work on
symmetric bargaining and coordination games. In particular, Dr. Ortmann will
study the effect of re-scaling, payoff perturbations, and pre-play communication
on the behavior of the experimental subjects in games in which the risk and
payoff dominant strategies differ. In previous work by the P.I. re-scaling of
the payoffs was found to have a substantial impact on subject behavior, even
though it does not alter either the risk dominant or payoff dominant strategies.
The goal of the educational plan is to make game theory and experimental
economics an integral part of the liberal arts curriculum. To do this Dr.
Ortmann proposes to alter the introductory principles and intermediate economic
theory courses and create a new interdisciplinary major in organizational
science.
