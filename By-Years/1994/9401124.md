9401124 Campbell This award provides support for an experimental, high-speed
network infrastructure that would interconnect parallel systems, large-capacity
secondary and tertiary storage devices, and muli-media workstations capable of
supporting high-quality digital audio and video. The network architecture is
based on a broadband ISDN backbone of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches
and fiber optics links. A high-bandwidth, gigabit/second HIPPI network would
interconnect an Intel Paragon distributed memory parallel system and a tertiary
storage system. The research spans three basic areas: system software
infrastructure for managing high-speed networks, data pre-fetching and staging
policies for high- latency, high-capacity secondary and tertiary data stores,
and information access and multimedia collaboration software.
