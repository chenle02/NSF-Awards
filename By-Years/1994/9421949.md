ABSTRACT CTS-9421949 G. Ruff An experimental investigation to evaluate the
momentum transport of non-evaporating solid spheres in a turbulent flow will be
undertaken. A test Facility will produce a quasi-homogeneous turbulent field.
The mean and fluctuating velocities, as well as the temporal and spatial
integral scale of turbulence, will be measured. The drag force on a solid sphere
suspended in the turbulent field will be determined, and the expression for the
drag coefficient within a broader turbulence length scale-particle Reynolds
number domain will be obtained. The work has relevance for modeling, with
applications in various areas such as chemical and materials processing, solids
transport, and fuel sprays. ***
