9351962 Smith A pontoon barge is used for vibracoring and other shallow-water
sampling in an integrated program of field- and laboratory- based instruction
and undergraduate research in geology. It is used in the introductory-level
courses of Introductory Geology, Introductory Oceanography, and Environmental
Science; in the upper level courses of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy,
Invertebrate Paleontology, Glacial and Quaternary Geology, Hydrogeology, Seminar
in Environmental Geology, and Seminar on Tropical Carbonate Geology; for
approximately two undergraduate research projects each year; and for the
Lawrence Summerscience Program, a two-week intensive program for high-school
juniors. Currently, most of the hands-on activities already incorporated into
courses are also the subjects of independent undergraduate research. The program
is an example of how field and laboratory-based instruction and undergraduate
research can be integrated, focused on the study of local Quaternary geology,
and implemented using relatively inexpensive and versatile equipment. ***
