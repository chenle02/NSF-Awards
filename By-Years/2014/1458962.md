This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program focuses on
engineering and technology projects related to mitigating global climate change,
and is a collaboration between the University of North Dakota (UND), California
State Polytechnic University at Pomona (CPP), and the Energy Research Institute
(ERI) at the University of Leeds, UK. The student research projects will
include: novel methods to extract, recover, and process the constituents of
algae and biomass-derived oils for use as renewable fuels, replacements for
fossil-derived commodity chemicals, and other high value specialty chemicals;
fundamental studies of solar energy absorption by nanoparticles to improve solar
energy systems; integrating biomass pyrolysis/electrical generation systems;
identifying ways to remove barriers for a more sustainable civilian aviation
industry; and studying ways to accelerate the adoption of district energy
technologies for the supply of heating and cooling in both the US and Europe.
The research will leverage an ongoing partnership between UND and CPP by adding
collaborators at a leading UK research institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through
this award, undergraduate and graduate student investigators will work on key
components of ongoing research efforts aimed at developing technologies that
help to mitigate the overall emission of fossil-derived carbon, primarily from
the supply and use of energy resources, upon the atmosphere. An annual cohort of
five students will participate in a year-long program, and a nine week research
experience at Leeds will form the core of the program. The topic theme is
designed to provide a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary projects that will
enrich the student experience. Participants will be drawn from UND (a research
university) and CPP (a nondoctoral Hispanic serving university) that have a
strong partnership with multiple pathways to encourage CPP students to consider
research as a future career path.
