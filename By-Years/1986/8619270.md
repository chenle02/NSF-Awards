This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of heterogeneous catalysis. The principal investigator will deposit
palladium monolayers and multilayer thin films on single crystal tantalum
surfaces and study the altered surface chemical properties of these overlayers.
The work will focus on correlating changes in adsorption/desorption kinetics,
chemisorption bond strength and reactivity with geometric and electronic
structure of the palladium overlayer. Critical data will be obtained by high
resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and ion scattering spectrometry.
These fundamental studies are expected to produce new chemical insight into the
design of materials with new and unique surface properties and to aid the atomic
level explanation of the selectivity of alloy and bimetallic cluster catalysts
which are important in the petroleum industry.
