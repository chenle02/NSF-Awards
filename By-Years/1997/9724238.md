9724238 April This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
Program, provides $101,287 as one-half support of the costs of acquiring an
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) for the Geology Department at Colgate
University for both major and trace element analyses of geologic samples. The
new XRF will replace an antiquated (vintage 1977) XRF and will provide state-of-
the-art analytical service for both departmental faculty and undergraduate
students involved in collaborative research projects including studies of the
biogeochemistry of forest soils, sedimentary and metamorphic petrology and
fluid/rock interactions. ***
