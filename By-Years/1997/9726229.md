9726229 Manson This senior PI has enjoyed a long-standing support for
theoretical research on scattering of atoms from surfaces and adsorbates. He has
developed a formalism to study an important aspect of inelastic scattering,
namely one which involves creation of several lattice phonons of the target. In
this grant he is planning to extend this formalism to include the presence of an
adsorbate, and in particular complex multi atom objects, e.g. hydrocarbons. He
is planning to study the role of the adsorbate internal degrees of freedom in
inelastic atom-surface scattering. There are in addition several associated
projects of fundamental importance. One considers the development of surface
sticking in both quantum and classical regimes and which leads to considerations
of energy accommodation coefficients and lift and drag coefficients . In another
project, the PI plans to consider the scattering of a metastable Helium atom.
This work will involve collaboration with experimental groups at the Florida
State University, the University of North Carolina and the Max Planck Institute
at Gottingen. %%% This renewal grant to a senior PI is in support of theoretical
work on scattering of atoms from surfaces, especially aspects of energy loss
during scattering. This grant includes study of the role of atoms and molecules
present at the surface, especially as the energy is shared between the internal
vibrations and oscillations of these atoms (or molecules) and the heating of the
target. He will also consider the characteristics of scattering of highly
excited projectiles and the associated questions about sticking and energy loss.
