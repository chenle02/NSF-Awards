Project Overview

This is an interdisciplinary conference to promote an exchange of ideas with the
hope of initiating collaborative efforts between young researchers in psychology
and philosophy. The topic of the conference is cognitive penetration of
perception; that is to say, participants will discuss whether perception is
primarily input-driven, or whether cognitive states such as beliefs, moods,
fears, expectations, emotions, desires, can influence the content or character
of perception. Perception is widely researched in experimental psychology,
widely discussed in philosophy of mind, and a constant part of our everyday
experience.

Intellectual Merit

The primary aim of the conference is to bring together the different
perspectives indicated above on theorizing about perception, and to address the
implications of different theoretical positions on the topic of cognitive
penetration for epistemology and theories of perception more generally.
Theorizing about the epistemic impacts of cognitive penetration and related
psychological phenomena has only begun to take hold in recent years, and could
benefit immensely from increased interdisciplinary discussion that serves to
integrate psychological research with theorizing in philosophy of mind.

Broader Impacts

Both the psychological and the epistemological issues related to cognitive
penetration have recently taken a strong hold in philosophy, with a host of new
work by graduate students and young researchers. This conference will serve to
deepen discussion of the issue, and to widen the range of experiments analyzed
by philosophers. It may also encourage the dissolution of the boundaries between
academic disciplines, and explore the impact that this line of research and
theorizing has for understanding our experience of the world. The conference is
open to all, and is expected to draw attendance from across a number of academic
areas, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and literature; it will
thereby broaden thinking on fundamental questions about how the mind works.
