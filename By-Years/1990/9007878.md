Dr. Wagner plans to develop and improve NMR methods to characterize protein
structures at the highest accuracy and focus on aspects of protein structure
where NMR can provide information complementary to x-ray crystal structure
analysis. In particular, he hopes to develop methods to characterize better the
surface conformations of proteins, since these are relevant for many aspects of
protein functions such as protein target recognition. He hopes to work out
better procedures to judge the quality of NMR structures. He will determine, as
far as possible, how the parameters of mobility obtained through his studies can
be associated with specific components of the protein, and try to obtain as
complete a description of static and dynamic characteristics of the protein as
possible.
