The goal of this research is to better understand the basic physical processes
associated with tropical cyclone formation, structure, and intensity change. The
research will combine theoretical and observational studies. Research on
tropical cyclones is difficult because the storms form and evolve over tropical
oceans, notorious data sparse regions. Dr. Gray is unique in his approach,
relying principally on compositing data from a number of cases as a means of
overcoming the problems of insufficient observations. While this technique has
its drawbacks, the research nonetheless has produced some interesting insights
into the behavior of tropical storms and his results have proved stimulating to
the community. Dr. Gray is recognized as a leader in tropical cyclone research.
