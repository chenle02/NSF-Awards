9450513 Ferguson This project seeks funds to support a science education forum
entitled "Scientists, Educators, and National Standards: Action at the Local
Level." The form is to address the understanding of national standards and the
issue of how scientists from universities, government and other agencies can
contribute to the success of the standards and the proposed science reform.
Efforts are to be made to determine how scientists and engineers might best help
to improve science education in their local schools. The building of
partnerships between scientists, engineers and K-12 teachers will be a major
thrust of this forum.
