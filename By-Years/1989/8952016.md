The laboratories in introductory level biology courses will be improved by the
acquisition of student microscopes and a video system. The microscopes will have
time-saving features such as built-in illumination and a mechanical stage, which
will allow students more time in studying the material. The video system will be
used to project images, allowing all students to observe a specimen at the same
time. Video recordings of successful demonstrations can be viewed repeatedly and
can be used during laboratory examinations. This should decrease frustration of
introductory level students and improve their knowledge of biological structures
and processes. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
