This award will provide financial support for US participants in the conference
"Mathematical Physics at the Crossings" to be held at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, VA, May 20-24, 2019.
The conference focuses on recent developments in many-body quantum systems.
These systems are of high relevance for the realization of the goals of the
Quantum Leap initiative. The meeting will add momentum to the process of
developing mathematical knowledge about the many-body quantum systems,
potentially facilitating building quantum devices for medical, navigational,
computational or other practical purposes. This award will give US-based
students, early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and
researchers without other sources of support an opportunity to attend and
participate in the conference. Information about the conference can be found at:

The international conference "Mathematical Physics at the Crossings" will gather
researchers in mathematical physics, quantum information, and physics to discuss
topics of current research regarding many-body quantum systems. The topics
covered include adiabatic approximation with a focus on many-body quantum
systems, many-body localization problems, molecular dynamics, and periodically
driven quantum systems. Study of properties of interacting many-body quantum
systems is one of the central problems in today condensed matter physics, and
the available mathematical knowledge about this problem is minimal. The topic is
also of significant interest for scholars working in areas of quantum
information and quantum computation. This conference will bring together experts
in the field and will expose graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to
the latest research in this area.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
