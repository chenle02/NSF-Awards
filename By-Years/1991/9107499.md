The primary objective of this US-Hungary Cooperative Science Research Project
between Dr. David Schramm of the University of Chicago and Dr. Alex Szalay of
Eotos University, Budapest is to continue the collaboration of US and Hungarian
researchers working on problems in cosmology and high energy astrophysics. The
observational and theoretical research relates to the formation and the
statistical description of the structure of the universe and will be applied to
problems in many areas such as Biased Galaxy Formation, Fluctuation Spectrum;
Pencilbeam Redshift Surveys; Higher Order Correlations and Clusters of Galaxies;
Particle Physics and Early Universe; and Gamma Ray Bursters and Gamma Ray
Background. The results may provide information on new observations and by
extraction from existing unique data. Methodology may be extended by the effort
to develop models in which a structure such as a supercluster can be formed from
first principles. This project in cosmology fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
