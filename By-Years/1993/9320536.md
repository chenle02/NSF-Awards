9320536 Hill This project is on research to determine the properties of one
lipase, or a mixture of lipases, immobilized on various supports, including
hollow fibers. This involves experimental studies of the rates at which
immobilized lipases bring about change in the compositions of fats and oils via
hydrolysis reactions which produce fatty acids and lower glycerides, or via
interesterification reactions which involve an initial hydrolysis step followed
by esterification. The experimental data will be used to develop models of the
enzyme reactors which can be used for process design and optimization. This
research has potential significance for the food industry. ***
