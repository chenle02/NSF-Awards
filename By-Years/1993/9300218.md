This project seeks to develop comprehensive dynamic and thermal models for high
speed spindle systems. The study addresses the dynamic characteristics of high
speed spindle-bearing systems during operation, including the effects of bearing
initial set-up and geometry, initial preloads, thermal load, external cutting
force, rotational speed, and bearing spacing, and attempts to develop models to
predict dynamic compliance and thermal stability. In addition, advanced bearing
designs and materials will be tested and analyzed, and their performance will be
evaluated in comparison with conventional bearings. As a final outcome of the
project, a computer aided analysis system for high speed spindles will be
developed. This analysis package will provide prediction of spindle-bearing
dynamic characteristics, bearing contact loads and temperature rise, which can
lead to optimal design and operation of high speed spindles. Successful analysis
and design of high speed spindles will enable easier implementation of high
speed machining. Spindle failure is currently a significant problem in high
speed machining practice.
