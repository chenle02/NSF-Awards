This Phase I SBIR award provides funds to construct solid state beta-ray
detectors for use in capillary electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is one of the
most important and widely used analytical techniques for the separation and
identification of biological molecules. Recently, there has been a significant
advance in electrophoresis technology through the use of gel geometries
involving thin capillary tubes. This technology has been developed into a new
separation technique, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and is particularly
appropriate for the separation of low abundance materials. This technique
provides much greater resolution than traditional electrophoresis techniques and
can achieve separations of complex mixtures as much as an order of magnitude
faster. The CZE technology is currently of very high interest since it appears
to make possible the development of new, high speed instrumentation for
analytical biochemistry. However, in order to make full use of this new,
powerful separation technique, several aspects of the technology require further
development. This project addresses the particular need for a nuclear detection
system which will allow CZE to be used effectively for the more common
separation experiments carried out in molecular biology laboratories.
