The Florida International University has been awarded a grant to develop
computational tools to help predict protein - protein interactions. Proteins
interact with other proteins either in pairs or as components of larger
complexes in many cellular processes, including metabolism, endocrine and
exocrine, signaling, synthesis, and transport. A systematic identification,
characterization and understanding of protein-protein interactions will provide
an essential knowledge base, and link proteome dynamics and architecture to
cellular function and phenotype. One of the most important applications of
analyzed PPI data is to predict functional annotation for uncharacterized
proteins. Uncharacterized proteins (also called unannotated proteins) refer to
proteins for which we do not know their functions. Functional annotation of
proteins is a fundamental problem in the post-genomic era. However, currently
available computational tools for functional annotation using PPI need to be
improved.

To help solve this problem this project will developing advanced clustering
methods for analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and will develop
computational methods for integrating gene expression profiles and protein-
protein interaction data which will improve the robustness and accuracy of
predicting protein interaction modules. The project will Investigate and develop
methods for evaluating the reliability of PPI data; Investigate and develop
effective methods for combining multiple, diverse and independent clustering
results to improve the quality and robustness of identification; and Investigate
and develop methods for integration of protein interaction data and gene
expression profiles. This project will facilitate the development of novel
educational tools and will involve both undergraduate and graduate students.
Moreover, Florida International University (FIU) is among the top awarders of
degrees to Hispanic students in US and this project will build on this strong
history by promoting the participation of underrepresented groups in its
research efforts.
