Jameson/Abstract The objective of this research is to seek additional evidence
about the spatial and temporal distribution of cloud drops and raindrops.
Existing practice assumes that Poisson statistics describe such distributions
but recent results contradict this assumption. Additional observations from
previous flights of research aircraft will be investigated along with
measurements from disdrometers.
