Emerging cybersecurity challenges require groundbreaking solutions that employ
technologies like the internet-of-things and artificial intelligence. It is
therefore vital to equip students with the computer science skills necessary to
pursue careers in these fields. The University of Texas El Paso aims to address
this issue by engaging middle and high school instructors in a 6-week immersive
summer research program focused on high priority and emerging cybersecurity
topics. The site will recruit 10 educators from the primarily Hispanic-serving
Independent School Districts of El Paso in an effort to broaden participation
and build long-term partnerships between teachers, faculty mentors, and industry
advisors in the bi-national metropolis. Through these collaborations, educators
will return to their classrooms with deeper cybersecurity content knowledge and
curricular modules to inspire their students towards computing, data science,
cybersecurity, and problem solving.

This RET Site at the University of Texas El Paso will engage Middle and High
Schools STEM teachers from El Paso County in cybersecurity and data science
research. The main objectives of the RET Site are to: (1) strategically recruit
middle and high school teachers and offer high-quality research experience on
both technical and ethical aspects of computer science with special focus on
cybersecurity and data science; (2) provide continuous collaborative support to
develop curricular training modules for delivering to middle and high school
students; (3) enable training the trainers/mentors to efficiently engage the RET
participants in their research; (4) offer authentic research experience through
6-weeks of summer institute; (5) Disseminate and promote Siteâ€™s results to local
and national educators.
