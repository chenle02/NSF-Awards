This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California - Riverside will acquire
an amplified femtosecond laser system with broad wavelength coverage -- from the
ultraviolet (270 nm) to the near infrared (2.6 micron). The laser system will be
used by researchers at Riverside to study the time-resolved spectroscopy of
interesting chemical and materials systems. Some the topics to be studied
include: (1) the time-resolved spectroscopy of neutral radical conductors; (2)
the charge dynamics in nanostructured semiconductors; (3) the properties of
molecular materials under high pressure; (4) the diffusion and reactivity of hot
adsorbates on metal surfaces and (5) exciton dynamics in organic semiconductors.
The laser system will be used by large numbers of undergraduate and graduate
students, both in instructional settings as well as in research. Significant
numbers of the student users at this Hispanic Serving Institution are members of
groups traditionally underrepresented in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultrafast laser systems, like the one purchased
under this award, allow chemists to probe the dynamics of chemical and physical
processes at precisely the time scales for important chemical and physical
processes -- from the making and breaking of chemical bonds, to the vibrations
of individual atoms and the relaxation of excited electrons. The ability of
chemists to observe these processes allows them to develop a better
understanding of how molecules and materials work. This kind of knowledge can be
used to make new or better materials or devices.
