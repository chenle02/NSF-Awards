This research develops an elastic constitutive model for the mechanical behavior
of soft plant tissue and verifies the predictive relationships with experiments.
The experiments are specifically designed to measure the cell turgor pressure
and the mechanical response of the tissue. The findings from this research will
provide a theoretical basis for inferring cell mechanical properties from gross
tissue properties. The results will help to upgrade the state-of-the-art
understanding of the mechanics of soft tissues and food losses associated with
packaging and transport.
