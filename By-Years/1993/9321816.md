Wieman This proposal provides partial support for the Fourteenth International
Conference on Atomic Physics (ICAP XIV) to be held July 31-August 5, 1994, on
the campus of the University of Colorado. This biennial series is firmly
established as the principal international forum for the presentation and
discussion of fundamental advances in atomic physics. It is the only
international meeting devoted to the full range of activity in atomic physics.
The conference program will be built around a series of invited papers by
scientists responsible for the most significant recent developments. Other
speakers will present overviews of selected subfields, or will discuss
interdisciplinary and technological impacts and opportunities. Two large poster
sessions will provide the format for one-on-one scientific discussions.
