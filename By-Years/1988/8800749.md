This project will collect sediment cores from two permanently stratified lakes
in the eastern Canadian Arctic that are likely to contain varved (annually
laminated) sediments: Ogac Lake in southern Baffin Island and Tessiarsuk Lake in
northern Labrador. Multiple cores from each lake will be collected and cross-
correlated using dendrochronological methods to minimize between- core errors in
measurement of varve thickness and composition. The resulting new high-
resolution varve chronologies could significantly improve the temporal precision
with which correlations can be made among widely separated lakes. Time series of
varve thickness and composition will be examined to assess their potential as
paleoclimatic sensors. New temperature- stressed and possibly moisture-stressed
three-ring chronologies will be developed from trees within the Tessiarsuk
watershed. Time series of tree-ring data will be examined to see if they can be
calibrated against time series of varve data.
