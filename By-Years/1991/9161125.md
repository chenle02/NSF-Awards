The primary objective of the research is to describe a methodology for
developing an interactive multimedia environment that motivates young students
to pursue paths of learning in science and mathematics. A varied assortment of
technologies and instructional techniques will be employed to create engaging
learning environment that intuitively illustrates the meaning and significance
of complex scientific principles and mathematical relationships. An emphasis
will be placed on constructing an environment that is sensitive to the needs of
under-represented groups in the sciences.
