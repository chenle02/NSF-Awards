The Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics & Biomechanics (CHABA) is a standing
committee of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences,
which is supported by contributions from several federal agencies. It provides
analysis and advice to those sponsoring agencies, on issues involving the
audition and speech, including questions of physiological and physical
acoustics, neurophysiology, psychophysics, perception, engineering and
equipment, hearing aids, speech comprehension, and environmental effects on
hearing. The committee of twelve members helps select and define activities of
several working groups dealing with specific topics of concern to the sponsors.
Results of this work are published in reports available to scientists, the
public, and to industry, and have impact on many areas of auditory science.
