9523078 Yee This project is to advance the development of fracture-resistant
engineering plastics and polymer-matrix composite materials. It will develop
fundamental knowledge in the science of toughening, and will provide guidance to
the polymer industry in product development and safety. Shear-yielding
toughening via rubber particles and micro-cracking/crazing/bridging toughening
via thermoplastic particles are the two most important toughening methods used
to improve material performance. A fundamental connection between these two
mechanisms is the intrinsic stress state dependent deformation of polymers.
Identification of the stress state near the reinforcing particles and
characterizing the deformation of the matrix in this stress state are critical
issues. These issues can only be resolved through experimental studies of the
polymer deformations and quantitative analyses of the details of the toughening
mechanisms. ***
