This grant will support continued research at the University of California,
Santa Barbara into a quantum theory of gravity and its application to cosmology.
James Hartle will investigate the principles which determine the quantum state
of the universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics necessary to
understand it. Gary Horowitz will investigate the gravitational aspects of
string theory, a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. Don Marolf
will explore interacting quantum matter around black holes and in cosmology.

This work in centered in the ongoing quest of physics for a unified theory of
nature's fundamental forces and the origin of the universe. These are subjects
not only of great interest to scientists but also the general public. By
engaging the interest of students and the public, the principal investigators
hope to encourage general appreciation for science. In addition, the project
will develop human resources for science and technology by training graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars in advanced techniques.
