In the last twenty years, largely due to the increased application of
computational methods, the ocean has become understandable through means other
than observation and experimentation. Now numerical analysis permits observation
of classic analytic behaviors on the scale of an ocean. %%% The purpose of this
research is to develop dynamic, physical, and graphic laboratory models of large
scale ocean and/or atmospheric circulation; presenting data in a more accessible
manner. This will ultimately benefit ocean exploration and future possibilities
of underwater habitation.
