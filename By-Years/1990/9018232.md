Most of the water used by the developing fetus comes from the mother and
appears to be regulated by the mother. However, fetus may have available to it a
way to regulate its own fluid volume. Recently, the heart of the fetus has been
shown to contain a substance-atrial natriuretic peptide that, when secreted into
the blood, apppears to alter the blood volume of the fetus. The ability of the
fetus to increase its plasma ANP concentration in response to volume expansion
may be a mechanism used and controlled by the fetus to eliminate any excess
fluid received from the mother. The purpose of this proposal is to determine how
ANP interacts with other developing systems in the fetus to maintain its fluid
volume within normal limits.//
