This award provides support for the meeting "Sensitivity, Error and Uncertainty
Quantification for Atomic, Plasma &amp; Material Data" to be held at Stony Brook
University, November 7-9, 2015. The meeting will bring together computational
physicists, chemists, mathematicians and computational scientists to understand
and develop the tools of uncertainty quantification applied to theory and
simulation relevant to systems ranging from materials processing to
astrophysical plasmas. The modeling in these systems is critically dependent on
data validation, verification, uncertainty analysis and quantification. This
meeting represents an opportunity to exploit advances in the science of
uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding in these systems.
