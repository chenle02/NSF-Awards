This award will provide partial travel support for eight key participants to the
International Symposium on Power System Stability to be held in Ames, Iowa on
May 13-15, 1985. The symposium will focus on possible techniques by which power
system stability analysis may be carried out in a rapid, accurate, and efficient
manner. The symposium brings together an international group of experts on power
system stability and should be useful in identifying those techniques which hold
the most promise for treating the complex stability problems introduced by the
very large interconnected power networks which are characteristic of the utility
industry today and in the future.
