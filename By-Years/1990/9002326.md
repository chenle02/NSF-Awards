Relations between forest canopy geometry, local physiological characteristics,
and whole-canopy gas-exchange will be examined. The goal is understand links
between individual- plant and whole-canopy physiological processes. Focus will
be on effects of vertical position on plant physiological processes, to provide
input values for a higher-order closure model of turbulent exchange at vegetated
surfaces. The extent to which 1) canopy position can be used to predict local
physiological properties and 2) canopy geometry can be used to predict canopy-
level gas exchange will be examined. It is hypothesized that 1) radiation flux
is a good predictor of leaf-level gas-exchange within relatively closed
canopies, and 2) leaf-level physiology can be predicted by spatial position
using a simple structural model. To test these hypotheses and to provide model
input parameters. 1) gas-exchange characteristics as a function of vertical
position will be sampled and 2) canopy radiation flux/geometry maps using
photographic techniques will be constructed. The canopy-level gas-exchange model
will be validated using eddy correlation. This research will be conducted in
close collaboration with research groups at the University of California at
Davis and the New Zealand Forest Research Institute. Field techniques will be
tested in an orchard and detailed field studies will be conducted in two well-
studied natural forests.
