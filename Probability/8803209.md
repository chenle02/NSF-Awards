The principal investigator will continue to exploit the representation of a
sequence of independent identically distributed random variables as the sequence
of the quantile function observed at independent identically distributed uniform
variables. The quantile function is the left continuous inverse of the
distribution function. This representation provides a strong connection between
the partial sums of random variables and the empirical process. The principal
investigator, along with a number of collaborators, has used this technique over
last several years to get many interesting results. Specific problems of study
include the Kiefer process version of the weighted approximations, convergence
of Bahadur-Kiefer type process, convergence of weighted sums of order
statistics, and iterated logarithm laws for the sums of extreme values.
