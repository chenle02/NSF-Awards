AST 9530590 Interstellar Matter and Magnetic Fields. In interstellar space the
magnetic energy density is usually comparable to the turbulent energy density so
that the field plays a very strong role in all physical processes. However,
measurements of the magnetic field strength are very difficult because they are
subject to contamination by instrumental effects, and the required sensitivity
is high. Accordingly our knowledge of magnetic fields is limited by the
observational data base. With this award Dr. Heiles will vigorously expand the
data base on interstellar magnetic fields with observations of Zeeman splitting
of atomic hydrogen, the hydroxyl radical, and radio recombination lines. He will
also pursue morphological and kinematic studies of the diffuse interstellar
medium in our Galaxy. ===============================================
