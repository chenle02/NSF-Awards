AEROCE is a multi-disciplinary atmospheric and marine chemistry research
program centered in the North Atlantic region. The program objectives include
understanding the chemical climatology over the North Atlantic Ocean using
observations of ozone, chemical tracers and other substances; estimating the
export of combustion sulfur and nitrogen from North America; and understanding
the impact of atmospheric deposition on chemical cycles. The primary objective
of this proposal is to understand the role of meteorological factors in the
observed chemical variability. The P.I. will prepare and analyze numerous
meteorological products, including isentropic air mass trajectories back in time
from the four AEROCE stations, analysis of radiosonde ascents from nearby
official observing stations, and compilations and analyses stations in source
areas and will synthesize these meteorological results with the chemical
observations, calculating and analysing the main transport paths and their
seasonal variation for each site.
