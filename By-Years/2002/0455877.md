The project is a five-year study centering on the need for schools to develop
and sustain technology-rich, school-based professional development activities
rather than rely on university-based professional development. It addresses two
major challenges of implementing innovative professional development:
a)transitioning professional development to schools and b)assessing its effects
on teacher and student learning. It is common for research-based and technology
-rich curricula to be introduced to teachers through university-based
professional development programs, but its transition to schools requires
careful planning, monitoring and support from the university at the initial
stages. This program provides a detailed research plan to build on a university-
based mentor model to design school-based approaches.
