Hake, Sarah 0445387 The function of KNOX proteins in shoot development

Plant growth is determined by small groups of cells called meristems. Meristems
produce the leaves, branches and flowers of the plant. Knotted1-like homeobox
(knox) genes are expressed in meristems and stems and are required for meristem
function and leaf patterning. KNOX proteins are also sufficient for meristematic
identity and are able to confer meristem fate on leaves if expressed
inappropriately. KNOX proteins are members of the TALE class of transcription
factors that are conserved in animals and plants. They function as biochemical
partners with BEL1-like (BELL) proteins to bind DNA and thus regulate
transcription. There are eight KNOX proteins and 13 BELL proteins in
Arabidopsis. The proposed research will determining which KNOX protein interacts
with which BELL protein and in what cell compartment and in what tissue. These
experiments will be carried out in Arabidopsis. Biochemical experiments will
also determine what genes are regulated by KNOX proteins in maize and rice by
identifying the DNA which is bound by KNOX proteins and following transcription
profiles. The third aim is to determine what are the regulatory sequences that
keep knox genes from being expressed in leaves. A number of dominant mutants
exist in maize that misexpress knox genes in leaves. Similar mutations are found
in barley and snapdragon. These mutations all have rearrangements in intronic
sequences, the part of the gene that does not code for protein. Molecular
genetic experiments will determine what are the important sequences that keep
knox genes from being expressed in leaves. The information gained from these
experiments will provide an understanding of plant architecture and lead to
improved crop yields. During the summer, a high school chemistry teacher from
San Francisco will join the graduate students on the project to participate in
the biochemistry experiments. In addition, the PI will bring genetics to the 7th
grade of a rural middle school each spring to look at genetic ratios segregating
on maize ears and isolate DNA.
