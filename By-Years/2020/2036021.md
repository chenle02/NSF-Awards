The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will improve pediatric health. Pediatric ear
infections often manifest at night and the child must wait until the next day
for an evaluation and treatment. The intention of this project is to create a
deep-learning at-home ear infection diagnostic system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
will advance translation of a pediatric ear-imaging system. The objectives
include: generating a training data set with images labeled with correct
diagnoses from a pediatric clinical setting; creating a deep learning algorithm
with transfer learning from well-established convolutional neural networks for
prediction; creating a prototype software interface to label a new image
presented to the system; and designing a speculum for at-home image
acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
