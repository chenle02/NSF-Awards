This conference brings together individuals who have been working to improve
introductory science and mathematics courses at major public research
universities and research faculty who may or may not have been actively involved
in the teaching of these courses. The problems of freshman year science at
research universities are familiar, yet innovation has taken place at selected
institutions in specific departments. Results of the conference include a
statement of the problems faced by research universities in the teaching of
freshman science to both science and nonscience majors and the creation of an
agenda for the revitalization of these courses. The grantee provides funds for
this project that are a partial match for the NSF award.
