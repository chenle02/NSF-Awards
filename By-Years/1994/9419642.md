Major instruments required to equip a facility for the study of macromolecular
interaction are requested. These center around a Beckman OPTIMA -XL - a
analytical centrifuge. To complement this equipment, a dynamic light scattering
instrument and upgrades to existing fluorescence instrumentation are requested.
This equipment will be used to determine protein equilibria distances within
macromolecular complexes, molecular weights and particle shapes for DNA protein
complexes, viral subassemblies and nucleic acids. Such a facility does not exist
within the University of Colorado system and is severely needed by a group of
investigator for their structural and mechanistic studies.
