Abstract: I propose to concentrate on constructive (and, if possible, efficient)
methods for finding and characterizing OPTIMAL geometric representations for
combinatorial, topological, or geometric objects in low dimensions. In one
dimension we will study graphs, in two dimensions, Riemann surfaces, in three
dimensions -- compact manifolds. We will study direct geometric invariants
(volume, curvature integrals, diameter) as well as less tractable but in many
ways attractive spectral invariants (individual eigenvalues or determinants
(regularized or not) of elliptic operators).

In all cases, our goal is find the nicest geometric representation of a
topological object. An obvious example is that of the "round" metric on the
sphere. People have been lucky to discover this metric early, because the
natural processes of weather work stones into approximately round shapes.
Unfortunately, nature is not there to help us with more complicated mathematical
objects, so we have to invent artificial processes which will work them into
"canonical" shapes, so we can better understand the underlying structure.
