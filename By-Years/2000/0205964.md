This program will explore the very inner structure of active galactic nuclei,
to determine masses of the central black holes using continuum and emission-line
variability to probe the physical processes in the accretion-disk/broad-line
region environment. The current program in progress to measure the bulge
velocity dispersions in the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei will be
expanded to test whether the relationship between the black-hole mass and bulge
velocity dispersion is the same for active galaxies and quiescent galaxies. This
relationship will be used to estimate masses for local AGNs for which
reverberation masses have not been measured, concentrating initially on radio-
loud AGNs and narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, objects that are not well
represented in reverberation-mapped samples. Optical ground-based support for
multiwavelength monitoring programs will be provided, in particular a long-
standing program of optical spectrophotometry on the well-studied Seyfert 1
galaxy NGC 5548.
