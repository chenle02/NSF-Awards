The goal of this proof-of-concept proposal is to revise and document the
effectiveness of a teacher-friendly regional geology field guide. This revision
targets Earth Science teachers with limited geological background knowledge, and
will enhance teachers' capacity to 1) provide local and regional examples for
geology/earth science concepts and 2) facilitate the delivery of inquiry-based
earth science instruction as outlined in the National Science Education
Standards. The teacher-friendly field guide/inquiry materials will be adapted
from the "Northeast Geology Field Guide" and developed through a summer
institute format with teachers. Impact of the guide's ability to foster inquiry
teaching and learning will be assessed employing a video-based analysis grounded
in STAM (Secondary Teaching Analysis Matrix).
