This project will analyze observations of energetic particles in the region of
Earth's magnetopause and magnetosheath. It will study the processes that lead to
the transport of plasma out of the magnetosphere and into the solar wind. The
observations will come from the five THEMIS spacecraft. The changing orbits of
the spacecraft provide several useful configurations allowing for simultaneous
measurements of source and loss populations at different radial locations along
the magnetopause. Observations have also been made where multiple spacecraft
pass through similar places along the magnetopause at similar times which makes
it possible to study small-scale temporal and spatial structures. Mechanisms
that may lead to plasma loss from the magnetosphere include magnetic
reconnection, particle drifts due to gradients in the magnetic field and
diffusion. The observations will be compared with the Fok Radiation Belt
Environment (RBE) model to test if loss rates from the model are consistent with
observations under different conditions.

Quantifying the conditions under which energetic particles are lost through the
dayside magnetopause is an important aspect in understanding the dynamics of
Earth's radiation belt. This is a topic that has relevance to our understanding
of space weather.
