Improvements in Analytical Instrumentation Used for Environmental Studies Mesa
State College is providing leadership through its development of an
interdisciplinary curriculum within undergraduate environmental education. One
of the program strengths lies in the extensive laboratory experiences for
students. There is an emphasis on the proper use of analytical instrumentation
to aide environmental site assessments. The use of field portable
instrumentation in conjunction with more traditional analytical chemistry is the
key to insuring effective assessments of contaminated areas. We will develop a
series of laboratories which will provide students with an understanding of how
to effectively use modern instrumentation both in the field and within the
laboratory. Students will learn through hands-on exercises and classroom
discussions the importance of scientifically assessing environmental systems.
This will also provide students with a basis for understanding the chemical and
physical factors which affect the environmental fate of contaminants. The
instrumentation in this project will be used in an integrated manner to examine
the metal composition of environmental matrices. The results of this project
will be disseminated through presentations, preparation of lab manuals,
textbooks and research publications. This project will also improve geology
studies and a new chemistry degree.
