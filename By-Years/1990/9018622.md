The principal investigator will develop new means to predict diffusion kinetics
data for rock-forming minerals, measure specific cation diffusion kinetics
useful for predictive capabilities, and collect new oxygen diffusion data to
clarify contradictions in the literature. One objective of this work is to
establish a framework that permits computation of a diffusion coefficient for
any particular mineral under a given set of physical conditions, and in turn
develop a data base that can be used to solve a range of problems for which
diffusion data are not yet available. An attempt also will be made to understand
the diffusion data on a sound theoretical basis. Results will have wide
application in geochronology, metamorphic petrology, and many other areas of
geology.
