The Department of Psychology is establishing a computer laboratory dedicated to
giving students in perception and cognition lab courses tools for active
learning and efficiently teaching them to use those tools. Using a network
approach, this lab will be used to develop Hypercard based laboratory exercises,
demonstrations, and formal experiments in perception; and will serve
experimental psychology and neuroscience courses in similar ways. It is expected
that the programs developed as part of this project will also inspire students
and teachers alike to construct their own.
