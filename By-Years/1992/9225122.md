Ten undergraduates each year for the next three years will participate in a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in the Department of Civil
Engineering and Geological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame. This
experience is designed to provide students with an improved understanding of
research and to encourage them to consider careers in research. The research
activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in civil engineering and
include projects in water resources, bioengineering and pollution control, and
structural mechanics. Components of the program include identification of
exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and
minority participation; matching of student research interests with faculty;
close interaction of graduate students and faculty with the undergraduates to
provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate study, university
research, and careers in academia; an intense two month research experience;
mini-courses, as needed, to facilitate effectiveness in the research projects;
and a mini- conference for presentation of results. The goal of the program is
to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation about the
challenges of a career in research.
