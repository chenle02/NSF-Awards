Stochastic inverse problems arise when a blurred version of a desired signal or
image influences the statistics of a random process that models measured data.
Examples include the quantum- limited imaging of radioactive tracers in the
body, imaging gamma-ray sources in astronomy, and forming images in low-light
photography. A joint group research program is being pursued with Alan Karr at
the Johns Hopkins University to investigate new algorithms for these problems.
Identifying algorithms which map onto highly parallel computational
architectures is an important objective of the research.
