Recent trends in the chemical industry have resulted in a move away from the
production of large amounts of commodity chemicals toward more emphasis on low-
volume speciality and high-value-added products. Such materials are often
produced in batch plants which provide the needed flexibility for changing
products, uncertain market conditions, variable feedstock materials, etc. and
for complex synthesis requiring long residence times. Scheduling such
manufacturing facilities are complex procedures because most batch plants
produce multiple products in a single facility, and the resources of this
facility, such as the equipment, the manpower, the utilities and the time, etc.
are shared among the products. This project will concentrate on developing
computer-aided methodology for scheduling a general batch plant with arbitrary
constraints on its shared resources. The PI's method of approach is to develop a
schedule that accounts for the allocation of all limited resources (vessels,
manpower, utilities, etc.) and then incorporate costs associated with late
penalties, inventory, change-over, set-up and clean-up. The method is viable in
a dynamic sense because the assumed initial state is the current operating state
which thus also automatically accounts for rescheduling in the event of
equipment failure, changes in feed, etc. He thus established a feasible schedule
and make evolutionary changes to improve it based on heuristics. Commercial use
of such methodology should result in higher personnel productivity, resource
(time, equipment, labor, energy, etc.) utilization levels, lower production
costs, and economically more profitable batch plants.
