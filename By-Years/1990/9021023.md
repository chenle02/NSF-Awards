This U.S.-Italy award will support a workshop on knowledge, beliefs, and
strategic interactions. The activity, which is being jointly organized by
Professor Christina Bicchieri of Carnegie-Mellon University and Professor Maria
Luisa Dalla Chiara of the University of Florence, will serve to bring together
philosophers and economists (game theorists) to explore several issues of cross-
disciplinary interest. Thus, it is expected that philosophers can provide game
theorists some useful insights into foundational problems and techniques that
may help to develop more powerful game theory models. At the same time, game
theorists can furnish philosophers with important new problems and applications.
This workshop follows after a similar successful inter- disciplinary workshop
that took place in Italy over two years ago. Expected outcomes from this meeting
are a proceedings publication and increased interaction between philosophers and
game theorists. Support from the Italian Interuniversity Center for Game Theory
and the Florence Center for the History and Philosophy of Science will make
possible the participation of other distinguished European and Israeli
researchers.
