This is an award to support Phase II of a project initiated in response to NSF
88-8, Program Solicitation for Small Business Innovation Research. The objective
of Phase I, conducted under NSF Grant No. 87-60690, was to determine the
feasibility of using electrochemically generated superoxide to dechlorinate
organic compounds such as the polychlorinated biphenyls, trihalomethanes,
chlorinated phenols, benzoic acids and chlorinated polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons that are contained in wastewater and are also found as contaminants
of surface and groundwater. The feasibility of the concept was demonstrated
during Phase I. The objective of Phase II is to determine its technical and
economic feasibility. The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic
compounds that are the target of this research is a matter of great National
concern. The novel concept being developed in this project is expected to result
in a process that can be used in fracturing organic compounds into innocuous
substances or into fragments that may be more readily removed by a secondary or
tertiary physical, chemical or biological process.
