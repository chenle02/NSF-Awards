This proposal requests support to obtain a high-efficiency data collection
instrument for protein X-ray crystallography. This instrument will be used for
the solution of protein crystal structures, specifically those of penicillin
acylase, D-amino acid transaminase, beta-keto thiolase, alanine racemase, and an
anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody Fab fragment. It will also be used for studies
of mutants and substrate complexes of L- aspartate amino transferase, triose
phosphate isomerase, glucose isomerase, the serine proteases chymotrypsin and
elastase, and iron superoxide dismutase.
