In this project in the Inorganic, Organometallic, and Bioinorganic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Andreas Mayr of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook will study tungsten carbyne complexes. The goal of the work is to
increase understanding of transition metal-mediated bond formation and cleavage.
The results will provide models for understanding detailed mechanistic aspects
of catalytic processes such as reductive polymerization of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbon skeletal rearrangements, and hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis. A number of
new compounds containing an alkylidyne ligand and additional ligands with
unsaturated bonds--alkenes, alkynes, carbonyl, isocyanide--will be prepared.
Complexes containing alkylidyne ligands and terminal hydrocarbon ligands--alkyl,
aryl, vinyl, alkylidene--will also be synthesized. The reactivity of these
compounds will be studied, including the mechanism of alkylidyne coupling
reactions with carbonyl, isocyanide, and other alkylidynes, and the mechanism of
insertion reactions of metal-carbon triple bonds with terminal hydrocarbon
ligands.
