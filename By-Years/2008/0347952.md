Proposal # DBI-BDI: 0347952 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Batzoglou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University has been
awarded a CAREER grant to evaluate emerging methods of genome comparison, to
improve existing methods and to develop new ones when appropriate. The
concentration will be on devloping comprehensive reference maps, or alignments,
of whole genomes to locate biologically functional and evolutionarily
constrained elements, and to trace their evolutionary history. The results will
be included in collaborations with multiple whole genome sequencing efforts.
There will also be a significant course development component and several
undergraduate and graduate students will be included in the
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
