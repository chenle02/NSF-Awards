9353812 Wood The University of California at Davis seeks to initiate a six-week,
residential, Young Scholars project in Biological and Environmental Science for
40 students entering grades 10 and 11. The project provides students an
opportunity to become involved in individual research activities in
collaboration with university research mentors. The students will participate in
"hands-on" laboratory activities designed to help them gain insight into the
interdisciplinary complex and interactions of biological concepts and
agricultural sciences. Additional activities include field trips and follow-up
activities during the academic year.
