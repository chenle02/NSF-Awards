This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The symmetries of any geometric object are encoded in
an algebraic structure called a group. One of the primary goals of geometric
group theory is to draw connections between the geometry of an object and the
algebra of its symmetry group. This leads to a powerful way to link topology,
algebra, combinatorics and computer science. One area of interest pursued in
this project will be finding groups with interesting geometric properties that
fail to be computationally “simple.” The PI will also study right-angled Coxeter
groups, a class of reflection groups introduced almost 100 years ago, using
techniques from probability and combinatorics to analyze their geometry and
algebra. As part of this project, the PI will organize and live-stream talks by
mathematicians to students at the Bard High School Early Colleges to provide
opportunities to students from underrepresented groups in urban and suburban
areas by connecting them with interesting work happening in the field as well
learn about pathways to mathematical research on the undergraduate and post-
graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves three research
directions tied to geometric and algorithmic problems in groups. The PI will
study different aspects of right-angled Coxeter groups: in one direction the
Erdös-Renyi model of random graphs will be used to study negative curvature
properties of random right-angled Coxeter groups; in another the topological
finiteness and negative curvature properties of outer automorphism groups of
right-angled Coxeter groups will be explored. The PI will also study
automaticity for new examples of CAT(0) groups, and study language theoretic
properties of autostackable groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
