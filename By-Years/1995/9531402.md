Dr. Geraldine Richmond and other members of the Chemical Physics Institute at
the University of Oregon are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemical physics. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects which encompass both chemistry and physics. Topics
include new optical phenomena and optical materials, as well as kinetics and
thermodynamics of materials and interfaces. In addition to the research, the
students and supervisors will participate in a collective program which includes
research seminars, weekly meetings, social activities, and a summer research
retreat.
