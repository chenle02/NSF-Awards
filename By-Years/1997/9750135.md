Abstract DBI 9750135 Leslie Pray This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This fellowship
provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific training
beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms and their
environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population, community and/or
ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the Directorate for
Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each fellowship supports
a research and training plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The
research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "A field study of
genetic variation and population structure in New England salamander
communities." Contextual analysis is being used to estimate selection among
clones, selection between clones and their parental species, and selection among
pond communities in New England populations of the unisexual salamander
Ambystoma laterale-(2)jeffersonianum. Clones and clonal variants are identified
by allozyme and DNA data, and fitness data are collected in the field.
