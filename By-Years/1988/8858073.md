This Presidential Young Investigator award will support a broad, multiyear
program of research in mathematical physics. Professor Imbrie's research
interests include disordered systems, field theory, and statistical mechanics. A
special contribution of his is the application of probabilistic methods and
ideas to problems in physics. Building on previous work concerning the Ising
model with random magnetic field, he will continue to investigate phase
transitions in random systems. He has also worked on renormalization group
methods for gauge theories, and plans to develop these methods further for
problems in probability theory such as self-avoiding random walks.
