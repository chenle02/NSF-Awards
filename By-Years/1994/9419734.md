Ralph Wheeler, University of Oklahoma, is funded by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the gas phase and solution phase
properties of aromatic amino acid radicals. Wheeler will use ab initio quantum
calculations and molecular dynamics to further understand the energetics,
pathways, and rates of radical migration in proteins and peptides. Comparisons
will be made between gas phase and solvated tyrosine and tryptophan radicals and
cations. Density functional theory will be used to calculate the gas phase
vibrational frequencies and spin densities of these species for comparison with
organic phenoxyl, phenoxyl cation, indoyl and indoyl cation radical side chains.
One of the objectives here is to identify vibrational and ESR spectroscopic
features which can be used to distinguish different orientations of the aromatic
amino acid radicals. Molecular dynamics will then be used to compute free
energies of hydration using free energy perturbation theory together with
charges and force constants obtained from the gas phase density functional
calculations. The formation and migration of highly reactive radicals is
implicated in carcinogenesis and aging. The recent discovery and
characterization of aromatic amino acid radicals in proteins implies that amino
acid radicals are much more prevalent and important than previously suspected.
The long term goals of Wheeler's computational research include understanding
the molecular components and their interactions responsible for the energetics,
pathways, and rates of radical migration in proteins and peptides.
