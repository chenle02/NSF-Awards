PI: Meinhart, Carl D Proposal Number: 1543708

The proposal seeks funds to partially cover expenses of participants and
organizing costs for the conference entitled "11th International Symposium on
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)" to be held in Santa Barbara, California during
September 14-16, 2015 . This international symposium will emphasize
advancements, practice and novel uses of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and
related techniques. This meeting is the premier PIV event in world, bringing
together experts, practitioners and worldwide expertise in a concentrated forum
for exchange of new ideas and intellectual interaction.

PIV has enabled detailed, high quality measurements in every aspect of fluid
mechanics opening up the opportunity to develop new insights in a host of fluid
dynamics research areas. Most recent developments include stereo, time-resolved,
tomographic, microscopic PIV and many more. In addition, applying PIV in
challenging situations has required solving many complicated fluid/particle
interaction problems. The meeting will cover phenomena from several areas of
experimental fluid dynamics image-based techniques, with emphasis in 1)
Improvements in accuracy, resolution and robustness; 2) Measurements in
difficult or extreme fluid flows; 3) PIV Theory and Algorithms; 4) Particle
Tracking Velocimetry (PTV); 5) Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF); 6) Stereo and
3D techniques (e.g. Holographic, Tomographic and Plenoptic PIV); 7) Pressure
Measurement; 8) Scalar Transport and Mixing; 9) Multiphase and Turbulent Flows;
10) Biomedical Applications; 11) Micro-/Nanofluidics; 12) Aerodynamics; 13)
Combustion; and 14) Data post-processing
