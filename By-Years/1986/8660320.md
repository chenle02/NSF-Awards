Pressure waves, due to the collapse of a steam bubble in a pool of subcooled
water, can be used to fracture materials and/or remove material if the waves can
be directed. The research proposed here will lead to the development of a
steam/subcooled water nozzle which will direct a jet of collapsing steam bubbles
towards a surface, set up pressure waves in the solid which will result in
surface cleaning, and flush away the removed material. The aim of this research
is to develop a surface cleaner that does not degrade the mechanical, chemical,
or physical properties of the cleaned surface.
