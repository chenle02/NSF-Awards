Pelesko&lt;br/&gt;0807546&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this project, the
investigator, his colleagues, and a&lt;br/&gt;team of undergraduate researchers
study electrocapillary surfaces&lt;br/&gt;and electro-elastocapillary systems.
Electrocapillary surfaces&lt;br/&gt;are capillary surfaces, i.e., surfaces which
minimize surface&lt;br/&gt;energy subjected to a volume constraint, that are
placed in an&lt;br/&gt;electric field. Electro-elastocapillary systems
are&lt;br/&gt;electrocapillary surfaces that are additionally constrained
to&lt;br/&gt;reside on a flexible elastic body. Mathematical models of
these&lt;br/&gt;systems are developed via a variational principle. The
resulting&lt;br/&gt;systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations
are&lt;br/&gt;studied using tools from perturbation theory, nonlinear
dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and numerical analysis. In addition, experiments are carried
out&lt;br/&gt;in the investigator's laboratory and the mathematical theory
is&lt;br/&gt;compared with experimental data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) operate at a scale&lt;br/&gt;where forces
common to everyday experience, such as gravity and&lt;br/&gt;inertia, hold no
sway. Rather, in the microworld, behavior is&lt;br/&gt;dominated by less
familiar forces such as surface tension and the&lt;br/&gt;electrostatic force.
Inspired and informed by recent advances in&lt;br/&gt;MEMS technology, this
project develops the mathematical theory of&lt;br/&gt;systems dominated by the
unique balance of capillary,&lt;br/&gt;electrostatic, and elastic forces. The
development and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of this mathematical theory allows MEMS
researchers to improve&lt;br/&gt;and optimize the design of MEMS devices. In
turn, improved MEMS&lt;br/&gt;devices can be used in areas ranging from
automotive safety to&lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering. This project also focuses
on outreach to&lt;br/&gt;mathematics faculty and students from local high
schools. As&lt;br/&gt;part of this project, the investigator strengthens
existing ties&lt;br/&gt;with several local high schools and help develop novel
lab-based&lt;br/&gt;exercises to be integrated into the high school
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;
