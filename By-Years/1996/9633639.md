This award will support a variety of studies involving use of trace metals (Ba,
Cd, Sr) in benthic foraminiferal shells for application to paleo-deep ocean
circulation. Previous work has shown that trace metals and 13-C do not follow
the same trends, although they have all been used as tracers of deep-water type.
The project will analyze live specimens from a variety of environments and
compare results with co-occurring dead specimens to determine effects of early
diagenesis; compare the same values with bottom water and pore waters (measured
by others) to determine how accurately the organisms reflect ambient conditions;
and examine changes in all tracers in depth transects from the western (Ontong-
Java Plateau) and eastern (Cocos Ridge) tropical Pacific over the last glacial
cycle, in order to establish a first-order record of deep circulation changes.
