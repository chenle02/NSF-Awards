This award from Divisions of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences and the Diratorate for Education and Human Resources supports a
workshop to increase awareness of leaders at universities and national
laboratories to address ethnic and racial diversity issues in the materials
science and engineering (MSE) community. The workshop will be held in Arlington,
Virginia, convening the evening of Sunday December 9, 2012 and running through
mid-day Tuesday December 11, 2012. The workshop will identify and understand the
current status and trends in representation of minorities in MSE, and the major
barriers that make science and engineering careers unattractive or unavailable.
The workshop will provide a forum (1) to educate those in the MSE community who
are in a position to remediate the atmosphere that fosters biases, (2) to
develop concrete suggestions to improve the culture for diversity in MSE, and
(3) to improve the understanding of the current status and trends in ethnic
diversity and equity in MSE. The workshop will result in a set of best practices
intended to increase the diversity of faculty members and administrators in MSE
and to render the atmosphere welcoming and attractive to all. These best
practices will be disseminated in the form of the conference report and
publication in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal. This will enable a broader
discussion of methods for mitigating diversity issues across the science and
engineering community.
