Despite its economic and biological importance, the family Bovidae (of cattle,
antelopes, goats, and gazelles) remains problematical in its phylogenetic
relationships. Previous work by Dr. Michael Miyamoto of the University of
Florida indicates that data from sequence analyses of mitochondrial ribosomal
RNA and transfer RNA genes provide sufficient resolution to construct a
phylogeny for this animal group. Current work will focus on four objectives: 1)
to isolate, clone, and sequence mitochondrial DNA from representatives of all
ten subfamilies of Bovidae; 2) to construct evolutionary branching diagrams of
bovids from the mitochondrial dataset; 3) to compare these results against other
molecular data acquired from nuclear genes for patterns of congruence; and 4) to
investigate the tempo and mode of evolution of mitochondrial rRNA and tRNA
genes. The ample fossil record of bovids will help establish calibration points
in this analysis of molecular evolution. Dr. Miyamoto is a Presidential Young
Investigator who has shown great promise in the new field of molecular
systematics and evolution.
