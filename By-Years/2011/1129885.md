This workshop in engineering education research seeks to bring together a wide
range of participants to look at recent changes in environmental engineering
practice, and determine how these changes impact how students are education in
degree programs. The workshop is framed around the National Academy of
Engineering's Grand Challenges, particularly in regards to the environment and
sustainable processes.

The workshop will draw from both practicing engineers, professional societies,
and engineering educators, and help create a broad network to address learning
and teaching in this dynamic field. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic
goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering
workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of
innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are
useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
