The primary goal of the research is to develop preliminary data that address a
key hypothesis about the evolution of redox reactions far from thermodynamic
equilibrium. In this project, the investigators will provide both experimental
data and develop computational analyses to test a key hypothesis: that the
abiotic reduction of N could proceed absent life via a light catalyzed oxidation
of ferrous iron. If this hypothesis can be supported, it would potentially
explain how iron-sulfur complexes became stably incorporated in core metabolic
enzymes, such as nitrogenase, while simultaneously providing an alternative
hypothesis accounting for banded iron formations at 3.8 billion years before
present (Ga). This high-risk, basic research project will provide both
experimental and computational evidence for understanding the evolution of core
metabolic complexes that were essential to the evolution of life on Earth.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The project will educate and
train one graduate student and one post-doctoral fellow. The post-doctoral
fellow will be team mentored and supported, with a goal of preparing him/her to
develop their own, independent research program. In addition, the project
scientists are strongly involved in working with local K-12 school systems in
New Jersey and providing information about evolution of life through public
lectures and outreach using the Liberty Science Center and the NSF-sponsored
Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence Mid Atlantic (COSEE MA;
www.cosee-ma.net).
