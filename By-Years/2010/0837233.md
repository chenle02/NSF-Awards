The American Meteorological Society will provide several scientific journals to
less developed countries. Approximately, 123 organizations in developing
countries will receive these journals. It is important that these journals are
disseminated to continue to enhance the knowledge of those scientists and
professionals dwelling in these countries. The journals will allow them to be
abreast with the latest scientific endeavors and discoveries. These countries
can make full use of the many advances the science can offer and participate in
the dialogue now underway internationally on climate and climate change.
