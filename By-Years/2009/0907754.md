This project will support the travel of US participants in an international
workshop on Advanced Smart Materials and Smart Structures Technology to be held
in Boston. The workshop will identify the high priority emerging research issues
in the area of smart materials and smart structures technology for application
to structural health monitoring. It will also identify the collaborative
research topics and mechanism that can be pursued by researchers to leverage the
resources of different international research centers in the Asia-Pacific
region. One of the workshop foci will be on utilization of emerging bio-inspired
intelligent systems in sensing actuation, networking and decision making
involved in structural health monitoring. The program includes a strong
participation by young researchers and graduate students. The workshop will
facilitate the exchange of ideas, research data, facilities, and resources with
international researchers from the Asia-Pacific region to address the pressing
research issues of common interest in structural health monitoring.
