This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the
potential of applying Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) to the manufacturing of
SOI wafers in order to obtain thinner absolute silicon layer thickness and
increased thickness uniformity, while achieving realistic cycle times. MRF,
featuring advanced polishing algorithms, exceptional system stability, high
removal rate and a shear mode of material removal has already been successfully
implemented for polishing high-precision photolithographic lenses. However, SOI
manufacturing leads to new challenges for MRF: the amount of material removal is
extremely small (5-50 nm), the absolute amount is critical, and there are strict
cycle time requirements necessary to achieve a commercially viable process.

If this research leads to a successful MRF solution for SOI wafers, other
applications in the semiconductor industry (other thin films, bulk silicon
wafers), as well as other industries (telecom) could be significantly impacted
by similar solutions.
