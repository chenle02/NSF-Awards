Ductile shear zones in rocks commonly develop in three-dimensional arrays
involving non-plane strains and possibly volume loss. The purpose of this
project is to establish the pattern of strain and fabric development in ductile
shear zones that form an anastomosing network in three dimensions, to understand
the kinematics of deformation, and to test models of shear zone development. The
shear zone to be studied developed in high-grade metagabbros of the Seve-koli
nappes of the northern Swedish Caledonides. Preliminary strain analysis
according to the planar band model of shear zone development indicates volume
loss with increasing strain, yet available geochemical data indicate that
deformation occurred under isochemical conditions. The three-dimensional strain
analysis will be applied to the resolution of the volume loss paradox, and a
successful result will be broadly applicable.
