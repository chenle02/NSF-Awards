The focus of this exploratory project is on improving the representation of
smoke plumes from forest fires in atmospheric transport models. Smoke plume
height data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instrument
aboard NASA's TERRA satellite can be used to evaluate the accuracy of smoke
plume rise models as well as to estimate the extent to which forest fire smoke
plumes penetrate the planetary boundary layer. In this project, ground-based
plume height data will be derived from imaging obtained by U.S. Forest Service
personnel using small, rugged, video recorders. This effort represents a novel,
low-cost approach to satellite data validation, and a first effort at producing
a database of forest fire smoke plume heights from ground-based observations.

Understanding the transport of pollutants from forest fires is critical to
assessing the impact of natural processes on air quality in the United States.
This project establishes collaborations between universities and the Forest
Service. People in rural areas, a traditionally underserved group, will be
integral participants in this project. The results of this project will be a
resource for the atmospheric research community and air quality regulatory
agencies.
