The PI will organize a conference on Algebraic Topology, Homotopy theory, and
its applications in October 2009, to be held at the University of Chicago in
Chicago, Illinois, honoring J. Peter May on the occasion of his 70th birthday.
The conference will consist of a Friday colloquium by a leading researcher,
followed by two days of talks. The speakers in the conference will represent a
cross-section of established researchers and recent Ph.D.'s from a variety of
institutions. The talks will describe the leading current developments and
trends in the fields of Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory such as those
pertaining to topological field theories, higher category theory, and
interactions with arithmetic algebraic geometry. Emphasis will be placed on
encouraging participation by graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, women, and
members of underrepresented minority groups.

The conference will stimulate research in a major branch of the mathematical
sciences. The proposed format of the conference is designed to foster the
development of undergraduate and graduate student participants with an interest
in algebraic topology, by giving them access to leading researchers in the
field. The subject matter of the conference is interrelated to many different
branches of mathematics, and the conference therefore has the potential to bring
about new collaborations and discoveries to groups of researchers in the
mathematical sciences. The accessibility of the conference will be augmented by
the creation of a web page which will distribute the contents of the
presentations on the internet.
