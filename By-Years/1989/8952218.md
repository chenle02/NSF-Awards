An interdisciplinary undergraduate course in image processing is the thrust of
this project. It is intended that this course primarily serve majors in both
Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, although other departments such as
Astronomy, Geology and Pharmacy have expressed strong interest in such a course
for their majors as well. The course itself will focus on the fundamental data
operations of computer vision such as image formation two-dimensional feature
detection, representation and basic pattern recognition algorithms. The proposed
project will facilitate the implementation of an undergraduate computer vision
laboratory in which students will be able to digitize and display images which
they have processed according to the specifications of required assignments.
Each student enrolled in the course will also be required to perform an
independent image processing project which extends the knowledge developed
during the course.
