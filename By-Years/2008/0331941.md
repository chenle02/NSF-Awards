Basic discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods and processes will be
needed to take advantage of the full impact of nanotechnology. Nanomanufacturing
is expected to be high-volume, high-rate, integrated assembly of nano-elements
into reliable and robust commercial products. This involves controlling
position, orientation, and interconnectivity of the nano-elements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to address moving from
laboratory fabrication and prototyping, into industry-floor manufacturing. A
full day tutorial on nanomanufacturing, poster session and a nanotechnology
infrastructure tabletop exhibit is also planned. The multidisciplinary experts
from academia, industry and small business will address many important issues
and provide insight and recommendation to ward overcoming the barriers to
Nanomanufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;
