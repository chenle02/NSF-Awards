Many scientific and policy issues currently confront biotechnology research and
development. Some of these issues include the introduction of genetically
engineered organisms into the environment, federal and state oversight of
biotechnology research, food adulteration by R-DNA techniques, biotechnology
education and international outreach programs, and the patenting of
biotechnology products and processes. It is proposed that a Committee on
Biotechnology be established to advise the Board on Basic Biology (BBB) on these
issues and to provide a forum to mediate the multidirectional flow of
information and technology transfer among industry, academe, and the public.
Under the direction of the BBB, the proposed committee will initiate relevant
workshops, symposia, and studies. The committee's activities will provide
valuable information and guidance to government agencies, research scientists,
and the public. In addition, the committee would serve as the U.S. National
Committee for COBIOTECH, which is a new international scientific committee on
biotechnology of the International Council of Scientific Unions. It is proposed
that the Committee on Biotechnology consist of approximately seven members
selected for the most part from sources such as the BBB, the Commission on Life
Sciences (CLS), and the U.S. representatives on the COBIOTECH steering group.
