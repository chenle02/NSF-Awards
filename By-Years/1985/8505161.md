Thermal annealed, transient annealed, and pulsed laser annealed, n-type ion
implanted samples of Cr-doped and undoped semi-insulated GaAs will be
investigated by the method of deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and other
relevant electrical and optical measurements. GaAs samples with light and heavy
doping of Si and Se will be examined. Capless thermal annealing will be
performed in the annealing furnace, transient annealing (1 - 10 sec) will be
employed for the encapsulated samples, and laser annealing will be done by using
dye and XeCl excimer laser. Profiles of deep energy levels will be studied by
DLTS and C-V measurements to determine the redistribution of impurities and
defects during the thermal treatment.
