This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating new
switchgear technology to fill the need for fault current limiting circuit
breakers. The fault tolerant mechanical disconnect switch is important because
it will allow the interconnection of substations in densely populated cities to
increase reliability and resiliency of the power distribution grid. Based on
utility system needs, the project will result in a minimum viable product (e.g.
prototype) of a fault tolerant mechanical disconnect switch. This 15 kV-class
disconnect switch has the following unique features: 600 A continuous current
rating, 30-40 kA fault current rating, and 1 ms switching time. These features
provide the following advantages when integrated in a hybrid circuit breaker
when compared to competing conventional, non-fault current limiting circuit
breakers in this market space. The hybrid circuit breaker limits the fault
current; reduces in the stress of substation components, and enables additional
interconnections between substations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery
toward commercial application: a) The development of electrical contacts that do
not weld even under the stress of fault currents, which will likely require new
contact materials and geometries. This is especially demanding in the particular
design with a piezoelectric actuator since it limits the achievable closed
contact force to levels much lower than its conventional, spring-loaded
actuators. b) The development of electrical conductors that conduct heat
efficiently from the contacts in the vacuum chamber to the terminals of the
disconnect switch so that it can be safely dissipated without overheating the
contacts or the actuator inside the vacuum chamber. In addition, personnel
involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive
technology translation experiences through the development of a minimum viable
product and the customer discovery process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
engages the switchgear manufacturers Eaton and G&amp;W Electric as well as the
electric utility Consolidated Edison to provide guidance with respect to
commercialization aspects, and connections to potential customers in this
technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial
reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of
Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and the Division of Engineering
Education; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of
the two divisions and their programs.
