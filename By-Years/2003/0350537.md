This project aims to understand how factors regulate the production of a
specific hormone in a selected cell type. Somatotroph cells located in the
pituitary gland make growth hormone (GH) under the control of the hypothalamic
neurons of the brain in order to regulate muscle development and bone growth.
While one protein, named Pit-1, is known to be essential for expression of the
gene for GH, combinatorial interactions with another protein named Zn-16 are
necessary for normal synergistic regulation of GH expression. Experiments will
study and manipulate Zn-16 in somatotrophs to assess effects on the
transcription of RNA from the GH gene. Zn-16 expression will be measured in GH-
deficient dwarf rats and mice, either as adults or during critical stages of
pituitary differentiation. Effects of GH inhibitors on Zn-16 levels will be
studied in rat somatotroph cell lines in vitro. Finally, tumors that can be
formed form somatotrophs will be manipulated genetically to study the activity
of Zn-16 in vivo. Establishing precise information about regulation of GH will
enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling how cells
differentiate and mature. These experiments require an array of molecular
biology techniques, especially polymerase chain reaction, and will validate the
use of new reagents to detect the Zn-16 protein. Beyond determining the role of
Zn-16 in GH regulation, these studies will have the broader impacts of providing
training of undergraduate students, publishing their findings, and integrating
these topics into the classroom. In particular, students in the Louisiana
Alliance for Minority Participation, co-directed by collaborator Dr. Henry Bart
at Tulane University, will be encouraged to work on these projects.
