The NSF Exploiting Parallelism and Scalability (XPS) program provides an
opportunity for its principal investigators to share and discuss the latest
advances in parallel and distributed computing, demonstrate technical
accomplishments, and inform NSF on promising future research directions. The
technical program agenda will highlight the contributions of the participating
NSF divisions and address the research themes of the XPS program, which aims to
develop scientific foundations for continued US technological leadership and to
strengthen education and training in cutting edge information technology.
