Peucker-Ehrenbrink&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0125873&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On geologic time
scales, atmospheric pCO2 is controlled by the release of Ca and Mg from silicate
weathering and subsequent formation of Ca/Mg-carbonates in the ocean. Attempts
to deduce the past intensity of silicate weathering have relied mainly on the
measured marine 87Sr/86Sr, but lately also on the marine 187Os/188Os record. In
order to correlate 87Sr/86Sr and 187Os/188Os in continental runoff with relevant
major cations released through silicate weathering, comprehensive data for
87Sr/86Sr, 187Os/188Os, Re, Pt, and major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Si) and anions
(Cl, SO4, HCO3) in streams and rivers is needed. Mafic silicates are generally
more reactive in the surficial environment than felsic minerals and runoff from
ultramafic rocks is characterized by high Ca/Na, Mg/Na and total dissolved
loads. Weathering of ultramafic rocks may thus be an important source of
riverine Ca and Mg derived from silicate weathering. As a comprehensive data set
on ultramafic rock weathering is missing, this project aims to correct that by
investigating, in the field and experimentally, how weathering of ultramafic
rocks affects riverine, and thus ocean chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
