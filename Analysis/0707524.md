This project pursues and amplifies the PI's earlier investigations of the
relationships between fractal geometry, spectral geometry, and dynamical
systems. We plan to study the vibrations of "fractal drums," both "drums with
fractal boundary" (Laplacians on open sets with very irregular boundary) and
"drums with fractal membrane" (Laplacians on fractals themselves), "fractal
billiards," as well as the associated "complex fractal dimensions" (a suitable
measure of the oscillations intrinsic to nonsmooth geometries and their spectra)
and "fractal curvatures" (a suitable measure of the way space warps in a fractal
space). Although the proposed theory is mathematically rigorous, it is also
naturally physically motivated (with, e.g., applications to the scattering of
waves by fractal surfaces and to the study of porous media), and has recently
drawn (and will continue to draw) its impetus from the use of computer graphics
and computer experiments. We also intend to pursue our mathematical and computer
graphics aided study of partial differential equations such as the Laplace,
heat, and wave equations on regions with fractal boundary or on fractals
themselves.

The proposed problems are closely connected to Mark Kac's question "Can one hear
the shape of a drum?" and to its beautiful extensions from the "smooth" to the
"fractal" domain by Michael Berry. The expected results should be of physical
significance in condensed matter and solid state physics; for example, in the
study of mechanical or electrical transport in porous or in random media, as
well as of heat diffusions on fractals and in disordered systems. They should
also be relevant to subterranean imaging and the study of the way information
and electromagnetic signals propagate across rough terrain. (Recent engineering
and physical applications include new types of cell phones, fractal antennas,
loudspeakers, heat insulators, nearly optimal soundproof walls, radar detection,
catalytic chemical reactions, and computer microchips.) This work may help
understand the formation of fractal structures (e.g. coastlines, trees and blood
vessels) in nature as well as the reason why certain biological structures, such
as lungs, are both fractal and nearly optimal to fulfill their biological
functions.
