This award supports participation in a summer school on complex random systems,
to be held at the University of Wyoming, May 27--June 6, 2014. Understanding and
ability to predict the behavior of complex random systems is critical, for
example, to weather and climate predictions and to nanoscale technology. The
summer school will focus on the ongoing development of theoretical methods and
applications in these areas. The aim is to provide a stimulating intellectual
environment for interactions among researchers with different backgrounds. The
school is primarily oriented towards PhD students, young and experienced
researchers and professionals working in related areas. This summer school is
especially aimed at encouraging female students and early career researchers in
mathematics. The interest and enthusiasm of these young students are the
motivating factor in organizing this summer school. This school will further
advance this development throughout the region, while training U.S. junior
mathematicians and students for international collaborative research. The summer
school materials will be widely distributed by the publication of a textbook.

Taking stochastic effects into account is of central importance for the
development of mathematical models of complex phenomena that affected by
uncertainty. Macroscopic models for these systems can include randomness in
several ways. The theories of random dynamical systems and stochastic
differential equations provide fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling,
analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. The associated research, ranging
from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups in the U.S.
and abroad. The summer school will treat key topics related to the theory and
application of stochastic differential equations, in particular, to turbulent
flow simulations: Malliavin calculus, Monte Carlo methods, multiscale models,
molecular dynamics, stochastic methods for turbulent flows, porous media,
weather prediction, and uncertainty quantification. The summer school will serve
as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research
among different research groups. Moreover, it will provide an educational
component for graduate students and early career researchers. The award supports
participation of six invited speakers and forty other participants.
