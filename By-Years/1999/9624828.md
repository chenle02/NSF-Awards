9624828 Stein Algorithms and Biology: Theory and Practice Combinatorial
optimization problems arise in fields as diverse as
transportation,communication, large-scale computing, and biology. This project
focuses on three fundamental areas in combinatorial optimization:(1) Scheduling,
including good average-case scheduling algorithms and algorithms for scheduling
a network of processors;(2) Flows and Cuts, including multicommodity flows,
minimum cuts, and shortest paths;(3) Computational Biology, including problems
that arise as part of the human genome project, algorithms for DNA folding, and
techniques for studying evolution. The Integrated Educational Plan of this
CAREER Grant includes curriculum reform, new course development, training of
teachers in new technologies, and outreach to high school students. ***
