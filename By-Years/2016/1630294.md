The proposed project seeks financial support for graduate students who will
attend their first national meeting, young faculty who will give oral
presentation, and those who belong to the underrepresented groups to attend a
Workshop that will be held October 2-7, 2016 at the Hilton Orlando, Buena Vista
Hotel in Orlando, Florida, The Workshop will allow to promote science by
providing a forum for exchange of knowledge among scientists and engineers
working in the field of III-nitride semiconductor materials and devices It will
address a large variety of topics with emphasis on growth, devices, defects and
new material and device concepts. The workshop will include 20 invited talks and
poster sessions. There will be three short courses and a rump session has also
been planned. The courses will be on X-ray diffraction of GaN-related materials;
Growth of GaN-on-Silicon applied to LED and HEMTs; and Simulation and modeling
of GaN LEDs and HEMTs. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this
generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of
semiconductors is developing. It will help students and other young scientists
to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of nitride semiconductor research.
