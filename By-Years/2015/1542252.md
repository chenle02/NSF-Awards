The estimated value of precious metals from consumer-electronic e-waste (gold,
palladium, silver, copper) is $500M/yr and growing; yet only 20% of e-waste is
collected and separated for recycling, leaving $400M/yr of precious metals in
landfills. The current precious metals recycling processes primarily include
manual sorting, pyrolysis, hydrolysis, scrapping and smelting that are energy
intensive or involve hazardous chemicals such as nitric acid and chlorine gas.
Regions are beginning to implement regulations mandating the responsible
disposal of e-waste, thus further spurring market growth and the need for
different technologies.

Knowledge of the distinct optical forces and chemical environments that control
the hydrodynamics of nanoparticles could assist with the separation and sorting
of metal nanoparticles. Selective control over the surface-enhanced mechanical
effects on different metals would have applications towards the clean-up of
chemical waste and the extraction or recycling of metal particulates. This team
has developed a method for optical separation and sorting that could be
controlled remotely via microfluidic channels in a safe aqueous environment,
using energy-efficient lasers or LEDs. The proposed product is a plug-and-play
solution for e-waste pre-processing companies using an optical response to
separate different materials. The proposed technology will be more cost-
effective than traditional smelting, easier to operate, will use less energy and
can operate as a smaller, scalable system.
