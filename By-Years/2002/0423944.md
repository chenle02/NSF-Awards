Pinsky&lt;br/&gt; The 26th Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at
Northwestern University, on October 15-16, 2004. This is a regional meeting with
a limited number of talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the
researchers. It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and
other young investigators to attend and interact with specialists. This year's
speakers are Persi Diaconis, Z.-Q. Chen, and Francesco Russo.&lt;br/&gt;
