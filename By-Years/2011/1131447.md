Ongoing technological revolutions continually bring forth new research
challenges and myriad research communities within Computer Science usually
respond to them on their own. It has been generally recognized that we need
tighter collaboration across these communities: researchers from different
communities working jointly "in the field," constantly informing each other,
inventing in their respective areas in response to their experience in the
field, and forging systems and solutions that are simultaneously validated by
both algorithmic and systems communities. Such an experience will produce
algorithms that are practical as well as powerful, and systems and applications
that are efficient and effective, without working to make independent research
threads meet ex post. We believe that the time is appropriate for "Algorithms in
the Field." We propose to initiate discussions and collaborations on
understanding the challenges and promises of algorithmic foundations in various
CS fields, and further establish the vision of algorithmic foundations forged in
these fields in practice. The development of successful examples will increase
awareness that collaborations across the subdisciplines should be customary, and
not exceptional. The main goal of the workshop is to provide a working vision
for such examples of Algorithms in the Field, and a prioritization of near term
goals and directions for scientific investigation.
