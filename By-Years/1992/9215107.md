Research in electromagnetic excitation of nucleon resonances will be carried
out at CEBAF using a large, superconducting, torroidal field spectrometer. CEBAF
staff and members of a large user collaboration, including James Madison
University, will build this device. Calibration and monitoring instrumentation
will be developed by JMU for the shower counter system of this spectrometer. The
related hardware and software will be developed at the JMU campus, which will
later be integrated into the full detector system. Data obtained with this
detector will determine the structure and decay properties of various nucleon
resonances, including the 1535 and 1710 MeV states. Comparison with current QCD
inspired models of the nucleon will be made. Undergrads will be involved in this
research.
