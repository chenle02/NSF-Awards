The objective of this research is to invent a new device structure of solar-
blind ultraviolet detectors for a broad range of applications, from homeland
security to environmental monitoring. Instead of relying on semiconductors with
wide band gaps >4 eV, the approach is based on a novel nanophotonic metal-oxide-
semiconductor structure coupled with avalanche gain in Si. Compared to wide band
gap semiconductor devices, this device structure offers much easier materials
deposition, device fabrication, and integration with Si read-out circuits.

The intellectual merits of this research are: (1) The proposed device structure
sets a new paradigm for solid-state photodetectors by using metal instead of
semiconductor as an active photon absorption medium; (2) The investigations on
hot electron ballistic transport in metals will explore a new territory
applicable to other devices such as high-efficiency solar cells; and (3)
Engineering the electronic structures of metal alloys for active metallic
optoelectronic devices extends the realm of band engineering beyond
semiconductors.

The project makes a broader impact by providing high performance, inexpensive
solar-blind ultraviolet detectors for a broad range of applications, including
early missile warning, ozone-hole monitoring, chemical/biological sensing, and
secure short-range communications. An example is large-scale mapping of
ultraviolet radiation associated with ozone depletion, where data can be
collected by groups of K-12 students in their local region. Such activities get
them involved into scientific research and raise their awareness of
environmental sustainability. The nanophotonic solar-blind ultraviolet detectors
can also equip Arctic researchers to monitor ozone holes in the Arctic region.
