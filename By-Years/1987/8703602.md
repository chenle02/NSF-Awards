This research will continue the investigations of the P.I. on the structure of
cycles and K-theory of arithmetic varieties and their (conjectural) relationship
to values of L-functions at integral points. He will analyze certain selected
conjectures of Beilinson, Bloch and Tate in the context of modular varieties
where one can use the theory of automorphic forms. This research is in the blend
of topics encompassing number theory, algebraic geometry and automorphic forms.
That is, it brings to bear tools from algebra, analysis and geometry to analyze
number theoretic problems. The "values of L-functions" give analytic expression
to explicit numbers of great arithmetic significance allowing for their deeper
study. The P.I. has contributed many interests results to this area in the past
and will surely do so further during this research.
