A new class of thermotropic, main-chain poly(ether-amide)s will be prepared in
both deuterated and nondeuterated forms as model polymers for the investigation
of diffusion behavior in liquid- crystalline (LC) polymer melts. The target
polymers will be prepared by melt polymerization and peptide synthesis methods
with sufficiently high molecular weights to form entangled melts in the
isotropic state. The mesophase properties of these polymers will be evaluated.
Forward recoil spectrometry (FRES) will be used to determine the concentration
profiles of these interdiffusing LC polymer chains. Both tracer and self-
diffusion studies of LC polymer chains in their smectic, nematic, and isotropic
phases will be undertaken. The effect of the degree of chain orientation induced
by poling in either magnetic or electric fields will also be explored for its
effect on the LC polymer diffusion characteristics. Collaborations are planned
which will further characterize these thermotropic polymers using rheological
measurements. This research is part of an ongoing effort in several laboratories
to understand the behavior of LC polymer, which have increasing use as
structural materials.
