The 2018 Conference on Fast Direct Solvers will be held at Purdue University in
November 9-11, 2018. The purpose of the conference is to bring together
researchers from different mathematical and application fields to exchange ideas
on the latest developments of fast direct solvers, discuss potential strategies
for tackling the current challenges, stimulate new multidisciplinary
collaborations, and disseminate relevant ideas to broader communities.
Researchers, students, and practitioners from all relevant fields are encouraged
to attend the conference and/or to give talks. The conference will provide a
multidisciplinary platform for junior and senior researchers, students, and
practitioners to discuss and to establish new collaborations. The activities
will help to attract students and junior researchers from diverse background to
join the field and also stimulate student interest in mathematics. This grant
will be used to partially support the travel and lodging of junior researchers
and students.

In scientific computing, data analysis, and engineering simulations, solving
large linear systems is typically a key computational component. Direct solvers
do not need iterations, are very robust, and have various other attractive
features. However, classical direct solvers are typically expensive for large
sparse systems because of the loss of sparsity. In the past 15 years or so, the
scientific computing community has witnessed quick developments of the so-called
fast direct solvers, which exploit structures and can achieve significantly
better efficiency than classical direct solvers, sometimes by orders of
magnitude. This conference will bring together researchers, students, and
practitioners from diverse fields that actively involve the design, study, and
application of fast direct solvers. The invited and contributed talks will help
to supply new tools and identify new research directions for direct solvers. The
conference is expected to be an effective event to both advance the development
of fast direct solvers and benefit more general numerical computations.
