With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Mark Smith of The
University of Arizona is continuing his studies on the kinetics of low
temperature reactions. In the past, he has used resonance-enhanced multiphoton
ionization detection to study (a) collisions of neutral molecules or radicals in
a free jet at very low temperatures, and (b) radical reactions in a pulsed
equilibrium axisymmetric supersonic flow reactor (Laval nozzle) between 80 and
250K. Next, he will extend the free jet studies by incorporating single-state
preparation and/or state-selective probes. He will also continue his
investigations of the 60-300K chemistry of hydroxyl radicals, chlorine atoms and
other reactive oxygen-containing radicals with a variety of atmospherically
relevant reactants. Broad based investigations will be made into the mechanism
and dynamics of gas phase chemical reactions at temperatures between 300 and 1K.
The primary goals of this work include the refinement of the developing
understanding of very low energy collision phenomena as well as the provision of
absolute reaction rates and product branching ratios. Such measurements are
critically needed for the modeling of planetary atmospheric, cometary,
circumstellar and interstellar chemical environments.
