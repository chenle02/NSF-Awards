Rutgers University will initiate a 4-week residential Young Scholars project
for 80 students (30 first year) in grades 10-12 in mathematics. The purposes of
the program are: to introduce students to discrete mathematics, an accessible
field with many open problems and many applications; to encourage students to
consider scientific careers; and to expose them to a variety of mathematical
scientists as role models. Two interactive courses are offered, a background
course taught by a leading mathematics educator and a course of graph theory,
algorithms, graph modeling, and applications taught by four well-known discrete
mathematicians. The program includes lecturers from industry, field trips,
computer activities. Follow-up includes four Saturdays during year.
