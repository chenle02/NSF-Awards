This project is intended to examine statistical data bases for the cities of
Miami and Detroit to apply a statistical model of teacher hiring practices to
seek improved strategies for attracting high quality teachers. It would focus on
determining leverage points for maintaining a high quality instructional work
force, providing the basis for selecting a policy from among options of changing
wage compensation, working conditions, or district policies. The team will use
econometric analysis and dynamic-system modeling. Teacher turnover will be
analyzed with a statistical model that includes teacher attributes,
compensation, and school factors. Then school effects will be decomposed into
specific attributes that affect turnover and measurable attributes that can be
observed. Finally, the researchers will build a data set that links teachers to
students to examine the effect of teacher attributes to student outcomes.
