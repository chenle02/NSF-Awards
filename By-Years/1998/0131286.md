One of the most fascinating and important properties of living systems is their
ability to cope with physical damage. This property is manifest in both single
cells and multicellular systems, and is broadly conserved not only in a number
of different animal phyla, but in plants as well. Because of its obvious
clinical importance, multicellular wound healing has long been the subject of
intense scrutiny. In contrast, repair of plasma membrane wounds in single cells
has been overlooked until relatively recently. At least two mechanisms have been
described: an extremely rapid membrane fusion event that provides an immediate
block to the inrush of ions that would otherwise kill the cell, and a slower
contractile response in which a circumferential ring of actin filaments and
myosin-2 assembles around the wound and then closes. The primary goal of this
project is to characterize the mechanisms that regulate assembly and closure of
this ectopic contractile ring. Using Xenopus oocytes as a model system, a
combination of physical, microscopic, and recombinant DNA-based approaches will
be employed to test relationships between cell tension, local increases in rho
class GTPase activity, and intracellular free calcium, in the recruitment of
actin filaments and myosin-2 to the wound border. In addition to providing
information directly relevant to the basic biological process of repair of
damage to the plasma membrane, the proposed studies have the potential to
provide insights into processes which resemble ectopic contractile ring assembly
and closure, such as animal cell cytokinesis.
