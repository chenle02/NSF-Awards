The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) Committee on Urban
Earthquake Hazard Reduction will convene a cooperative United States--Japan
workshop to present current research findings and lessons learned from recent
damaging earthquakes, and resultant changes in mitigation, preparedness,
response, and reconstruction practice. This workshop will be held in Hawaii,
November 13- 15, 1991. As the International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction begins, this workshop will provide an opportunity for the U.S. and
Japan to build on earlier collaborative research efforts and to strengthen
existing ties. It will provide a basis for future program planning for
earthquake hazard reduction research.
