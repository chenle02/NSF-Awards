The study will document the relationship between shell growth, shell habitat
and shell chemistry of deep.living planktonic formainifera, leading to a clearer
understanding of the chemistry of upper 1000 m of sea water and its controls on
contained fauna and their use as paleoceanographic indicators. Stable isotop, Mg
and Sr studies are planned.
