9972257 Laver Steel and Laver proved from a very large cardinal, a theorem about
a tower of finite left-distributive ( a(bc) = (ab)(ac) ) algebras. Laver is
studying a family of other finite problems about l.d. algebras and the braid
groups, using large cardinal axioms. He proved a partial solution to the strong
Halpern-Lauchli problem on binary trees, under the assumption of a measurable
cardinal, and is working on solving the full problem. In all the above problems
it is not known whether a large cardinal is needed. The project also involves
studying a very large cardinal axiom of Woodin that behaves like the axiom of
determinacy on higher cardinality versions of the real line. This axiom is being
studied for its own interest and for the possibility of variants of it shedding
some light on the continuum hypothesis. The CH is known to be immune to standard
large cardinal axioms, but not necessarily to strong variants. Almost all
theorems in mathematics can be proved from a simple set of basic principles, the
Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZFC) axioms for sets. But, as first discovered by Goedel im
the 1930's, there are some statements that can neither be proved nor disproved
from ZFC. However, at least for some of these ``undecidable'' statements there
is hope of their resolution. Namely, they might be proved when one augments ZFC
by ``large cardinal'' axioms, axioms beyond the strength of ZFC, which assert
the existence of very large infinite numbers. The undecidable statements are in
some cases about finite mathematics. The project involves studying some large
cardinal axioms and their potential to solve some well studied open questions in
classical math. Since some of these problems are about the finite world, they
cannot be ruled out as sources of concrete applications; if this happens, an
area of high philosophical interest will also have a striking practical use. ***
