This research examines landscape change associated with the waste outputs of the
phosphate fertilizer industry in Central Florida. In this region, phosphate rock
is mined, converted into fertilizer, and used abundantly in agriculture.
Phosphate mining and the clay wastes it produces have radically transformed
terrestrial landscapes in Bone Valley, the region?s phosphate mining district.
Agricultural application of phosphate fertilizer has, through runoff,
transformed aquatic ecosystems throughout the peninsula. In both terrestrial and
aquatic zones, researchers and managers are attempting projects of reclamation
and restoration. This research examines such projects in the contexts of Bone
Valley and Lake Apopka, a large shallow lake undergoing restoration.

Through 15 months of research in Central Florida, Mr. Caple will conduct
ethnographic interviews with reclamation and restoration scientists; do archival
work; and landscape mapping projects to create an account that includes an
environmental histories of local agriculture and mining; knowledge practices of
waste-landscape researchers and managers; and multispecies interactions on
existing landscapes. The knowledge gained from his research will have practical
implications for Central Florida?s phosphorus management, as well as phosphorus
landscapes around the world.
