Lower &lt;br/&gt;EAR-0209795&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in
response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative NSF 01-157,
category NER, and is co-funded by the GEO and ENG Directorates. The
collaborative team states that while it is generally held that inter- and intra-
molecular forces ultimately govern the interactions between biomolecules and
inorganic surfaces, it is difficult to gain an appreciation of these forces
because they exist at a seemingly infinitesimal magnitude. The central aim of
this proposal is to begin to bridge this gap by using force microscopy to
discover and explore the nanoscale forces at the interface between bacterially
produced proteins and mineral surfaces or other inorganic phases. Force
measurements will provide a quantitative measure of the natural affinity between
nanoscale biomolecules and inorganic surfaces. These force data will be used to
design a soft-lithographic technique in which a bacterium is used as a living
"pen" that produces and secretes various proteins as nanoscale patterns onto a
solid surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
