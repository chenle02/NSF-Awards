The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Syracuse University has
served as a REU site for the past three years and will continue this year. The
research stipends will be awarded to motivated and academically superior
engineering undergraduates who have completed their junior year studies. The
project has both the summer and academic year components. Seven faculty members
in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department have expressed active
interest in supervising the research efforts of the students. The areas in which
these faculty members are currently engaged in research span experimental and
computational fluid mechanics, gasdynamics, aerodynamics, heat transfer,
aeroacoustics, noise control and composite materials. A REU participant may
select a research problem in any one of these research areas of interest to him
or her. Research participant's choice of a research problem and faculty
supervisor's field of specialization will be matched.
