The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research will convene a workshop on
August 10-12, 1992 to creare a comprehensive plan for Project Skymath, a program
based on the success of UCAR's Unidata program. Unidata distributes weather and
atmospheric data to universities and colleges in a format that facilitates
computer manipulation of these data; skymath proposes to do the same for the
nation's pre- collegiate schools. Skymath participants includes nationally known
and respeted math eduators at all levels, mathematicians, and data transfer and
matherials development specialists. This team will develop lassroom materials
that utilize daily weather and climate data in the teaching of mathematics at
K-12 schools with an initial focus on grades 5-8. Plans for Project Skymath
include the introduction of the Skymath materials to in- and pre-service
teachers across the countryl Lesson plans will follow the standards of the
National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). For example, students will
collect and record real-time data; will organize, manipulate and graph these
data; and will learn to explore functions that rule these graphs. Skymath will
help students to become active learners, incorporating mathematics, physics,
atmospheric sciences, earth and environmental scienes and computer technology.
