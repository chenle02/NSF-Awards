This project investigates two design methodologies, dynamic systolization and
macro-dataflowing, useful in developing multiprocessor supercomputers. The
concept of multiprocessor element systolization is generalized from pipeline
chaining implemented in Cray X-MP. This technique offers a new network approach
to designing reconfigurable systolic arrays for fast evaluation of compound
functions and special algorithms. Macro-dataflowing refers to an event-driven
approach to developing dataflow supercomputers. Macro-dataflow is effective to
support multitasking with variable granularity. The studies include principles
of dynamic systolization and macro-dataflowing, development of functional
mechanisms, multiprocessing software supports, system reconfiguration
techniques, multitasking benchmark studies through simulation experiments, and
supercomputer performance evaluations. The major application area emphasizes the
solution of Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems.
