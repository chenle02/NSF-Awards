This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
commercially viable methods for the fabrication of high aspect ratio micro- and
nano-structures for microfluidic applications using contact nano-printing. X-ray
lithography will be used to produce molding tools to emboss structures in
polymers. Microfluidic channels will be fabricated with ordered arrays of micro-
and nano-posts filling these channels. Molding tools will be constructed from
metal electroform to allow hot embossing or injection molding of various
polymers. Mechanical properties of both the electroform and the polymers will be
evaluated for the ability to minimize structure deformation during demolding.
Various gluing and heat annealing assembly methods to enclose the microfluidic
channels will be investigated. A number of post geometries will be examined for
feature integrity during molding, demolding and assembly. Fluid transport
through the ordered arrays will be studied in detail using confocal fluorescence
microscopy.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of micro-column
separations such as for reversed phase chromatography and for micro-reactors.
