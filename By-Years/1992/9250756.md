This project will improve the education of women science majors by providing
them with hands-on experience with modern spectrometric instruments interfaced
with computers to study molecular structure and dynamics. The acquisition of a
90 MHz FT-NMR with multinuclear and variable temperature probes, a GC/MS, and a
fast-scanning UV/VIS spectrophotometer, will provide for in-depth and
challenging laboratory projects. We will incorporate these projects into our
curriculum by both expanding experiments that are currently used and replacing
less sophisticated experiments that do not use advanced techniques. Carrying out
high-level experiments using sophisticated equipment will enhance the
understanding of theoretical concepts and basic applications covered in the
classroom.
