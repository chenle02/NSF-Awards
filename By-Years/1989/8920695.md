A scientific revolution represents more than the overthrow of one scientific
theory or system by another. It also represents the displacement from positions
of authority of the advocates of the old by advocates new system or theory. In
modern times, we see this in the dispensation of research grants, invitations to
give talks, etc. There is something rather pathetic about, for example, the
proverbial fruit fly geneticist whose lab is no longer funded, who has no more
graduate students, and who doesn't get travel grants to the international
congresses. Too often, these displaced scientists (or rather, scientists whose
theories have been displaced) wind up teaching the introductory courses or,
perhaps safer, the history and philosophy of science courses in their
departments| Needless to say, the resistance to new theories thus carries with
it a social as well as intellectual component. Under this grant, Dr. Biagioli is
looking at this social and intellectual process as it developed at the start of
modern science. He is completing his analysis of Galileo's career and strategies
for the legitimation of Copernicanism and the mathematical method. Dr. Biagioli
has found that disciplinary hierarchies established under the then accepted
scholastic system held mathematics to be subordinate to philosophy and theology.
Consequently, Galileo needed to increase his social and disciplinary status in
order to legitimize Copernican astronomy and mathematical physics. However, as
mathematicians could not obtain the higher status of philosophers within the
university, Galileo looked elsewhere. His career traces a trajectory of socio-
professional escalation away from the university toward the court (where he
became the first mathematician to obtain the title of "philosopher"), finally
landing in the newly created scientific academy--and institutions in which the
"new philosophers" could dictate the rules of their own game. Under this grant,
Dr. Biagioli is specifically studying Galileo's activity within the first
scientific institution, the Accademia dei Lincei, and the strategies for the
legitimation of Copernicanism he developed through the authority of that
institution. This work offers not only a specific case study, but brings
together a range of analyses that he has already developed. Further, on a
broader scale, this study illustrates the strategies, both social and
intellectual, which advocates of a new scientific system must use in order to
displace their adversaries and gain access to sources of support for their
research.
