Power is becoming increasingly as important, if not more important than
&lt;br/&gt;performance in many digital systems ranging from PCs and servers to
&lt;br/&gt;Internet routers and embedded systems-on-a-chip. While there has been
&lt;br/&gt;substantial research exploring the power efficiency of the processing
&lt;br/&gt;and memory elements of digital systems, research investigating the
power&lt;br/&gt;consumption of communication elements has been lagging. As a
wide range &lt;br/&gt;of digital systems becomes increasingly interconnected, it
is now&lt;br/&gt;both timely and critical to explore power-aware interconnection
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we outline our plans to
research, develop and build &lt;br/&gt;self-regulating power-aware
interconnection networks that trade off &lt;br/&gt;power and performance
automatically while meeting design constraints. In &lt;br/&gt;these networks,
power-aware router and link mechanisms export knobs by &lt;br/&gt;which network
power and performance can be adjusted. Policies then &lt;br/&gt;control these
knobs to deliver network power-performance that meet &lt;br/&gt;design goals.
Self-regulating power-aware networks alleviate designers &lt;br/&gt;from the
daunting task of reconciling two highly divergent goals -&lt;br/&gt;high
performance, and low power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In highlighting and
demonstrating the importance of power awareness in &lt;br/&gt;networks, our
proposed research advances a deeper understanding of &lt;br/&gt;networks from a
fresh perspective, with a potential for high-impact &lt;br/&gt;contributions in
research. In addition, we see our research leading to &lt;br/&gt;power
efficiency being an integral part of networking
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
