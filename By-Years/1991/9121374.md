A major goal of neuroscience is to determine the causal relationships between
patterns of neural activity and consequent behaviors. This award to Dr. Alvin
Murphy focuses on the behavioral consequences of divers patterns of neural
activity in identified neurons of the buccal ganglion of a snail. The studies
will combine intracellular recordings from identified nerve cells with
simultaneous videotapes of musculature that subserves feeding movements and
other oral behaviors. Behaviors will be monitored directly along with
intracellular and extracellular recordings from neurons and muscles.
Intracellular dye and tracer substance injections will be made to study how
neurons are interconnected. Videotapes and tension measurements from muscles
will be correlated with activity in the nerve cells and during behaviors.
Pharmacological treatment or manipulation of sensory stimuli such as food will
be used to determine the functional efficacy of the various neural patterns
produced by this multifunctional pattern generator. these studies on s simple
model system will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how the nervous
system controls behavior.
