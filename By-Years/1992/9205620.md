The purpose of this study is to determine how much isotopic variability in
basalts arises in the mantle, and how much is a result of crustal interaction.
It will consist of (1) an isotopic survey of upper mantle and crustal basalt-
borne xenoliths, (2) detailed geochemical studies at volcanoes that show large
variability in isotope ratios, (3) textural and microprobe studies of textural
disequilibrium, in order to test for the mixing predicted by isotope studies,
and (4) experimental studies of interaction between basalt magma and crustal
mantle xenoliths. A successful outcome of this research should shed considerable
light on the chemical nature of the mantle of the southwest United States.
