Professor Tough has maintained an important and productive program studying the
properties of superfluid helium turbulence. He proposes investigating the effect
of imposed noise on the turbulent state and on the transition critical
parameters. The postponement of turbulence and more recent preliminary
observations, in Professor Tough's laboratory, of some dramatic effects of noise
on the turbulent state. A principal purpose is to use superfluid turbulence as a
model nonlinear system to study the effects of noise on such systems. Superfluid
turbulence is a unique, interesting and insufficiently understood phenomenon and
these experiments will also yield important new information about the nature of
superfluid turbulence.
