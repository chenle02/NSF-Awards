Many nation states restrict citizen access to information over the Internet by
analyzing Internet users' traffic and then blocking traffic deemed controversial
or antithetical to the views of the nation state. This project explores an
alternative end-to-end network architecture that removes the vulnerability of
citizens to traffic analysis. The researchers propose alternative Internet
architecture and protocol designs, assesses the impact of such designs on
Internet stakeholders, and provide assessment methods for correctness,
performance, and scalability of the alternative design. The project broadly
impacts multiple domains and research communities, from the network security and
anti-censorship communities to those who design and run the Internet. Assuring
that individuals around the world can easily access information over the
Internet is one of the core, driving principles behind this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traffic analysis uses packet meta-data and side-
channels to infer information about communication sessions, encrypted or not,
running over a network. Proxy services make traffic analysis difficult by
inserting intermediate nodes between packet source and destination, but their
success is limited. They can be detected and blocked. The core concept binds
communications sessions to dynamic, short-lived, and seemingly random Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. This fundamentally impacts multiple aspects of the
Internet: the domain name system (DNS), IP addressing/routing, and packet
forwarding. This EAGER project will explore the solution space (scope,
capabilities, impact), identify strategies for realization, and develop a
prototype to assess key properties of the approach. The project's intellectual
merit includes host and network methods based on ephemeral, pseudo-random IP
addresses, IPv6 addressing and inter-domain routing, and SDX
architecture/functions.
