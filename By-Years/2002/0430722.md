Current research in computation focuses on how to program a computer to perform
algebraic calculations that involve concrete mathematical objects. In a concrete
situation, explicit numerical data is available to effect and control the
calculations at run time. No such information is available when the objects are
unspecified (indefinite), and yet mathematicians routinely carry out manual
calculations with them as preliminary steps to obtain insightful theorems. For
the most part, computations involving indefinites have not been studied in
depth. This research explores both the scope and the methods by which algebraic
manipulations of indefinite objects can be automated and lays the foundation for
an entirely new level of abstraction in symbolic
computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer implementation of
indefinite computation considerably expands the scope of computer use in algebra
and is an intellectual challenge of the highest order. Every tiny inroad into
understanding and developing methods to do such computations will have very wide
applications. The planned research consists of several phases: (1) Investigation
and analysis of examples. (2) Experimental prototypes in specific cases. (3)
Defining a practical and categorical framework for indefinite computation. (4)
Eventually full implementation in the open source system Axiom. (5) Applications
to open problems. The investigators will apply state of the art algorithms in
algebra and in computer science to define the framework. Cutting edge methods
for solving parametric equations, symbolic summation, recurrence equations,
Grobner basis, cylindrical algebraic decomposition, dynamical evaluation, and
lazy evaluation will be integrated as necessary. Specific open problems of great
importance in group theory and differential algebra will be studied in order to
better understand some of the basic difficulties. Students will participate
through courses, seminars, and hands-on implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
