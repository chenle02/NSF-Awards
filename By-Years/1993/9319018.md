This award is for support for a program of borehole studies to resolve
fundamental questions about the mechanisms responsible for the rapid movement
(~1 m per day) of the West Antarctic ice stream. Basal "lubrication" by
deformation of soft glacial till underlying the ice is often given as the
mechanism responsible for this rapid movement, however, efforts to observe this
bed deformation directly by measurements in boreholes drilled to the bed have
not given a definite indication of it. Borehole observations have shown that
soft subglacial till is present and that physical conditions favor either till-
deformation or basal-sliding as the rapid-flow mechanism. Improved borehole
techniques for measuring separately the basal-sliding component of ice movement
and the bed-deformation component will be developed and should help to provide
insight into what controls ice stream motion.
