The Department of Mathematical Sciences of George Mason University, Fairfax,
Virginia, will host the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference on March 12-14,
1998. The Spring Topology Conference, as it was originally called, is in its
32nd year and has established itself as one of the largest and most successful
annual topology conferences in the country. Over the years, this conference has
managed to maintain its traditional identity and at the same time expand its
breadth, giving it now an interdisciplinary appeal. In particular, the area of
dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in 1987, and its evolving
link to the more traditional areas of topology has become a central emphasis of
the conference. There will be a mix of one-hour and half-hour invited talks and
contributed talks in areas ranging from general/set theoretic topology through
continuum theory and dynamical systems to geometric topology.
