9312369 Svoronos This project is on research to develop a novel adaptive
modeling approach for periodic bioprocesses. This approach, which combines
mechanistic models and neural network models, will be used to develop control
algorithms. These models will also be used to optimize the process with respect
to the manipulated variables. The techniques developed will be tested on a newly
constructed wastewater treatment plant which utilizes the Bio-Denipho Process
for nutrient removal. ***
