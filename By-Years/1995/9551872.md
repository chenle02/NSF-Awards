The project is incorporating 12 Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL) units and 3
MacIntosh computers into the General, Introductory, and Organic Chemistry
Laboratory curricula. The CBL is an automatic data collection device from Texas
Instruments. The device allows automated collection and storage of data in a
laboratory setting. Automated data collection and computer-aided report
preparation facilitate the mental connection between graphed data and physical
activity, allowing students to focus on the trends and implications of data,
rather than its collection, and acquainting the students uith technology
currently used in working laboratories. The successes of the project will be
shared with the Science Education community through workshops, presentations at
professional meetings, and journal publications.
