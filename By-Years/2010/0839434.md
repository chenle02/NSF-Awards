This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project proposes to
develop a smart wheelchair system that will integrate onboard LIDAR for position
estimation and obstacle detection with an adaptive motor controller framework.
The resulting smart-chair will be capable of autonomous navigation outdoors, and
under real-world environmental conditions. This technology will be integrated
into the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS). ATRS represents a new
paradigm in personal auto-mobility for wheelchair users. It affords complete
mobility independence while providing a safer and more economical transportation
alternative to van conversions. The proposed smart-chair will be the heart of
ATRS. It will navigate autonomously between the driver's seat position and a
lift platform at the rear of the vehicle where the chair will be automatically
secured and stowed for transport. This eliminates the need of an attendant for
stowing and retrieving the wheelchair for the
driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to transportation is critical for Americans
with disabilities and the elderly to participate fully in basic activities such
as employment, education, worship, job training, commerce, recreation, and other
activities of community life that most people take for granted. By facilitating
personal transportation, the proposed smart-chair system will improve personal
independence and the quality of life for the physically challenged across the
country. It will also help remove one of the greatest hurdles preventing
wheelchair users from finding employment. With the number of people 65 and over
in the U.S. expected to double from 35 million people in 2002 to 70 million by
2030, a sizable market is expected. The benefits of the technology-based smart-
chair/ATRS paradigm over van conversions include lower cost, improved safety and
greater vehicle choice.&lt;br/&gt;
