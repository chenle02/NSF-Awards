Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0112117&lt;br/&gt;E. Meiburg, Et. Al, University of
California Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI together with
his two colleagues at Santa Barbara request funding to purchase a mid-range
parallel computer dedicated for the large scale simulations of fluid dynamics of
complex liquids. The specific research areas are (1) the fluid dynamics of
highly nonideal mixtures of chemical species, (2) the flow of complex fluids
with microstructures, including polymer liquid crystals and suspensions, and (3)
high Reynolds number flows of dilute polymers. &lt;br/&gt;
