9322114 Duncan A number of theoretical investigations in Quantum Field Theory
and specific aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the Standard Model of
Electroweak physics will be carried out. The methods employed will mostly be
nonperturbative, including Monte Carlo simulations in lattice QCD, analytic
improvement of perturbation theory, and 1/N expansions. The lattice calculations
will lead to high-precision first-principle evaluations of decay constants and
mass splittings in the B-meson system, of central importance for upcoming
studies of B-meson phenomenology in B-factories. Nonperturbative techniques are
essential for attacking problems in strongly-coupled field- theories such as
QCD. The problems attacked represent fundamental issues of topical interest in
Quantum Field Theory and matters of direct phenomenological relevance to current
and future generations of particle accelerators. ***
