Project Number 0243227 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rowan University&lt;br/&gt;PI:
John Chen&lt;br/&gt;Title: Adaptation of Concept Inventories for Rapid Feedback
and Peer-Assisted Learning in Core Engineering
Courses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our study is being
conducted under the Adaptation track of the Assessment of Student Achievement in
Undergraduate Education Program. The goal of our project has been to adapt the
Concept Inventory for frequent classroom use, and to implement it in a system to
provide rapid feedback to students of their understanding of key concepts during
classroom lectures. This rapid feedback system acts as the focal point and
catalyst to encourage students, working in pairs, to assist each other in
correcting misconceptions or deepening each other's understanding of the topic
at hand. Furthermore, the system allows the professor to assess the students'
level of comprehension (or misconception) in a just-in-time fashion, and thus
guides his or her pacing and coverage of the material. The system and
methodology has been implemented in at least three core-engineering courses at
two institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
