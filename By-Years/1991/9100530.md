Current approaches to uncertainty management in AL and expert systems largely
ignore the dynamics of large-scale problem solving. For example, much research
has focused on the problem of computing the answer to a single query or set of
queries, given a static problem model. However, advanced work in large scale
problem solving, such as story and image understanding, reveals that such
queries are interspersed in a larger stream of model
specifications/reformulations and evidence assertions. This research has as its
goal the understanding of the functionalrequirements for uncertainty management
at this higher, task- oriented level, and the development of uncertainty
management systems which provide efficient support for these requirements.
