0216343&lt;br/&gt;Lowman&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of an Environmental Scanning
Electron Microscope (ESEM),is requested. To date, no Philadelphia area
universities have ESEM capabilities, so this project would also be of
significant interest to local universities and industries through partnerships
established through the Nanotechnology Center. Additionally, the proposed work
will have a strong impact on Drexel University's educational initiatives with
respect to community outreach, mentorship activity and graduate/undergraduate
education. This will also include high students through summer courses designed
for underrepresented minorities from Philadelphia schools as well as students
from Math and Science academies. Additionally, new graduate and undergraduate
curricula are being established that will make use of ESEM as a training tool.
