The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will acquire original notes and drawings
of the world-class, rock deformation apparatus known as the "Paterson Rig."
Professor Paterson is 91 years old, and he is no longer building his highly
reliable and highly productive machine. Professor Paterson will provide his
insights into the art and craft of design considerations for the next generation
of his machine. All materials resulting from this interaction will be archived
at the Digital Conservancy at the University of Minnesota, such that all
scientists will have free and open access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University
of Minnesota-Twin Cities will acquire original notes and drawings of the world-
class, rock deformation apparatus known as the "Paterson Rig.?" Co-PI, Dr. Mark
Zimmerman, will visit Professor Mervyn Paterson in Australia to accomplish two
goals. First, drawings and documentation (working notebooks) will be physically
transferred for scanning and archiving at the Digital Conservancy
(http://conservancy.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota. Second, Drs.
Paterson and Zimmerman will review together the critical features of the design,
particularly tricks of the trade that are essential elements of the art and
craft of building complex equipment. This information will allow improvements of
the current design for particular applications and be the basis for new machines
in the future.
