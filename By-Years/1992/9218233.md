In this collaboration, Dr. Herbert Fried, of the Brown University Department of
Physics, will work with Dr. Brian McKellar at the Department of Physics of the
University of Melbourne, Australia, on problems associated with the definition
of the infrared approximation in Quantum Chromodynamics, in a non-perturbative
formalism containing both quarks and gluons, and the binding structure of quark-
antiquark and three-quark states. Current techniques and theory cannot be
applied to large-scale structure. The U.S. PI has recently defined new methods
to approach the problem and would collaborate with Australia's leading expert in
this field. The results may enhance our understanding of the fundamental
structure and behavior of matter.
