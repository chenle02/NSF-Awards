This award is for research by a senior University of Houston faculty member, a
research assistant professor and a graduate student. The project has three
distinct component activities. The major effort is the SMC experiment at CERN,
which studies inelastic scattering of polarized muons on polarized protons and
deuterons. In this way information is gotten on the underlying quark constituent
contribution to the nucleon spin, the spin-dependent structure functions. The
group continues to be involved in R&amp;D for the GEM detector to operate at the
SSC. Some attention continues to be given LVD still in construction at Gran
Sasso in Italy. LVD is expected to detect neutrinos emitted in stellar collapse,
gather information about possible oscillations among neutrino types and seek
evidence of proton decay.
