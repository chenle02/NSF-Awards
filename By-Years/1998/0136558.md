Recent scholarship has identified a set of social and economic conditions that
led to the creation of segregation and of a legally-defined racial order in the
United States and South Africa. Yet similar circumstances and needs did not
result in comparable institutional and social arrangements in Latin American
countries with a substantial population of African descent. Why? That is the
central question that this research project seeks to answer. Building upon
recent historiography on Atlantic slavery and using Cuba as a test case, this
study seeks to identify some of the conditions that prevented the creation of
segregation in Spanish America. The researcher suggests that the legal,
institutional, and ultimately cultural settings in which slave regimes developed
are indeed crucial to understand post-emancipation race relations. These
settings established the ideological and cultural boundaries of what would later
be politically possible. This research attempts to identify the opportunities
for claims making that colonial legislation and institutions created for slaves
during the long colonial period. Traditional Iberian law, represented mainly by
the 13th-century code Las Siete Partidas, conferred a limited legal personality
to slaves, as illustrated by several slave "rights": to marry even against the
will of the master, to seek judicial protection in case of abuse and
mistreatment, and to access manumission. These opportunities for claims making
could have contributed to the creation of a political culture of inclusion and
indeed to what has been described as the integration of the Africans and their
descendants into colonial society. In turn, a political culture of inclusion and
integration would facilitate the emergence of cross-racial forms of mobilization
such as the nationalist coalitions that fought for independence in Cuba and
elsewhere in Spanish America. To test these hypotheses, the principal
investigator will use archival resources that contain local regulations, court
decisions, cannon laws, pastoral letters and church documents.
