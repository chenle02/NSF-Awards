Most of the web is not designed for accessibility for the nearly one billion
people that have a disability such as blindness, low vision, motorphysical
impairments, or dyslexia, and no comprehensive, precise verification tools
currently exist for checking accessibility. Existing testing tools are limited,
imprecise, and incomplete, and even when they are used, they give guarantees
only about one particular web browser configuration such as window size, default
fonts and colors. This project aims to enable the formal verification of web
accessibility. The research to be pursued involves the automatic identification
of a broader class of accessibility problems that is currently possible and is
intended to give guarantees of absence of such problems for all possible web
browser configurations. The software tools developed in this project are
intended to give web developers and content producers targeted, concrete
feedback on who is affected by an accessibility issue, and why, and how to fix
any problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a user interface logic
for specifying accessibility properties, and formalizes a large fragment of
browser rendering algorithms using novel finitization reductions. The project
builds software tools that translates web pages, accessibility rules, and the
browser algorithm to quantifier-free linear real arithmetic, using an SMT solver
to verify it or produce a concrete, inaccessible rendering of the webpage. To
make the results of these verifications useful and usable to developers, content
producers, and web users, the investigators develop new classes of concrete,
comprehensible, and actionable warning explanations and new techniques for
patching accessibility at run time. To evaluate all of this work, the project is
partnering with Adobe, Instructure, and Wikimedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
