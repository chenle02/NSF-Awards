ABSTRACT This is a joint proposal to support the Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice
Interactions (OAII) Science Management Office (SMO) and Science Steering
Committee (SSC). The SMO will be located at ODU and the chair of the SSC will be
at UT. The SMO will support the activities of the OAII SSC (e.g. workshops,
planning meetings, and coordination with international science projects),
publish a newsletter, promote correspondence of OAII results at national
meetings and between PIs, facilitate logistical arrangements, and promote
integration of OAII activities with other components of the Arctic System
Science (ARCSS) Program. The SSC will conduct planning meetings for future OAII
science projects, appoint working groups to conduct workshops for development of
science plans for new initiatives, and provide the ARCSS Program with an
assessment on priorities for OAII global change initiatives/projects in the
Arctic that are developed through the workshops.
