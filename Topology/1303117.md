The PI plans to continue working on various topics in the representation theory
of groups, with special emphasis on problems related to the Kazhdan property T
or pro-finite groups. The main aims of the project are to study the expansion
properties of Cayley graphs and to understand various representation theoretic
properties of pro-finite and discrete groups. The project also involves studying
objects central to the geometric group theory, like automorphism groups of free
groups. The PI will use algebraic, combinatorial, geometric and probabilistic
tools to reduce the proposed problems to questions in combinatorics and theory
of random walks and apply the results to important open problems in graph
theory. As a byproduct of the project, questions in these areas are likely be
answered.

Expanders are highly-connected sparse graphs widely used in Computer Science, in
areas ranging from parallel computation to cryptography. Margulis gave the first
explicit construction of expanders, following Pinsker's observation that random
sparse graphs are expanders. This construction was improved in the eighties by
Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak who constructed Ramanujan graphs
(optimal expanders) using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years
the scope and depth of applications of expanders has increased -- over the past
decade several completely new and unexpected lines of development have emerged
and the field has undergone explosive growth. The principal investigator plans
to pursue projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial
interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics.
