This research project concerns the mathematical theory of optimal decision
making under uncertainty. A particular focus will be put on problems arising in
quantitative finance, where a classical issue is to maximize an investor?s
future gain or to minimize their future risk. We will further develop the
probabilistic theory underpinning the modeling and investigation of such
problems. A particular focus will be put on situations where, in addition to
randomness, models have to reflect some particular discontinuities that can
occur in the system. One example is that of optimal investment in a company
subject to possible bankruptcy proceedings or, more generally, subject to
possible drastic changes. In addition to developing the mathematical theory, we
also aim to further the understanding of the numerical computation of such
systems so that the outcomes of the project will directly benefit the financial
engineering and academic communities. Moreover, the proposed research activity
will include mentorship of undergraduate as well as graduate students, and
scientific dissemination through presentations and publications in scientific
journals.

It is well-known that the value and optimal strategies of many optimal
stochastic control problems can be characterized by (forward) backward
stochastic differential equations. However, the rather strong regularity
conditions imposed on coefficient of these equations for their well-posedness
severely restrict the realm of control problems that can be tackled with these
probabilistic methods. The goal of this project is, in the first part, to
develop a set of new ideas that can be used to study well-posedness and
regularity of solutions of backward stochastic differential equations with rough
coefficients and the associated second order partial differential equations. The
main approach we envision will make ample use of strong compactness criteria
from the theory of Malliavin calculus. Then, we will consider a number of
applications, including application to rough partial differential equations,
quantitative finance (portfolio optimization problems) and optimal transport.
Putting our theoretical results together with newly developed deep learning
approaches to the approximation of backward stochastic differential equations
will further allow to numerically simulate the solutions constructed in some of
the application areas.
