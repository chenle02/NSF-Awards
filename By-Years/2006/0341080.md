Chemistry (12) This project is developing a resource GUide to Research for
Undergraduates (Web-GURU) intended to facilitate faculty mentoring of
undergraduates participating in undergraduate research (UR) experiences in the
field of chemistry. The project personnel are developing and field testing a set
of web-based modules unique to the UR experience that are used by undergraduates
for self-study or by faculty mentors either in formal classroom settings or
research group meetings. The project benefits all parties involved in the
undergraduate research enterprise and should improve the quality of student
undergraduate research experiences. The project is expected to positively impact
the training of undergraduates and inform the practice of UR widely. The
intellectual merit of this project includes the development and investigation of
the value of a web-based mentoring resource for undergraduate students involved
in undergraduate research experiences in chemistry. The broader impacts of this
work include (1) improving the education of future STEM faculty, teachers, and
practitioners through the creation of a knowledge database of materials and
methods that enhance student learning during the undergraduate research
experience; (2) sparking complementary efforts by other UR practitioners; and
(3) encouraging the participation of new faculty to develop UR efforts and thus
expanding the practice of UR even more widely. &lt;br/&gt;
