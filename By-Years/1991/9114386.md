Dr. Fisher will initiate three types of investigations of hydrothermal vent
invertebrates with chemoautotrophic symbionts. These studies will address
specific major gaps in our understanding of the species at 13N on the East
Pacific Rise; the techniques developed will be useful in future investigations
at any hydrothermal vent site with bivalves or tubeworms. The first is a
determination of the in-situ tube growth rate of the tubeworm Tevnia
jerichonana, and associated measurements which allow conversion of these
measurement to growth on a weight basis. The second involves development and
employment of new and modified techniques for physiological investigations using
intact gill preparations (from B. thermophilus) incubated under pressure as
models of intact animals, and isolated bacterial preparations to study symbiont
physiology. The third series of experiments are studies of vestimentiferan
symbiont concentration and autotrophic carbon fixation rate by R. pachyptila
symbionts, and expand previous studies to a second species of vestimentiferan
for comparative purposes.
