0353201&lt;br/&gt;Monaco, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project is for
support of project planning activity involving Dr. Gregory Monaco, Director of
Research, Great Plains Network Consortium, University of Kansas, Lawrence,
Kansas and Dr. Abdelhadi Soudi, the Center for Language, Communications and
Computer Science at the Ecole Nationale de L'Industrie Mineral (ENIM) in Rabat,
Morocco. They plan to meet with a number of U.S. potential participants in an
interdisciplinary research and education agenda in the area of Human Language
Technology. The technology will be applied to English and Arabic dialects, and
possibly to indigenous languages as well. Soudi has done recent interesting work
in natural language processing, and has visited laboratories in the United
States and Britain, and the projects undertaken during those visits have been
successful. The scientists intend to use the results in undergraduate and
graduate education. Advances in human language technology would of course have
broader impact on the way people use computers in everyday life. Advances in
Arabic language processing are long overdue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This
award will allow the Moroccan scientist to visit the U.S. P.I. and his U.S.
colleagues, who come from a variety of backgrounds. These various backgrounds
are potentially useful for the planned research on the subject of human language
technology. Dr. Soudi and Dr. Monaco have had previous contacts, and have
jointly submitted one conference paper. They plan to obtain widespread
involvement and commitment of other individuals in this region as envisioned in
this project and to iron out the details of the research collaboration through
face-to-face meetings.&lt;br/&gt;
