AST-9618491 Collaborative Project: Integrated Models of Star Formation. This
project involves the construction of integrated models of star formation through
collaborative efforts of the astrophysical theory groups at the University of
California at Berkeley and New York University headed by Frank H. Shu and Alfred
E. Glassgold respectively. The work will build on Shu's expertise in
magnetohydrodynamics and Glassgold's expertise in atomic and molecular physics.
The integrated theory must encompass not only a description of the system's
magnetohydrodynamics, but also its physical state. Both of these are critical
for the radiation and chemical diagnostics of young stellar objects and the
planetary systems that they may harbor. The project has the ultimate objective
of producing critical observational tests of the theory that can exploit the
improved capability in angular and spectral resolution that will become
available in the next decade. ===========================================
