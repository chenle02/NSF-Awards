Symbiotech, Incorporated proposes to determine the feasibility of using
bacteriorhodopsin to construct an optical detector and discriminating device.
The proposed device will provide a new means for gathering and deciphering
optical information. It is anticipated the proposed device coupled to
appropriate algorithms will possess the capacity for size and shape
discrimination, motion detection, and coordinates determination.
