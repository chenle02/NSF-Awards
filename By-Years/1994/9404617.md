9404617 Klein This research proposal centers on two unique types of Precambrian
iron-formations in Brazil. The first is the iron and manganese region of Urucum
which is of Late Proterozoic age. The second, of Archean age, is in the Serra
dos Carajas region of Brazil and is considered the largest Archean deposit of
high-grade iron ore in the world. These two iron-formations have been selected
for detailed geologic, petrologic and geochemical studies (major elements, REE,
total organic carbon, and C and S isotopics where appropriate). This is in full
cooperation with Professor Eduardo A. Ladeira of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais in Belo Horizonte and several of the Brazilian mining companies. Results
from these studies will allow for better constraints in global geochemical
models of evolution of the ocean and atmosphere in Precambrian time.
