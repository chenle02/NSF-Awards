The focus of this project is to evaluate the potential of cold shock promoters
for the expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli following a shift
to a low temperature culturing condition. The primary objective of this project
is to characterize the expression of different model recombinant proteins placed
under the control of the cspA cold shock promoter. The strength and inducibility
of the cold shock promoter in directing the low temperature synthesis of
proteins which are produced in a biologically active conformation under normal
growth conditions will be first compared and contrasted to those of the widely
used tac promoter. Potential advantages of cold shock promoters are facilitated
folding, and a reduced degradation of recombinant proteins. The cspA-controlled
production of a recombinant protein susceptible to aggregation, and a recominant
protein susceptible to degradation under normal growth conditions will be
specifically investigated. The secondary objective of this project is to extend
initial shake flask studies to pilot scale fermentations in order to demonstrate
the usefulness of cold shock promoters for the large-scale production of useful
proteins.
