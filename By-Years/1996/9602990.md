9602990 VanOrden This U.S.-Mexico Planning Visit will provide travel support to
Drs. Ann C. VanOrden and Desmond C. Cook, of Old Dominion University, so that
they may make research planning, site inspection and coupon exposure trips to
the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. They wish to plan a research proposal in
corrosion research with Drs. Juan J. Carpio and Luis Maldonado Lopez of the
Universidad Autonoma de Campeche. The objective of this research is to use
highly accurate instrumentation to determine the chemistry and crystallography
of the oxide phase found in corrosion products formed in differing environments,
and to correlate the corrosion products and corrosion rates with the
environmental parameters available from the atmospheric monitoring of the sites.
This planning visit will allow the investigators on both sides to finalize
research plans and to evaluate the designated sites, which present some very
harsh atmospheric exposure conditions. ***
