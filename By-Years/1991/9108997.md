This action is for partial support of the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council Committee on Seismology. The activities of this committee which
are relevant to the Earthquake Hazard Mitigation program include planning and
assessment of earthquake strong motion data and earthquake early warning
systems; planning for symposia and workshops; and the publication of academy
reports on specialized topics such as the 1987 "Recommendations for the Strong-
Motion Program in the United States". This committee, in cooperation with the
Committee on Earthquake Engineering, is considering methods to implement the
recommendations of this report. The Seismology Committee has a history of
addressing areas of concern to the NSF Earthquake Hazard Mitigation program.
These activities provide an important input into earthquake hazard mitigation
studies.
