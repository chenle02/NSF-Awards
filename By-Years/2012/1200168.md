This project is jointly funded by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic
Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber
Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the
Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
&lt;br/&gt;The project includes optimization of Erbium incorporation for
enhanced optical efficiency; development of device fabrication processes of
nitride optical amplifiers and emitters active at 1.5 microns; and new
applications in optoelectronic technologies. The planned research will involve
training of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of novel materials
growth, characterization, nano-fabrication techniques and material/device
processing using the state-of-the-art facilities. The Er-doped III-nitride
photonic structures may lead to novel electrically pumped optical amplifiers.
Such devices would possess the unique advantages of semiconductor optical
amplifiers (small size, electrical pumping, and ability for photonic
integration) as well as those of Er-doped fiber amplifiers (minimal crosstalk
between different wavelength channels in optical networks). The studies would
also provide input for the development of suitable quality materials and the
fundamental understanding of material properties, as well as the technological
advancement in the fabrication of integrated optoelectronic devices active from
infrared to deep UV. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal has the
potential to make transformative advancements in development of electrically
pumped, semiconductor optical amplifiers for optical communications and
information processing. The project will involve training of graduate and
undergraduate students in the areas of novel materials growth, characterization,
nano-fabrication techniques and material/device processing using the state-of-
the-art facilities. In addition, the PIs will continue their close relationship
with local middle - high schools students and to recruit women into their
research.
