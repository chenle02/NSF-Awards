Many of the most influential current approaches to international relations
theory appeal to analogies between the international system and oligopolistic
markets. However, the existing formal economic models of oligopoly have few
counterparts in international relations theory. In this research the
investigator develops a formal approach to international relations theory by
beginning to formalize this analogy. Preliminary research by the investigator
has already developed a natural model of a bipolar international system;
established conditions sufficient to ensure the existence of a peaceful
equilibrium in which neither state attacks; shown that there is a strictly
Pareto dominant pair of peaceful equilibrium payoffs; and characterized the
unique pure-stragey, peaceful, Markov perfect equilibrium that yields these
payoffs. In the model, increases in the cost of fighting, a state's level of
risk aversion, a state's discount factor, and the advantages of striking first
are shown to increase the equilibrium level of armaments in the system. More
generally, the model provides a framework for analyzing broader issues in
international relations theory including the role of anarchy and the problem of
absolute and relative gains. The current research extends this model in an
effort to incorporate incomplete information, link the model with existing
formal work on crisis bargaining, and broaden the scope of the analysis to
encompass several issues in international political economy.
