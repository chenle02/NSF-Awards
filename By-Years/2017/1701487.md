Joel Leja is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to conduct a program of research and education at Harvard University. Leja will
build an accurate theoretical model to infer the physical properties of galaxies
from astronomical observations. Understanding these properties will allow
astronomers to gain a better understanding of how galaxies form and evolve.
Alongside this research, Leja will provide science enrichment to middle school
students through "reverse" science fairs, and he will serve as a mentor to
minority undergraduate students to help prepare them for graduate studies in
astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leja will develop a realistic model to fit the
spectral energy distribution of galaxies to better than about 50%. He will
include the effects of active galactic nuclei in the model and calibrate it
against well-studied photometric and spectroscopic galaxy catalogs. After full
calibration, he will fit the model to nearly 10,000 galaxies spanning redshifts
from 0.2 to 3.0 available in photometric catalogs. The fitting will yield the
deepest, largest sample of self-consistent stellar masses and star formation
rates to date and provide key constraints on feedback models of galaxy
formation. For the educational component of his work, Leja will organize reverse
science fairs where professional scientists will present their research to
middle school students, and he will mentor minority undergraduate students in a
summer program that prepares them for astronomy graduate programs through
research and study experiences.
