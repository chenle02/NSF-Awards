L'evy processes form a family of models that is the cornerstone of the modern
probability. Research related to L'evy processes is broad and deep, and the
results are used in further research in probability, in other areas of
mathematics, and in numerous applications. This proposal is designed to make
funds available to support researchers from the United States who are interested
in participating in the 5th L'evy conference in Denmark in August 2007. This
will serve to increase timely dissemination of ideas between the specialists
working on L'evy processes, and stimulate the research by the younger people,
particularly by the students.

There is at least a perception, and it is based on available evidence, some of
which is provided in the proposal, that much of the research activity on L'evy
processes is conducted outside of the US, mostly in Europe and Japan. This
proposal aims to take a step towards improving the visibility of the research on
L'evy processes done in the United States and also making it more obvious to
graduate students and junior researchers that research in L'evy processes is an
important and interesting area to pursue.
