Arc welding is an important unit operation, widely used for joining parts into
assemblies. It is desirable that it be automated, not in the sense of
"unattended" (because of fire hazard), but in the sense of "aid to the operator"
(helping him to be more productive). In this work additional information will be
extracted from arcs for the purpose of insuring weld quality. The approach
requires performance of nine tasks: modeling of electrical arc welding signals,
data acquisition, signal analysis based on first-order statistical measures,
signal analysis based on second-order statistical measures, signal analysis
based on waveform features, effect analysis--correlation of direct weld defects
with signal measures, casual analysis--correlation of weld defect causes with
signal measures, microcomputer implementation, and real-time feedback control.
