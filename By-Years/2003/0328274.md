PROPOSAL TITLE: Collaborative Research: Biologically Inspired Cilia-Driven
Microscale Robots

Recent advances in smart electroactive polymers have created a unique
opportunity to combine microscale science, robotic engineering and biomimetics.
These materials can be applied to microscale structures of arbitrary shape with
biomimetic features. Largely inspired by nature, we propose an approach in
integrating electroactive materials and control into a new class of cilia-driven
microscale robots. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate key
scientific issues on: i) materials development and identification, ii)
biomimetic design of microscale cilia structures, and iii) robotic controls. The
proposed cilia-driven microscale robot systems have a wide spectrum of future
engineering applications such as drug delivery micro-robots and micro-
colonoscopy systems.

The goal of the proposed research program is to provide students with the
expertise to broadly address the future needs of industry and academia in small-
scale science and engineering as well as robotics on small scales. Also, the
proposed study will help increase the diversity in the research and educational
mission of this effort.
