This grant provides travel and subsistence to students so that they can attend
the Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), which
this year is being held San Jose, California in June 2011 as part of the
Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). PLDI is a top conference in the
field of programming language and compiler technology. Attending enables
students to hear the latest results in the field, meet with other researchers,
and build community with the next generation of researchers.
