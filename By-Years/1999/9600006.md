This three-year award, which supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
molecular biology, involves Maria Tasayco of the City University of New York's
City College and Michel Godlberg and Alain Chaffotte of the Institut Pasteur in
Paris, France. The objective of their research is to study the protein folding
problem. Specifically, they will investigate pathways by which fragments of E.
Coli thioredoxin reconstitute the original structure of macromolecules. Through
the study of the function of thioredoxin, they propose to elucidate structure
and the protein folding pathway. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in structural studies and approaches. This is
complemented by the French investigators' expertise in kinetic studies of
protein folding. The research will advance our understanding of the relationship
between structure and function in biological macromolecules.
