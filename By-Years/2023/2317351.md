This grant provides funding for US-based researchers to participate in a two-
week long scientific school and workshop that will take place May 2-12, 2023 at
the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. The
focus of the meeting will be commutative algebra and algebraic geometry in prime
characteristic and mixed characteristic, an area of pure mathematics that has
seen fantastic advances in recent years. The ICTP is focused on supporting
advanced studies and scientific research in developing countries. Support from
this grant will give scientists from the US the opportunity to participate in
the meeting and to interact and collaborate with a cohort of researchers from
the developing world, as well as other leading international experts in the
field.

In more detail, with the inception of tight closure theory in the 1980s,
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry in prime characteristic has become an
important and vibrant field of mathematics. It has lead to vast improvements and
simpler proofs of many results. It has also provided notions of singularities
that are defined purely algebraically but correspond, somewhat mysteriously, to
types of singularities that appear in birational geometry over the field of
complex numbers. Commutative algebra in mixed characteristic, the study of rings
that do not contain any field, has seen the introduction of new methods and
spectacular advances through the recent solution of the celebrated homological
conjectures. The scientific school and workshop at ICTP will give students
early-career mathematicians an opportunity to get involved in these fast moving
areas, and more experienced researchers will have a chance to initiate new
trans-national collaborations. The website for the scientific school is
