This project addresses the need for decision support for supply chain
coordination at the operational level. We consider four practical environments
where scheduling decisions made by different decision makers in a supply chain
need to be coordinated. For each, the proposed research will begin with an
evaluation of conflicts, or how far from optimal one decision maker's optimal
schedule is for another decision maker's problem. The estimation of conflicts
requires developing solution procedures for the scheduling problems of the
individual decision makers. Where conflicts are significant, several further
analyses are needed. Some of these relate to the optimization of the overall
system. More generally, the benefit of cooperation needs to be evaluated for the
various decision makers. These analyses require the development of solution
procedures for the overall system problem. Since this problem is more complex
than those of the individual decision makers, heuristic solution procedures may
be needed. Asymmetric power relationships in the supply chain generate various
scheduling problems that also require investigation. Finally, it is important to
find incentives to encourage the decision makers to coordinate their decisions,
and practical mechanisms for implementing
coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive industry support underlies the
project. The models to be investigated are motivated by the PIs' frequent
interactions with industry. Because of the generality of the problems studied,
the results can be applied broadly and have the potential to offer significant
advances in decision support for industry's planning problems. The educational
component of the project involves the training of future scholars, the
development of new courses and seminars, new research experiences for both
undergraduate and graduate students, and the incorporation of new applied
research into the curriculum, at the business schools of both PIs.
