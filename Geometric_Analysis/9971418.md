Abstract

Award: DMS-9971418 Principal Investigator: Peter Li

In this project, the principal investigator proposes to study various analytical
aspects of a complete manifold in relation to its geometrical structure. In
particular, he proposes to understand the space of polynomial growth harmonic
functions on a general class of manifolds that includes manifolds with non-
negative Ricci curvature and also minimal submanifolds of Euclidean space which
has Euclidean volume growth. He also proposes to understand the structure of the
image set of harmonic maps and it implications to the underlining geometric,
topological, and complex structures. Finally, he proposes to investigate the
impact of the validity of a global mean value inequality with sufficiently small
mean value constant.

The study of geometric-analytical structure is a fundamental and important part
in the development of mathematics. It also has direct implications to many
branches of sciences and engineering, such as, general relativity, robotics,
material science, and computer graphics.
