&lt;br/&gt;In many cities of the US public officials are demolishing public
housing and relocating poor families into dispersed private housing, following a
program called HOPE IV whose goal is to "deconcentrate" poverty. Two competing
models predict different outcomes from this relocation: Social Disorganization
(SD) asserts that public housing projects generate negative social capital and
that escape will relieve those problems, and further that relocation
neighborhoods will afford new social opportunities and access to new valuable
information. Cooperative Assets (CA) regards the social ties of public housing
to be positive assets embedded in kinship and locality networks, so that
relocation will harm reciprocal support arrangements, and further that
relocation neighborhoods will be hostile or at minimum unfamiliar, so the net
effect of relocation will be to harm families. &lt;br/&gt;This study by a team
of cultural anthropologists from the University of South Florida will measure
the social networks of a sample of affected households in two sites in Tampa,
Florida, representing the most typical receiving areas to HOPE VI programs.
Methods include formal interviews with a random sample of 100 households and
their non-HOPE neighbors, participant observation and semi-structured key-person
interviews and documentary analysis to establish a statistical profile of each
site. The results will be valuable to planners as well as to affected
communities, to inform public policy as well as to help participant households
cope with the problems of adjustment to relocation. &lt;br/&gt;
