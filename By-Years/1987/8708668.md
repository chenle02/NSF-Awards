Interactions within animal societies are a complex mix of cooperation and
conflict. This study will examine how the individuals in the honey-bee colony, a
society exhibiting an extreme degree of cooperation, are nonetheless in conflict
during certain of the colony's activities. The study focuses on the point of
greatest conflict in honey-bee social life: the division of the colony between
queens during swarming. It is among the first in hundreds of years of
observations on bees to describe the behaviors of individual bees during
swarming and afterswarming. Of special interest in this study is an
understanding of how the bees decide which queens leave with swarms and how many
swarms (queens) are produced, and how these decisions, resulting large-scale,
colony-wide events, are built up from the behavior of individuals. This research
will contribute to the general theory of social behavior by testing predictions
of current evolutionary theory within a colony of advanced social insects. It
will add to understanding of the way in which evolution shapes animal
communication, and it will broaden our view of the nature of the societies of
the advanced social insects by showing how, because they are genetically
distinct, individuals within these societies may sharply conflict, although they
so often cooperate. In addition, the control of swarming in honey bees remains
one of the unsolved problems in practical management of honey bees for honey
production and pollination of food crops. This research into the surprisingly
little-studied social biology of swarming may thus have practical implications
for the beekeeping industry and agriculture.
