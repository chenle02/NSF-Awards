Building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems are comprised of
many different pieces of equipment, which are controlled individually and
separately. By coordinating the operation of these systems in real-time,
significant energy savings are possible. However, the changing nature of
building systems require that this coordinated control strategy be flexible and
modular, with the ability to adapt to new equipment or changes in building
operations. This award supports both fundamental and applied research to create
and demonstrate algorithms capable of coordinating building systems to reduce
energy usage, while maintaining or improving the comfort of building occupants.
Results of these research will directly benefit the United States by reducing
building energy costs and environmental impact. The project will also help
broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hierarchy of control strategies investigated
in this project includes lower level control strategies that compensate for the
inherently nonlinear behavior of building energy subsystems, while preserving
the intuitive controller design and tuning methods common to current equipment.
The research also investigates a supervisory distributed predictive control
algorithm that is capable of determining to the system-level energy optimal
reference trajectories for lower-level controllers. The distributed controller
requires minimal communication between systems, and is modular and adaptable to
changes in building equipment or operational conditions. The coordinated
controller minimizes energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. By
including occupant demands in the predictive controllers, the system can also
provide feedback to users regarding the energy costs associated with specific
behaviors, and help shape occupant behavior.
