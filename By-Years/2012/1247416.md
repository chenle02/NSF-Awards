This award is a travel grant to fund underrepresented groups to attend the 2012
Software Engineering Educators Symposium (SEES12) and the 2012 ACM SIGSOFT
Conference on Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE12). This proposal aims to
help address problems of the low representation of women and minorities in
computer science graduate degree programs in the United States. It will supply
travel awards to educators from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), liberal
arts colleges, and primarily teaching universities to attend the 2012 Software
Engineering Educators? Symposium (SEES12) and the 2012 ACM SIGSOFT Conference on
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE12). SEES12 aims to (1) expose educators
to tools and techniques for teaching software engineering and programming that
they can use to interest their students and better prepare them for graduate
work in SE; and (2) establish connections between educators at PhD granting
research universities and those at target institutions that will serve as
avenues for recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women.
