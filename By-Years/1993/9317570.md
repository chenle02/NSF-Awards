In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Dr. Thomas Flood, Chemistry Department, University of
Southern California, will undertake synthetic and mechanistic studies of
reactions between hydrocarbons and transition metal complexes. The reaction
types to be investigated are fundamental to all of organometallic chemistry and
transition metal-based catalysis with the targeted systems providing well-
defined examples in which carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-oxygen
bonds are formed and/or cleaved. A variety of effects which may influence these
reactions will be evaluated, with particular attention being paid to a
comparison between amine and more conventional ligands. Mechanistic studies will
be carried out using physical and spectroscopic methods. Carbon-hydrogen,
carbon-carbon, and/or carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken and/or formed in
countless chemical reactions, including those involved in many industrial
processes. A large number of these reactions are facilitated by metal containing
catalysts. Consequently, an understanding of how metals mediate such processes
and how they interact with reacting species is of profound importance. This
research will both improve our fundamental understanding of these important
processes and provide the information needed to design more efficient metal
catalysts.
