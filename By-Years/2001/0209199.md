Mining sequential patterns and structured patterns (e.g., trees, lattices, and
graphs) are important data mining tasks, with broad applications, such as the
analysis of customer purchase sequences and Web page structures, understanding
of disease treatments, scientific experiments, transportation and production
processes, detection of anomaly and unusual patterns, discovery of bio-molecule
sequences and structures, and so on.

This project is to perform a systematic investigation of the principles,
algorithms, and applications of scalable sequential and structured pattern
mining, which covers the following issues: (1) development of highly scalable
mining algorithms, including mining max-patterns, closed patterns and top-k
patterns; (2) investigation of highly flexible mining methodologies, including
mining of multi-dimensional multi-level sequential and structured patterns and
constraint-based mining; (3) extension of the scope to cover sequential or
structured pattern-based clustering; and (4) application of multi-dimensional,
multi-level sequential or structured pattern mining for intrusion detection, Web
mining, and other important applications. This will lead to a set of efficient,
scalable, and flexible sequential and structured pattern mining methods for
scientific and industrial applications.
