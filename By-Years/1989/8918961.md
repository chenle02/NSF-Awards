This proposal is to conduct a hydrographic cruise in the southeastern Pacific
along longitudes 88 and 150 degrees west. As a central element of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the cruise will provide measurements of
temperature, salinity, nutrients, and many additional tracers useful to describe
the ocean circulation. The proposal is closely linked to a number of additional
specific activities on the cruise, and to other WOCE activities.
