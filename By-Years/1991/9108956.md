Detecting the occurrence of an underlying change in a process, when observations
are only related probabilistically to the state of the process, has long been a
problem of concern to statisticians, engineers, economists, epidemiologists,
etc. In this proposal, we use the context of machine monitoring, although
applications to areas such as quality control, health, military surveillance or
economic analysis should be readily appparent. We propose to address four issues
that are relatively neglected both in the literature and in practice: (1) Rather
then focusing on the expected time until the first false alarm is raised, given
the system remains `in control', we propose the use of the more practical
concept of `false alarm rate', the expected number of false alarms per unit time
during the entire monitoring process. (2) Rather than focusing on the expected
time to detect the system as out of control, given it is out of control, we
focus on the expected time between when the system goes out of control and when
it is detected as out of control in the course of the monitoring policy. (3) We
propose to investigate various exact and approximate ways to compute system
operating characteristics. (4) We propose to examine the sensitivity of
operating characteristics to changes in expected time between system failure,
relative discriminatory power of sampling devices and the existence of natural
times at which to monitor and take actions.
