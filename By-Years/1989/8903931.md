Modulation and coding for the "recording channel" has much in common with the
techniques for the data transmission channel, but there are also some striking
dissimilarities. One of these is that for the magnetic recording channel there
is a "saturation type" nonlinearity which essentially constrains the channel
signal to be two-level. The information and communication theoretic aspects of
recording is a relatively new field and it has had some remarkable successes in
improving storage efficiency and reliability. This project addresses several
topics in this new field, starting with modeling the signal distortion and noise
properties of the recording channel, then studying spectral density and other
statistical properties of combined modulation/coding formats which incorporate
run-length and other constraints imposed by the nature of the recording channel.
Other topics include error-control coding and efficient detection/decoding
techniques.
