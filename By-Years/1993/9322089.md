9322089 Thews Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in ongoing
research projects in experimental physics are structured in a summer REU
program. Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics
activities, under the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of
Physics at the University of Arizona. The main student audience will be those
who have finished the equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in
science or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for transfer to
a 4-year degree program. This program will also be available to similarly
prepared students from regions outside southern Arizona who will be resident in
Tucson during the summer. Graduate Teaching Assistants from the physics
department will serve as mentors for the students. Special orientation and
skills activities will be individually tailored to enable the students to make
significant contributions to the research projects. Opportunities exist in many
cases for the students to continue their associations with the research project
after the completion of the summer REU program, most often as paid laboratory
associates. Recruitment activities will place special emphasis on women and
underrepresented minorities. Because most students will start in this program at
a very early point in their scientific education, we encourage continuity in
their development by allowing past participants to apply for admission in
subsequent summer sessions. ***
