The marine geochemistry of rehenium (Re) has attracted interest in recent years
due to its extreme enrichment in reducing relative to oxygenated sediments and
the utility of ReOs geochronometer for dating ancient black shales. Recent work
has pointed out the essential features of its oceanic behavior, including its
long residence time and conservative distribution in seawater. In this regard,
Re is similar to Mo and U in its marine chemistry, all of which occur as oxo-
ions or oxo-ionic complexes in oxic seawater. All three elements are also
enriched in anoxic sediments relative to oxic sediments, by factors of 500 (for
Re) to 5-50 (for Mo and U). It appears that Re is not enriched in any other
sedimentary phase. Recent work has suggested that these elements (as well as V)
may be used as indirect proxies for the redox state of ancient oceans, or of
depositional environments. These suggestions follow one of two approaches: the
first would utilize the sedimentary concentrations of the elements, while the
second relies on records of their seawater concentration contained in
foraminiferal calcite. This research will studt Re in the context of these other
elements to determine whether it may be a useful indicator of paleoenvironment
using either of the two approaches. Re concentrations will be measured in pore
waters and sediments from a variety of depositional environments, including
anoxic basins, low-oxygen hemipelagic sites, and fully oxygenated hemipelagic
sites. The results of this investigation will attempt to answer basic questions
about the mechanism of Re enrichment in anoxic sediments and relate Re behavior
to environmental parameters.
