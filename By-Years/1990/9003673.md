This project continues the existing support for research in Mexico of several
cultural anthropologists from the University of California-Berkeley. The project
studies the medical and pharmacological ethnobotanical knowledge of a group of
Mayan Indians living in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The project will prepare
an encyclopedia of plants with their medicinal and pharmacological properties
and local customary uses, as well as herbarium collections in Mexico and in the
USA. This project is important because the traditional knowledge of Indian
peoples is a valuable part of our human biodiversity resources. By analyzing
these local communities' ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological knowledge, and
matching that knowledge with biological assays of the biochemical properties of
the plants, this project will add to our understanding of the nature of
traditional ethnobotanical knowledge.
