Long-term research abroad: Hippocampal Zinc-Containing Neurons This award
recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-Term Research at
Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to enable U.S. scientists
and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of
proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to the applicant's field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicant for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. The project is under the direction
of Dr. Rosemary E. Frederickson, Department of Psychology, University of Texas
at Dallas, in collaboration with Dr. Gorm Danscher, Institute of Anatomy,
University of Aarhus, Denmark. The award recommendation provides funds to cover,
as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
