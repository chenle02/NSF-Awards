A9302348 Knut The aim of this research is to investigate the role of
stratospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the ozone chemistry and abundance. The
researchers will measure NO2 column densities at two high-latitude sites in the
northern hemisphere using twilight absorption spectroscopy in the wavelength
range 430-450 nm where NO2 has appreciable absorption features. One of these
sites (Svalbard, Norway, 78 degrees N) is expected to be inside the polar vortex
more frequently than the other (Fairbanks, Alaska, 65 degrees N). The
measurements will be conducted on a continuous basis providing a baseline for
NO2 abundance under perturbed as well as unperturbed stratospheric conditions.
This set of measurements will allow these researchers to study differences in
NO2 climatology between the two sites and relate the NO2 abundance to
stratospheric ozone content, temperature, and circulation. Radiative transfer
modeling including the effects of spherical geometry and refraction in the
presence of cloud and aerosol layers will be used to construct synthetic spectra
that will allow them to study the sensitivity of the retrieved NO2 abundance to
cloud and aerosol effects as well as the feasibility of retrieving NO2 vertical
profiles.
