Abstract 9314722 de Zafra This project will use millimeter-wave detectors to
measure atmospheric column densities and vertical profiles of chlorine monoxide,
nitrous oxide and ozone from the ground at McMurdo, Antarctic during the austral
spring of 1994. These trace gases are crucial to the understanding of the
formation of the annual Antarctic ozone hole. The measurements will be carried
out in conjunction with the NASA sponsored ER-2 aircraft project which will be
flown from Christchurch, NZ to Antarctica during this time period. This project
is part of the Global Change initiative. Part of the support for this project is
covered by NASA through an on-going grant. ***
