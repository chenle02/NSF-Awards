Recent technological developments have brought on a revolution in the design
and operation of warehousing systems. Trends in manufacturing such as the just-
in-time operating philosophy have produced an increased demand for efficient
storage/retrieval systems. Within the fields of inventory control, warehousing,
and order picking, significant research has been conducted in the development of
operating philosophies, analytical models, and control algorithms. Much of this
theoretical research has yet to be applied successfully to actual situations.
There is real need for the integration of current material handling knowledge
and for the development of systems to apply this theory and research to
manufacturing and warehousing. %%% The objective of this research is to develop
an expert system that will address the issue of dynamic control of a warehouse
system that experiences changing control variables and changing constraints. A
system which will build upon the current sequencing knowledge and research and
broadens its scope to apply to a real world dynamic system.
