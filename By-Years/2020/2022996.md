The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) develops and maintains
multiple community models for modeling the atmosphere. The next generation
vision for community models of the atmosphere at NCAR includes the strategic
development of the System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA). The
University Cooperation for Atmospheric Research’s (UCAR) Cooperative Program’s
Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (UCAR/CPAESS)
plans to bring together model developers and model users from the weather,
climate, atmospheric chemistry, and space weather communities with an end goal
of creating a 5 year plan for the SIMA. CPAESS will use professional
facilitators experienced with Ideas Labs to create an environment that results
in new dialog about the future vision for community models.

This project aims to identify the needs and associated requirements of the
university research communities involved in the modeling of weather, climate,
air quality and space weather. The goals of the project are to create a modeling
framework that a.) reduce duplication of efforts across communities, b.) allow
climate, weather, geospace and chemistry communities to collaborate and share
innovations, c.) provide modeling capability that transitions smoothly across
space and time scales, d.) enables the exploration of new science for the
research community, e.) eases the burden of implementing new technology, and f.)
allows capitalization on next-generation HPC technology.
