Dr. Anthony Haymet is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop new statistical mechanical theories
which can be applied to the freezing of liquids including those which exhibit
significant quantum effects at low temperatures. This research will provide a
deeper understanding of the important natural phenomena associated with liquid
to solid phase changes and superfluidity. Haymet will extend the current density
functional theories of freezing, which he has been instrumental in developing,
by combining them with modern quantum path integral techniques so that he can
treat freezing of quantum liquids and liquid mixtures. In his preliminary
calculations on helium-4 he has discovered a self correlation effect which
drives the quantum freezing process, and which has no counterpart in classical
fluids. In essence it is the "quantum swelling" which is responsible for the
non-classical behavior.
