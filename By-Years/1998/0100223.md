Underwater landslides have generated several local tsunamis reaching at least 30
meters in elevation this century -- most recently on Flores Island, Indonesia in
1992. In addition, these events typically occur close to shore and offer very
little time for warning, and can be devastating to nearby coastal development.
Underwater landslides often pose the greatest local tsunami
hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsunamis generated by underwater landslides are
governed by at least six fundamental parameters, which are functions of
landslide geometry and kinematics. In addition, nonlinear interactions may occur
between waves, shoreline, and landslide. Consequently, predicting landslide
tsunami amplitudes requires sophisticated numerical
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have developed an accurate and efficient
model of inviscid, irrotational, fluid dynamics during tsunami generation, based
on a Boundary Element Method (BEM). A three-dimensional (3D) version, the
''Tsunami Open and Progressive Initial Conditions System'' (TOPICS) is an
analytical tool that provides estimates of tsunami features and initial
conditions. The source code is distributed freely to academic, nonprofit, and
government researchers, in order to facilitate tsunami hazard assessment within
the tsunami community (see: www.tsunamicommunity.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
action is to support research to refine the effects of landslide shape, motion,
and deformation, on tsunami generation, describing three-dimensional effects
during tsunami generation, coupling tsunami generation and propagation models,
validating these numerical methods with experiments and actual case studies, and
producing more accurate versions of TOPICS for the tsunami community. The
fundamental goal is to predict accurate tsunami source features.&lt;br/&gt;
