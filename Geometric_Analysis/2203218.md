Singularities arise naturally in many areas of science and mathematics.
Sometimes they are technical obstacles to overcome, while in other cases they
encode essential features of the problem being considered. In this research the
focus is on singularities of minimal submanifolds and of the Lagrangian mean
curvature flow. Minimal submanifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of
minimal surfaces, which model soap films. Their study is very classical, but
some basic questions remain unanswered about their behavior near singularities.
Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a particular kind of minimal submanifolds,
which have received a great deal of attention recently due to their appearance
in string theory. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is a natural evolution
process by which we can attempt to find special Lagrangian submanifolds, however
once again the appearance of singularities is the basic difficulty. This
research project aims to understand some common features of singularities which
appear in families, in contrast with most previous research that focused on
isolated singularities. Progress on this problem will have applications to many
other related questions in geometry and analysis. The project also includes
several educational activities aimed at increasing interest and success in STEM
fields at all levels. Specifically, the educational activities include: a week
long summer math circle aimed at students in grades three to five; support for
undergraduate research; the continuation of a summer undergraduate workshop in
geometry and topology; and the continuation of a bridge program for beginning
graduate students to ease transitioning to graduate school.

The most basic information that can be obtained from a singularity in many
geometric problems is its tangent cone or tangent flow. The question of the
uniqueness of such "tangent objects" is one of the most basic problems in
geometric analysis and it is only well understood when singularities are
isolated. The PI will study non-isolated singularities in two related settings:
minimal hypersurfaces and the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. The tools
developed for understanding the uniqueness of tangent cones and flows in these
settings will also have applications to important geometric problems: the
classification of minimal hypersurfaces with prescribed behavior at infinity;
the generic smoothness of minimal hypersurfaces; and the possibility of
surgeries at singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in
connection with the Thomas-Yau conjecture. In addition to these specific
applications, the PI expects that the new methods introduced in connection with
the above problems will have applications in other areas of geometric analysis.
