The project is concerned with the quantitative analysis of random and physical
processes, viewed both as application areas where techniques from theoretical
computer science can be useful, and as an impetus that suggests novel directions
for CS theory. Â In addition to core research topics in theoretical computer
science (algorithms and computational complexity), the project makes connections
with the fields of probability and statistical physics by examining them through
the "computational lens."

Specifically, the project will address the following two broad themes:

1. Random processes with an algorithmic flavor: the rigorous study of iterative
algorithms for matrix pre-conditioning that are widely used in numerical linear
algebra but poorly understood theoretically; the analysis of certain fundamental
Markov chains that are beyond the range of current techniques; and the
understanding, from a computational viewpoint, of non-linear stochastic
processes known as "quadratic dynamical systems," which generalize the classical
Boltzmann equation in physics and models for recombination in population
genetics.

2. Computational aspects of statistical physics: the development of more
sophisticated techniques for studying the key property of spatial mixing in spin
systems and its algorithmic implications; the investigation of stability
properties of naturally occurring combinatorial polynomials (partition
functions) in statistical physics, and their applications to algorithms and
computational complexity; and the potential application of models from
statistical physics to the study of phenomena such as viral marketing in social
networks.

Broader impacts of the project include graduate student training in the
interdisciplinary field of theoretical computer science, statistical physics and
applied probability.
