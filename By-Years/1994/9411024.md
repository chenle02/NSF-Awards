The PIs propose to examine self-managed work teams (SMWTs). Such teams consist
of non-management employees who make management decisions related to their own
work. Such teams are becoming more prevalent in the US economy in an attempt to
lower management costs as well as improve quality. Two theories relating to
SMWTs are those of Hackman (1988) and Salas et al. (1992). The PIs will test
these two theories by examining the performance levels of various work teams in
order to determine which theory's predictions provide a more accurate
description of the data. Participating organizations will include Boeing, Texas
Instruments, and the Department of Defense.
