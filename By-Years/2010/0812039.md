This project is motivated by the needs of disaster response teams, which include
efficient waste removal, humanitarian aid, electronic group buying, air cargo
transport, and power transmission planning. However, the strategies that the
project explores apply to many cooperative work environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on the problem of forming coalitions
in an environment in which tasks are dynamic, agents are presented with
inaccurate and unreliable information, agent trust is used to evaluate offers,
and a combination of leadership and incentives are used to improve the
efficiency of coalition formation and operation. The project is (1)
investigating simple local strategies that lead to desirable group behavior, (2)
evaluating the scalability and adaptability of these strategies, (3) showing
that through mechanism design the coalition framework can temper bias and
increase the global good without restricting the algorithms used by self
interested agents, and (4) showing that leadership increases
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing of algorithms and
adaptive strategies to aid artificial (virtual, machine) agents in dynamic and
unknown environments, but the research has implications for human society, which
include applications to emergency response and other cooperative work, and also
for theorizing about the way individuals and groups respond to the many forms of
bias in areas such as promotions, hiring, and college admissions.
