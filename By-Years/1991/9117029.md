This project represents a collaboration between a leading theorist and a well-
respected observer to attack in a detailed manner the questions of the nature
and evolution of radio sources in clusters of galaxies. An extensive data base
of some 300 cluster radio sources will be prepared, and theoretical modeling of
the evolution of these sources will be tested against that data. Radio,
infrared, and optical data will be utilized, and various extensions of the
standard model for these sources will be tested, as well as alternative
evolutionary models.
