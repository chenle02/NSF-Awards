This project is designed to increase the technical literacy and awareness of the
general population of Mission College students through cooperation with regional
colleges and universities as well as industry. The College plans to develop a
course which is easily transportable throughout the State of California. A
statewide network is currently in place through which the results can be quickly
disseminated. Project activities include outreach to scientists and engineers in
the community, collaboration with faculty in various disciplines, visiting
counterpart schools, researching topics, experimentation, and the construction
of simple prototypes.
