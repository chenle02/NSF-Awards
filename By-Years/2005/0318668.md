The National Science Foundation will support a workshop and a symposium
associated with an initiative to support Terascale Linguistics. The workshop
will be held in Monterey, CA, on October 25-26, 2003. The symposium is planned
for the Linguistic Society of America's annual meeting in Boston, January 8-11,
2004. The workshop in Monterey will include presentations and work sessions, the
goal of which is to develop an initiative prospectus. The prospectus will
represent the range of interests that Terascale Linguistics serves and show the
impacts for future linguistic science. The symposium in Boston will present the
leading ideas of the initiative as encapsulated in the prospectus to the field
at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leading idea of the Terascale Linguistics
Initiative is simple: research based on an abundance of data, made available by
linguists for linguists, presenting opportunities for advancement in theoretical
work and integration of that work both with research from other subfields as
well as with results from other disciplines. The aim is to build on the
potential for new methods and technologies to catapult research into new realms,
re-evaluating the current practice in all aspects of linguistics in light of
developments over the past 20 years in theoretical linguistics, computational
technology, and data collection and storage. This initiative is broad in scope.
It will span research in NSF's Linguistics Program, and it has direct
connections to the Human and Social Dynamics Priority Area, as well as to
various disciplines represented in the Computer and Information Science
Engineering Directorate. &lt;br/&gt;
