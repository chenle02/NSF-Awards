The Desert Studies Center (DSC) is a residential field station located in the
Mojave Desert operated by the California State University system. This facility
supports research and education activities in a location that offers a unique
wealth of living organisms geological features that are valuable for scientific
field research. Over the past 48 years under the support of the California State
University system, the DSC has ably served university and extension courses,
workshops, and conferences. Currently the DSC supports several thousand
overnight visits per year, though most users are visiting for educational
purposes. The DSC has tremendous untapped potential for supporting research.
This project supports the development of a five-year strategic plan for the
Desert Studies Center to foster the development of research infrastructure and
promote institutional sustainability.

The development of the strategic plan for the DSC will be informed by a 1.5-day
workshop to be convened early in 2024 at the Desert Studies Center. The workshop
will be independently developed and implemented by an external evaluator who is
experienced with institutional planning. Participants in this workshop will
include DSC staff, regional stakeholders from partner agencies and
organizations, current and potential users, and experts in field station
research and operations. Several weeks before the workshop, all invitees will
receive a detailed survey that will guide the development of the workshop and
the planning effort, and after the workshop finishes, participants will be asked
to provide feedback on the process and additional information to support the
development of the strategic plan. After the workshop, with support of the
evaluator, the steering committee of the planning effort will develop the formal
strategic plan.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
