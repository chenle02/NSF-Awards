Solving polynomial systems is a fundamental problem in mathematics with
applications to various fields of science and engineering. The free and open
source software PHCpack applies symbolic-numeric and polyhedral methods to solve
polynomial systems. As a new interface to PHCpack written in the Python
scripting language, phcpy improves the functionality of PHCpack. The
implementation on parallel computers to compensate for the cost overhead of
multi-precision arithmetic will enable scientists and engineers to solve larger
systems faster and more accurately. A web server developed with phcpy will give
anyone with an internet connection access to the developed
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solvers in PHCpack apply homotopy
continuation methods, blending symbolic-numeric with polyhedral algorithms.
Numerical approximations to solutions are computed with Newton's method.
Solutions are approximated symbolically by Puiseux series, which originate at
initial forms defined by the Newton polytopes of the polynomials in the system.
The design of phcpy gives a flexible interactive scripting interface, without
sacrificing efficiency as compiled code in PHCpack is executed. The package
phcpy will provide the tools for a scalable compute server to serve requests
submitted to the web server. Multithreaded implementations on multicore
processors accelerated by graphics processing units compensate for the cost
overhead of double double and quad double arithmetic.
