The proposal describes an investigation of magnetospheric dynamics using
various activity indices and sophisticated non-linear analysis methods. The
proposed research has three goals: 1. to examine the size and frequency of
active magnetospheric periods and to determine the degree of non-linearity of
the magnetospheric response to the solar wind drivers, 2. to investigate the
stability of the solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere system, and 3. to
determine predictive functional relationships between input and output
variables.
