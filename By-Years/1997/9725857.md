9725857 Vergeront The Minnesota Children's Museum, in collaboration with the
American Library Association will develop a project to engage children ages two
through seven years old and their parents in exploring mathematics through
hands-on, book-based math activities in libraries and children's museums across
the country. The main elements of the project are: 1. A 1200 square foot exhibit
at the Minnesota Children's Museum; 2. A traveling exhibit to ten children's
museums over a six month period; 3. Five smaller versions of the exhibit will
travel to 75 libraries sponsored by the American Library Association. Each
library that apply for the exhibit must present a plan in which 50 percent of
their exhibit audience will be children and families of the under-represented,
lower income groups, and racial and/or ethnic groups. 4. Programs and materials
will be designed to provide parents with the means to actively participate in
their children's math education. The collaboration of the Minnesota Children's
Museum and the American Library Association draws together two organizations
whose natural constituencies are parents with young children. Project 1,2,3 is
designed to be national in scope and creates multiple formats within which
families can enjoy exploring math. Its goals and objectives reflect four
messages: start early, math is everywhere, parental involvement and get into
books. The project Principal Investigator (PI) Ms. Jeanne W. Vergeront received
her Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Science in Child and Family Studies and
Environmental Design, respectively from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Currently, she serves as the Vice President, Educational Projects at the
Minnesota Children's Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.
