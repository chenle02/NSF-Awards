This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Molecular genetic analysis of the chloroplast-
encoded rpoA and rpoB genes of Chlamydomonas" is to be carried out in the
laboratory of Dr. David Stern at Boyce Thompson Institute. Dr. Sturm has
received her Ph.D. training working on RNA editing in the trypanosome
mitochondria. In her postdoctoral training, she will focus on the regulation of
gene expression in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in
Plant Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding young
investigators in plant biology.
