This is an award for conduct of research the objective of which is to
determination the technical and commercial feasibility of a windowless exit
portal for an electron beam emerging from an accelerator tube for use in
irradiation of gases, liquids and solids. The research objectives include
determination of the optimum design of a transverse nozzle for the windowless
design, analysis of the scattering losses, design and production of a complete
electron-optical and vacuum system for the electron beam acceleration tube.
Results are expected to provide the basis for design and fabrication of a
prototype device potentially useful for wastewater treatment, decontamination of
hazardous organic substances, disinfection of water, treatment of exhaust gases
derived from the combustion of fossil fuels. This is an award for support of
Phase II of a project, Phase I of which was initiated under NSF Grant No. 89-
60943 under conditions stated in Program Solicitation NSF 89-30, Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR). Results are expected to provide the basis for
engineering design of innovative processes and systems to remove environmental
pollutants from waste streams.
