Building on the results of a previous grant, this research will collect and
compile data sets in computer readable files, and conduct a comparative
empirical and theoretical study of the nature, evolution, and implications of
specific non-market economic institutions in England and Italy between the
twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The research will concentrate on the
institutions that supported "anonymous" markets for goods which are separated by
time place such as credit markets and contracts for future delivery. An
extensive data collection effort and a theoretical framework, building on recent
developments in game theory, contract theory, and organization theory, will
facilitate an empirical examination of these institutions. In addition, the
study is aimed at compiling data sets which will provide a better understanding
of the institutions that governed agency relations in Genoa during the twelfth
and early thirteenth centuries. To analyze and present this data, the research
will take advantage of an analytical method which so far has not been utilized
by economic historians, namely, network analysis. This research is important
because it will shed new light on the nature and evolution of modern
institutions, thereby facilitating the understanding of the institutional
transition that developing economies and the economies of the former Eastern
block still face.
