The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that
contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these
plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced
alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well
as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need
for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This
project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in
compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging
products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as
protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell
waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high
quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required
to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process
developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable
sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the
industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and
create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as
expanded polystyrene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
