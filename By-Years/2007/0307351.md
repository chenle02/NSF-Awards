This research will continue a theoretical and numerical investigation of the
role of chaos in galaxy structure and, especially, in galaxy evolution. It will
attempt to explain three issues of fundamental importance. Firstly, why is
violent relaxation so effective? Transient chaos triggered by large-amplitude
oscillations may explain both rapid evolution and why the final state is
comparatively insensitive to the initial conditions. Secondly, could galaxies
that reach near-equilibrium quickly, subsequently show slower systematic
evolution? And finally, the work will try to provide a dynamical explanation for
correlations observed in the kinematics of early-type galaxies.

The work has broad inter-disciplinary implications for studies of non-neutral
plasmas and charged particle beams, which will be explored in collaboration with
charged beam dynamics experts. It will also support a graduate student.
