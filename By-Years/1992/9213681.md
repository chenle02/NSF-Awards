In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Curl and Tittel of Rice University will investigate the high
resolution infrared spectra of free radical species using infrared kinetic
spectroscopy. The absorption infrared spectra of free radicals prepared using
excimer laser photolysis is obtained using a single-frequency continuous-wave
infrared probe laser by means of a difference frequency generation scheme
developed previously by these investigators. Transient radicals to be studied
include C4H, HCCO (ketenyl), HCCCO (propynonyl), and HCCCH (propargylene). A
technique for observing the high resolution spectra of radicals cooled in a
supersonic jet expansion will continue to be developed and applied to analyzing
the CO stretching vibrations in CH2OH (hydroxymethyl). %%% Free radicals are
highly reactive, transient species which are produced as intermediates in many
different chemical reactions. In this research project transient free radicals
will be produced, and their characteristic absorptions of infrared radiation,
that is, their vibrational spectra, will be examined for the information they
can provide on the structure and nature of these short-lived species. Such
information has a bearing on the fundamental nature of chemical bonding in these
important reaction intermediates and impacts our understanding of such diverse
areas as combustion reactions and molecules in interstellar media.
