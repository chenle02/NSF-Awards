This Project is in the area of the Chemistry of Life Processes and is supported
jointly by Chemistry and Biochemistry. It involves the production of antibodies
that are potential enzyme-like catalysts. The project is directed toward the use
of monoclonal antibodies to simulate the features of enzymes by exposing them to
antigens that mimic the transition state of the desired chemical reaction.
Catalytic antibodies that take advantage of transition metal ions as Lewis acids
might simulate the activity of a wide variety of metalloenzymes catalyzing
important chemical transformations. The transition state of such processees is
obtained from the complex consisting of the substrates coordinated to the metal
ion through a reactive functional group. Antibodies made against metal chelates
with substrate-like ligands may act as metalloenzymes by favoring assembly of
the substrates and metal cofactor in the combining site through antibody-
assisted chelation. The chemical process is allowed, then dissociation of the
complex releases the products. This project is a continuation of one previously
supported by the Foundation grant DMB-8607352.
