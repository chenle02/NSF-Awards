This project will examine adaptive synchronization protocols that monitor the
execution of the parallel simulator, and automatically adapt the simulator's
execution to optimize performance. Adaptive mechanisms allow the underlying
simulation system to achieve maximum performance, particularly for dynamically
changing workloads that often arise in practice. These mechanisms can also
simplify the development of parallel simulation software to the extent that some
degree of performance "tuning" is automatically performed by the simulation
system, rather than by the application programmer, who may not be an expert in
parallel simulator performance. A protocol that uses memory allocation to
control execution is proposed. A second problem that will be addressed concerns
analyzing and defining suitable incremental state saving methods that are
designed to execute efficiently with rollback-based parallel and distributed
simulators. Both problems will be attacked using experimentation on
implementations running on multiprocessor hardware, and analytic modeling
techniques.
