The proposed project focuses on defining the design constraints and mapping the
educational potential of various emerging technologies. The goals are to
identify key emerging technologies that have the potential to transform science
education; examine critical issues in science education reform that could point
to potential uses for emerging technologies; explore how these emerging
technologies can be anticipated by educators and harnessed to improve practice
in formal and informal science education; outline the characteristics of a
research agenda for science education in the context of these emerging
technologies; and disseminate insights from the retreat to the science education
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day conference will include 12 invited
discussants and up to 20 experts (observers). Pre-conference activities are
guided by a steering committee. Post-conference activities include a published
report of the conference findings&lt;br/&gt;
