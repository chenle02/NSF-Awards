This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop an
innovative role-based software for science education. Using a schema called
"scenario-based assessment" the company has gathered evidence in controlled
studies that this software is effective in helping students to learn and solve
science problems. This project will study the feasibility of using enhanced
versions of this software to improve K-12 science education by: a) freely
disseminating the software to a range of public and private schools in North
Dakota; b) creating and providing an array of support documentation to accompany
the software: user manual, teacher guide and suggested lesson plans; c)
providing online "help desk" technical support for the period of the grant; d)
coordinating assessment studies and lesson narratives conducted on the company's
behalf by teachers at the schools. This research will address two questions: 1)
what is the level and type of support necessary to enhance adoption rates; and
2) what are the measurable effects on K-12 student learning that arise from
using this software in school.

The commercial application of this research will be a self-sustaining
educational media company that takes intellectual property created by the NDSU
research team and develops and expands it to produce commercially viable role-
based educational simulation environments. This research is aimed at developing
and distributing new models of science education, and providing science teachers
with new methods and materials for the classroom, thus promoting teaching and
learning. Its questions in Phase I will inform the handling of the feedback loop
from teachers to developers, thus enhancing the infrastructure for research and
education partnerships. These approaches have the potential to change the way
science is taught in the schools. As the goal of science instruction is to help
foster a scientifically literate public, the goal of this project is to help
foster better science education.
