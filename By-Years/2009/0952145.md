Cloud computing is transforming our perception of how computing, storage, and
networking resources are consumed and managed; yielding improved cost
efficiencies, and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Along these lines,
this project explores the merits of "Colocation Games" (CGs) as a novel,
economically-sound framework upon which emerging cloud architectures could be
implemented. CGs enable the modeling and analysis of the dynamics that result
when rational, selfish parties interact in an attempt to minimize the individual
costs they incur to secure the shared cloud resources necessary to support their
application QoS or SLA requirements. CGs offer an attractive alternative to
approaches that require such parties to trust cloud providers (who may have
conflicting incentives), or those that expect such parties to be altruistic or
to accept best-effort approaches that do not guarantee performance isolation. In
addition to developing the analytical underpinnings of CGs and variants thereof,
this project involves the implementation and experimental evaluation of some of
these variants for cloud infrastructures, paving the way for the development of
a revolutionary distributed resource management alternative for autonomic, self-
organizing systems, in which the adoption of a global optimization approach
(centralized or distributed) would be neither practical nor justifiable. This
project involves the application of techniques from economics to the design of
distributed systems. The interdisciplinary training of students along these
dimensions promotes technical innovations that are not only cognizant of, but
also mitigate the tussle between the various stakeholders of fledgling cloud
computing architectures
