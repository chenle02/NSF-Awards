This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will establish market
demand for a novel electrically mediated leveling technology and position the
technology for market launch via a joint venture. The specific Phase II
objectives are: 1. Scale-up and demonstration of the electrically mediated
process on eight inch wafers, 2. Development of a process library for feature
sizes 1-5 down to 0.17 microns, and lower, and 3. Design of a "proof of concept"
plating tool. Preliminary concept design of a plating tool incorporating the
electrically mediated process will be performed by an outside firm. The
sustainable competitive advantage associated with the project for leveling is
cost. Minimal overplate will eliminate or minimize the need for
chemical/mechanical planarization (CMP) by reducing the copper waste slurry
compared to the state-of-the-art copper metallization processes. This in turn
would eliminate the associated control, environmental, and cost issues.
