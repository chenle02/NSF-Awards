This is a three year program sponsored by San Jose State University which will
provide leadership training, science content instruction, and hands on
laboratory and demonstration activities to 85 teachers, grades 7-12, from about
30 schools in the local area. The target group will be teacher-leaders in
science education in the schools. A high percentage of the students in these
schools will not be college bound but will need background in the sciences in
order to work in the local industries many of which are science oriented. The
schools serve minority and disadvantaged communities. These teachers, after the
program, will become Supervisors of Student Teachers and will carry on as
mentors/advisors to the pre-service teachers so that what they have learned in
their teacher education programs will be reinforced in their student teaching
experiences. Thus a new generation of teachers will enter the profession trained
and experienced in-up-to date science content, pedagogy and hands-on activities.
The project teachers are also expected to serve as resource agents for their
colleagues with the objective of having all science teachers eventually use
current science pedagogy. The National Science Foundation is providing funds in
the amount of $401,023 for the project. These funds are being matched by
$178,777 from the local school district and San Jose State University. This
amounts to approximately 45% in matching funds.
