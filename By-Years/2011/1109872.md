Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are remnants of the swarm of primitive bodies that
accreted in the outer parts of the protoplanetary nebula as the Solar System
formed. They have diverse spectroscopic and dynamical properties, which may
represent a coded memory of chemical and orbital processes early in the Solar
System's history. Remarkably, 15% of KBOs are found orbiting about each other in
binary or multiple systems. This provides a way to measure KBO masses and
constrain their histories, as well as to test theories for the evolution of the
protoplanetary disk. But first, the orbits themselves need to be determined. In
this project, the collaborating team will carry out high-resolution imaging
observations of KBO binaries, using the laser guide-star adaptive optics system
on the Gemini-North telescope, roughly doubling the sample of known orbits. The
observing program will obtain semi-major axes, eccentricities, periods, and
spatial orientations for the orbits over the course of 3 years. From the data,
constraints on object masses, shapes, and composition will be derived. The
statistics of the orbital elements will constrain both the mode of binary
formation and the subsequent evolution, which are tied to conditions in the
protoplanetary nebula. In addition to the observational program, the proposing
team will contribute to Lowell Observatory's middle-school outreach program for
the Navajo and Hopi communities, and will supervise undergraduate students in
research. Lowell's partnership in the Discovery Channel Telescope project will
also contribute to broader public understanding of astronomy.
