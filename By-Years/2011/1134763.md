The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a high priority project in the
international high-energy physics program. As part of an ongoing effort to
educate and train young scientists for this project, the ILC Global Design
Effort (GDE), the ILC Steering Committee (ILCSC) and the International Committee
for Future Accelerators (ICFA) Beam Dynamics Panel will jointly organize the
Sixth International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders in 2011 to be held
at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, CA. This award
provides funds for partial support to U.S. students to attend the school.
