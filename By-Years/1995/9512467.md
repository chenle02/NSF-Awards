ABSTRACT Proposal: 9512467 PI: Cave, R.J. Institution: Harvey Mudd College This
award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at Harvey Mudd College acquire several workstations (two IBM RS600,
two SGI Indigo, three SGI Indy and a DEC Alpha 300) to establish a computational
facility. The research activity to be supported includes studies of
phthalocyanine thin-films on silicon and gold, ab initio studies of electron
transfer processes, fluorescence studies of chromophores in micelles, synthetic
and physical organic treatment of reactive intermediates, the characterization
and phase-behavior of liquid crystalline materials, and the study of self-
assembling monolayers. A workstation network of fast, modern computer
workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and
visualization facilities.
