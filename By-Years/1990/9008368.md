This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "The Purification of the VirB11 Protein, Characterization of
the ATPase and Autophosphorylation Activities, and Study of the Role of the
VirB11 Protein on T-DNA Transfer in A. tumefaciens." The Research Fellowships in
Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional areas of plant
biology who wish to extend their training in new techniques and to those trained
in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to gain experience working with
plants. These fellowships are designed to increase the number of outstanding
young scientists in plant biology.
