This project uses a two wavelength (4278 and 6300 A) intensified optical all sky
imager which was especially developed for this project to make digital and video
images of the aurora above South Pole Station. The objective is to investigate
the electrodynamics of the polar cap and cleft regions by making measurements of
the auroral precipitation patterns and interpret the results in terms
coordinated observations of magnetic, radio wave absorption images and high
frequency coherent scatter radar measurements. It is hoped that understanding
can be gained about the source regions and energization mechanisms of auroral
particles and other forms of energy inputs into the high latitude atmosphere.
The Lockheed Space Sciences Laboratory is uniquely qualified to make these
measurements.
