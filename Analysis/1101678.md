Complex analysis of several variables is a branch of mathematics where analysis,
algebra, and geometry intertwine. The complex Laplacians studied in this project
are the second-order differential operators associated with the Cauchy-Riemann
or tangential Cauchy-Riemann complexes. The main goal of the project is to study
the spectral theory of these Laplacians, in particular, the interplay between
the spectral behavior of the complex Laplacians and the geometric structure of
the underlying spaces. Problems to be addressed in this project include explicit
computations, positivity, pure discreteness, and stability of the spectrum. The
principal investigator will also study boundary behavior of the Bergman and
Szego kernels, as well as the relationship between these kernels.

Complex analysis is an essential tool in physics and engineering. The classical
differential operators known under their technical names as the Dirichlet- and
Neumann-Laplacians have been used to study heat diffusion and fluid dynamics by
physicists and engineers for more than two centuries. The so-called complex
Laplacians are the analogues of these classical operators in the setting of
complex analysis in several variables. Spectral theory of differential operators
plays an important role in many areas of biological, medical, and physical
sciences. For example, the inverse problem--the problem of determining the shape
from spectral properties--has applications in fields such as medical imaging.
Pure discreteness of the spectra of the complex Laplacians is intimately related
to diamagnetism and paramagnetism, topics widely studied in quantum physics and
chemistry. Ideas and techniques developed in this project can potentially have
repercussions in other branches of mathematics and sciences. The project also
has significant impact on the development of human resources: the principal
investigator will develop topics courses and engage graduate and undergraduate
students in research activities. Research in this project will be incorporated
into the teaching and learning process. In addition, this project will also
facilitate interdisciplinary research activities among mathematicians,
biologists, and computer scientists.
