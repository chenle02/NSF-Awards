Magnetic levitation, confinement and shaping of molten metals will be studied.
Modeling of the magnetic field and corresponding metal geometries will build on
previous work to develop tools for computing source configurations and to
develop improved models of magnetohydrodynamic interactions and instability
mechanisms. The models will be validated by experimental studies of the
levitation-shaping of thin strips from a flowing metal stream. Initially low-
melting metals will be used. Later the studies will be expanded to include
liquid steel in medium scale tests.
