This grant will support the Particle Data Center at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory. This group is responsible for collecting the results of many
different particle physics experiments and providing them in summary form. They
also make this information available on the Web. In addition, they provide an
interactive Web site for the general public which allows anyone interested in
Particle Physics to explore many of its concepts.
