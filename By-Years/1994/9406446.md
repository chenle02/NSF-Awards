The long term objective of this research program is to elucidate the mechanisms
of cell interactions that control cell fates during early embryogenesis.
Signaling between embryonic cells is a fundamental mechanism of cell fate
specification in all multicellular animals. An understanding of cell-cell
interactions in the early embryo will require not only an analysis of the
molecular basis of the signaling, but also an understanding of the cellular
context of such interactions within the embryo. With these goals in mind, the
proposed research program involves an integration of cellular and molecular
methodologies. The P.I. will apply these experimental strategies to the
developing sea urchin embryo, a manipulable, optically transparent experimental
system. He plans to focus on a key regulatory interaction that occurs between
the two principal populations of mesodermal cells in the embryo, primary and
secondary mesenchyme cells (PMCs and SMCs). PMCs transmit a signal during
gastrulation that suppresses the skeletogenic potential of SMCs and directs
these cells into an alternative developmental program. This interaction plays an
important role in the specification of SMC fates and the process of
skeletogenesis, and serves as a model system to study embryonic regulation and
cell signalling in the early embryo. Three key aspects of the PMC-SMC
interaction are to be addressed: (1) the development of new methods for studying
the dynamics of cell fate-switching in living embryos; (2) the properties and
molecular basis of PMC signaling; and (3) the properties of the responding SMCs.
The proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of a central
issue in developmental biology. In addition, this research program will continue
to support the training and development of young developmental biologists at the
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.
