Worldwide, many lakes undergo large changes in fish populations and nutrient
loading. The impact of each of these common changes is well-known for pelagic
communities, but poorly known for benthic communities. Furthermore, nothing is
known about the interaction of fish and nutrients in structuring benthic
communities, or about the impact of this interaction on benthic-pelagic
coupling. This project will test the responses of benthic algae, macrophytes,
and invertebrates to the three levels of fish predation and two levels of
nutrients created by the Madison team. Benthic response variables will include
abundance, species composition, size structure, biomass, and production of
algae, macrophytes, and invertebrates. A central focus is the degree to which
benthic responses to fish and nutrients will compensate for pelagic responses. A
central hypothesis is that progressive fertilization will prompt a rapid,
threshold shift from benthic to pelagic primary production. Without the
simultaneous measurements of pelagic and benthic responses, our understanding of
the response of lake dynamics to management efforts would suffer. Lakes serve as
major landscape features on most continents, so the results of the research
should be important for a broad array of habitats.
