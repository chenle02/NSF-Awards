A grant has been awarded to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to
acquire a laser confocal microscopy system to enhance faculty and student
research and research training in the departments of Biological and
Environmental Sciences and Chemistry. The equipment enhances and enables new
research and teaching activities by faculty members in a wide range of
environmental, biological and chemical areas including: microbial ecology,
analysis of protein function, embryological development in animals, and
systematic entomology. Because microscopy is central to research in many areas,
including chemistry, geology, and engineering, the proposed system will promote
high quality research and research collaborations beyond the projects. The
results of these scientific studies will enhance the lessons taught in our
classrooms, and students will gain hands-on experience in advanced microscopy
and image analysis. The research studies resulting from the use of the laser
confocal microscopy system will be disseminated by poster or oral presentations
at regional or national meetings, by publication in peer-reviewed journals, and
highlighted within the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's faculty and
course related websites.

UTC is primarily an undergraduate institution that serves the needs of a diverse
group of students in southern Tennessee, northern Georgia, and northern Alabama.
UTC's departments of Chemistry and of Biological and Environmental Sciences have
a distinguished record for undergraduate education and research, and will be the
primary users of the requested equipment.
