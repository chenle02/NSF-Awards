Manufacturers of discrete products have not yet made full use of the power of
the computer to improve their performance. In particular, most manufacturers use
linear process plans that are based upon the planner's estimate of which machine
will be "the best" at the time when the work pieces are produced. This imposes
unnecessary constraints on the process plan and the machine type choice is made
without current knowledge of the system's status. Both have the potential to
reduce the system efficiency/effectiveness by restricting the system manager's
domain of alternatives for dispatching and processing the workload (scheduling
and control). The long term goal of Technology Constrained Process Planning
(TCOPP) is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of discrete manufacturing
through improved processing planning, scheduling, and control. This will be
accomplished through 1) the specification of process plans as directed graphs,
based upon technological constraints; and 2) functional specification of the
process plan, rather than a specific class of work station. The result will be
an increase in the degrees of freedom available for scheduling and controlling
the production of the workload. Resource assignments will be based upon current
system status. The expanded domain of alternatives and use of current system
status can reasonably be expected to improve decision making and system
efficiency/effectiveness.
