This project will investigate the possibility of using spaced Global Positioning
System (GPS) receivers to measure overhead ionospheric drifts in the polar cap
and auroral zone. Four high sensitivity and high data rate GPS receivers will be
placed at the Poker Flat Rocket Range near Fairbanks, Alaska, and operated for
one year. This site was selected for the availability of infrastructure and for
coordination with observations from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar,
which will allow testing and validation of the inferred drifts. The primary goal
of the project is to investigate different receiver spatial configurations and
operating modes. This will allow cross-correlation of small fluctuations in the
measured signal between each receiver in order to derive the overhead
ionospheric flow vector. The scientific questions that will be addressed are: 1)
At what scale sizes and frequencies are ionospheric structuring and
irregularities primarily present in the auroral and polar cap ionosphere, 2) how
does this structure relate to measurements of GPS phase, amplitude, and total
electron content, and 3) to what extent can these data be used in a spaced
receiver configuration to derive not only total electron content and
scintillations but ionospheric plasma drift vectors. One broader impact of the
project is that, if it's successful, it would provide a new method to measure
vector ionospheric drifts at high latitudes that is easily deployable and
relatively low cost. Ionospheric drifts are a fundamental space weather
parameter directly related to magnetospheric convection and to magnetosphere-
ionosphere coupling. A second broader impact is that the GPS receiver data
obtained during the experiment will be made freely available to the community
and the receivers will be left at Poker Flat as a community resource.
