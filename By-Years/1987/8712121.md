Historically complexity theory has been concerned with the intrinsic difficulty
of problems whose underlying domain consists of the integers or other discrete
objects. More recently, there is a growing interest in understanding complexity
issues arising in solving problems rooted in continuous mathematics. Here, in
contrast to the discrete case, the basic foundational questions are far from
resolved. Under investigation is the role the condition (or the logarithm of the
condition) of a problem plays in (1) formulating natural models of computation
and measures of complexity, and (2) designing algorithms, for continuous
problems. The linear programming problem with its various competing algorithms
defined via disparate models of computation and complexity provides a rich
source of ideas for this investigation.
