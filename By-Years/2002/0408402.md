An grant has been awarded to the Wadsworth Center under the direction of Dr.
Bruce McEwen for partial support for an interdisciplinary meeting entitled:
"Third International Congress on Electron Tomography", under the auspices of the
Albany Conference Foundation. The meeting will be held April 29 to May 2, 2004
in Rensselaerville near Albany, New York. The aim of this conference is to
provide a forum for discussion and informal exchange among specialists from a
wide range of approaches and technical expertise in order to stimulate cross-
fertilization of ideas on the technical and computational challenges unique to
electron tomography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The format of the conference is
designed to provide an environment for a frank and informal exchange among
scientists that is normally not possible within the constraints of the usual
large, broad-range meetings. We are seeking an interdisciplinary audience that
includes the leading practitioners of electron tomography whose interests are
focused on technical development and on increasing the number of users and
applications.
