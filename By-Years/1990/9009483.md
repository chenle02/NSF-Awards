The development of parallel and vector algorithms for solving very large matrix
algebraic Riccati equations is proposed. The approach to be used stresses the
use of computational kernels such as the BLAS3, which are available on a wide
variety of parallel computers. This approach will make the algorithms portable
to many advanced scientific computers. Much of the research is based on the
matrix sign function algorithm, an iterative method that has been shown to work
well on a certain class of multiprocessor. Topics for research include easily
parallelized "multiplication rich" algorithms, parallel and vector algorithms
for several different advanced computer architectures, a condition estimate
computable using the matrix sign function, and iterative algorithms for solving
the linear Lyapunov equation. Finally, implementation of the algorithms as high
quality, reliable mathematical software is proposed, in order to make the
results of the research available for use by the control systems community. The
solution of algebraic Riccati equations is a fundamental computational problem
in control engineering and is essential for the application of many modern
control techniques.
