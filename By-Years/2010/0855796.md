This collaborative grant to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Colorado
School of Mines is to fund a study on the feasibility of creating a research
center in the area of materials recovery and recyclability. The PIs plan to meet
with industry leaders to help determine the need and sustainability for a
government, industry, and academic partnership to work on research issues
related to innovative recovery and recycling technologies that maximize the
recovery of scrap from the waste stream and optimizes the cycling of these
material back into the production of materials and
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies will be planned with industry input to
develop and build systems that optimize recovery and recycling technologies
including: increased recyclability; developing sensors to identify metals and
separation technologies to sort the waste stream; and establishing materials
sensors, processes, and controls to achieve greater tolerance of scrap metal
input for downstream recycling processes. Materials recovery and recycling
research would be multi-disciplinary involving physics, mathematics, computer
science, economics, management sciences, materials science, mechanical
engineering, and electrical engineering. Generic science and technology
developed by the center could have applicability in metallic alloys while
providing economic and societal benefits. Energy savings and avoidance of
pollution represent a compelling reason to establish this center as well as
interests from a broad societal need throughout the supply chain involving scrap
yards, disassembling companies, municipal waste centers, shredding companies,
smelters, foundries, and consumers.&lt;br/&gt;
