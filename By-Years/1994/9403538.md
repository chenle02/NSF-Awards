Jacquet This award funds the continuing work of Professor Herve Jacquet in the
Langland's program. In particular Prof. Jacquet will investigate certain period
integrals. The major problem is to classify the automorphic representations of a
particular group that are distinguished for a subgroup. Number Theory is the
study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished the
driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the
discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number
theory with calculus. Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it
has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and
coding theory. ***
