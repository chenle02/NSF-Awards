The goal of this Planning Grant is to investigate the mechanisms by which the
cells of the kidney move organic electrolytes from the blood into the excreted
urine. This is an important mechanism involving the expenditure of cellular
energy to move these substances but a mechanism that is poorly understood at the
present time. The long-term objective of this research, therefore, is to
understand this process at the molecular level. To this end, the present project
will involve the development of new methods for the study of intact kidney
tubules and of surface membranes of the cells lining these tubules. The
transport process occurs across these membranes. Once these methods are
successfully in use, the applicant will then be in position to submit a full
Minority Research Initiation proposal that addresses the mechanisms involved in
the transport of these organic substances.
