This award provides support to continue an REU Site at the Demographic Research
Laboratory, Western Washington University. Ten undergraduates, recruited
nationwide, will participate in "Applied Demographic Research on Migration" for
two months in the Summer, 1991. These students, supervised by a project team of
professional demographers, will focus their research efforts on the study of
migration profiles and analytical models. Public Use Microdata Samples and the
County to County Migration Flow files will serve as primary data sources for the
research experiences for undergraduates. The project provides undergraduates the
opportunity to become involved in the research process and to expand their
research-related competencies through an intensive, two-month research project.
