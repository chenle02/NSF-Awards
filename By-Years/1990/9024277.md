This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the Lamont- Doherty Geological Observatory of
Columbia University and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.
The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship
equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Robert D. Gerard is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to install a gyro
steering stand for improved navigational control and replace an INMARSAT
satellite communication device which is obsolete and unreliable.
