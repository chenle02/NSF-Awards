The National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation award will
enhance microscopy-intensive undergraduate research and training at Truman State
University through support for the acquisition of a spinning disc confocal
microscope. The Truman State University mission includes an emphasis on
integrating original research in undergraduate education, and its faculty are
committed to providing their students with a rich research-intensive learning
environment through faculty-mentored student research opportunities and direct
inclusion of research into its curriculum. Five Truman faculty members use
confocal microscopy in their research projects, specifically, exploring:
development and cell migration in C. elegans, genetic control of the shoot
apical meristem in maize, actin dynamics during plant gravitropism, and plant-
endophytic fungi interactions. In addition, the confocal microscope will be used
in investigative labs in eight courses, ranging from core courses to upper-level
electives. Each year, a diverse student population (more than 300 students,
including an increasing number of minorities (currently 12.4%), and students
with majors in Biology, Chemistry, Health Science, Exercise Science, Mathematics
and Computer Science) will receive training in confocal technique and gain
hands-on experience with the confocal microscope via laboratory-based courses.
Research results will be disseminated through faculty and student presentations
at scientific research conferences and in publications in peer-reviewed
scientific journals.
