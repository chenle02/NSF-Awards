Physical Sciences Inc. will demonstrate a selective anisotropic etching tool for
silicon dioxide, using a hypothermal Flourine atom beam based upon its patented
Fast Atom Sampler Test (FAST) technology. The energy range of the FAST source
enables highly efficient, damage-free etching of SiO2. The anisotropic, low
damage capability targeted is very relevant to the Semiconductor Industry
Association roadmap, which defines neutral stream processing as a critical
technology for etching sub 0.2 Âªm features in silicon dioxide in the fabrication
of ULSI devices.
