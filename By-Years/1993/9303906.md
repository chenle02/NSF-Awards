This project involves a continuation of research on magma transport phenomena at
both the microscopic and macroscopic scales. The microscopic scale research will
utilize molecular dynamics modelling to examine transport properties (viscosity,
chemical diffusion) of melts in the system NaAlSiO4-SiO2. The macroscopic scale
research will focus on modelling and simulation studies of various anatexis
models, of the behavior of silicate mush piles, and of radial zonation in
granitic plutons.
