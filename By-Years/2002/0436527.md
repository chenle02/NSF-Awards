This is an SGER to support interdisciplinary research to explore new techniques
to sourcing driftwood in the archaeological record through tree-ring data and
indigenous knowledge. The PI will develop a method of cross dating as a way of
sourcing driftwood and exploring variability in tree response to climate change.
The CoPI will collect oral history and traditional knowledge of driftwood and
its use. Working together in the collection and analysis of both types of data
the researchers propose to better understand the use of drift wood in the
archaeological record, as well as develop a more precise chronology for the
region of Southwest Alaska. In addition, the project includes community
consultations in order to explore community interest in this topic and the
possibility of collaboration with local scholars on a larger future project in
this area.
