When an engineer is attempting to design an artificial arm, a great many
different data are needed concerning the forces and torques which the biological
arm is put through each day. It is these "natural" forces and torques that the
artificial arm must imitate. This research has designed an apparatus that
willmake measurements on human arms and, thus, provide much of the necessary
data for such designs. In addition, this apparatus is programmable, so that it
can be used directly in the development of the software, i.e., computer
programs, that will be used to control the artificial arm.
