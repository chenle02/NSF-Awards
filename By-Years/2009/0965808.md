California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is a Hispanic Serving
Institution (HSI) created with the vision of bringing educational opportunities
to underrepresented, low income, and first generation students in the tri-county
(Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz) area. The primary goal of this project is
to increase the number of students from these counties entering computer science
by providing scholarships to financially disadvantaged students with high
academic potential who otherwise might not be able to complete a college
education. A set of support services are provided to increase retention and
maintain a high graduation rate among the scholarship recipients, including
cohort-building among scholarship recipients, summer enrichment workshops aimed
at reinforcing academic skills, and individual faculty mentoring. Intellectual
Merit: Research has shown that cooperative learning increases student success in
computer science programs. This project focuses on building and supporting an
engaged cohort of scholarship recipients by bringing them together in a summer
enrichment workshop before each academic year, organizing study groups, seminars
and social events, and providing faculty mentoring. Comfort with the material
and perception of success have both been shown to influence retention in
computer science students, particularly among female students. In order to build
comfort level with Computer Science material, summer enrichment workshops are
organized for the scholarship recipients to review the previous year's materials
and to prepare for the following academic year. Broader Impact: It is projected
that computer science will be one of the fastest growing occupations in coming
years, yet bachelor degree production from CS programs has declined. In
particular, women and minorities often do not participate in this job market.
Despite the proximity of the tri-county area to Silicon Valley, the lack of
success experienced by students from these communities is likely to continue
without the opportunity to receive a rigorous college education in areas like
computer science. This project directly addresses this need by recruiting and
retaining students from surrounding counties into the Computer Science and
Information Technology degree program at CSUMB. The unique, customizable degree
program coupled with the financial support, summer enrichment workshops, and
faculty mentoring are strong features of this projects.
