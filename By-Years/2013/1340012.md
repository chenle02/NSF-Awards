Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is providing scholarships for 22
students, including 12 STEM majors, each receiving two years of support and 10
Masters of Teaching students, each receiving one year of support. The program
also provides stipends for 12 master science and math teachers who serve as
Noyce Teaching mentors. Using the existing infrastructure of the successful
Phase I VCU Noyce Initiative, this Phase II also is providing funds for
internships for Pre-Teacher education students from J. Sargeant Reynolds
Community College (JSARCC) in an effort to encourage additional students to
enter the STEM teacher pipeline. The program is also providing two years of
induction support which provides a professional learning community and
programming activities to enhance instructional and leadership skills and assist
in the professional development of the new teachers. The support during the
first two critical years of service is likely to result in increased teacher
retention in high-need districts within the target area: high-need schools in
the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The project is providing
needed information on the use of culturally-responsive pedagogy and collecting
and qualitatively analyzing the efficacy of instruction using a cultural
competency framework. The creation of a culturally responsive classroom ecology
framework can be used both as a planning tool for instructing pre-service and
in-service math and science teachers in high-need districts and used as an
analytical tool for conducting research on teaching in high-need settings.
