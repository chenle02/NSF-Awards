The goal of this research is to develop an approach and the necessary
methodologies and tools to allow circuit card assembly manufacturers to
determine the optimal strategy for operating an assembly line, and to rapidly
generate optimal or near-optimal line setups. The objective is to maximize total
production rate over a desired product mix. The constraints are the equipment
capabilities, including material handling, the products' bills of materials,
technologies, and the production plan (quantities and lot sizes required) for
some planning horizon. Models and algorithms will be developed for the process
optimization for a range of assembly equipment types. These algorithms will be
demonstrated using realistic data from actual circuit card assembly operations.
Ultimately, these algorithms should provide the basis for automated or semi-
automated process planning tools. Such tools would enable process planners to
create higher quality process plans, with much shorter lead times than is
currently possible. The potential benefit to manufacturing is faster response to
changing requirements and continuous improvement of the assembly process.
