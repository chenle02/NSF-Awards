Fluids are involved in nearly all geologic processes, and are ubiquitous in the
continental crust to depths of at least 10 to 15 km. As heat is advected by
fluid movement, it may lead to distinctive patterns of thermal anomalies which
can be interpreted to gain insight into fluid pathways and mechanisms. Field
studies of past and present temperatures in the Ouachita Mountains- Arkoma basin
area re proposed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which fluid flow occurs
in the continental crust and the nature of possible relationships between fluid
migrations and orogenesis. The Arkoma basin and Ouachita mountains are of
interest because they have been implicated as a source of the hot brines which
apparently flooded North America in Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian time (about
300 +25 Ma), leading to widespread potassic alteration, formation of Mississippi
Valley-type (MVT) lead-zinc deposits, and possible resetting of paleomagnetic
poles. Mathematical models will also be used to evaluate various hypotheses
concerning the mechanisms by which fluid flow takes place in the continental
crust. Modeling will include a study of (1) temporal focusing of compaction- or
metamorphic-derived fluids, (2) catastrophic release of heat in the crust from
free convection an the interaction of free- and forced- convective flow regimes,
and (3) the conditions under which free convection is important in tilted
geologic media such as may occur in sedimentary basins. Results of the
mathematical modeling will be used in conjunction with data collected in field
studies to evaluate hypotheses concerning fluid flow in the continental crust,
particularly in reference to tectonically-driven fluid migrations.
