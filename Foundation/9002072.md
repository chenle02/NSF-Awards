A central question in the foundations of mathematics is: Which set existence
axioms are needed in order to prove specific theorems of ordinary mathematics?
Here "ordinary mathematics" refers to the parts of mathematics which are not
overtly set theoretical. For instance "ordinary mathematics" includes subjects
such as geometry, differential equations, real and complex analysis, countable
algebra, countable combinatorics, and the topology of complete separable metric
spaces. On the other hand, "ordinary mathematics" does not include topics such
as general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic. It has been found that
the language of second order arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study
of the above question. (This is because "ordinary mathematics" is to a large
extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.) Moreover, a great
many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when formalized as sentences of
second order arithmetic, turn out to be equivalent to the set existence axioms
which are needed to prove them. (The equivalent is proved over a weak base
theory.) Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms which
arise in this way is rather small. This is the theme of Reverse Mathematics,
which has been developed by Simpson and others and will be further developed
under the current project.
