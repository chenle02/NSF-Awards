Their main objective is to study theoretically the surface structure and surface
vibrational properties of clean and adsorbate covered semiconductor surfaces
that have fundamental scientific importance as well as various microelectronics
application. Their efforts will be directed towards systems which are hard to
treat using plane-wave techniques that have traditionally been popular in
investigations of semiconductor surfaces. A hierarchy of theoretical techniques
will be used, ranging from accurate and computationally intensive state-of-the-
art first-principles total energy calculations (which will be applied to
tractable prototypical systems) to parametrized tight- binding and classical
force constants descriptions (which will be applied to more complex systems).
