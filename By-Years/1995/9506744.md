Funds are requested for a science planning workshop to be held January 6-9,
1995, at the Woods, a conference center in West Virginia. Ten archaeologists and
anthropologists who study northern hunters and gatherers will map out a
scientific agenda and research strategy. This planning is designed to both
generate and integrate natural and social science data that will further our
understanding of the relationship between hunters and gatherers and the
environment, thus contributing to studies of the human dimension in global
change studies.
