An examination of the history of the development of quantum mechanics in the
early part of the present century shows the essential influence both of factors
usually taken to be "internal" to science (such as logical consistency,
empirical adequacy, fertility and the like) and of "external" ones (such as
professional rivalries and prior metaphysical commitments of some of the major
scientists). Neither class of factors alone can explain why the "Copenhagen"
interpretation of quantum mechanics, with its ineliminable indeterminism at the
level of microprocesses, was chosen by the consensus of the scientific community
to the virtual exclusion of an equally empirically adequate and fertile causal
version of quantum mechanics in which one has the deterministic, continuous and
picturable evolution of microsystems in a space-time background. Professor
Cushing argues that there exists a possible, and in fact plausible, temporal
reordering of certain highly contingent events in the actual historical record
that could have resulted in the acceptance of a deterministic, causal quantum
theory to the exclusion of the present "Copenhagen" orthodoxy of inherent
indeterminism. In this research project, Professor Cushing is exploring the
ramifications of the existence of a viable rival to the accepted position in
science and the failure of science to explore this alternative. He argues that
this raises practical as opposed to just in-principle problems of the
underdetermination of accepted scientific theories by an empirical basis and
questions of the reliability of the knowledge with which science provides.
