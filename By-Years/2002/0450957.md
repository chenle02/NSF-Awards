When we talk to one another, we don't just talk. We gesture, point, look at
objects, and touch them; and our speech often refers to objects in our
environment. This is so prevalent that we gesture when we're on the phone, and
we describe things differently depending on whether or not the people we're
talking to can see us. If speech is not an isolated cognitive activity, but
depends on integrating information from other processes, then how does this
integration take place? How do speakers and listeners integrate language, as it
is being performed, with other streams of information from the visual
environment?

Work on gesture analysis and situated cognition has recently provided a good
deal of evidence to address this question. Some of this evidence has come from
work by Dr. Sweetser and Ms. Narayan on fine-grained linguistic analyses of
utterances and their accompanying bodily movements. With support from NSF, Ms.
Narayan will continue this line of research to investigate the role of timing in
the integration of speech and non-speech processes. The experiments promise to
bring together work in linguistics and psychology to bear on the question of how
we think when we talk. The results may lead to more effective methods of
communication in teaching, and may lead to insights into the mechanisms of sign
language. The experiments being funded are part of Ms. Narayan's dissertation
work.
