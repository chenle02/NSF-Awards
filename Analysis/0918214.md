Schroedinger Maps and Related Problems

Abstract of Proposed Research Ioan Bejenaru

This project is to study the Schroedinger map equation. This is a nonlinear
Schroedinger equation which arises from geometrical considerations and also as a
version of the Heisenberg model of ferro-magnetism. The fundamental question is,
under what conditions on the data, is there global existence of the solutions
and when is there "blow-up" of solutions. To study this, we shall investigate
the dynamics of solutions with very rough initial data and will use fine tools
from harmonic analysis and Riemannian geometry as well as partial differential
equations methods. It is expected that the analysis will be more difficult than
the Wave map equation which has been studied extensively recently. The
Schroedinger map equation has a special nonlinear term; under this project
various other non-generic nonlinearities will also be studied.

Since the primary problems to be studied in this project arise in well-known
physical theories, the results obtained should have some impact for theories of
electromagnetism and ferromagnetic materials. They may well prove to be
prototypical problems for a number of other important equations that arise in
geometry and physics and for which existence and blow-up results are yet to be
obtained.
