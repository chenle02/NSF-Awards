This award will support Professor Leonard Scott of the University of Virginia in
a research collaboration with Professor Klaus Roggenkamp of the Faculty of
Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. These
mathematicians intend to work on the general area of integral finite group rings
and the representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups in characteristic p
&gt; 0. More specifically, they aim to work on the isomorphism problem first
posed by Graham Higman in 1940. Briefly stated, the isomorphism problem asks,
"when does an isomorphism of two integral finite group rings imply the groups
are isomorphic?" The PI's are justly recognized for their leadership in
attacking this important problem. In 1984 they partially solved the problem in
the affirmative for finite nilpotent groups and recently provided a counter-
example to the related Zassenhaus conjecture. The investigators are now at the
stage where they have developed the techniques and tools necessary to resolve
the problem and, more important, to provide a framework for proving that the
isomorphism problem "usually" has a positive answer.
