Air quality and composition studies, especially of volatile organic compounds,
their oxidation products leading to secondary aerosol particle formation, are
based on a detailed knowledge of the molecular identity and concentration of
many chemical compounds. Given the complexity of, and often vanishingly small
concentrations of key chemical intermediates, techniques such as high resolution
mass spectrometry are preferred. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary
group at Georgia Tech jointly engaged in atmospheric chemistry, aerosols,
clouds, climate, and air quality research will acquire a commercial instrument,
a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols High Resolution Time-of-Flight Chemical
Ionization Mass Spectrometer (FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS). This instrument will advance
research in atmospheric trace gases/aerosols/clouds/air quality, expose
undergraduate and graduate students to state-of-the-art mass spectrometric
techniques, and serve as a locus to increase diversity in science and
engineering at Georgia Tech.
