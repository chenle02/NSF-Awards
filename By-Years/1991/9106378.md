This project involves cultural and biological anthropologists studying the
causes of growth variation in Ecuadorian children. Households in two
communities, one a more traditional farming community in the highlands and the
other a more cash-crop oriented community in the lowlands will be studied.
Methods include participant observation, surveys, formal interviews, and
periodic measures of growth, illness and activity in a sample of families. The
hypothesis to be tested is that the traditional farming regime produces children
who grow better than those in the more "modern", cash crop regime, by providing
a broader assortment of foods and allowing mothers more autonomy and control
over resources. This research is important because the issue of child health is
critical in the developing world, and development programs stressing "modern"
cash-crop agriculture may be damaging the overall health of the families by
ignoring issues of diet and mother's access to resources. This project will
provide a controlled comparison which will shed light on this issue.
