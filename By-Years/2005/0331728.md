The proposed research involves exploring novel connections between cosmology and
the new physics beyond the Standard Model. The PI plans to use the Cosmic
Microwave Background as a probe of the new physics near the scale of inflation
that could leave a small, but detectable, imprint in the CMB anisotropy. The PI
proposes a new explanation for the Type IA supernovae observations, which are
postulated to be fainter because of dynamical conversion of photons into axions,
without cosmic acceleration. The PI predicts a new particle, the ultralight
axion instead of the assumption of dark energy to explain these observations.
The PI also proposes to investigate whether the dynamics of extra dimensions can
generate the primordial seed for extra-galactic magnetic fields. The PI also
intends to apply techniques from statistical physics to understand the
transmission of information in neurons.
