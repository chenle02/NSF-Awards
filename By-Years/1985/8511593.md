Within the last few years there has been a revival of interest in the dynamical
behavior of laser oscillators. From a purely scientific standpoint, some
fundamental laser transient phenomena which were once known only to
theoreticians are now observable in the laboratory. From a more practical point
of view, many lasers of great commercial utility are found to exhibit pulsations
of known or unknown origin, and for applications such effects may be either
detrimental or highly useful. The general purpose of this research is to search
out additional spontaneously pulsing lasers and to seek a better understanding
of those that are already known. This research includes both experimental and
theoretical studies to extend the present state of knowledge concerning such
lasers. Of special interest is a recently recognized laser instability which
causes deep modulation pulsations at MHz rates in single-mode xenon lasers. This
instability is believed to be responsible for important transient effects in
helium-neon lasers and probably other lasers as well.
