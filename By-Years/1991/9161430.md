Future optical interconnect architectures with vertical and lateral paths will
need to be silicon-based for integration of waveguides, modulators, and
detectors with microelectronics. Current research efforts concentrate on
operation beyond the band-edge wavelength of 1.12 um, where silicon is nominally
transparent. Potential integration of optoelectronic devices at wafer level may
lead to the development of optical interconnection technologies based on
infrared light sources at 1.3um. Recent research in this area indicates that a
refractive index change as large as 0.01 can be achieved in silicon even though
silicon does not exhibit a linear electrooptic effect. This electrically induced
refractive index change is based on the free-carrier effect, (e.g., in a p-n
junction) and can be used for light modulation. Physical Optics Corporation
proposes to use its holographic recording of photoresist gratings to develop an
optical modulator based on a waveguide grating coupler. The coupling efficiency
can be modulated by very small changes of refractive index in the structure
because of the narrow acceptance angle of the guided mode. Full modulation depth
of the guided wave can be achieved with current densities under 10 uA/um2. This
structure can be also used for spatial light modulators.
