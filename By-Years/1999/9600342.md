9600342 Sheaff This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin, Professor John
Cumalat of the University of Colorado, Professor Hector Mendez and Professor
Gerardo Herrera of CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico, in experimental elementary particle
physics. Specifically, the researchers intend to concentrate on a charm
photoproduction experiment (E831) to be performed at Fermilab, in order to
conduct high precision studies of varied charmed meson and baryon states. The
researchers intend to conduct a systematic study of the lifetimes and other
properties of charmed baryons and will work on upgrades to the existing Wide
Band Photon Lab Spectrometer that will significantly extend the physics reach of
the E831 experiment. Responsibility for maintaining the detectors during data
taking and the analysis of the collected data will be shared by both sides. The
project will contribute to the internationalization of large science projects;
its emphasis on student involvement will help to promote future collaborations.
