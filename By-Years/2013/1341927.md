The National Academy of Science Committee on Science, Engineering and Public
Policy (COSEPUP) is charged to "to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in
the area of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the
concerns and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the
NSF, the Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science
and technology-related committees of the Congress." Its work has addressed
issues of critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation. Key issues
that COSEPUP is currently addressing or has recently addressed include
maintaining the excellence of human resources for U.S. science and engineering
research, promoting effective management of U.S. federal research investments,
and ensuring research integrity and the responsible conduct of research. Since
its inception, the National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities.
This award will provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work
as an independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology
policy.
