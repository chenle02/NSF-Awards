9523648 Padture The objective of the proposed research is to understand the
aspects of microstructural evolution in in situ-reinforced (ISR) silicon carbide
(SiC). This is a new class of tough ceramics in which elongated-grain
reinforcements are grown in situ within the microstructure during pressureless
liquid- phase sintering. The proposed research consists of two sets of critical
experimental studies: 1) a systematic study of densification and grain--growth
kinetics in polycrystalline liquid-phase sintered SiC, and 2) a systematic study
of growth kinetics of isolated SiC grains grown in s supersaturated Al-Y-O-C
glass. The results of the experiments will be critically analyzed, with
reference to existing models whenever possible, to determine the rate-
controlling mechanisms for densification, normal grain growth and anisotropic
grain growth. %%% It is anticipated that the proposed study will provide a
comprehensive picture of the evolution of the microstructures in ISR SiC an
understanding vital to the effective tailoring of mechanical properties. In
addition, the research also has the potential to contribute toward a broader
goal of guiding general processing efforts for creating the next generation of
ISR ceramics with novel microstructures for superior mechanical properties. ***
