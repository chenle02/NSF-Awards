9318346 Haymon This award provides one-half of the funding required to purchase
a powder X-ray diffractometer system to be installed and operated in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
for the acquisition. The new X-ray diffractometer will replace a 32-year old
instrument no longer capable of providing the type of data required by numerous
research and teaching programs at the institution. Among the research projects
that will use the new instrumentation: (1) A time- series study of
mineralization at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise crest, (2) Studies
of chemical diagenesis and pore fluid movement in sedimentary basins, (3) Marine
sediment records of Cenozoic paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic evolution, (4)
Coral records of Cenozoic chemical fluctuations in upwelling zones, (5) Regional
thermobarometric studies of metamorphic terranes, and (6) Studies of silicate
melt-transport properties. ***
