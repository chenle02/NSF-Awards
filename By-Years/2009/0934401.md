Full Center Proposal for an I/UCRC for Intelligent Storage 0934396 University of
Minnsota; David Lilja 0934401 University of California-Santa Cruz; Ethan Miller

The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Intelligent Storage" to
conduct research on new storage architectures and storage system designs, new
data models and new ways to access and deliver data. The lead of the proposed
Center will be the University of Minnesota, with site location at the University
of University of California-Santa Cruz.

The goals of the proposed Center are to develop innovative storage systems and
new storage architectures, solve the long-term data preservation issues, develop
efficient benchmarking, tracing, performance management and tuning tools for I/O
and input systems, propose solutions that ensure data/information privacy and
security, and to explore ways to save energy in data center. The proposed Center
will build on the respective University's research talent and technology
transfer skills to attract industrial partners who will subsequently play a
significant role in planning, selecting, and implementing the output of the
research.

The broader impact of the potential research outcomes includes fostering the
advancement of science and technology, making the society more efficient and
secure, providing better health-care delivery, and better ways of preserving
information. The industry participation will enhance the students' educational
experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientists to
industry. The proposed Center is committed to enhancing the education process by
bringing input from industry, developing new courses at both undergraduate and
graduate levels, and emphasizing the diversity of the student population. The
Center also has plans to recruit more female and under-represented minority
students and faculty into its research group. Research results will be
disseminated to general public via journal publications and conference
presentations.
