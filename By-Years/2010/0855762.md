This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muhlenberg College faculty and students
plan to pursue a research program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory, in collaboration with scientists around the
world. The research program at Muhlenberg College has two distinct science
themes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first theme concerns the behavior of matter at
very high density, corresponding to conditions a fraction of a second after the
Big Bang, when a hot, dense brew of quarks and gluons existed. One goal of the
RHIC program is to recreate these conditions via colliding nuclei at very high
energies. The Muhlenberg group will help to characterize some of the properties
of the plasma by measuring a quantity called transverse energy. It has been
proposed that event-by-event fluctuations in the transverse energy could be a
signal for a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear
matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second theme concerns the quest to understand
the spin of the proton in terms of its underlying constituents of quarks and
gluons. The Muhlenberg group will play an important role in an upgrade of the
PHENIX detector that will more directly address this issue by detecting so-
called W bosons emitted during proton-proton collisions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative activity at a national laboratory exposes students
to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at a small college. It
provides students with new skills and a better understanding of the scientific
enterprise, and it can help with informed career choices, whether in physics or
in other areas.&lt;br/&gt;
