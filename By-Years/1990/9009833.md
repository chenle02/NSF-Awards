Although much attention has focused on the genetic control of development in
the central nervous system of Drosophila, development of the neuromusular system
is largely unexplored. The proposed research seeks to identify the precursor
cells that differentiate during metamorphosis to form the thoracic muscles
mediating the escape response. The large size of metamorphosing flies, relative
to embryos, makes their developing muscles ideal for physiological testing,
anatomical analyses, and surgical intervention. The investigators will follow
during metamorphosis the differentiation of normal muscle precursors, determine
which developmental steps are perturbed in mutant flies lacking escape- response
muscles, and identify the function(s) controlled by the wild-type alleles of the
mutant genes. To further characterize the action(s) of genetic mutations that
prevent formation of muscles or cause them to degenerate prematurely, the
investigators will test whether transplanted muscle precursors reverse mutant
defects. Results from these experiments should help to determine whether defects
in muscles or in neurons innervating muscles cause muscle deficiencies. This
information should enable the investigators in future to identify the gene
products that are required to complete the complex process of muscle formation.
