In contrast to the sex chromosome systems of mammals and birds, the sex of many
reptiles is determined by the incubation temperature of the egg (temperature-
dependent sex-determination, or TSD). Sex determination under TSD can also be
controlled by the artificial application of specific steroid hormones, whereby
the effects of temperature are overridden. The proposed work pursues this
interplay in a turtle with TSD. The study has two specific aims. The first aim
is to study further the physiological bases of TSD by (i) localizing key enzymes
during the temperature-sensitive window, and (ii) capitalize on a recent
discovery that exogenous androgen can cause male development. The second aim
extends our line of research into the molecular biology of TSD/HSD to identify,
map, and quantify steroid hormone receptors in the developing embryo. Together
these studies will serve to generalize and unite anatomical, physiological, and
molecular observations. The basic research proposed here has applications to the
conservation of endangered reptiles.
