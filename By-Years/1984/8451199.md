This research will generate alternate formulations of numerical algorithms that
will be integrated to develop a package of conceptual design, kinematic and
dynamic analysis, and analytical/experimental mechanical system optimization
tools. An automated computer-based mechanical system "inventor" will be
developed that generates and draws at the computer terminal candidate mechanical
systems subject to designer-specified constraints. Numerically efficient methods
for the analysis of nonlinear kinematic and dynamic mechanical systems will be
generated, including a combined, lumped/distributed parameter dynamic modeling
scheme and a parallel-processing dynamic analysis algorithm for multiple-body
mechanical systems. Further, the systematic dimensioning and tuning of prototype
systems for prescribed dynamic response will be implemented by developing
optimization tools that integrate interactive, user-guided, parametric
optimization, color computer graphics, and combined analytical/experimental
methods (utilizing on-line, computer-controlled data acquisition of prototype
response).
