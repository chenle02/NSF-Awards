This project investigates membrane-protein folding, an essential function of all
cells across all kingdoms of life. The project's overall goal is to understand
how cells accomplish the task of folding their membrane proteins by measuring
the conformations and interactions accessible to these molecules as they undergo
the folding reaction. The experiments adopt the time-tested biophysical
techniques and mathematical theories established by decades of research on
soluble protein folding. These tools will be applied in novel ways to eight
membrane proteins to determine how they fold. The project further investigates
the functional roles of important cellular factors known as chaperones. These
are soluble proteins that are required for membrane protein folding in vivo, yet
the physical nature of how they do this is yet undiscovered. Altogether, this
project will address original and fundamental questions about how the membrane
parts of a cell are assembled and regulated.

The principal investigator (PI) will facilitate broader outreach in several
venues: (1) In the community-at-large the PI will tutor middle school students
in science and math and will welcome opportunities to discuss science and
scientific careers with K-12 students; (2) In the scientific community the PI
will facilitate outreach through organizing scientific conferences, mentoring
young scientists, and disseminating research results by invited talks; (3) In
the classroom the PI will improve pedagogical tools that utilize discovery-based
knowledge and methods; and (4) the PI will mentor undergraduate and graduate
student researchers. All students will have the opportunity to present their
work at national scientific meetings and will publish their results in peer-
reviewed journals.
