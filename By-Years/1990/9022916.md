A new superconduction tunnel-junction receiver is being completed by the PI for
use in ground-based measurements of stratospheric trace gases. This receiver
will operate in the 260-280 GHz range with high sensitivity (low receiver noise
temperature). A separate 'back-end' spectrometer for this new receiver is not
currently available. This proposal seeks funding for a commercially made dual
acousto-opticspectrometer in a single economical package, having two
simultaneously usable sections with different resolution and total bandpass.
This spectrometer would allow a flexible choice of high or low altitude mixing
ratio retrievals, or a combined mid-mesospheric to low stratospheric coverage of
appropriate species, and be fully portable in keeping with the intended program
of field measurements in which the SIS receiver will be employed. The
acquisition of a new spectrometer, in addition to the aging filter-bank
spectrometer now on hand, will allow flexible deployment of both receivers -
e.g., one dedicated for 1 to 2 years of round-the-year observations at the South
Pole or another remote site, while the other is used at one or more other field
sites in connection with regular observations and the UARS correlative
measurements program.
