The PIs will carry out theoretical research on both equilibrium and dynamic
properties of classical liquid and solid systems containing multilayer films. In
the area of dynamics they propose (1) studies of the growth of absorbed films
under both wetting and non-wetting conditions and (2) simulations to elucidate
the effect of wetting on fluid flow in narrow channels. In the realm of
equilibrium phenomena they propose studies of (1) surface melting, (2) wetting
in the presence of structural phase transitions, and (3) film desorption
produced by, e.g., surfactancts. Emphasis is on the use of lattice models,
studied by Monte Carlo simulations, mean-field theories, and scaling analyses.
