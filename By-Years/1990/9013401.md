This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award will support a
program planning workshop in the area of partial differential equations. The
purpose of the workshop, organized by Professor Paul Rabinowitz of the
University of Wisconsin and Professor Jairo Figuereido of UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, is
to stimulate cooperative research between U.S. and Brazilian mathematicians. As
such, the workshop will try to address the following topics: diagnostic of on-
going research efforts in both the U.S. and Brazil in the area of partial
differential equations; identifica- tion of areas of common interests and likely
future collaborators; and organization of joint planning activities for
cooperation in the short, medium, and long term.
