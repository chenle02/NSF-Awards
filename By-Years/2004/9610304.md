This research project deals with the development of a methodology for the
simulation, analysis and design of high-order, complex nonlinear dynamical
systems that have an underlying multiple time- scale structure. The methodology
provides for time-scale identification, efficient numerical simulation, and
reduced-order model development. The specific objectives of the project are to
extend the (CSP) Computational Singular Perturbation to a wide class of multiple
time-scale optimal control problems, establish rigorous theoretical foundations
for the method, develop and test algorithms, and apply the algorithms to design
problems in robotics and aeronautics. The fundamental issues being addressed
are: how to identify multiple time-scale structure in a nonlinear system and how
to exploit multiple time-scale structure for simplified simulation, analysis and
design. the research establishes a significant new capability for nonlinear
system design. the order reduction, better conditions, and physical
understanding - previously obtainable only for low-order systems by analysts
applying the analytical singular perturbation method - will be obtainable for
high-order, complex, nonlinear systems that have multiple time-scale behavior -
systems such as machines, structures, ground vehicles, aircrafts, spacecrafts,
robots, and other mechanical systems.
