Interdisciplinary (99) This project is developing and implementing a required
freshman and sophomore integrated science curriculum for all science, secondary
science education and mathematics education majors. The new curriculum, based on
the "Building Bridges" program at Bryn Mawr College, is composed of 6 science
courses, up to 6 mathematics courses, and a 5-course "backbone"
laboratory/research series requiring students to work in cooperative groups to
apply learning from multiple courses to solve problems. The intellectual merit
of the project lies in the design of a curriculum that demonstrates connections
between science and mathematics, while modeling for education majors the use of
student-centered, standards-based instructional and assessment strategies. The
first two years of the project focus on development and piloting of materials;
full implementation is occurring during the third year. To ensure broad impact,
curricular materials are being produced for custom and nationwide publication to
disseminate the curricular
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
