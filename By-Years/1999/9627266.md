9627266 Cavanagh The project is based upon the established Math, Science, and
Beyond (MSB) program which consists of a series of evening family science
workshops (with curriculum materials developed for classroom settings) in which
students and parents explore science and mathematics together through exciting,
hands-on activities. Units for each grade level (K-6) focus on physical, earth,
and life science. The MSB informal science project will adapt materials and
bring the program to informal learning settings - 25 Boys and Girls Clubs of
California, and 25 California Department of Parks and Recreation sites. These
clubs will receive training, materials, and support to operate Science Clubs
(after school MSB sessions), Science Camps (summer, off-track and Spring/Winter
Break, week-long MSB sessions), and Science Explorers Family Workshops (1-2 hour
sessions for elementary school students and their parents). In addition to the
Boys and Girls Clubs, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation, the
California Science Implementation Network is a key collaborator on the project.
