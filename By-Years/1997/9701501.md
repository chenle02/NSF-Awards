This is a proposal to adapt a TRW off-the-shelf software system architecture to
address two goals of the GGCM project: to flexibly integrate multiple modules
and to provide a 'user friendly' interface to magnetospheric research community.
An open architecture that is accessable to support the wide variety of users in
the magnetospheric research community is a fundamental requirement.
