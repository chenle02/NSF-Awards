This effort is in support of the NSF Informational Meeting on Programmable
Wireless Networks. The purpose of the Informational Meeting is to share with the
community the goals and scope of the focus area. By including presentations from
government, academia, and industry, this meeting will enable attendees to get a
sense of the state of the art in programmable wireless networking, and the key
challenges facing the focus area and sub-areas thereof. It will help the
community better target proposals and be more efficient. Finally, it will start
to build a community for the focus area, perhaps encouraging early collaboration
and potentially strengthening the pool of submissions. &lt;br/&gt;
