This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
demonstrate the feasibility of a new type of advanced hydrodesulfurization (HDS)
catalyst for deep desulfurization purposes. Specifically, metal nanoparticles
supported on zinc oxide nanowires are proposed for creating higher performance,
reactive adsorbent type HDS catalysts. HDS is a process used for the removal of
sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels. In this process, fuels are treated with hydrogen
gas in the presence of a catalyst. The environmental regulations are
continuously pushing down the sulfur levels allowed in transportation fuels and
will continue to lower the limits much below 10 ppm in future. Also, low sulfur
concentrations are desirable for various fuel cell and refinery technologies
where presence of small amounts of sulfur can poison the catalysts. The current,
traditional HDS catalysts are efficient in removing the sulfur to levels down to
around 20 ppm and leaves behind difficult-to-remove thiophenic sulfur compounds.
In this project, an advanced catalyst and a scalable and cost-effective
manufacturing is proposed that can accomplish deep desulfurization for lowering
sulfur levels down well below 5 ppm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/
commercial potential of this project will be improved air quality and
energy/cost savings for the nation from improved durability of fuel cell and
several refining technologies. The project's other outcome will also include new
manufacturing technologies for advanced catalyst materials which is crucial for
both the nation and the state of Kentucky to be globally competitive in terms of
energy technologies. The catalyst materials using ZnO nanowire supports will
also find applications beyond deep hydro-desulfurization such as C1-C4 alcohol
production using syngas, and steam reforming of methanol. The market size for
the proposed catalysts is estimated to exceed $1B considering the number of
application areas.
