Abstract 9424005 Bieber This award will continue for two years the operation of
a two station array of cosmic ray neutron monitors in Canada which are presently
scheduled to be terminated very soon by the Canadian National Research Council
(NRC), which owns and operates them. The Principal Investigator, who is from
Bartol Research Institute, has reached an agreement with the NRC which will
allow him to run them and probably eventually obtain ownership. This award gives
time for the arrangements for transfer to occur as well as to determine the
relative priority of various such facilities. These instruments, along with
other high latitude monitors, are especially important contributors to cosmic
ray studies because their fields of view are well defined and also because they
are much more sensitive to low energy cosmic rays, compared to mid- latitude
monitors. ***
