This research is examining techniques for reducing the hardware complexity for
Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) and Multi-level Decision Feedback
Equalization (MDFE) in hard disk drives. Both digital and analog circuit
approaches are being investigated. The first part of this work concerns the
testing of a digital realization of DFE in an 0.8 mm process. The projected
operating speed of this IC is about 100 MHz. Enhancements to the digital
circuitry will give improved strategies for optimal phase detection, gain
detection and dc offset detection. The second part of this work concerns the
investigation of an analog implementation of MDFE. A simple architecture for
MDFE, which includes both the phase and the gain detectors, is being studied for
its robustness using actual playback waveforms. From this investigation, the
circuits needed for the transversal filters comprising MDFE will be obtained. A
mixture of switched-capacitor and current-mode circuit techniques will be
examined.
