This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate and
demonstrate a novel, short response time, low temperature chemical sensor based
on nanoceramic materials. Nanoceramics are a broad new class of materials that
have been artificially modulated in zero to three dimensions on scales less than
100 nm The nanoscale modulation bestows nanoceramics with interfacial properties
tailored to the molecular scale, unprecedented microstructures, and unique
properties Such interface engineering has created an exceptional opportunity to
design and commercialize novel chemical sensors. Nanomaterials Research
Corporation (NRC) will develop and demonstrate these sensors through this
program. During this program, NRC will synthesize and evaluate nanoceramic-based
low temperature, low cost, short response time oxygen sensors. Nanomaterials
Research Corporation expects to establish the proof-of-concept of the sensor
during Phase I, optimize, completely characterize and field test the sensor
during Phase II; and during Phase III, commercialize the sensors to niche
markets.
