The objective of this Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC) project
is to develop a database of information for use by utilities and electricity
end-users in evaluating distributed generation (DG) and distributed energy
storage (DES). The information in the database can be used with utility, end-
user, and investor economic evaluation methods to compare the various DG and DES
technologies with central station generation and transmission and distribution
improvement options.
