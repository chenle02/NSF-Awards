I propose a program of research in the general area of combinatorial set theory,
with an emphasis on "singular cardinal combinatorics" in the style of Shelah. An
example of the sort of questions that I propose to work on is the question (due
to Woodin) whether failure of SCH at a singular cardinal implies the existence
of an Aronszajn tree at the successor of that cardinal. I am interested in
obtaining ZFC results as well as complementary consistency results: the methods
that I plan to use include PCF theory, inner models, Radin forcing and some
recent generalisations of proper forcing. Combinatorial set theory can be seen
as an attempt to take some very elementary mathematical ideas (counting,
ordering, permuting) and make sense of them in the context of infinite sets.
Typical problems might involve finding an infinite path through an infinite
tree, or colouring the vertices in an infinite graph so that no two adjacent
vertices have the same colour. Problems of this kind turn out to be surprisingly
deep and have found applications in many areas of mathematics. The focus of my
proposal is problems involving so-called "singular cardinals", which (by some
measure) are the hardest infinite sets to understand.
