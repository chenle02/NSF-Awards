This research is undertaken in order to complete a reference grammar of Itzaj
Maya, a Yucatecan Mayan language on the verge of extinction in Peten, Guatemala.
No modern reference grammars exist for any of the extant Yucatecan languages.
The Itzaj Maya were the last major indigenous group in Mesoamerica to be
conquered by the Spanish and were conservators of Mayan culture, including
hieroglyphic writing, long after most Mayan groups were overwhelmed by the
Spanish invaders. It is critically important for Mayan linguistics and epigraphy
to document Itzaj as soon as possible. The grammar will complete basic
documentation of the Itzaj Maya language. Based on prior grammatical research
and drawing on extensive textual and lexical databases, a comprehensive, heavily
exemplified grammar will be prepared for use by linguists, anthropologists,
epigraphers, those involved in language pedagogy, and others interested in a
general reference work. The grammar will be completed in twelve months,
including two months of fieldwork with an experienced language consultant.
