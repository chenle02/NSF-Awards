The study of organic, physical, and analytical chemistry by undergraduates will
be integrated through use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Experiments to be performed in organic lab in place of the normal synthesis labs
include Instrumental Aspects of NMR, and Keto-Enol Tautomerization Kinetics. Two
experiments involving NMR will also be added to the physical chemistry course:
Effect of NMR Shift Reagents on NMR Spectra, and Determination of Para-magnetic
Susceptibility using NMR. Quantitative uses of the technique will be introduced
into the second semester quantitative analysis course. The technique will also
be used extensively in the organic qualitative analysis course to augment
traditional means of identifying unknowns. The grantee will match the NSF award
from non-Federal sources.
