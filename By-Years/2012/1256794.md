Insects and other animals are frequently infected with maternally inherited
symbiotic bacteria, which can benefit their animal hosts by providing nutrition
or host protection. Many beneficial symbionts are themselves infected with
viruses called bacteriophages, which have the capacity to impact host biology in
critical ways, yet their roles in animal-bacterial symbioses are poorly
understood. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, the bacterial symbiont
Hamiltonella defensa confers protection from attack by parasitic wasps, but only
when bacteriophages called APSEs are also present. Aside from this role in
protection, little is known about the influence of APSEs on H. defensa and aphid
biology, including specifically how APSEs contribute to the demise of parasites
and the potential role in the regulation of symbiont abundance. This project
will use a combination of approaches, including genomics and molecular biology,
to characterize the roles of APSEs in the regulation and maintenance of the
protective symbiosis and to identify specific factors responsible for wasp
mortality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deciphering phage-symbiont interactions is
important to the study of animal-microbial interactions generally and to
understanding the biology of many economically important insects like aphids.
The proposed work will yield information of practical importance for the
management of pest insect populations and on the role of phages in the
establishment and maintenance of bacterial-arthropod associations, which are
widespread in the natural world. The interdisciplinary nature of this research
is also well suited as a platform to train young scientists at the interface of
symbiosis, cell biology, parasitology, and molecular processes. This project
will train high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and post-
doctoral researchers.
