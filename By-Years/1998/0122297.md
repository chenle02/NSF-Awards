The project would conduct Development phase activities necessary to implement a
systemic reform effort in schools on the Cheyenne River Reservation, in South
Dakota. The proposed activities of the project include conducting a series of
community/school meetings to help the personnel, parents, and communities to
understand systemic reform. The recommendations that arise from the meetings
will serve as the foundation for a five-year Implementation strategy.
