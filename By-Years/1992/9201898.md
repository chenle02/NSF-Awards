This research combines statistical theory with engineering technology to
develop confidence levels for part inspections. The goal is to extend previous
research on cylindricity to all solid geometric primitives. The research will
employ maximum likelihood estimation of part geometric parameters, such as the
radius of a sphere, to estimate the probability of geometry conforming to a
specific model. These models will incorporate expected random and systematic
deviations from nominal values and will be developed in the context of the
manufacturing process. Once the measurements are complete, the theory developed
will permit the statisically characterization of the impact of part geometry
deviations. The research will enable the determination of several important
values, among them is the number of sample points required to assure specified
probabilities on type I and II errors. Individually inspected parts will be
employed to draw inferences about the remainder of the parts in the production
system. The relation between individual components and uninspected parts will be
developed from the statistical theory of tolerance regions.
