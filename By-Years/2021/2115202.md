A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment on R/V Atlantic
Explorer, a 168â€™ general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the United States Academic Research
Fleet (ARF). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-profit research and
educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and
geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to
support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically
work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program. RV Atlantic
Explorer had 130 days funded, in the pandemic-shortened season in 2020, all of
which were for NSF. In 2021, the vessel is scheduled to sail 206 days with 183
(89%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following
Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawboldt Standard Winch 42 Series
$537,696&lt;br/&gt;Nine Drager SCBA packs and Viking firefighting outfits
$77,496&lt;br/&gt;Three RCP-90X programmable controllers $21,082&lt;br/&gt;
$636,274&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
