This research addresses the question regarding the potential role played by
equation of state in geodynamics. The specific objectives of this research is to
investigate the physics of compressible convection by including both variable
viscosity and variable thermodynamic parameters, such as thermal expansivity,
for both cartesian and spherical-shell configurations. The PI will study the
feasibilities of placing bounds on the rheological and thermodynamic parameter
values in the deep mantle by constraining the results to fit the excess
ellipticity of the core-mantle boundary, temperature at the core-mantle
boundary, and the thermal and viscosity profiles of the lower mantle.
