Professor Schatz is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
continuing investigations of spectroscopic and structural properties of the
ground and excited states of various molecular, ionic, mixed-valence, and
radical species isolated in noble gas matrices at cryogenic temperatures.
Companion theoretical investigations are used to aid in interpreting the
measurements. Systems being investigated range from atoms through small clusters
and inorganic ring compounds to large organometallics. The spectroscopic work,
emphasizing absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism, extends
from the near infrared into the vacuum ultraviolet and permits the assignment of
transitions, the deduction of ground and excited state symmetries and magnetic
moments, and the characterization of vibronic, electronic, and spin-orbit
interactions. The vacuum ultraviolet measurements are being made at the
Synchrotron Radiation Center of the University of Wisconsin in a new
experimental area constructed in collaboration with a research group at
Wisconsin. Theoretical work on mixed-valence systems extends earlier effort in
Schatz's group and emphasizes the properties of extended linear chain systems.
