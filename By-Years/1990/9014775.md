Despite more than a decade of research into parallel computing systems, the
development of such systems remains a difficult and error-prone undertaking,
owing to the subtle interactions in which simultaneously executing components
may engage. One way to ensure that such systems behave correctly is to verify
them formally; this, however, can be an extremely complex task, and even the
development of automated tools has not permitted very large systems to be proved
correct. Using the framework of process algebra, the broad goal of this project
is to develop automated techniques that enable the verification of large
concurrent systems. The project will work along three lines. Methodologies will
be developed that exploit the structure of concurrent systems and their
specifications to reduce the verification process to a collection of more
manageable subproblems that may be solved using existing techniques. Automated
tools that support these methodologies will be built on top of an existing tool,
the Concurrency Workbench, which provides the basic support needed for the
proposed techniques. The utility of the methodologies and associated tools will
be evaluated by applying them to the verification of existing "real world"
communications protocols.
