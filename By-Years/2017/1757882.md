This REU site at Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station aims to provide
learning experiences for undergraduate students in the emerging area of
Cybermanufacturing. The project will support 10 undergraduate participants from
across the nation with an emphasis on recruiting women and underrepresented
minority groups. The REU site will engage participants in high quality research,
enrichment, and development experiences through a 10-week long summer research
program. The project will increase enthusiasm and research skills in advanced
manufacturing among early stage undergraduate students thereby preparing them
with professional skills to enter the STEM/knowledge workforce and/or to pursue
graduate school. Furthermore, this project will provide a valuable entry point
for a wide array of students from institutions with limited access to research
facilities and a strong impetus to pursue graduate school and careers in this
critical and growing industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU projects will
leverage the diverse Cybermanufacturing-focused efforts and testbeds of the
Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station's Institute for Manufacturing
Systems faculty to provide the students with a broad perspective of
Cybermanufacturing with specific focus on three critical aspects: a) design and
planning, b) in situ prognostics and process control, and c) enterprise-wide
optimization and coordination. The research testbeds are co-located as part of
the Advanced Manufacturing Facility. REU students will be exposed to this
intellectually stimulating research environment and gain critical skills to
contribute to this emerging research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
