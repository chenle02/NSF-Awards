The adsorption of simple organic molecules which can undergo acid-catalyzed
chemistry will be examined in high-silica zeolites using a variety of
techniques, including simultaneous temperature-programmed desorption and thermal
gravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic
resonance. The purpose of these adsorption studies will be to study the
interaction of intermediates with the zeolite lattice and ultimately to
formulate structure/reactivity relationships which can give insight into the
chemistry occurring at the acid sites. Zeolites with different crystal
structures and with different trivalent cations incorporated into the lattice
will be studied in order to determine how these properties affect the properties
of the acid sites. The experiments to be conducted should provide a basis for a
more detailed understanding of the acidity of high-silica zeolites.
