Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a computer-based system used to
capture, manage, edit, manipulate, analyze, synthesize and output
geographically-referenced information. The objective of this workshop is to
convene selected researchers and practitioners from academia, government and
industry to exchange information and ideas relating to GIS technology, and to
provide guidelines for others using or considering the use of this technology in
geotechnical engineering, especially in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The
workshop will be held in Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1992, at the
Georgia Institute of Technology, thereby benefiting by the presence on this
campus of the Center for Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis
Technologies. Rapid development of a variety of information systems, resulting
from the large demand to implement this technology, has led to a frequent
failure to clearly distinguish between GIS and other similar systems which do
not have the ability to integrate geographically referenced data analytically.
In addition, the inherent compatibility limitations between systems have led to
restricted usage of databases and the software used to manipulate them. These
potential problems will be addressed at the workshop.
