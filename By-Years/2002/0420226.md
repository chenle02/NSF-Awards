For plant seeds to develop, fertilization must occur, i.e., sperm cells from the
male must unite with female cells in the embryo sac. Because the embryo sac is
within the flower, the pollen tube of the male gametophyte must transport the
sperm cells to this destination by navigating through several floral tissues. It
accomplishes this crucial task by perceiving, interpreting and acting upon
signals from the surrounding floral tissues. This project seeks to understand
the mechanisms by which the male gametophyte develops and interacts with the
flower and embryo sac to accomplish fertilization. The roles of a family of
signaling proteins, the Rop GTPases, in coordinating the development of the male
gametophyte will be investigated. This investigation will combine a genetic
approach with molecular, cellular and bioinformatic methods, in two model
plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. Results from this work should establish
roles for specific maize Rop GTPases in the distinct stages of male gametophyte
development in vivo. Possible connections between A. thaliana pollen tube
growth, Rop GTPases, and localized exocytosis may be elucidated and genes in
maize and other grass crops that may influence Rop GTPase function may also be
identified. This research may inspire new agriculturally-beneficial ways for
controlling male gametophyte development, and thus plant reproduction, in maize
and other closely-related crops (rice, wheat). For example, control of the male
gametophyte could reduce unwanted gene flow from transgenic to non-transgenic
plants. An outreach program to the Portland Public Schools will inform the
public about pollen biology and bioinformatics. This program will allow high
school students to participate in scientific research by helping to build a web-
accessible database of broad interest to plant biologists.
