This one year, full-time award enables a physicist who directs the Carleton
College Technology Policy Project to develop his understanding of the
relationships between access to information and new information technologies and
political power and influence. He will spend a year at the University of
California at San Diego, working with two host scholars. Political scientist
Sanford Lakoff studies the interaction of science and government; Herbert York,
director emeritus of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, is an
experienced government servant and international negotiator on arms control and
other technology/society issues. Professor Lakoff will guide Professor Casper's
study and analysis of concepts in democratic theory such as "political
accountability" and "public right to know," and consideration of how such
concepts might be operationalized. Professor York will guide his study and
analysis of how scientists have both empowered and legitimated, and disempowered
and delegitimated citizen involvement. The project will place particular
emphasis on important new roles for colleges and universities in providing
citizens access to information and expertise. Among the concrete products of the
project will be a series of articles and a book, tentatively titled Experts,
Information and Political Empowerment. This project addresses a central issue in
ethics and values studies: the social values and mutual obligations and
responsibilities that arise in the interactions between scientists, engineers,
and citizens. The investigator and his host specialists and host institution are
uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project; research and
related activities are likely to continue after the period of the award. Results
are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount
ofd $43,000 is therefore recommended.
