Spatial knowledge plays an important role in daily life. We must learn the
layout of the streets and buildings to navigate between home and work. We must
remember where a book was put down, where the dinner plates are stored, and
other ordinary instances of spatial location. What's the nature of this spatial
knowledge? Are we allocentric in that we learn objects' spatial relationships to
each other, or egocentric in that we learn things relative to our own position
in space? If the latter, how do we acquire and maintain accurate knowledge when
it changes with every step we take and every turn we make? Also, have we a
different spatial system than our ancestors due to daily exposure to complex,
nested urban environment or new technologies such as maps and virtual realities?
With NSF support, Dr. Ranxiao Wang will seek to answer these questions. Her
studies include new methods to distinguish between different types of spatial
knowledge, to examine whether spatial knowledge differs for different types of
environments, and what forms of spatial knowledge operate in virtual
environments. The broader impacts of her research include the potential to
better understand various spatial deficits and navigation difficulties.
Moreover, her research compares spatial processing in real and virtual worlds,
which will provide insights for how to develop user-friendly virtual reality
systems.
