ABSTRACT: 9360802, PI-Furick: This research will develop an integrated framework
and software algorithms to seamless convert legacy paper blueprints into a
knowledge based form of electronic objects. These objects will hold the syntax
and semantics contained in the blueprints. The goal is a seamless transfer from
paper to persistent electronic form that can be implemented by a practicing
engineer who is not a computer expert.
