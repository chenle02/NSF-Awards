This proposal requests support for research designed (1) to develop an accurate
chronology for the climatic records contained in the Vostok East Antarctic ice-
core, including the carbon dioxide record soon to be published by C. Lorius and
his colleagues; and (2) to compare the Vostok records with climate records
obtained from deep-sea cores. The work will be carried out in close cooperation
with Claude Lorius and his colleagues at Grenoble. Given an accurate chronology,
the length and quality of the Vostok record provide an unprecedented opportunity
to understand the dynamics of processes which change carbon dioxide and climate.
By cross-correlating the Vostok and deep-sea records, investigations proposed
here will establish what the coherencies and phases are between: variations in
the atmosphere at Vostok; variations in the temperature, circulation, and carbon
budget of the ocean; and variations in volume of global ice. The proposed work
promises to link the two most valuable records of climate change on orbital time
scales (tens to hundreds of thousands of years) - ice cores and marine sediment
cores. This temporal correlation will allow the PI to investigate the detailed
nature of climate change in terms of atmospheric chemistry, oceanic circulation,
and volume of continental ice. The Vostok ice core is of special importance
because of its great length and excellent resolution.
