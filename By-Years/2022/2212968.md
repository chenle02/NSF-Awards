Machine learning has become a highly successful and practical tool for
understanding data, enabling new technologies, and aiding human decision-making.
However, its increased use in applications that impact people has also led to a
number of concerns. These include concerns about the fairness of decisions made,
concerns about incentives generated and the effect of strategic behavior on
accuracy of these systems, and concerns about the impact of classification
decisions on societal welfare. This project aims to develop theoretical
frameworks that advance the foundations for machine learning systems that
address these concerns. In particular, the high-level goal of this work is to be
able to provide clean guarantees both to those using these systems and to those
affected by the decisions they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this
project is centered around three main research directions. The first is to
advance the understanding of fairness in machine-learning and algorithmic
contexts, with emphasis on the interaction between fairness conditions and
biased training data, and on implementing fairness conditions in multi-stage
decision systems. The second direction involves strategic classification, which
is the problem of making classification decisions on agents that have the
ability to modify their observable features to a limited extent, and who may do
so if it leads to a decision they prefer. This work will tackle a number of
fundamental problems in the design of algorithms with provable accuracy
guarantees in such settings, especially for the challenging case of online
sequential decision-making. The third direction involves impacts on societal
welfare, and development of learning algorithms that combine classic accuracy
goals with goals that involve incentivizing societally-beneficial
behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
