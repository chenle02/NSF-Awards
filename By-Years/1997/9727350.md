9727350 The Division of Medical Sciences is a part of Harvard University that
supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
for students who are engaged in basic biological research in laboratories on the
Medical school campus. The Division will conduct a 1O-week summer research
program for undergraduate students to participate in research projects in the
field of microbial biochemistry and genetic regulation. In addition to their
research projects, students participate in a weekly student faculty research
discussion seminar series at which they teach other about their projects, and in
a weekly career development series, which covers such topics as choosing
graduate programs, completing successful applications, and interviewing. Three
sessions each summer are devoted to discussions of ethical issues in biological
sciences. Students will be recruited from a nation wide pool, with a particular
emphasis recruiting students who are interested in careers in biological
research and on recruiting qualified minority students and women. Students will
have the opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories of any of 18
Division faculty members who are participating in this program. Students will
also have opportunities to meet other majority and minority research faculty and
graduate students in both academic and social settings. These opportunities are
provided by the program, by the individual laboratories, and by the housing
accomodations, which are in the dormitory on the Medical School campus. Students
receive a stipend, housing, travel to and from program, and health insurance for
emergency illness and accidents.
