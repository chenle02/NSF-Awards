This proposal deals with many of the central questions in Fourier analysis and
how they manifest themselves on domains or more generally, Riemannian manifolds
with boundary. In the context of the Fourier transform on Euclidean space or the
flat torus, topics such as restriction theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-
time integrability estimates for wave and Schroedinger equations), and local
smoothing inequalities have been subjects of great interest for quite some time.
However, many questions remain on how these theories should play out on a
bounded or exterior domain. Here it may be appropriate to think of
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for the torus
with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions. In this regard, the
PI intends to explore estimates on the restriction of these clusters to curves
in the domain. In the case of Strichartz estimates, the PI and his collaborators
are using a parametrix-based approach to obtain results for general domains.
Further improvement is expected in certain contexts by making use of a
relatively new family of local smoothing estimates.

Fourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both
mathematical and physical theories. In particular, it strengthens our
understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical
physics. The research pursued here expects to have several applications to the
study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it. These investigations
should yield insight on how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences
the development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest.
