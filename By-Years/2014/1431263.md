Under the direction of Hannah Landecker, post-doctoral scholar Nadine Levine,
will carry out a two year laboratory ethnography focusing on the impact of big
data on the science of metabolism. This study of metabolomics, the post-genomic
study of the molecules and processes that make up metabolism, will serve as a
case study for the role and impact of big data in biomedical
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this project will
contribute to science policy discussions on the key opportunities and challenges
facing the increasingly prominent field of metabolomics, as well as other fields
of data-intensive research. Moreover, the findings of this project will provide
collaborative and educational resources, which will enable students,
researchers, and members of the public to understand how,and with what
consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, new understandings of
metabolism are being generated with big data.
