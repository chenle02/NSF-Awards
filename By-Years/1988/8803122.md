Within the past few years a large number of small RNAs have been discovered and
characterized. Several of these have been found to be regulatory molecules. One
small RNA termed micF RNA has been hypothesized to negatively regulate the
expressions of outer membrane protein F (ompF) at the level of translation in E
coli. The mechanism faction of micF RNA as a repressor molecular will be
elucidated. The kinetics of its systhesis and decay will be determined. The in
vivo levels of ompF m RNA in cells having micF on a multicopy plasmid, in
reference strains and in micF deletion strain will be investigated. Attempts
will be made to form a micF RNA - ompF m RNA hybrid in vitro and its properties
will be characterized. The question of whether small RNA molecules complementary
fo certain mRNA sequences can repress translation of those mRNAs is of much
current interest. Specifically is there a micC RNA that participates in the
regulation of ompC synthesis? MicF RNA may prove to be a prototype of other
regulatory RNA genes that function in eubacteria and it would indeed be exciting
if this were the case.
