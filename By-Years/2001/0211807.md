Wood accounts for 25% of the value of all industrial materials produced in the
U.S., and on an annual basis, the value of wood-derived products equals or
exceeds that of virtually every other agricultural crop. However, losses in
production forest acreage, coupled with increasing demands for paper and cheap
fiber supplies from overseas, have put intense pressure on U.S. companies to
increase wood yields per acre, particularly in southeastern forests.
Unfortunately, our limited understanding of tree biology constitutes a
significant barrier to attaining the productivity gains necessary to keep pace
with the rising consumer demand for wood products. Efforts are underway to
catalog genes expressed in the wood-forming tissues of loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), the predominant commercial tree species in the southeastern U.S.
Although this collection of wood-specific genes provides an excellent step
toward improved understanding of the basic genetic units governing wood
formation, it will be incomplete with respect to many genes that will prove
critical for increasing the productivity of tomorrow's forests.&lt;br/&gt;This
project will develop a collection of several thousand new genes derived
primarily from other pine tissues of commercial and biological significance, in
particular roots undergoing a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. To the
greatest extent possible, data from this project will be integrated with that
from other projects focused on genomic studies of pine so as to create a
seamless set of resources, such as a comprehensive unigene set, for the research
community. Such comprehensive unigene sets will form the basis of DNA
microarrays that will be used to identify genes whose expression varies in
response to various environmental and developmental cues, particularly those
responding to stresses that trees would likely experience when subjected to
intensive management regimes. Identification of such genes will provide for
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms trees use to respond to
environmental and biological stresses, and will enable the development of
techniques and tools, such as targeted microarrays, that could be used to
monitor in near real-time the effects of silvicultural practices on tree growth
and development. For example, microarrays of root genes that respond to specific
mineral or nutrient deficiencies could allow silviculturalists to judge whether
or not a new fertilization regimen was likely improve growth rates or wood
quality well before the phenotypic responses could be detected. Such new
techniques will provide the means for addressing current biological constraints
that limit forest productivity in the southeastern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;
