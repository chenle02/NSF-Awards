A pendulum can be described as a flow on a 2-dimensional "phase space," whose
coordinates are given by position and velocity. The mathematical system that
describes the motion of a pendulum is a dynamical system. Another example is
fluid dynamics, which for instance, is used to study the flow of air over an
airplane wing. Often, the structure of a phase space has implications for the
dynamical systems that it supports. For example, any flow on the sphere has a
stationary point, which means that the corresponding dynamical system has a
state that never changes. This project is concerned with the obverse of this
idea: What does a flow on a space say about the space itself? The spaces we
consider are 3-dimensional, like the space surrounding us; the flows are used as
a tool to "flatten" the space into simpler 1- and 2-dimensional spaces, where
the geometric structure of the original space is reflected in the symmetries of
these flattened spaces. In addition to its implications within mathematics, this
project has applications to applied dynamics, where the flattened spaces can be
used to understand the stability of fluid flows. Quasigeodesic and pseudo-Anosov
flows are product covered, which means that the orbit space in the universal
cover is a topological plane. This plane has a natural circle at infinity, with
an action of the fundamental group, which reflects the large-scale dynamics of
the flow and the geometry of the manifold. This project uses techniques from
dynamics, 3-manifolds, geometric group theory, and classical analysis situs to
understand the relationship between a flow, its underlying manifold, and the
circle at infinity. In particular, it aims to prove Calegari's conjecture that
every quasigeodesic flow may be deformed into a pseudo-Anosov flow, characterize
the circle actions that come from such flows, and use flows to understand
cubulations and essential surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
