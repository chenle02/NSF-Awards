This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I research project will
investigate the application of T-splines to the problem of computing a
topologically consistent surface intersection for geometric modeling
applications. In the CAD/CAM industry, most free-form geometric modeling is done
using NURBS surfaces. The intersection between two NURBS surfaces is
traditionally represented using trimmed-NURBS format, but trimmed-NURBS cannot
express the intersection of two NURBS surfaces without error, and hence a gap
occurs. T-splines are a dramatically new surface formulation that allows local
refinement, which means that a single control point can be inserted into a
T-spline control grid without changing the surface. The objective of the
proposed research is to study algorithms for computing the intersection of two
NURBS surfaces represented as T-splines. The anticipated result will be a robust
algorithm for representing the intersection of two NURBS surfaces using a single
gap-free T-spline model.

The gaps that occur in NURBS intersection algorithms mean that the resulting
models are not topologically consistent. This lack of topological consistency is
regarded as the single most serious unsolved problem in CAD/CAM. This problem is
estimated to cost the industry a billion dollars per year. A successful solution
to this problem will greatly reduce the design/analysis cycle time. T-splines
seem ideally suited to solve this problem. Furthermore, NURBS are a special case
of T-splines, and any T-spline can be converted without error into a NURBS. This
means that a T-spline-based solution to the surface intersection problem will be
forward and backward compatible with existing CAD/CAM software.
