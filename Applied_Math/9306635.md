9306635 Renardy The proposal addresses a number of problems in the mathematical
analysis of viscoelastic and multilayer flows and encompasses three components:
i) the development of a rigorous mathematical foundation for the analysis of
instabilities and bifurcations in viscoelastic flows. The issues to investigate
include the connection between linear stability and spectrum, and the existence
of center manifolds which allow the reduction of the dynamics to ODEs. While
these issues are well understood in Newtonian fluid dynamics, very little is
known in viscoelastic fluids; ii) the study of instabilities and qualitative
dynamics of fluid interfaces. Previous work in the area has been concerned with
linear stability and "simple" bifurcations. The proposed research will concern
more complicated bifurcations, such as sideband instabilities, and situations
where several unstable modes coexist; iii) the study of flow problems with open
boundaries. Such open boundaries arise from truncation of flow domains for
numerical purposes. The proposed research is aimed at addressing questions
relating to open boundaries in viscoelastic flows, and the possibility of
artificial instabilities resulting from the presence of open boundaries. A
graduate student will work on the existence of steady flows for model equations
resulting from kinetic theories of polymer solutions. The proposed research is
aimed at further developing the mathematical theory of the flow of polymeric
liquids, as well as multilayer flows. Such flows are important in many
industrial processing operations. The results of the proposed research will be
helpful in developing a better qualitative understanding of such flows and in
developing methods for their numerical simulation. The research focusses in
particular on the study of instabilities, i.e. qualitative changes in the nature
of the flow when certain parameters are changed, and on problems introduced by
artificial boundaries which arise w hen the flow domain is truncated for
numerical purposes. ***
