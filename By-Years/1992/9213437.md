Tropical intraseasonal oscillations are important to the short-term climate
variability of tropical latitudes and have connections with low-frequency
oscillations throughout the global atmosphere. Dr. Crum plans to pursue a broad
research effort aimed better understanding of the nature of these oscillations.
Conditional heating, where forcing of the large-scale circulation by organized
convection occurs in regions of large-scale moisture convergence, has a
significant nonlinear effect in determining the structure and horizontal scale
of these oscillations. Dr. Crum will expand upon previous results on conditional
heating using linear models which have been modified to allow for interaction of
the tropical waves with the stratosphere and boundary layer. He plans to examine
factors which control the amplitude of these oscillations, focussing on the
roles of moisture and static stability. The possible cooperative interaction
between convective clouds and the large scale, crucial to many theories, also
will be tested in a model with explicitly resolved clouds. A better
understanding of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation will lead eventually to
a better prediction of a variety of weather phenomena.
