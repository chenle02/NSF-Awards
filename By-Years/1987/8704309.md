This project will build initially an environment that supports Milner's
Calculus of Communicating Systems. CCS provides a simple and general model of
concurrency based on processes communicating via ports, and is also a formal
system in which semantics is represented nonprocedurally, i.e. via inference and
equational rules. The experiment with the CCS environment will be performed by
using it in several ongoing research projects involving concurrent systems.
These experiments will provide critical feedback on the environment's
effectiveness. The CCS environment will also serve as a laboratory to
investigate how the principles on which it is based extend to other languages.
This is an attempt to develop understanding of environments for the
specification and design of concurrent systems. Improved understanding of such
environments will be important in future designs.
