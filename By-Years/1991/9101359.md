This research project is concerned with algorithms for minimizing smooth
nonlinear functions of many variables. The research has both practical and
theoretical components, and its ultimate goal is the development of new general-
purpose software. The project has three components. (1) The incorporation of
variable metric information in algorithms for large constrained problems will be
considered. The initial effort will concentrate on the use of limited memory
methods for bound constrained problems, but novel techniques useful for more
general constraints will also be developed. (2) A complete convergence theory
for nonlinear conjugate gradient methods will be derived. The new results will
fill important gaps in our present understanding of nonlinear gradient methods.
The new methods suggested by the theory will be tested on large scale problems,
in particular, in the variational assimilation of metereological data. (3) New
full-rank automatic scaling techniques for optimization methods will be
developed. The idea is to scale the columns of a factorization of the Hessian
approximation. The scaling techniques will result in dramatic improvement in the
performance of quasi- Newton methods, especially for ill-conditions problems.
