Julio C. de Paula of Haverford College is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate the nature of excited states of
metalloporphyrins using time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The focus of
his studies will be (a) to investigate equilibrium dynamics between conformers
of tetraphenylporphyrins in triplet excited states, (b) to distinguish between
charge-transfer and metal-centered excited states by varying the substituents on
ruthenium and nickel ion complexes, and (c) to assign the time-resolved
resonance Raman spectra of the cupric tetraphenylporphyrins. Metalloporphyrins
have a rich photochemistry that may be applied to artificial photosynthesis,
molecular electronics, and photodynamic cancer therapy. For example, free-base
zinc and cupric porphyrins are known to sensitize tumor necrosis in vitro.
Further, polymers of ruthenium porphyrins are photoconductive and can act as
molecular wires. Non-planar metalloporphyrins are emerging as important
compounds for a number of these applications, because distortions of the
porphyrin ring modulate electrochemical and photochemical properties. These
studies of the excited electronic states of metalloporphyrins will lead to a
better understanding of their photochemical activity.
