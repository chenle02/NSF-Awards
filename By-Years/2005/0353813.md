This award from the Chemistry Education Program continues a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site at Wellesley College. Chris Arumainayagam and
David R. Haines share duties as the site's Program Director. Over the award
period (2004-2006) they will oversee a program of interdisciplinary research
between chemistry, biological sciences and environmental sciences. This REU
award provides research opportunities for ten undergraduate women, including
those with limited research opportunities at their home institution. The REU-
funded participants will join an active summer research program that includes
additional students funded by Wellesley and a diverse and commited group of
faculty researchers.
