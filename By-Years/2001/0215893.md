AST-0215893 Burles, Scott M.

An infrared echelle spectrograph will be designed, fabricated, assembled and
tested for use at the Magellan II telescope by researchers associated with the
Magellan consortium. It will be capable of observing faint targets in the
wavelength region in the UV (blueward of 3600 Angstroms), while maintaining high
resolution and full wavelength coverage of the visible spectrum. The design
incorporates a medium order reflection diffraction grating in combination with a
large fused-silica prism to provide cross dispersion. A Schmidt camera with
140-mm focal length will focus the 100 mm collimated beam onto a low noise; back
illuminated CCD optimized for UV coverage. ***
