0332070 Chanton The objectives of the proposed research are to:&lt;br/&gt;1.
Evaluate the performance of biocovers placed over the surface of landfill caps
in field test plots. A biocover consisting of a 30 cm layer of gravel for gas
dispersion overlain by a meter of mixed woodchips and mature composted yard
waste would be constructed and monitored for methane emission and oxidation over
2 annual cycles.&lt;br/&gt;2. Evaluate the performance of biofilters to
eliminate methane emissions and attenuate non methane organic compound (NMOC)
emissions from passive vents. Performance based designs for these systems would
be the product of this research. Prospective applications of biocovers in the
U.S. include landfills which are too small for commercial gas extraction, where
gas production has declined beyond the point of commercial interest, where gas
extraction is not required under U.S. EPA Clean Air Act Amendments, leaky areas
or hot spots, or where interim cover will be in place for a substantial period
of time before additional filling and eventual gas extraction.&lt;br/&gt;
