Scientific planning for international cooperative oceanographic research in the
Western and North Pacific Ocean will be supported. This will be accomplished
through partial support for an international secretariat for the Regional
Committee for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) of the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of Unesco. Additional support for this
secretariat, to be located in Canberra, Australia, is expected to be provided by
Australia and Japan. Planning for future international cooperative oceanographic
research in the North Pacific will be assisted by University of Washington staff
participation in international meetings to consider establishment of a Pacific
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (PICES).
