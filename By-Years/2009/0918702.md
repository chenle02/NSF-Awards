The Center for Science Education and the Center for Children and Technology at
the Education Development Center are developing and testing a prototype
electronic teacher's guide for a 12-week genetics unit in the NSF-funded
curriculum titled Foundation Science: Biology (0439443) to determine how it
impacts high school teachers' learning and practice. The electronic guide, which
is based on an existing print guide, has a flexible design so that it
anticipates and meets the curriculum planning and support needs of teachers with
different knowledge/skills profiles. The electronic guide provides teachers with
just-in-time, point-of-use access to resources that help teachers plan,
implement, and reflect on innovative reform-oriented instructional materials.

Case-study research will investigate how use of the guide changes teachers'
subject-matter knowledge, teachers' pedagogical content knowledge for science
content and science inquiry, teachers' classroom practices, and student
engagement. The results of this project will help to determine to what extent a
flexible and modular electronic teacher guide can afffect teacher practice and
to what extent it can enhance the ability of teachers to implement curricula
effectively.
