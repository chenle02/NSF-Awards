A central goal in nuclear physics research is to understand nuclear interactions
and properties from the underlying theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). At
low energies, however, QCD becomes non-linear and strongly interacting, eluding
first-principle pencil-and-paper calculations of nuclear properties. An
important aspect of nuclear physics at low energy is the physics associated with
weakly bound systems. Some properties of such systems are universally shared
across atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The effective field theory (EFT)
formulation allows for systematic calculations of nuclear properties that are
deeply rooted in QCD. EFT allows reliable error estimates in calculations that
are otherwise difficult to estimate in phenomenological approaches. In the
supported research work, EFT for few-body systems involving electromagnetic
radiation would be constructed. Key reactions involving light nuclei that are
relevant in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and stellar burning would be studied. Some
of these reactions play an important role in interpreting experimental results
probing physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The proposed work
would also introduce new model-independent tools with reliable error estimates
to study halo nuclei. These nuclei are described as a tightly bound core with
usually one or two valence neutrons forming a halo. This research ties in with
planned major U.S. investment in rare isotope beam experiments.

Broader impacts of the research include training of physics graduate students in
numerical and analytical work for an academic or industry career benefiting
society. Results from this research work would be incorporated in a graduate
course. Atomic physics research would also be affected by this study of weakly
bound few-body systems due to the universality described above. Atomic systems
with large scattering lengths form an active field of theoretical and
experimental research.
