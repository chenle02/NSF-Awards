The two investigators propose to continue their study of packing and covering of
space with congruent replicas of a convex body, including the analytical and the
combinatorial aspects of the topics. In their previous work, they obtained many
results in dimension 2, and some in dimension 3 and higher. The proposed
research concentrates on the covering problems in dimensions 3 and, whenever
feasible, in higher dimensions. The common thread linking the various problems
is the sphere covering conjecture in 3 dimensions. The following topics are the
main subjects of the proposed investigation: covering space with parallel
strings of spheres; covering space with congruent circular cylinders of infinite
length; circle covering (of the plane) with a margin; stability properties of
sphere coverings. The topics mentioned above belong to the area of discrete
geometry, and some of them, especially those dealing with lattice arrangements,
are related to the geometry of numbers. The problems addressed by the
investigators have an intuitive flavor and a natural motivation. For instance,
the sphere covering problem can be interpreted as searching for the most
economical distribution of transmission stations whose ranges are spherical and
of equal sizes to cover the whole space, i.e. so that every point is within
reach of at least one of the stations. Whenever it is discovered that a certain
optimality condition (e.g. minimum density, as in the example of transmission
stations distribution) of an arrangement of figures or solids implies some
regularity of the arrangement, a powerful tool is provided for computational
geometry. Results of this type give a theoretical foundation for finding
efficient computational algorithms. The investigators propose to increase their
contributions to this important and difficult area of research.
