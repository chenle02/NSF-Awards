Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Technical: High In-composition alloys (InGaN, xIn &gt; 0.25)
are among the most unexplored materials in the III-nitride system. While the
bandgap range of InGaN alloys can cover the entire spectrum from ultra-violet
(Eg, GaN ~ 3.4 eV) to infrared (Eg, InN ~ 0.7 eV), technological applications
until now are restricted to the higher energy range of this spectrum. The
relatively low number of applications in the lower bandgap III-nitride alloys is
due to the challenges associated with epitaxial growth, and poor understanding
of the electrical, defect, and optical characteristics of these materials. This
project will address the critical issues relating growth and structural
properties to electrical, optical, and defect properties to achieve higher
composition InGaN films on N-polar orientation of GaN. This project will
investigate the growth kinetics for this material in metal-rich and nitrogen-
rich regimes to create a comprehensive growth model for Ga- and N-polar InGaN.
This study will include thick InGaN films and strained InGaN films on GaN to
understand the physical origins of phase segragation, dislocation-mediated
relaxation, and surface morphologies. Electrical and optical characterizations
of the films will lead to an understanding of p-type and n-type doping, as well
as the background defect incorporation in the films (through deep level optical
spectroscopy). &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical: The study will enable device
applications that exploit the large bandgap range of III-nitrides. Extending the
tremendous commercial success of III-nitride emitters to a larger range of
optical and electronic applications will be transformative to the semiconductor
technology industry. The PIs have a strong record of extending their research
activities to involve high school students. The interdisciplinary nature of this
project requires close collaboration between the different groups involved, and
will be excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students involved.
