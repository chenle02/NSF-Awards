UNDERSTANDING WHAT MAKES NACRE STRONG AND TOUGH -- Design Rules for
Manufacturing Synthetic Nanocomposites Mimicking Seashells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nacre from seashells is a
natural composite with such a well-designed microstructure that its strength and
toughness are 20 to 30 times those of its constituents. What controls its
remarkable mechanical behavior is poorly understood and there is no design
guideline to develop new synthetic composites mimicking nacre. A first effort in
this direction will be a throughout investigation of how the microstructure
controls the deformation and failure mechanisms of nacre at multiple scales.
State of the art experimental techniques and intense modeling are employed at
this stage. In a second effort, novel nanocomposites mimicking nacre will be
developed. Their design will be based on the morphological and mechanical
features that where identified to be key to the strength and toughness of nacre.
A combination of ceramic platelets bonded with a softer metallic phase would
provide a hard and damage tolerant material ideal for aerospace and MEMS/NEMS
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
