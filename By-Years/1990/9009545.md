An important failure mechanism for ductile metals is the growth and coalescence
of microscopic voids. In this work an explicit Eulerian code will be developed
to study at the micromechanical level the dynamic failure of solids by void
growth and coalescence. The highly sophisticated and accurate interface tracking
methods developed for hypervelocity impact and penetration calculations will be
adopted for evolving new surfaces. The accuracy of the Eulerian calculations
will result in greater insight into this important failure mechanism.
