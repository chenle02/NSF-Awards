This project will construct an integrative biography of Nobel laureate Barbara
McClintock to help teachers of the history of science communicate McClintock's
work to students, and to help clarify the role of gender in the practice of
science and the development of scientific knowledge. Rather than be seen within
the context of a gendered model of scientific thought which unfairly robs her of
agency, McClintock will be seen as a transition figure in the shift from turn of
the century natural history to modern molecular genetics. Moreover, the project
seeks to examine many new sources that have become available. These include
McClintocks' laboratory notebooks and the 3 by 5 cards on which she recorded her
genetic crosses; her experimental material, correspondence, and a festschrift
produced for her 90th birthday in 1992. Interviews with her colleagues and
friends, supplemented by the festschrift will frame a composite sketch of the
reception of transposons and a portrait of McClintock as a woman and scientist.
