9322323 Mendillo The projected impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet
Jupiter offers an unprecedented opportunity to study a wide range of possible
effects in atmospheric science and space plasma physics. Dr. Mendillo will
search for signatures on the largest known spatial scale associated with the
planet - the sodium magneto-nebula that spans 1000 Jovian radii. He will conduct
an intense 3-week imaging campaign to document the state of the magneto-nebula
prior to, during, and following the encounter date in July 1994. Possible
disruption of the plasma-neutral interactions in the Io plasma torus and sodium
cloud that drive the great nebula bring unique "active experiment" investigation
techniques to planetary atmosphere research. ***
