9531005 Kioussis This is a RUI grant to a PI with a moderate length record with
the Materials Theory program in DMR. The PI is one of the very few people who
approach the problem of strongly correlated fermions with a strong background in
state of the art ab-initio electronic band structure and also in the many body
techniques. The current grant is to study unusual magnetism and crystal field
effects of a series of monopnictides and monochalcogenides of Cerium and
Uranium. These compounds are isostructural and have been selected for a
controlled study of the correlated f-electrons, incorporating the three
essential subtleties of magnetism all in one series: Crystal Field effects,
Kondo Effect and exchange interaction. %%% Exotic magnetism is often found in
the rare earth materials and their compounds. In this grant the objective is to
study the magnetic properties of (1:1) compounds of Cerium and Uranium, each
with two columns in the periodic table: group Vb, consisting of (N, P, As, Sb
and Bi) and the chalcogens of group VIb consisting of (O, S, Se, Te) using state
of the art techniques. ***
