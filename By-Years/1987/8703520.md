This is an SBIR Phase II award from the 1985 solicitation. Many important
problems in characterizing materials in the earth's lithosphere employ thermal
analysis. The innovation offered in this project is an unique system which
couples thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with evolved gas analysis (EGA)
performed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. An unique
feature of the system is its ability to provide continuous monitoring of the
infrared spectra of evolving liquids as well as quantitative analysis of gases.
The FT-IR system combines all of the control and data reduction functions in the
FT-IR's computer and thus is capable of providing an integrated, automated
instrument with extensive analysis of products at a limited analysis. The Phase
I program emphasized the characterization of energy resources. In collaboration
with Dr. Jean Whelan of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, a variety of the
petroleum source rock samples were analyzed with the TG-FTIR and the results
correlated with data on maturity, vitrinite reflectance, mineral composition,
organic content, and organic composition obtained by standard methods. Initial
results indicate that the TG-FTIR technique provides useful geochemical
information related to source rock characteristics including: a) Independent
maturation indicator,s Tmax of a number of organic and inorganic sediment
components; b) Material balance of organic and inorganic sedimentary carbon,
nitrogen, and sulfur; c) Data for classification of sedimentary organic matter
into kerogen Types I, II, and III and depositional environment. Phase II will be
devoted to improvements in the apparatus, in the methodology, in calibrations
using a variety of standard materials and in the application technique for a
variety of problems related to resource and pollution monitoring.
