The Monterey Bay Aquarium's educational programs model hands-on, process-based
science teaching, which is called "Wet Science". The Wet Science Project is
designed to improve the scientific literacy of 7th to 12th grade teachers,
strengthen their science-teaching skills, and develop support systems for hands-
on science in their districts. This project will train 120 teachers from 13
school districts. With each participant conducting one in-service for ten
colleagues, a total of 1200 teachers and their students will be reached. The
project duration is 36 months, and the cost sharing is 33 percent of the amount
requested for the National Science Foundation. The project consists of five
levels of teacher enhancement. The participants will learn science and wet-
science teaching, study upper-division marine ecology, conduct field research,
develop curriculum, and learn student research management, science education
promotion, multi-disciplinary team building, and adult teaching skills. The
participants will form teams to transform their wet-science experiences into
classroom of field-trip experiences for students and colleagues. Together with
their school administrators, the participants will integrate wet science into
district goals, curriculum and programs, and disseminate wet science to other
school districts, aquariums, and zoos.
