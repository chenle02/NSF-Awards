The project addresses the solutions of long-standing mathematical problems
dealing with non-linear propagation of waves. These problems are inspired by
important areas of science and engineering, such as water waves, lasers and
nonlinear optics, ferromagnetism, particle physics and general relativity. The
central theme of the project is the mathematical study of a remarkable
simplification for large time that occurs in such problems, as observed both
computationally and experimentally. In turn, such a mathematical study improves
the computational and experimental tools, thus yielding important new
applications. The research that is developed by the PI, his students, postdocs
and collaborators is also used as the basis for educational training at the
graduate and postgraduate levels. The results obtained as part of the project
are disseminated widely through the publication of research articles and
monographs, and through the internet. The main focus of the project is on the
study of soliton resolution for the energy critical nonlinear wave equation and
the wave map equation, both in the presence and the absence of symmetries, and
for other dispersive and dispersive-geometric models; the study of quantitative
unique continuation in local settings and at infinity, and in the case of
periodic coefficients with connections to homogenization theory. This is a
research program that should have lasting consequences for the development of
these subjects and which builds on the Principal Investigator's previous
research accomplishments. It is hoped that the project will have a synergistic
effect between the areas of science and engineering mentioned above and the
mathematical fields of analysis and geometry, as well as an important
educational impact through the training of future generations of researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
