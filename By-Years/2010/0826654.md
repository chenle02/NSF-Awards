The focus of this project is to develop techniques to objectively
(automatically) measure spoken language variability and change in aging. Many of
the most effective methods for cognitive assessment are mediated by observed
behavior, particularly spoken language production. These include clinical
instruments, e.g., the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), but also less
formal assessments involving interviews or dialogs with physicians or even
friends and family. Behavioral changes noted through these spoken language
interactions could indicate pathological changes associated with a disorder; or
the changes may be transient, due to missing medication or depression at the
time of assessment. Alternatively, the observed behavior may be simply due to
normal change in spoken language due to aging, or even within the range of
natural behavioral variation. Understanding normal versus pathological language
change with age requires the collection and annotation of repeated samples from
both healthy and impaired individuals. This project has three specific aims: 1)
to collect and transcribe longitudinal spoken language sample data elicited in
multiple ways from diverse elderly adults; 2) to develop algorithms for
automatically extracting features from these spoken language samples; and 3) to
characterize the variability of feature values across samples of the same
individual; and the utility of feature values and even feature variances for
discriminating between subject groups. A particular challenge being addressed by
this research is to achieve high-quality, efficient automatic annotation of
discourse structure for the spoken language samples. The resulting methods are
expected to directly contribute to important behavioral assessment
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
