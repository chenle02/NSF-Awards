This is a proposal to study the structure of bulk and thin film oxide
superconductors using perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy. The
primary objectives of the proposed research are: to determine the site-
occupation probabilities of indium in Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide material as a
function of temperature, oxygen concentration, and cation-alloy composition; to
determine the nature of the orthorombic/tetragonal phase transition which occurs
near 700C; and to provide accurate information about the Yttrium-Barrium-Copper-
Oxide phase diagram at high temperatures. Other major objectives are: to study
oxygen defect trapping by indium at low temperatures; and to study oxygen
ordered phases at low temperature. These issues are important for the processing
of high Tc superconductors.
