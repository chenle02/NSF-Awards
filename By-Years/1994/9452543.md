9452543 Schaumberg The purpose of this project is to introduce gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) into the undergraduate curriculum in
chemistry. Students will utilize GC/MS techniques in courses ranging from
introductory chemistry to advanced senior level courses including undergraduate
research. Specifically the students will be introduced to one of the most
powerful analytical techniques used in modern chemical laboratories. The
proposed Hewlett Packard GC/MS is very reliable and user friendly. This
instrument will significantly enhance the undergraduate curriculum both by
expanding experiments and by allowing the introduction of new experiments.
