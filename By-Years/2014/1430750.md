This award is for the oversight and management of the annual science workshops
offered by the SHINE (Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment)
program community over the five years. SHINE unites the U.S. scientists within
the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric research communities, who are
dedicated to promote enhanced understanding of the processes by which energy in
the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun and
accelerated in interplanetary space, and on the mechanisms by which these fields
and particles are transported to the Earth and elsewhere in the solar system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHINE research focuses upon the connection between events
and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the
heliosphere, as well as the origin and evolution of the solar wind, the nature
of turbulence in the interplanetary medium, and the production and transport of
solar energetic particles from the Sun through the heliosphere. The goal of
SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen our physical understanding of, and
predictive capabilities for, such phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the
course of this workshop support project, SHINE mentors and trains next-
generation scientists, while facilitating the community's exchange of ideas and
providing directions for future research. In addition to providing all
logistical support for the workshop's activities, this specific five-year effort
will fully fund the participation of at least 55 U.S. students and 5 U.S.
postdoctoral fellows annually, as well as up to five foreign students and
scientists able to make unique contributions to the SHINE science community. As
a community-based research group engaged in space weather science, SHINE is also
allied with other community science programs within the NSF that support
research in magnetosphere physics, ionospheric physics, and aeronomy.
