The broad-scale goal of this research is to characterize the structure and
function of a novel 82 kD protein which was recently identified in this
laboratory as a component of adhesion plaques and zonulae adherens of cultured
cells. The specific aim of this project is to define the structural features of
the 82 kD protein. The primary sequence will be determined by molecular cloning
and sequencing techniques. Secondary structure will be predicted and conserved
structural motifs and functional domains will be identified. Sequences that are
required to address the 82 kD protein to adherens junctions will be defined in
transient transfection experiments. Previous work from this laboratory has
suggested that multiple isoforms of the protein are present in smooth muscle.
The biochemical basis for differences among these isoforms (e.g., post-
translational modifications) will be investigated. In addition, rotary shadowing
will be used to characterize the molecular shape of the protein. The adherens
junctions represent a specialized class of cell-cell and cell-matrix
associations that are characterized by the presence of filamentous actin on the
cytoplasmic face of the junctional membrane. These include the focal contacts or
adhesion plaques of cultured cells, the zonulae adherens (or "belt desmosomes")
found in the apical junctional complexes of epithelial cells, the dense plaques
of smooth muscle, the fascia adherens of cardiac muscle, and the myotendinous
junction. These junctions share in common a number of structural features,
though they also exhibit a degree of molecular heterogeneity. The finding of a
novel 82 kD protein which is localized specifically to these junctions is
particularly interesting. The detailed studies to be performed with this award
should lead to an understanding of how these junctions are organized and
regulated in living cells.
