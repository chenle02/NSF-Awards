Many large granitic bodies (plutons) are thought to originate as partial melts
at mid-crustal levels. However, there is as yet no clear understanding of the
process of forming a large amount of melt under such conditions nor of the
source and transport of the necessary H2O. This detailed study of two small but
well-exposed areas in the Swiss Alps could reveal an incipient state of pluton
formation. The proposed research will explore the feasibility of generating a
granitic pluton from such an area by using several analytical techniques to
characterize the rocks in major and trace element composition, estimates of P-T
conditions, stable and radiogenic isotopes, and fluid inclusions. The results
will also contribute toward a better understanding of overall crustal processes.
Interactive activities include; recruiting a female graduate student to
participate in the research; conducting a seminar at graduate level and acting
as a guest lecturer in undergraduate classes with a special emphasis on
promoting interest in natural resources, environmental and social impacts of
resources exploitation, and conservation.
