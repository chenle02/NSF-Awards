Borisov will study in detail the IIA-IIB superstring theories that correspond to
Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The goal is to provide geometric
meaning to the combinatorial construction of N=2 vertex algebras associated with
such theories. In another part of the project, Borisov will try to prove the
derived equivalence conjecture for K-equivalent algebraic varieties. His
approach aims at defining a triangulated category of any log-terminal pair,
which would extend the notion of the derived category of a variety to this more
general context. Finally, Borisov will strive to settle a puzzling discrepancy
between the numbers of parameters of deformation of small quantum cohomology of
a DM stack and of those of a crepant resolution of its coarse moduli space.

Generally, Borisov will try to build mathematical tools necessary for further
development of string theory. In the particular flavor of string theory that
Borisov's project is related to, strings are expected to propagate on a "small"
space of dimension six with very peculiar properties. Borisov's approach may
generalize this small space to other mathematical data, which may potentially
increase the flexibility of the theory.
