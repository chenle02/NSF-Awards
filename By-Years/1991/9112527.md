The purpose of this project is to use newly available within-firm personnel
data, including longitudinal employee records, to study internal labor markets
over the business cycle. Statistical patterns in real wages over the business
cycle and knowledgeable observers' descriptions of employer practices suggest
that cyclical variation in firms' hiring standards and promotion rates play a
key role in aggregate employment and wage fluctuations. This aspect of the
business cycle, however, has never been subjected to quantitative study because
of the general unavailability of within-firm data. This project uses personnel
records recently acquired from the Ford Motor Company, the Pullman Company, and
the A.M. Byers Company to peer inside the "black box" of the internal labor
market. This unique opportunity to track individual workers' wages and job
assignments within the firm and relate them to conditions in the aggregate labor
market will shed new light on both the nature of cyclical labor market
fluctuations and the nature of the employment relationship.
