We plan to achieve these goals by applying the pulsed field technique to DNA
sequencing by developing an instrument and switching conditions that will extend
the capability of current DNA sequencing apparatuses. This project will increase
the throughput of current DNA sequencing technology significantly and will
benefit all areas of research which use molecular approaches. This is a proposal
to develop a 20,000 volt computer controlled switching system for application in
the pulsed field technique to DNA sequencing by electrophoresis. Optimum field
inversion condition will be determined for separating single stranded DNA as
large as 2 kilobases. The effect of parameters such as voltage gradients,
buffer, temperature, switch times, switching regimens, and composition and
formulation of gel matrix on the resolution of large DNA fragments will be
studied. The goal is to extend the amount of readable sequences from a DNA
sequencing gel.
