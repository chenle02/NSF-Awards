Today, asphalt is no longer a simple mix of coarse and fine aggregate and
asphaltic cement. Recyclables such as glass, rubber tires, and reclaimed asphalt
pavements (RAP) are being added to the asphalt mixes. In addition, different
asphalt binders, other than asphaltic cement, are being used to accommodate
these new recyclable materials while, at the same time, adhering to specified
criteria. These performance-based specifications will radically change how
asphalt and asphalt aggregate mixes are tested in the laboratory. Existing
asphalt testing laboratories will need to retrofit, at substantial cost, to meet
the projected testing needs specified by SHRP. In order to prepare the
undergraduate civil engineering student adequately for these crucial
technological changes in asphalt testing, the university requires state-of-the-
art equipment.
