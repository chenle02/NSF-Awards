Microbial ecologists are unsure of the composition and structure of any
microbial community, because traditional methods cannot ensure the recognition
of all community members. This provides a poor basis for understanding how
toxicants and genetically engineered organisms affect natural microbial
communities. New solutions to this problem come from molecular phylogeny and
improvements in recombinant-DNA technology. 16S rRNA is a unique cellular
component useful for describing microbial communities. Prior work on this
approach leads to the proposed development of a method for retrieving 16S rRNA
sequence information from natural communities as copy DNA, valuable in that it
permits quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of community members. The
limitations and scope of the method will be analyzed on a hot spring
cyanobacterial mat community as a model.
