9619674 Kummer ABSTRACT This proposal to continue a summer biomedical
engineering research fellowship program for undergraduates is based on program
successfully conducted at this institution for fifteen consecutive summers, the
past four of which were conducted with NSF-REU support. The program is based on
the premise that the ideal place to supplement the basic education of
bioengineers with practical experience and expose them to real-life situations
of the sort that will characterize their future careers in the intense medical
environment of a teaching hospital. Such experience is critical to the education
of engineers and scientists who will create new concepts and develop, design,
and manufacture medical devices. Such training, moreover, is necessary to
maintain and expand the competitive edge enjoyed by the U.S. medical device
industry, whose products are recognized as being the world's best. The program's
projects, chosen from ongoing research activities at the Hospital for Joint
Diseases' Musculoskeletal Research Center with independent fund sources, involve
ligament and cartilage repair, spinal fixation, fracture repair, physical
chemistry of biomineralization, mechanical effects on tissue growth, and total
joint design. In previous years, this strategy of adding undergraduate fellows
to established research groups has maximized the students' results and given
them a sense of contributing to an ongoing, useful research effort. ***
