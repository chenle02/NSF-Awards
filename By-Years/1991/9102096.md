This project funds the participation of 28 minority faculty at the ACM CSC 91
and SIGCSE 91 conferences to be held in San Antonio, TX, March 5-9, 1991. There
is a number of planned special activities which are important to minority
faculty, particularly those from minority institutions. Among the planned
activities are (1) special sessions addressing unique programs for minorities,
(2) panels addressing federal funding possibilities for minority research
programs, (3) an employment register, (4) graduate schools describing
opportunities for minorities, and (5) a special session in the chairs' program
addressing problems associated with administering a computer science program at
a minority institution. This project funds the participation of 28 minority
faculty at the ACM CSC 91 and SIGCSE 91 conferences to be held in San Antonio,
TX, March 5-9, 1991. It is important that minority faculty attend national
conferences in order to become better integrated into the research and education
communities. This project represents a strong effort in that direction.
