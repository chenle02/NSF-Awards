A combined modeling and experimental program of research will be conducted on
various topics relevant to near-wall turbulence. The primary tools are Particle
Imaging Velocimetry and Direct Numerical Simulation. Topics include high
Reynolds number channel flow, flow over a wavy wall, flow oscillatory in time,
and flow with polymer injection for drag reduction. Wall shear stress in
separating and reversing flows will be measured with electrochemical methods.
Complex turbulent flows are relevant to a very broad range of industrial
processes in Mechanical and Chemical engineering, and there is still a low
degree of reliability in predicting their characteristics due to the complexity
of turbulence.
