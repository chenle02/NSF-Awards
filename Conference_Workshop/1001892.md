This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a semester-
long program on celestial mechanics at the University of Maryland during the
Spring 2010 term. Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians
(i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not have their own
support.

The semester's program will cover a wide range of topics in dynamical systems,
linked together by their relationship to celestial mechanics and Hamiltonian
systems. An impressive number of the world's leading authorities on dynamics
have agreed to take part in the program. This semester of emphasis will afford
many aspiring young dynamicists an opportunity to interact on an extended basis
with some of the luminaries in the field.
