9627230 King The PI proposes to utilize newly developed formulations for viscous
faulting, non-Newtonian rheology, and phase transitions to focus on the
deformation and thermal structure of subduction zones from dynamically self-
consistent convection models. The proposed models will focus on questions at
intermediate length scales, and will result in a set of thermal models of
subduction zones with more physically realistic temperature profiles. The models
will be used to ray-trace through and calculate seismic residual sphere anomaly
patterns and starting models for slab tomograpy, and will also be used to
develop more realistic geotherms in subduction zones. ***
