Proposed research involves theoretical study of stable, spatially
inhomogeneous, vibrational excitations in periodic but anharmonic lattices.
Detailed analytic studies and molecular dynamics computer simulations will be
used. The second part of the proposal concerns the solid state defect system
KI:Ag+. Investigated will be the possible role played by the intrinsic
anharmonic resonance modes. Other studies on this system are also proposed.
