This award supports research involving a study of the applicability of
Artificial Neural Networks to the problem of determination and compensation of
positioning errors in machine tools and coordinate measuring machines. Research
issues which will be explored are: (1) Prediction and compensation of
geometrically induced errors using a neural network to map workspace positions
into tool point error vectors with training data obtained from machine
measurement of a precision physical artifact. (2) Prediction and compensation of
thermally induced errors using a small number of strategically located
temperature probes as additional input to an expanded neural net, and performing
the artifact measurement for differing thermal states of the machine. (3)
Generation of design rules for the design of the physical artifact to insure
optimal performance of the neural net error compensation technique. (4)
Investigation of the possibility of using the results of dimensional inspection
of manufactured parts to update the training set for the neural network; thus
closing the loop between process output quality and process input variables,
resulting in continuous process improvement in an automated factory environment.
(5) Investigation into the necessary architectural features and computational
capabilities of a hybrid neural net machine tool controller.
