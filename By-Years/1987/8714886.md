This award will support a collaborative workshop between a group of U.S.
researchers headed by Professors Darrell Doyle and Morton Rothstein of SUNY at
Buffalo, and a similar group of Italian researchers headed by Professors E.
Bergamini and P. L. Ipata of the University of Pisa on the subject of protein
metabolism in aging. Alterations of protein metabolism represent an important
facet of the aging process. While it is known that a number of changes take
place, the mechanisms behind these changes are poorly defined. For example,
cell-free protein synthesizing systems from various tissues of old animals
function less effectively than those from equivalent young preparations with
highly significant differences. More recent work has demonstrated that old rat
liver ribosomes are deficient in a protein factor present in young ribosomes. On
a broader scale, protein turnover has been shown to slow substantially with age,
although the reasons are obscure. Alterations in enzyme structure with age is an
area that can be presumed to lead to physiological consequences also.
Modifications of hormone receptors would also be expected to play a role in
regulation of metabolism regulation. These are a few examples of a variety of
current and ongoing investigations related to aging and protein changes. The
purpose of convening the proposed meeting is to increase our understanding of
what is known about protein structure, regulation, and metabolism as it relates
to aging. While there have been other meetings related to protein turnover, none
so far has focused on age-related changes in protein structure and metabolism,
together with selected topics in important related areas. Giving the aging
population in the U.S. this topic is one of increasing interest for basic
research. A workshop getting together researchers in the U.S. with leading
researchers in Italy, where a strong focus on aging research has developed, has
the potential to lead to successful exchange of information and to future
collaborative projects in this important area.
