This one-year Collaborative Planning project seeks to bring together an
interdisciplinary planning team of informal and formal STEM educators,
researchers, scientists, community, and policy experts to identify the elements,
activities, and community relationships necessary to cultivate and sustain a
thriving regional early childhood (ages 3-6) STEM ecosystem. Based in Southeast
San Diego, planning and research will focus on understanding the needs and
interests of young Latino dual language learners from low income homes, as well
as identify regional assets (e.g., museums, afterschool programs, universities,
schools) that could coalesce efforts to systematically increase access to
developmentally appropriate informal STEM activities and resources, particularly
those focused on engineering and computational thinking. This project has the
potential to enhance the infrastructure of early STEM education by providing a
model for the planning and development of early childhood focused coalitions
around the topic of STEM learning and engagement. In addition, identifying how
to bridge STEM learning experiences between home, pre-k learning environments,
and formal school addresses a longstanding challenge of sustaining STEM skills
as young children transition between environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
planning process will use an iterative mixed-methods approach to develop both
qualitative and quantitative and data. Specific planning strategies include the
use of group facilitation techniques such as World Caf√©, graphic recording, and
live polling. Planning outcomes include: 1) a literature review on STEM
ecosystems; 2) an Early Childhood STEM Community Asset Map of southeast San
Diego; 3) a set of proposed design principles for identifying and creating early
childhood STEM ecosystems in low income communities; and 4) a theory of action
that could guide future design and research. This project is funded by the
Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches
to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM
learning in informal environments.
