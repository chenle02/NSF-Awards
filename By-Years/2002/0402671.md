This project provides for the continued functioning of the Steering Committee
for the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program for three years. The GEM
program is a major program in magnetospheric physics with the ultimate goal of
producing a General Geospace Circulation Model. The GEM program has been very
successful in the past in large part due to the efforts of the GEM Steering
Committee and in particular the Chair of that committee. This grant will provide
a small level of support for the continued participation of the current GEM
Steering Committee Chairman in the GEM workshops and planning meetings.
