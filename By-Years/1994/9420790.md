This proposal is composed of both research and continued operations of the
neutron monitors at Climax, Colorado and Haleakala, Hawaii. The motivation for
research is to understand the physics of the electrodynamical processes in three
dimensions in the inner heliosphere, with special emphasis on the solar-
terrestrial region. In addition, the PIs will continue their long-term studies
of the apparent bimodal character of cosmic ray modulation through the next
solar minimum. Finally, the PIs wish to implement the continuation of the Climax
and Haleakala neutron monitors extending into the solar minimum period with the
same level of precision maintained over successive solar activity cycles.
