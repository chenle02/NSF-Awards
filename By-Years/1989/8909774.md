academic community in the next decade. First, the workshop will explore the
future directions of technology in engineering education. There emphasis will be
on philosophical input rather than specific hardware or software. Secondly, the
workshop will address the research agenda for computer aided design, computer
aided engineering and computer aided manufacturing in the United States for the
next decade. A broad national perspective is desired which can then be focused
on the role to be played by university research in meeting national objectives.
