Title: Non-equilibrium collisional transport in nano and mesoscale modeling

This research project is concerned with several equations of statistical
mechanics and transport theory at the nano- and mesoscale. Of particular
interest are integrodifferential equations for kinetic collisional transport
(like the Boltzmann equation) and systems of integrodifferential and partial-
differential equations for transport of charged particles (quantum hydrodynamic-
Poisson equations). The goal is to rigorously analyze these equations by proving
existence and stability theorems and by numerically simulating the underlying
physical problems. The project requires the development and application of new
tools from nonlinear analysis, as well as the design of new computational
strategies linking the different models from the quantum level to the kinetic
level to the fluid level.

This research program has applications in several areas. We mention the rapid
flow of granular materials, which is described by statistical models for
collisional transport of inelastic particles, and electronic nanodevice
modeling, where channel lengths are of the order of nanometers and quantum
tunneling effects are important. The results of this research are expected to
lead to the design of deterministic computational tools that can be applied to
the simulation of multiscale phenomena in highly heterogeneous media, for
example in turbulent granular flow problems and electronic or biological
nanodevice modeling.
