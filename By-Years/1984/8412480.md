An electropolymerization process for the application of very thin polymeric
coatings on 8-micron diameter graphite fiber will be investigated. In this
process the polymerization reaction is initiated electrically at the graphite
fiber surface. Since the monomer is unsoluble in the electrolyte but the polymer
is not, the polymer tends to deposit on the graphite fiber surfaces as it is
formed. These fibers will be used to improve the strengths of fiber reinforced
composite materials, particularly those used in biochemical applications.
