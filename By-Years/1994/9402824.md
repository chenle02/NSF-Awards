9402824 Skalak This proposal from University of California at San Diego requests
partial support to conduct a conference entitled Biomaterials: Cellular Response
to Implanted Materials. The symposium focuses on integration of the structure
and surface properties of implants form the standpoint of the cellular level
responses of biological tissues to non- biological materials and to survey
current clinical rehabilitation needs in regards to the performance of implanted
biomaterials. The aim of the conference is to bring together materials
scientists, cell biologists and practicing clinicians in rehabilitation
medicine. %%% Presenter participants in the symposium are world leaders in
biomaterials, cell biology, and clinical rehabilitation medicine. Funding
requested from the NSF would provide partial support for invited participants.
The results of the conference will be recorded in a Proceedings, which will be
sent to all conference participants and to related organizations and agencies,
thereby making symposium results available to a large audience. ***
