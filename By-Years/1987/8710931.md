This project will explore a variety of mathematical and statistical theories
related to large, high dimensional data sets. Specifically the focus is on
graphical methods for data representation in higher dimensions, structural
inference, density and function estimation, elements of computational geometry,
the relationship of algorithms and architectures, and high - interaction
graphics. All of these topics intertwine to form the conceptual core of the
approach to large, high dimensional data sets.
