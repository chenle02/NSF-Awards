The objective of this research is to create a new class of Si-based
electroabsorption modulators (EAM) that operate at an unprecedented bandwidth of
80Gb/s. The approach is to use 3D wafer bonding technology to vertically couple
light into a nanowire high-index contrast silicon waveguide. A graded base SiGe
heterojunction transistor is the baseline electric structure of the modulator,
while the free carrier plasma effect is used to generate optical absorption
modulation. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: For high capacity fiber-optic
systems, a Si-based, monolithically integrated fast EAM is an appealing
alternative technology to commercial III-V compound semiconductor based
modulators. The proposed research will explore the carrier transport phenomena
and its corresponding optical attenuation effect in a SiGe heterojuction
transistor, as well as various design trade-offs among modulation depth, signal
dispersion, operation speed, power consumption, and local heating effects. The
proposed work will design a fully integrated modulator driver circuit using
unmodified, silicon fabrication processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: An 80Gbps, low-power, and small footprint Si based EAM will be a
breakthrough technology in advancing the development of the next generation of
broadband fiber-optic networking and lightwave circuits for high-speed
computing. There is a strong, synergistic educational and mentoring component
for students at all levels. Outreach efforts will broaden participation of
under-represented groups and undergraduate students in research programs at both
institutions. K-12 outreach activities will be in collaboration with New York
New Vision program at RPI, and through the Center for Engineering Educational
Outreach (CEEO) at Tufts.
