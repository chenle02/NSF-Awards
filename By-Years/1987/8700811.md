This workshop will explore a number of fundamental issues associated with the
design and analysis of parallel and distributed algorithms in computation and
data communication networks. The following topics are among those to be explored
at this workshop: (1) Synchronous and asynchronous parallel algorithms in
numerical analysis, mathematical programming, combinatorial problems. Also
distributed algorithms in an unreliable computing context (Byzantine algorithms,
etc.), (2) Complexity of parallel computation, (3) Parallel computer
architectures, (4) Distributed control of data communication networks (e.g.,
routing, etc.), and (5) Distributed control in multiaccess communication schemes
and other problems in decentralized decision theory.
