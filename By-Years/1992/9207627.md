To gain a better understanding of the storage process in plants, the PIs will
study plants that have evolved in an ecosystem in which storage is obviously
useful. The alpine environment is one in which such a condition exists. Alpine
plants provide unique opportunities to study the advantages and costs of
resource storage to plants. The PIs will use alpine plants as model systems to
study storage as a general phenomenon. The study will yield new information on
how storage benefits growth of these plants, what its costs are in terms of
future growth, and how plants can conduct storage in a competitive environment
where soil microorganisms use the same resources. The questions addressed in
this proposal have several practical implications. First, by studying plant
survival in harsh ecosystems, the PIs will learn about adaptations that could be
useful for plants in agricultural systems. Second, a basic understanding of soil
nitrogen transformations can have a practical application in agricultural
ecosystems. Finally, the approach developed will provide useful information on
processes in alpine ecosystems, an area that may prove quite susceptible to
global warming and other climate changes.
