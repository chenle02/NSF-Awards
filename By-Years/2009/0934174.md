This award will fund an International Workshop on Frontiers of Complexity
Science and Social Science at the International Social Science Council, World
Social Science Forum. The session will focus on issues of complexity in the
social sciences. Much of the current literature in complexity science focuses on
tipping points and emergent phenomena, both of which have implications for
policy-making. The panel will bring together several experts in the scientific
community on complexity science to present their recent research in this area.
This workshop will bring together speakers from the United States, Japan, Peru,
Germany, and the UK with the other participants at the World Social Science
Forum.

The workshop session has strong potential to contribute to the complexity
science literature and to identify future areas of research. The proposal is
well designed and is organized by a leading scientist in the field who has
experience designing workshops and symposia.

The proposed workshop has strong broader impacts in that it will strengthen
international collaborations in the area of complexity science that is very
important to the SBE sciences.
