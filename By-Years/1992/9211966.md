Acellular bone was discovered over 100 years ago, and yet many fundamental
qualities of its biology remain obscure. Acellular bone comprised the skeleton
of the earliest vertebrates, "heterostracans," which are now extinct. Most
living vertebrates possess cellular bone. However, one group of extant derived
fishes, the Teleostei, includes many members with acellular bone. Although it
has been assumed to be similar in both groups, there has never been a
comparative study of this peculiar tissue in teleosts and "heterostracans." This
study addresses the development of acellular bone in "heterostracans" and
teleosts in order to determine whether this tissue is the same in these two
distantly related groups. Growth series of heterostracan fossils will be
compared to developmental series of a living fish with acellular bone, Geophagus
brasiliensis. The study will focus on microscopic aspects of bone such as the
amount and site of cell entrapment within the hard tissues, the relative size of
tooth-like structures, and how these factors relate to the overall pattern of
morphogenesis. The result will be the first comprehensive developmental study of
earliest vertebrate hard tissues. Furthermore, it will elucidate some basic
aspects of the biology of acellular bone.
