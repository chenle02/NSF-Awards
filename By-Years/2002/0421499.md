0421499 -- Walker/U of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A submillimeter-wave
heterodyne array receiver will be constructed for use at the Cassegrain focus of
the 10-meter Heinrich Hertz Telescope. The array will operate in the
astrophysically rich 870 micron atmospheric absorption window where the HHT has
the highest efficiency of any submillimeter telescope in the world and excellent
atmospheric transmission more than 40% of the time. The Superheterodyne Camera
(SuperCam) will be an 8x8, integrated receiver array fabricated using leading-
edge mixer, local oscillator, low-noise amplifier, cryogenic, and digital signal
processing technologies.
