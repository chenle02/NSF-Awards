An award is made to the University of South Carolina to support the Peromyscus
Genetic Stock Center (PGSC). Animals of the genus Peromyscus are the most
abundant and widely distributed North American mammals. Due to a series of
characteristics, Peromyscus emerged as a model of choice for the study of major
biological processes such as speciation, adaptation and stress response,
behavior adaptation in the context of physiology and evolution, host-parasite
interactions, microbiome-associated studies and others. The PGSC facilitates
biological research and workforce development through training of undergraduate
and graduate students in Peromyscus-related research. It also assists internal
and external investigators in their research projects and provides training in
animal handling and manipulation. The PGSC also operates as a focal point for
Peromyscus-associated research through its Newsletter that is published twice a
year and the maintenance of a website that disseminates information that is of
interest to investigators using Peromyscus.

The PGSC maintains and distributes outbred stocks of Peromyscus and several
behavioral and coat-color mutants. In addition, it provides biological samples
of various species, such as fresh, frozen and preserved tissues, DNA, fecal and
blood samples and in response to external requests performs small-scale research
projects to facilitate external investigators research needs. In view of the
increasing concerns of the scientific community for transparency and
reproducibility of the scientific results, the existence and regular operation
of the PGSC warrants the availability of animals of verified quality, health,
genetic and physiological status and of their unbiased and uninterrupted supply
to investigators requesting them. These activities are of particular value to
NSF supported investigators who require diversified animals of reliable genetic
and physiological state.
