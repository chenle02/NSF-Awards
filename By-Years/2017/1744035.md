The conference "Dynamics Days 2018" will take place in Denver, Colorado in
January 4-6, 2018. Dynamics Days is an international conference focused on
chaos, nonlinear dynamics, and their applications. This award provides funds to
defray travel costs for graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs without
other sources of support. This year the conference will showcase research in
areas including networks, fluid dynamics, mixing, topological time series
analysis, nonlinear waves, dynamic mode decomposition, and biological systems.
The conference will have 15 invited speakers, a similar number of contributed
speakers, and poster sessions. The conference webpage is
http://www.colorado.edu/amath/ddays-2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics Days is
an international conference on applications of nonlinear dynamics and chaos
which has been running in the US for 35 years. During this time, it has
established itself as one of the main venues for the discussion of new ideas in
nonlinear dynamics. The conference is characterized by covering a wide area of
applications, which promotes the exchange of ideas and dissemination of results
across different fields. The variety of topics attracts participants with
diverse backgrounds, including physics, mathematics, engineering, and biology.
Travel awards will be offered to graduate and undergraduate students and
postdocs without other sources of support. These participants will be able to
present their results in contributed talks or poster sessions, and will gain a
broad perspective of interdisciplinary research in the field. The participation
of underrepresented groups will be encouraged.
