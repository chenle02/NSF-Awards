This project involves the deployment of surface current drifters across the
equatorial Pacific Ocean basin, and the analysis of their trajectories and data
collected from current and temperature sensors mounted in them. International
cooperation with France, Australia, and Japan is anticipated. 350 surface
drifters will be deployed in the equatorial Pacific over a three-year period to
determine the upper layer advection and heat content and its evolution. During
the first year the primary procurement of drifters will be through this grant,
but in out years, contributions from the French, Australians, and possibly the
Japanese have been committed. This experiment is a process study contributing to
the objectives of the US TOGA (Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere) Program.
