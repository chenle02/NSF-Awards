The intent of this project is to (1) adapt and refine for the two-year college
environment existing microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) curriculum materials
and (2) to extend this area by developing additional MBL curriculum pieces that
provide a more complete collection of laboratory activities for introductory
physics laboratories. The targeted laboratories include the laboratory from the
calculus-based course, trigonometry-based course, conceptual-based (liberal
arts) course, and the technical physics (for technical/vocational students)
course. These curriculum pieces are being initially tested at two different two-
year college laboratories and then tested further at several other two-year
college sites.
