0420888&lt;br/&gt;Stroud&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to develop instrumentation supporting and enhancing research efforts in three
University of Rochester departments in the field of quantum optics, quantum
information, nanotechnology, and microscopy. The instrumentation will allow the
production, detection, and characterization of individual photons interacting
with matter. It will consist of three modules: a single-photon-on-demand source,
high-speed single-photon detectors with 10% efficiency at optical communications
wavelengths, and a high-speed photon statistics analyzer that can operate with 8
ps time resolution. These state-of-the-art facilities will support research in
the Institute of Optics, the departments of Physics and Astronomy, and
Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Center for Quantum Information. The
PIs will collaborate in this project with BBN Technologies, which is building
the world's first absolutely secure quantum key distribution network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it
provides essential instrumentation supporting research in some of the most
promising new fields of technology: quantum information processing, quantum
communications, and nanoscience. All of these involve the controlled interaction
of the smallest units of light with the smallest units of matter: single photons
interacting with single molecules. The facilities developed in this project will
allow work at the University of Rochester to progress in all of these fields.
The broader impact toward which this research is aimed is the development of
quantum computers exponentially more powerful than any classical computer, the
development of communication systems secure from any known method of
eavesdropping, and miniaturization of medical and diagnostic instrumentation to
the nanometer scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
