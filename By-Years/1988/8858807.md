Dill Research is on the verification of finite-state concurrent systems, both
abstract systems and their implementations in hardware. The approach is to
represent the set of states as a boolean function in the form of a binary
decision diagram, then find and inspect the set of states reachable from a set
of initial states. A protocol description language and a verification system are
being developed and tested on real-world designs. Additionally, effort is being
made to characterize conditions under which verification is particularly
attractive, for example using it in the initial design phase when the system is
abstract. Several benchmark examples for other users are being developed.
