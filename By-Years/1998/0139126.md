The UMBC Teaching Enhancement Partnership Project (TEPP) will organize and lead
a university-middle school partnership with 5 local, high-needs middle schools
in order to support and enhance mathematics and science instruction of
underrepresented middle school youth in the greater Baltimore area. Twenty-five
graduate and advanced undergraduate student Fellows with majors in information
systems, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and natural sciences will
be recruited and selected from UMBC. One graduate student and five undergraduate
students will be placed in each of the five middle schools to support teachers
in the classroom and in co-curricular activities. Participating teachers will
provide leadership to Fellows in instruction and classroom management, exposing
them to the rewards of teaching in the K-12 public school system. Teachers will
also participate in a continuous and sustained professional development efforts
designed to enhance their understanding of mathematics and science concepts, and
to introduce them to IT and inquiry-based instruction through UMBC sponsored
seminars and courses. An emphasis will be placed on information technology (IT)
as a tool for the enhancement of teaching and learning in science and
mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
