Shock waves and low-frequency turbulence are ubiquitous in plasmas, occurring in
environments as diverse as jet engines, inertial confinement fusion devices,
interplanetary space, the Earth's bow-shock and supernovae. The fundamental
interactions between shocks and turbulence will be addressed through two
complementary studies. For situations in which pre-existing upstream turbulence
is simply convected into a shock, the mean location and speed of the shock as a
function of the upstream energy density and turbulence, the variance of the
shock position and speed, the amplification of the turbulence by the shock and
its subsequent dissipation downstream will all be assessed through sophisticated
numerical simulations. Broad energetic-particle-mediated shocks amplify and
transmit the pre-existing turbulence, but also generate additional turbulence
through shock-accelerated energetic particle gradients. In this case, energetic
particles can contribute to the overall momentum balance within the shock. The
second study aims at developing a fully self-consistent model of the thermal
plasma, the superthermal accelerated particles and the associated
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence through a shock jump.
