This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
novel delivery vehicle for anti-cancer drugs using guanidine-modified molecule-
based systems.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of anti-cancer
therapies. This drug delivery system may enable or improve the performance of
known pharmaceuticals by modulating their administration regimen or intake
routes. It may also help salvage many clinically proven therapeutics that were
abandoned due to their low cellular uptakes and / or poor solubility and
bioavailability.
