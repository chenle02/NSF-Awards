9622876 This award supports the research of Professor K. Goodearl to work in
non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from the
theory of Quantum Groups. In particular, Professor Goodearl will continue to
investigate analogies between Quantum Groups and enveloping algebras of solvable
Lie algebras concentrating on the non-root-of-unity case. This is research in
the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra can be
though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has direct
applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of non-commutative
ring theory generalizes structures found in Quantum Mechanics and this proposal
continues to explore areas that connect directly with modern quantum field
theory.
