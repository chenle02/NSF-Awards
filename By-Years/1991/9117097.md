This award is for partial support of a summer school on the evolution of
galaxies and their environment. The Principle Investigator, Dr. Harley Thronson
has received high praise from many quarters for his operation of two previous
summer schools on specialized topics of current astronomical interest. The
program will consist of twenty to twenty-five invited tutorials and reviews, and
an attendance in the neighborhood of two hundred, mostly younger, scientists is
anticipated.
