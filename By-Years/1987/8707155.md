Programming-in-the-large is concerned with how to combine relatively small
software components into larger, meaningful wholes, in order to meet particular
requirements for functionality and performance with minimal programming effort.
Techniques for programming-in-the-large are important because of their potential
for reducing the enormous cost of writing, debugging, and maintaining software,
especially for very large systems. This research will explore languages and
environments supporting programming-in-the-large for object-oriented, logic, and
functional programming as well as their combinations, with some consideration of
requirements for execution on parallel architectures. The project will build
upon previous research on abstract data types, on multiparadigm programming
(e.g., Eqlog, which unifies functional and logic programming, and FOOPS, which
unifies functional and object- oriented programming) on "logical" programming,
and on parameterized programming and reusable software for environments (OBJ2),
and for ordinary imperative languages. Programming systems are growing larger
and more complex. This research is aimed at establishing the ability to properly
manage the construction and maintenance of enormous systems of programs.
