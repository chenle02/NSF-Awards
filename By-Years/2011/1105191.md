The overarching objective of this proposal is to provide a unified framework for
the study of a regression model described by a regression function that is a
weighted sum of multi-dimensional unimodal functions. The multidimensional
regression components are assumed similar in shape but identifiable through a
set of parameters. The focus of the proposed research is to advance methodology
that addresses fundamental statistical problems in estimation and inference of
the proposed multidimensional mixture regression model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed statistical methodology will contribute to the field of biomolecular
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies, which will aid in the quantitative
argumentation needed in discovery of biomelecule structures, but also to other
applications such as identification and classification of lesions or tumor
masses using breast computed tomography (CT) and identification and estimation
of astronomical objects in images of the sky. The endpoint of the proposed
research is stable protein structure predictions and determination of complex
molecules using NMR technology along with more accurate detection of lesions or
tumor masses using breast CT technology.
