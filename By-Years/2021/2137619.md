The goal of this proposal is for participation support for undergraduate and
graduate students to attend the Twelfth International Green and Sustainable
Computing Conference (IGSC), which will be a Live Virtual Event. In particular,
this is to provide students with a unique experience through the virtual
conference attendance where they can present their work at the Student Research
Forum and meet with peers and experts in their research area. These funds will
focus on women, underrepresented minorities,&lt;br/&gt;and non-author students
and provide them the opportunity to virtually attend the conference and
participate in its Student Research Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
