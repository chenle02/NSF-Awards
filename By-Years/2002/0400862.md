This award provides partial support for purchase of a 48 capillary DNA sequencer
and related software. The instrument will be placed in the Pritzker Laboratory
for Molecular Systematics and Evolution, a multi-user core facility that
supplies museum curators, their students and postdocs, research scientists and
visiting scientists with the equipment necessary to perform molecular work.
Currently, these users account for over 35 projects in the fields of
systematics, molecular evolution, population biology, and molecular ecology. An
important role of the Pritzker Lab is in training of incoming scientists and
students in use of the automated sequencer. Training has been offered to
students from local Chicago-area Universities as well as institutions from the
U.S. and around the world. This training has helped visiting researchers to set
up labs in Louisiana, India, Brazil and the Philippines. In addition, the lab
has been used to educate groups of local high school and undergraduate students
with respect to research activities at the Museum.
