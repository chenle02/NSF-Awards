A huge number of applications involve simulation optimization, i.e., the
optimization of a function that is computed via Monte Carlo simulation. The
primary goal of the research is to develop solution methods for structured
simulation optimization problems. The word "structured" suggests that the
problem possesses certain structural properties that can be leveraged by
optimization algorithms to, for example, reduce solution time or improve the
likelihood of convergence. In more detail, the primary goals of this research
are as follows. First, to further develop simulation optimization methods for
structured problems, where the structure may be detected and verified with
minimal user input. Second, to apply those methods on a range of practical
problems, with emphasis on emergency services in rural areas. Third, to create a
library of simulation optimization problems that can be used to help compare
proposed optimization methods, and help guide the development of new simulation-
optimization algorithms.

The development of structured simulation-optimization methods will allow far
larger models and associated optimization problems to be solved than is possible
today. The potential list of applications is enormous, since Monte Carlo
simulation is now used in a tremendous range of fields including, but certainly
not limited to, emergency service planning, manufacturing, communications
systems, service system design and health care. The research explicitly includes
applications to emergency service planning in rural areas, with the goal of
obtaining more effective response times and coverage. Other potential benefits
include improved methods for operating policy design for networks such as arise
in power systems, communication systems and manufacturing. Applications also
exist in health care, such as in external beam radiation treatment planning for
cancer patients.
