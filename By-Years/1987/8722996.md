The purpose of this research is to test if tertiary amines can selectively
absorb (react with) carbonyl sulfide from a mixture of carbonyl sulfide and
carbon dioxide. Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) will be the primary candidate.
Heterocyclic amines, which have larger side groups than MDEA, should have more
steric hindrance toward CO2 (hence higher selectivity toward COS) and will also
be tried. If successful, tertiary amines could be used as the chemical solvents
for selectively removing COS (rather than CO2) from fuel gases. Selective
removal of sulfur containing gases is a necessary step for air pollution
control.
