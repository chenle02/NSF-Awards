This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Scientific Research Associates, Inc will develop a time-resolved flourescence
microscopy system using acoustooptic tunable filters as spectral tuning elements
and a phase-modulated image dissector tube as a detector. Potential products
from such device include microscope attachments and other imaging system. In
particular, it will greatly improve sensitivity of existing flourescence
microscopy technology, which will be extremely useful for biological research.
