9706143 Heaney This project will investigate the isotopic structure of
carbonado, a variety of polycrystalline diamond. It is hypothesized that
carbonado did not form in the upper mantle, but crystallized from preexisting
organic carbon. The PI's will examine carbonado samples from Brazil and the
Central African Republic. They will address the following questions: (1) what is
the source of the carbon? (2) What is the microstructural evidence for
meteoritic shock? (3) Did the REE-phosphates form by fissiogenic processes? (4)
Did these carbonados crystallize as part of a single event or process? A variety
of microanalytical techniques will be used. Electron microprobe and TEM will be
used to investigate shock textures. SIMS will be used to determine C isotopes
and REE ratios.
