Pattern classification is a fundamental problem in a vast number of
applications, ranging from detection of abnormal heartbeats in cardiac patients,
to identification of defective chips in microchip manufacturing, to
classification of nuclear sources in nonproliferation tasks. The conventional
approach to designing classifiers is to leverage training data comprised of
labeled examples of the different object classes under consideration. However, a
fundamental assumption of standard approaches is that training data are
representative of future observations to which the classifier will be applied.
In a growing number of applications, including those mentioned above, this
assumption cannot be justified because of subject-to-subject variability arising
from biological, technological, or environmental factors. In response, this
research is developing new fundamental approaches to classification and
prediction that adapt trained classifiers to the characteristics of future
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this research develops a
theoretical and algorithmic framework for distribution-adaptive prediction and
classification. A critical feature of the framework is the use of distributions
as predictive features. Several statistical learning problems are studied that
incorporate distributions as features; some are generalizations of existing
learning problems, while others are new and uniquely motivated by distribution-
adaptive problems. General solutions are developed to these problems using the
framework of complexity regularization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
Methodological contributions include novel kernels on distributions and new
methods of generalization error analysis. The work is concretely motivated by
and evaluated in diagnostic applications of flow cytometry, a high-throughput
assay for cellular analysis used in the study of blood-related diseases. The
research component is complemented by educational initiatives involving
graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.
