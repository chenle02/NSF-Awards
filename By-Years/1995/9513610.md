9532041 DeBra Thermal control and temperature gradients in machine tools and
metrology instruments are fundamental limitations to precision engineering. A
way to minimize these limitations is using hydraulic actuation and sensing,
because of its high and efficient transfer of energy. This approach is also
compatible with oil showering, one of the ways thermal control is achieved in
ultra-precision manufacturing. This project will develop an ultra precision
machine tool based on laminar flow motors and linear actuators, and oil
differential gages for straightness and yaw compensation. These components were
developed at Stanford University, in part with NSF Strategic Manufacturing
Initiative support, to eliminated control of hydraulic actuators by throttling
which leads to turbulence, noise and vibration. The major research efforts will
be on development of compatible hydraulic sensors and integpation of the quite
actuators in an ultra precision, quiet hydraulic diamond turning machine. The
impact of this research is primarily on the infrastructure for precision
engineering and ultra precision machine tools. It promises better thermal
control at lower cost than is possible with existing ultra precision machines
and equipment.
