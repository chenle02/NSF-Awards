9300665 Brennen A combined experimental and analytical study of the effect of
vibrations on the motion of a granular material is proposed. The study aims to
improve fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms in relatively simple
situations. The "phase change" caused by vibrations, bifurcation, transition to
chaotic behavior, velocity and granular temperature profiles will be measured
with instrumentation developed by the research group. Numerical simulations of
one-dimensional columns of particles on a vibrating plate, and of flow in
externally vibrated chutes will be performed, and compared to experiments. It is
expected that fundamental data on vibrating granular materials will be obtained,
with application to vibrofluidization, molding of powder materials and others
industrial processes. The work has relevance also to earthquake and geotechnical
engineering. ***
