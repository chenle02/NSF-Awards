Dr. Phoebe Dea and other members of the Chemistry Department at Occidental
College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. The program continues to focus on attracting Los Angeles area
community college students, particularly minority students, to work side-by-side
with Occidental College faculty and students in summer research. The program is
successful in stimulating community college students to continue work toward the
bachelors degree by achieving admission to four-year colleges and universities.
