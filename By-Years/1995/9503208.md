ABSTRACT CTS-9503208 An approach for the direct numerical flow simulation of
systems consisting of several bubbles or drops at finite Reynolds numbers will
be investigated using a front tracking technique at the interface between the
continuous and dispersed phase. Complex multi-body collisions and deformable
interfaces can effectively be described in simulations by parallelizing the
computer code. Several case studies will examine the behavior of many bubbles
and drops moving freely in a rectangular domain due to gravity, pressure
gradient, and/or shear flow. The results will include lift and drag force as a
function of the void, fraction, Reynolds number, and deformations, and averaged
momentum, flux, Reynolds stresses, and particle dispersion. The improved
simulation capabilities have relevance to various multiphase engineering and
environmental processes. ***
