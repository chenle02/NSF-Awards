This research develops methods for extending data modeling capabilities for
database systems. The role of a conceptual data model is to store information in
a manner that provides for efficient processing by the computer while allowing
the human to access this data in as natural a manner as possible. The approach
taken in this project is to automatically generate data models to fit the
requirements of the application environment. Research issues include (1) The
formal specification and representation of a family of semantically rich
conceptual data models, (2) the development of a rule-based approach to the
generation of of database systems, and (3) the characterization of the
performance of systems generated by this approach. The prototype system produced
is tested against previously defined data models and refined based upon the
feedback gained. The significance of this research is that it offers an approach
to removing the inflexibility of present day database systems. Improving
database systems is critical to extending their use, especially for engineering
and manufacturing information, enhancing computer assisted systems which are
rapidly becoming the vital core of design and manufacturing.
