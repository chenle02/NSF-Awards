This project will continue monitoring and experimental manipulations of seed-
eating animals and seed-producing plants in the Chihuahuan Desert that have been
conducted continuously since 1977. The long-term records of rodents, birds,
ants, and annual plants will provide information on the response of individuals,
populations, and communities both to natural temporal and spatial variation and
to the experimental perturbations. Manipulations begun in 1977 are still being
propogated through networks of direct and indirect interactions and having new
effects on the system. The study will: 1) continue to census granivore and plant
populations using standardized techniques that have already provided some of the
most extensive and intensive long-term data for any terrestrial ecosystem in
North America; 2) convert plots that have been assigned to relatively
unproductive experiments to additional replicates of the treatments that have
had the most interesting effects, focusing attention on the mechanisms an
dynamics of indirect interactions; and 3) work up the extensive data on rodents,
emphasizing the relationships between the behavior of individuals, the dynamics
of populations, and the organization of the entire assemblage of 11 common and
several rare species. The investigation is a classic example of long- term
ecological research at the cutting-edge of community ecology.
