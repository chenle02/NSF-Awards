This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I aims to extend an interactive
anatomy-learning environment from undergraduate into middle school and high
school settings. Life sciences education in middle and high school is severely
limited because of the cost and complexity of authentic laboratory experiences.
This project will provide easy access to powerful data sources with tools for
manipulating the data for a learning objective. This environment marks a unique
approach to the application of computer technology to the K-12 anatomy and
physiology curriculum, specifically grades 7-12, but with applicability to K-6.
The environment supports an interactive work model where students engage in the
same cycle of observation, interpretation, and action that characterized the
historic "dissect and sketch paradigm." This environment allows students to
produce an individual and unique visual record of their investigations, while
they learn sophisticated computer skills, problem-solving techniques, and health
science content. The tools resulting from this research will greatly enhance the
ability of middle and high school teachers and students to access federally
funded anatomical data such as the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human
data sets, needed to learn basic anatomy. Providing this experience virtually
improves overall access, and providing it early in a child's learning program
might increase the number and quality of health care professionals in the
future..
