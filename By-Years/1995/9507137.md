9507137 Diehl This U.S.-Czech cooperative research project between Dr. Jimmy
Diehl of Michigan Technological University and Dr. Jaroslav Kadlec of the Czech
Geological Survey will involve measurement of variations in the amounts, types
and grain sizes of magnetic particles contained in cave sediments. The
researchers intend to obtain this magnetic property data, carbon 14 dates, and
pollen analyses from the interior floodwater deposits of Spiralka Cave and the
entrance facie sediments of the Kulna Cave, both of which are located in the
Moravian Karst of the Czech Republic. Results should be useful in interpreting
measurements from other cave deposits in Central Europe and for eventual
reconstruction of the regionally variable response to global climate change
during the Late Pleistocene/Holocene eras. This project in geophysics and
paleontology fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge
by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ***
