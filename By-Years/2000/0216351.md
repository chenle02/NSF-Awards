This proposal will provide funds to upgrade a detector known as BigBite, which
will be moved from its present location at the NIKHEF nuclear physics facility
in the Netherlands to Jefferson Laboratory (JLAB) in Newport News, Virginia. The
large acceptance of BigBite will complement the two existing high-resolution
spectrometers in Hall A at JLAB, enabling experiments to be completed in months
or weeks that might otherwise have taken years to complete. The upgrade
supported by this award will enable BigBite to handle the&lt;br/&gt;much higher
counting rates (up to six orders of magnitude) at JLAB compared to NIKHEF. Key
approved experiments that will make use of BigBite include a high-precision
measurment of neutral pion electroproduction (providing a test of chiral QCD
dynamics), a measurement of the neutron electron form factor at high momentum
transfer, and a study of short-range properties in nuclei via a triple-
coincidence proton-knockout reaction. The detector upgrade and the experiments
themselves will involved students and junior investigators in an essential
way.&lt;br/&gt;
