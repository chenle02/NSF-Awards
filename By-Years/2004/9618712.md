We are able to think about, or construe, a given entity in more than one way.
For example, a given entity may be thought of as a table, or as some wood. These
distinct construals are linked to the linguistic distinction in English between
count nouns and mass nouns. Thus we can talk of two tables, but not two woods,
similarly we can say a little bit of wood, but not a little bit of table. This
is because kinds of objects (e.g. tables) come in discrete amounts, whereas
kinds of substances (e.g. wood) come in continuous amounts. The experiments in
this proposal investigate what factors lead children and adults to construe
solid entities as either objects, and thus quantify them discretely, or as
substances, and thus quantify them continuously. Specifically, we will be
investigating whether cues that suggest that the structure an entity possesses
is non-arbitrary (couldn't have been just any other way) lead us to construe it
as an object of some kind, whereas cues that suggest that the structure an
entity possesses is arbitrary (could have been any other way) lead us to
construe the entity as an amount of solid material instead. It is expected that
in addition to providing important data on how conceptual representations are
related to the linguistic distinction between count- and mass nouns, the
experiments will shed light on the nature of conceptual representations during
development, and how they are related to representations within other knowledge
systems (e.g. systems for representing and reasoning about quantities).
