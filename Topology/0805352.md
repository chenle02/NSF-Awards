Abstract

Award: DMS-0805352 Principal Investigator: Ko Honda

Recently it has become more evident that contact structures play a central role
in low-dimensional topology and Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). The
cut-and-paste theory of contact structures in dimension three, developed by
numerous authors including the PI, can now be imported into Heegaard Floer
homology, a (3+1)-dimensional TQFT. The PI, together with his collaborators,
seeks to better understand the relations among contact geometry, Floer homology
theories, TQFTs and string theory, and hyperbolic geometry. More specifically,
the PI proposes the following: (1) Analyze the TQFT properties of
Heegaard/sutured Floer homology. (2) Understand a certain category obtained via
contact geometry, which satisfies many of the properties of a triangulated
category. (3) Study contact homology invariants of exact Lagrangian cobordisms
between Legendrian links in the symplectization of a contact manifold. (4)
Calculate the contact homology of tight contact structures on hyperbolic
3-manifolds.

The PI proposes a study of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces using a probe called a
contact structure. The 3-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to
the standard (Euclidean) 3-dimensional space. These objects may be very
complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just as
an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere.
A contact structure is a field in 3-dimensional space, analogous to an electric
field in physics. Just as the nature of the electric field, such as the strength
and the direction at any point, gives some information about the distribution of
the electric charge, i.e., the source of the electric field, a contact structure
gives information about the shape of the ambient 3-dimensional space. A more
thorough mathematical understanding of contact structures in dimension three may
contribute significantly towards our understanding of the shape of the universe.
