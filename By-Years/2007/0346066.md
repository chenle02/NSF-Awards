This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Veronika A. Szalai at the University of
Maryland Baltimore County to test the hypothesis that DNA condensation affects
the rates and yields of one-electron guanine oxidation. To determine whether
reaction rates are affected by DNA packing, the one-electron oxidation of
guanine by ruthenium(III) polypyridyl complexes will be monitored using a model
system in which DNA has been artificially condensed in reverse micelles.
Comparison of the rates and yields of guanine radical formation in the reverse
micelle model system to those determined in dilute solution will reveal how the
oxidative chemistry occurring in dilute solution compares to that sustained by
condensed DNA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxidative damage to DNA is a process
important in production of cancerous cells and aging. This project provides
cross-disciplinary training in physical, inorganic, and biochemistry to students
involved in fundamental research on this process and discoveries from this
research will be incorporated into courses taught by the principal investigator.
This project will couple with ongoing efforts at UMBC to increase minority
participation in science through the Meyerhoff Undergraduate and Graduate
Fellowship Programs, NIH-Minority Access to Research Careers Program, Women in
Science and Engineering, and an NSF-ADVANCE grant.&lt;br/&gt;
