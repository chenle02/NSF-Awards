Psychology - Cognitive (73) This project is creating an interactive computer-
based classroom for the teaching of core content courses in psychology. We are
building on our previous success in revamping the Statistics and Research
Methods courses, which now use exploratory computer exercises to encourage
active, collaborative learning of fundamental concepts. In the present project,
we are applying similar methods to incorporate a hands-on, research-based
approach to the teaching of Developmental Psychology and Sensation and
Perception. We are doing this by adapting materials developed primarily at
Pennsylvania State University - Erie for use in our Developmental Psychology
course. We are also adapting materials developed at the University of California
- Riverside and Skidmore College to our course on Sensation and Perception. Our
goals in this project are to (1) create a more interactive classroom environment
in courses that in the past were often taught by lecture, (2) continue the
emphasis on developing students' research skills that begins in Introductory
Psychology and our Statistics/Research Methods sequence, and (3) guide students
to focus on methodology as they critically evaluate scientific research
findings. We are equipping a new computer laboratory/ classroom with 31 seats
and software. In addition, this project includes a plan for assessing the impact
of students' experiences in the interactive classroom on their mastery of course
content, as well as their interest in and attitudes toward science. Upon
completion of this grant, we will also encourage and assist other department
faculty in the development of similar materials for other core courses within
the department.
