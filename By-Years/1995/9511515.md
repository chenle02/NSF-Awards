This project supports the ethnographic research by a team of 3 anthropologists
and 5 student research assistants in Dade County, Florida on minority school
performance and orientation. The study will assess the social capital of
students' families and communities in five disadvantaged groups: Native-born
African-American, immigrant Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Mexicans living in
3 neighborhoods of Dade County. Using in-depth ethnographic methods of intensive
interviews, focus and `rap` groups, and participant observation in schools,
homes and communities, the project will explore the interrelations between
family structure, social class, gender, and migration history. Students
representing `positive` and `adversarial` orientations towards education from
each ethnic group will be chosen for long-term study. This research is important
because education is the fundamental source of human capital which makes for
productive citizenship. Understanding the sources of variation within broad
ethnic categories -- why some disadvantaged young people take full advantage of
their educational opportunities while others seemingly from the same backgrounds
and circumstances spurn them -- is the most promising strategy to advance our
understanding of workable designs for intervention and improvement.
