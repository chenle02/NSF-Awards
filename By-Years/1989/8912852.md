A direct simulation of compressible boundary layer transition will be carried
out. A fourth-order, phase-accurate version of the MaxCormack explicit scheme
will be employed to numerically integrate the full, three-dimensional, time-
dependent compressible Navier-Strokes equations. The computations will be
performed on the massively parallel Connection Machine CM2 which will take full
advantage of the explicit solution procedure. The two dimensional version of the
code is currently running at a rate of one Gigaflop, which is about five times
as fast as a CRAY 2. In addition to providing a multi-disciplinary research
environment focused on the application of parallel processing to computational
fluid dynamics, the proposed work offers the unique advantage of training future
aerospace engineers in this emerging technology.
