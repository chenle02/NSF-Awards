This dissertation research project supports a cultural anthropological study of
workers and farmers in the citrus industry in Belize. The focus of the study is
in how small firms and individual workers deal with the more powerful economic
actors in the citrus industry to defend their interests. Methods will include
surveys, intensive interviews, and participant observation. The research will
shed light on the success or importance of development projects that attempt to
democratize political and economic systems that have been organized in a
repressively monopolistic manner. This research is important because Central
America is a vitally important part of the hemisphere that is currently subject
to severe unrest. Understanding of the causes of success and failure in local-
level economic development projects, and of the causes of accommodation or
unrest in local industries, can help guide policy in the future.
