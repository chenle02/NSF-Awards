The principal investigator has demonstrated that an aerosol liquid micro-
particle can act as an optical memory element. This optical bistability effect
is relatively slow for practical memory elements. Therefore he proposes
experiments and analysis of this effect on solid aerosol micro-particles which
should achieve more rapid photothermal optical memory.
