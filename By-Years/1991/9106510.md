The principal investigator will design and implement efficient (space and time)
algorithms for analyzing DNA and protein sequences. The research will focus on
three projects: local similarity, multiple sequence alignment, and biosequence
library search. These projects represent a continuation and expansion of his
work. In particular a portion of the work will involve design and implementation
of algorithms in parallel architectures. The principal investigator will design
and implement efficient algorithms for analyzing DNA and protein sequences.
These algorithms will be useful to molecular biologists working in genetics,
biophysics, and evolution.
