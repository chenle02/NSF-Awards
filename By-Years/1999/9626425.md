9626425 Watson The University of South Carolina requests support from NSF for
connection to SURANET. This grant will be used to help three campuses get access
to the Internet. The three sites are USC Lancaster, USC Salkehatchie and USC
Union. SURANET, a midlevel network in South Carolina, will provide operations
management and information services and it provides access to the Internet, a
collection of interoperable networks connecting most research and education
organizations in the United States. The University of South Carolina campuses
need the Internet connections to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of the University of South Carolina system as well as
the community in general.
