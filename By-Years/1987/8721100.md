Continental extension is a major aspect of tectonics and it is important to
understand the processes involved and to what extent older structures influence
the localization, segmentation and orientations of younger faults. East-central
Idaho is an ideal area to study extensional processes because of the long
history of extension which dates back to Eocene time and produced a highly
segmented and faulted crust. This project will map selected areas and conduct
paleomagnetic studies to evaluate the extent to which the crust breaks up into
discrete blocks which rotate about vertical axes. The results will be used to
better understand the tectonic history of part of the western Cordillera, the
mechanics and kinematics of crustal extension and the evolution of seismogenic
normal fault zones.
