Abstract

Award: DMS-1007846 Principal Investigator: Yi-Jen Lee

The PI proposes to continue her study on the relation between gauge theoretic
invariants and Gromov-type invariants under the framework of Taubess proof of
Seiberg-Witten equals Gromov; especially, its various Floer theoretic
extensions. She also intends to explore the rich implications of the equivalence
of various theories on both sides.

Symplectic Geometry has its origin from classical mechanics. However, in spite
of much progress made, many basic questions remain unanswered. An example is the
long standing Weinstein conjecture, which states that there is a periodic orbit
on any compact contact manifold. In physics, "contact manifolds" provide the
framework to describe the motion of particles. On the other hand, gauge theory
arises from the theory of elementary particles in modern physics. Surprisingly,
many seemingly unrelated invariants defined on both sides turn out to be
equivalent, and therefore facts that are easier to see on one sides imply
similar results on the other side, which might otherwise be very difficult to
establish. Taubes's celebrated recent proof of the 3-dimensional Weinstein
conjecture is an example of many possible applications of such equivalence.
