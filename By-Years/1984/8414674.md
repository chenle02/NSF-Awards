Research is conducted on these aspects of very large scale integrated (VLSI)
design that are especially relevant to digital signal processing. This research
deals with the implementation of important digital signal processing algorithms,
such as linear filtering and Fourier transformation, in custom VLSI circuit
technology. These algorithms have a great deal of inherent structural regularity
and it is the objective of this work to exploit this regularity to increase
throughput and to make design and testing of signal processing chips
straightforward and easier. In this investigation, automatic leaf-cell (use of
same cell in many instances) optimization, global performance of regular
structures, and testing of regular structures are being pursued. The long-range
goal of this effort is to reduce the algorithmic structure to implementation on
a chip in the most expeditious and efficient manner.
