Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spelman STEM Scholars (S3)
program is providing competitive scholarships and academic/career-building
support to academically-talented, economically disadvantaged African American
females who pursue a STEM degree. Special emphasis is being placed on building a
critical mass of prospective engineering graduates in Spelman's dual-degree
engineering program with Georgia Institute of Technology and its Black Graduate
Student Association. Spelman's esteemed group of faculty, "The Vanguard
Faculty," will support and guide the first-year students. In addition to the
scholarship support, Spelman is developing three new support initiatives: 1)
introduction to engineering seminar series, 2) a graduate student mentoring
program, and 3) scholarship/graduate school writing workshop.
