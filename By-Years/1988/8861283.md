Emerging Digital Signal Processing (DSP) VLSI products are widening the horizons
of system designers. Because of their compact size and low cost, tightly-coupled
single-board multiprocessor configurations are now quite feasible. This research
examines the degree to which hardware can be minimized by judicious selection of
an architecture that lends itself to modern Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)
compilation techniques. With the need to solve DSP problems in mind, the
architectural tradeoffs are being determined for a small number of critical DSP
routines involving FFT's, 2D filtering, and dynamic programming algorithms.
Also, automatic instruction scheduling/compaction techniques are being related
to the architectural choices. Ultimately, it is expected that the results
generated will highlight the strengths and weaknesses for some of the
commercially- available DSP chips. Reviewers awarded this very high scores of
16, 18 and 18. All reviewers saw this as quality work stemming from innovative
ideas to be done by an excellent group. There is high potential for a Phase II
project. Success will lead to a meaningful advance in the theory and practice of
instruments that require signal processing circuit design.
