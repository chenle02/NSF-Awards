The Department of Geology at the University of Puget Sound will purchase an
energy-dispersive quantitative X-ray microanalysis system with image processing
capabilities to be mounted on an existing scanning electron microscope. This
instrumentation will be integrated into the undergraduate geology curriculum at
all levels above the introductory courses and will be used for student and
student-faculty research projects. The equipment will allow students to analyze
the chemical composition of very small regions of rock and mineral samples and
thus assist in the identification and characterization of the samples. A modern
laboratory facility now houses the University's electron microscope and will
house the new system.
