9706548 Cooke Flexural slip along bedding is a common occurrence in folding, and
have a variety of consequences to the development of folds. This study will
investigate mechanical stratigraphy, lateral variations in apparent friction
along bedding and deformation within individual layers of rocks involved in the
East Kaibab Monocline. These field observations will be compared to numerically
predicted results, and the role of flexural slip in fold development assessed.
Also included is consideration of the possible influence of exhumation on
flexure. Results are intended to provide criteria for determining the relative
contributions of tectonic loading and exhumation to observed brittle structures
and fold form.
