The effective solution of big data problems requires computers that have very
large memory capacity and that are able to perform very many operations per
second. Since providing the required amount of main memory with sufficient
bandwidth to achieve the desired throughput is cost prohibitive, vendors have
resorted to multi-level memory (MLM) architectures in which main memory
comprises two or more levels, with each level having memory with different
bandwidth and cost characteristics. The Intel Knights Landing is an example; it
has two levels of main memory - 16Gigabytes of high-cost, high-throughput
memory, and up to 384Gigabytes of relatively low-cost, low-throughput memory.
The Knights Landing also has 72 compute cores capable of performing up to 6
teraflops of single precision or 3 teraflops of double precision operations.
This project seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of multicore MLM
architectures in solving big data problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will develop efficient multicore MLM software for representative applications
with different workflow characteristics: data parallel, hierarchical, and task
parallel. The specific applications being considered are simulation of
compressible multiphase turbulence, sparse matrix factorization, and image
reconstruction from synthetic aperture radar data. The software will be
evaluated on the Knights Landing as well as using MLM simulation software.
Techniques for the development of such software and optimal MLM configurations
based on workload characterization will be identified.
