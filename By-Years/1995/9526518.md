9526518 Coleman This award provides support for a workshop on "Introduction of
High Performance Computing in Undergraduate Computing Programs" to be held at
the 1995 ADMI meeting. The annual ADMI meeting brings together faculty from a
large number of minority institutions. The goal of this workshop is to provided
participants with a comprehensive overview of computational science curricula
and hands-on experience with the use of the Internet and HPCC shared resources.
The workshop program includes a series of lectures by experts in the field,
discussion of possible curricula implementations, and demonstrations and hands-
on experiences in the use of the Internet, Netscape, and the World Wide Web. ***
