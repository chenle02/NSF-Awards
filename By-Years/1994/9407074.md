9407074 Srivastava The objectives of this work are the structure and evolution
of the (size) spectra of both raindrops and cloud drops. Characteristics of the
former, including rain rate and water content, will be explored using
observations from two radars, transmitting at different frequencies, and
evaluating the attenuation to "improve" the backscattered reflectivity.
Characteristics of cloud drop spectra, on the other hand, will be investigated
using recent numerical results to improve existing theory and the use of VHF
radar to measure droplet spectra at selected sites. Both topics will help to
understand the physics of (liquid) precipitation.
