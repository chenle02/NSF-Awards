This award will initiate a Travel Grant program for faculty from typically
under-resourced institutions, such as Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs),
Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and community colleges. Faculty at these
institutions often have higher teaching loads and do not have access to
significant travel funds, making it more difficult for them to attend scientific
conferences. Attendance at these conferences will allow the faculty to establish
connections to other researchers and bring back the latest innovations in
research and teaching to their classrooms.

The American Meteorological Society (AMS) will administer a Travel Grant program
for faculty from under-resourced institutions. AMS hosts an Annual meeting with
thousands of attendees, and smaller specialty meetings throughout the year.
Faculty at ERIs, MSIs, and community colleges will be able to apply to receive
funding for travel and conference registration costs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
