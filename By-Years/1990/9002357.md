This research will focus on three areas: 1) Stability and instability of
quantum Hamiltonians with dense point and singular spectra; 2) Existence of
absolutely continuous spectra of Schrodinger operators with random potential;
and 3) Solutions of a commutator inequality which arose in connection with
random Hamiltonians. This work is in the general area of mathematical physics.
The problem examined by this researcher is to some extent a simple quantum
analogue of the KAM problem in classical mechanics. Problems of this sort with
time-periodic potentials are of considerable physical interest, particularly in
connection with atoms in laser fields.
