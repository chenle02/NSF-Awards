The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports this project by Professor
Allen Bard of the University of Texas at Austin in which several new scanning
probe/electrochemical microscopy techniques will be developed. First, scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be applied to the measurement of ion flux
through a single channel of a bilayer lipid membrane, and then of living cells.
Preliminary experiments have detected iodine transport across a membrane, and
other researchers have used Prof. Bard's SECM method to monitor molecular ion
transport through living cell membranes. There is the potential to use SECM both
as an imaging device and as a quantitative tool to extract kinetic information
about ion transport. A potential area of application is in the neuronal
microenvironment and the release of neurotransmitters during exocytosis. A
second instrument combines the SECM with electrogenerated chemiluminescence.
Previous studies demonstrated the potential, but were limited by tip size and
tip-substrate spacing. Newly developed probes will overcome these problems and
permit detailed studies of electrochemical reactions at and near electrode
surfaces. Applications include characterization of molecular electronic devices
via a method termed "molecular voltammetry". In molecular scale nanostructures,
the discreteness of the electronic charge has been demonstrated to play a
prominent role in device performance, and these can be further studied with the
proposed analytical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scanning probe microscopy is
widely used in the study of surfaces, including chemically reactive electrode
surfaces to the surface of a living cell. In this project, new techniques will
be developed with a goal toward improving the quantification of the imaged
features. For example, ion channels have been imaged on cell membranes. The next
question is: What is the rate of ion transport through the imaged ion
channel?&lt;br/&gt;
