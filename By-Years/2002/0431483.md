This project investigates the impacts of anthropogenic activities on
tropospheric sulfur and nitrogen cycling in the atmosphere. Existing daily
aerosol samples acquired by University of Miami (UM) during a several decade
long program will be used to study the mass-independent (oxygen, nitrogen and
sulfur) isotope effects in sulfates and nitrates occurring in these samples.
Specifically, the Mass Independent Fractionation (MIF) of 17O in sulfate and
nitrate components of selected aerosol samples, as well as more traditional
sulfur and nitrogen isotope analyses will be used to characterize atmospheric
oxidative processes with a view to identifying unique reaction pathways
occurring in the ambient environment downwind of anthropogenic and natural
sources of sulfate and nitrate precursors. Results from this study will further
understanding of aerosol formation and atmospheric transport, particularly with
respect to elucidating long term changes in aerosol source signatures and
production pathways and the potential of these to impact climate. Support is
included for a postdoctoral researcher and one graduate student to gain research
experience under the mentorship of the principal investigator.
