Theoretical studies will be conducted on random networks with particular
emphasis on disordered superconductors and quantum systems. The connection
between percolation and superconductivity will be addressed for networks of
Josephson junctions and for networks of thin wires governed by Ginzburg- Landau
order parameters. Also, studies will be conducted on the random walk method for
calculating transport properties such as the Hall coefficient at the percolation
threshold.
