ABSTRACT CMS-9725010 Schiffries "Partial Support of the U.S. National Committee
for Rock Mechanics" This award to the National Academy of Sciences is for
support of the activities of the U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics
(USNC/RM), operating under the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, National
Research Council, during the one-year period from September 1, 1997 through
August 31, 1998. The USNC/RM represents the United States in the International
Society for Rock Mechanics, and supports symposia and workshops in the U.S. and
North America to offer a venue for researchers in the national groups from the
U.S., Canada, and Mexico to present and discuss their work. The USNC/RM also
provides a forum for meetings with federal agencies and other organizations to
keep abreast of developments in the field and to identify issues of national
significance that may merit independent inquiry to serve the needs of the
government. ***
