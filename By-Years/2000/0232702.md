This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
technology for a "3D Video Immersion Room", based on the company's previous 3D
video capture work. A user of this room will don a Head Mounted Display (HMD)
with a camera attached. Entering the room, the user will experience immersive
virtual scenarios containing arbitrary combinations of (1) realistic live 3D
video from a Zaxel 3D Video Capture Studio, (2) prerecorded Zaxel 3D video, (3)
virtual Computer Graphics (CG) content, and (4) the actual room, people, and
objects around them. The proposed research will provide a new paradigm for
interaction with live or recorded 3D content. The system will very accurately
track the position and gaze of the viewer via the camera attached to the HMD.
The investigative team will extend work on camera-based marker tracking so a
large space can be instrumented with paper markers. The system will
automatically determine the position and orientation of the camera relative to
these markers at video frame rate. It will be quickly self-calibrating so it can
be set up by simply attaching the paper markers to the walls and slowly sweeping
the camera around the room. Thus, this technology will be much cheaper and more
accurate than competing technologies.

The "3D Video Immersion Room" is a new tool for education and training with
numerous applications. Some examples are as follows: Live 3D Video
Teleconferencing, which permits two participants to step into different
geographically separated rooms, enabling them to see each other to communicate
naturally; Sports Training, which permits an individual to review his or her own
athletic performance (a golf or baseball swing, a basketball shot) with a
trainer, including overlaying own previous performance or performance of
professionals; Historical Reenactment, which uses live or recorded actors and
enables students to go to a 3D reconstruction or recreation of a historic place
with live actors and/or tour guides.
