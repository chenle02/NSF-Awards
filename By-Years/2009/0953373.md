This project studies natural image statistics, and their applications in diverse
fields such as computational neuroscience, image processing, computer vision,
and graphics. The centerpiece of this project is a new image representation
based on a simple nonlinear transform that is statistically justified and
biologically inspired. This representation provides a new language to describe
image signals, and forms the basis to build statistical models to more
effectively capture statistical properties of natural image. Built upon this new
image representation, this project explores new paradigms to model and interpret
visual neural responses and high-level perceptual properties, and provides new
tools for image restoration, analysis and synthesis. On the other hand, by
applying natural image statistics to the forensic analysis of digital images,
this project facilitates forensic practitioners in criminal investigations, and
contributes to national security and public safety. Moreover, this project
contributes to education by making the learning of Computer Science fun and
useful for undergraduate students, promoting the participation of women and
undergraduate students in research, and improving the early learning of
mathematics and sciences for local high school students.
