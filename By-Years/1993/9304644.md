Urban planning has come under attack recently for failing to improve urban
society. Although many facets of American cities now appear to be in worse
condition than they were 30 or 40 years ago when urban planning was actively
embraced by most municipalities, it is not certain what impacts planning had on
the shaping of urban society, which planning techniques worked and which failed,
and the extent to which mistakes from the past are being repeated today. This
doctoral dissertation project will systematically evaluate records from and
contemporary patterns in dozens of American cities, many of which formulated
Section 701 comprehensive plans from the late 1950s through the 1970s. Focusing
on the distribution of parks and recreational facilities, this project will use
accessibility measures to compare the planned locations of these facilities with
the actual geographic distributions that subsequently emerged. Through analyses
of these measures, the degree to which comprehensive plans helped ensure more
equitable distributions of park and recreation facilities in cities will be
assessed. This project will provide solid empirical analyses of the influence of
comprehensive planning on the locational distribution of urban services for a
diverse range of cities. In addition to evaluating the success of comprehensive
planning in meeting one of its goals, this project will provide valuable
insights into the factors that contributed to the success and failure of
planning efforts, and it will help assess the degree to which planners have
learned from their past experiences. As a doctoral dissertation improvement
award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to
establish a strong independent research career.
