Adipose/fat tissue is a dynamic endocrine organ that acts as a major site of
energy storage, shock absorption, and a crucial regulator of metabolism,
glucose, temperature, and hormonal processes. Accordingly, engineering adipose
tissues is of critical importance for understanding physiology and pathology
(such as obesity and diabetes), and for repairing body surface defects that can
result from traumatic injury and invasive surgical procedures. While tissue
engineering has been explored for these purposes, approaches have met limited
success due to diffusion constraints, and insufficient adipose cell density and
stability compared to the native tissue. This project aims to address these
engineering challenges by delivering an innovative technology for manufacturing
high-density, large human adipose tissues with integrated, perfusable vascular
systems. The educational impact of this project will be achieved through
integrating research-related demonstrations with existing biomedical engineering
courses and facilitating opportunities to enhance the representation of
underrepresented minorities in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to integrate adipose and vascular tissue engineering using a
decellularized lung matrix (DLM) and offer a transformative solution for
engineering perfusable, vascularized, high-density adipose tissue models. The
lung is one of the most highly vascularized organs with high flow, low
resistance, and a large blood-alveolar interface separated by a very thin
basement membrane (&lt;1 Âµm). The DLM offers the following unique advantages for
adipose tissue engineering: (1) its large volume alveolar compartment can
accommodate high-density adipose cell filling; (2) it offers a preserved,
acellular vascular bed allowing efficient tissue perfusion and vascular cell
seeding; (3) the alveolar compartment shields buoyant and fragile adipocytes
from harmful high shear stresses by confining high flow rates to the vascular
bed where they are required for proper endothelial functionality; and (4) it is
scalable and can be adapted for critically sized defects using scaffold
materials derived from large donor sources (example: pigs). Specific project
tasks will: (1) engineer scalable, pre-vascularized adipose tissues; and (2)
model adipose-vascular-extracellular matrix interactions during hyperglycemia.
This model will facilitate the acquisition of basic knowledge on adipose
physiology as well as provide a tissue-engineering platform for repairing
critically sized (&gt;200 mL) subcutaneous tissue
defects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
