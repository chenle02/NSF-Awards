9317424 Thompson This research examines the geographical variation in the
ecological relationships between Greyia moths and their host plants in the plant
family Saxifragaceae. There is considerable geographic variation in the degree
of mutualism vs. exploitation in the moths' relationship with their usual host
plant (Lithophragma) and in switching over to an alternative saxifragaceous
host, Heuchera. This geographic variation is used to address the origins of host
switching and how mutualisms are derived from antagonisms and vice versa. The
three objectives of this research are to determine whether: 1) Heuchera-feeding
Greyia politella populations are genetically differentiated from Lithophragma-
feeding populations, 2) host shifts are associated with plant chromosome number,
and 3) the host shift to Heuchera has resulted in a mutualistic relationship.
%%% Geographic variation in plant-insect relationships has been largely ignored
in previous studies. Such variation provides important clues into how
mutualistic and antagonistic relationships between organisms originate and
change with time. This project is novel in addressing important questions about
the origins of antagonisms and mutualisms between insects and their host plants
and in examining the geographic variation in these relationships. Information
from this research could have important applications to biological control and
other pest management methods in agriculture and forestry. ***
