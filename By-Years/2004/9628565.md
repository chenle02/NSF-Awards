With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Siegel of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California--San Diego will
investigate the chemistry of three nanomolecular morphologies. The focus of this
work is the computational design, synthesis and characterization of Stem-Palmate
Clusters, Entwined Networks of Cyclophanes, and Aromatic Shells and Curved
Surfaces. Particular attention is to be paid to the stereochemical
characteristics of the above systems. New synthetic materials developed in
chemical laboratories range in size from a small (10 angstrom) molecules to very
large compounds such as polymers that are 100 angstroms long. This investigation
focuses on intermediate systems referred to as nanomolecules (10-100 angstoms).
Computer aided design followed by synthesis will provide a myriad of molecular
motifs that are useful in biosensors, optical materials and liquid crystals. The
three dimensional character of these systems is of particular importance.
