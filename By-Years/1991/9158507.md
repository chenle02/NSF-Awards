The proposed research is directed to understanding the factors that govern the
response of cartilage to external mechanical forces. The remodeling of
cartilage, like that of bone, is a very complex response that involves a variety
of chemical factors in addition to the physical forces. The PI will combine
techniques of engineering, biophysics, and cellular and molecular biology to
study how cells regulate tissue composition and material properties. The work
will include the use of NMR spectroscopy and imaging techniques for the
evaluation of the biochemical and mechanical states of cartilage. These basic
bioengineering studies will result in a better understanding of the remodeling
of connective tissue, and should eventually result in better diagnostic and
therapeutic techniques.
