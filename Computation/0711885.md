Astrophysical fluid dynamics is a branch of physics concerned with understanding
the evolution of far-away objects such as black holes and neutron stars. In
order to fully understand such objects, mathematical models must incorporate
general relativistic, electromagnetic, and fluid dynamic effects. The resulting
equations are a large, coupled, nonlinear system of partial differential
equations, some of which are evolution equations, while others are constraint
equations that result from various gauge freedoms. The PI's research will focus
on developing high-order schemes on unstructured grids to solve various
simplified versions of the full astrophysical fluid dynamic model. For example,
one problem of great interest to astrophysicists is that of mass accretion onto
black holes and the resulting formation of relativistic jets; this phenomenon
can be treated in the test-fluid limit (i.e., background spacetime metric is
fixed). Another important problem is the generation of gravitational waves
(i.e., ripples in spacetime) from the collision of two massive black holes; this
problem can be first looked at in the minimally coupled scalar field limit. The
PI will make use of both discontinuous Galerkin and residual distribution scheme
methodologies to construct accurate and efficient schemes. In particular, these
methods will be combined with adaptive mesh refinement strategies. In order to
do this efficiently, the PI will construct a posteriori error estimators that
can be used to dynamically diagnose where large numerical errors are being made.
The resulting set of numerical methods will be incorporated into a computer code
that will be made freely available on the web.

Although astrophysical objects such as black hole accretion disks,
extragalactic jets, and supernovae are observable using various telescopes,
direct experimentation is clearly not possible. On the other hand, mathematical
models that attempt to explain the physics of these objects are necessarily
complex and must include gravitational, electromagnetic, and fluid dynamic
effects. Exact solutions to the resulting mathematical equations can only be
constructed in very special cases. Therefore, the ability to understand
astrophysical phenomena from a scientific viewpoint rests largely on the ability
to run accurate and efficient computer simulations, which, in turn, rests on the
quality of the computational methods that are used to carry out those
simulations. The PI's research is focused on developing classes of high-order
computational methods for solving the equations of astrophysical fluid dynamics.
One aspect of this work will involve the construction of various error
indicators that can be used to dynamically diagnose and correct the accuracy of
a computation. Another aspect will be to develop a software package that will be
made freely available on the web. The computational methods that result from
this development will be applied to two distinct problems in astrophysics: (1)
the formation of astrophysical jets from black hole accretion processes and (2)
the dynamics of the interaction of two black holes and the resulting generation
of gravitational waves.
