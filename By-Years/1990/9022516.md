This award is for the purchase of equipment to upgrade a vision laboratory to
enable the laboratory to perform research in a number of new areas. The research
that this equipment supports includes research in low bit-rate coding of color
signals, knowledge-based video feature extraction, adaptive video coding using
non-uniform sampling, information preserving video coders, and high speed
architectures for seismic image interpretation. In recent years there has been
unprecedented progress in the development of cost effective video systems that
can provide a variety of visual communication services: video conferencing,
video telephones, facsimile transmission, high definition television,etc. One of
the driving forces for these innovations has been the development of powerful
signal processing algorithms and fast$and inexpensive hardware optimized for
them. It is still a technical challenge, however, to design these systems to
operate economically at video rates. Seismic signal processing involves signals
with lower bandwidth than video signals, but many of the issues are similar. In
particular, both must work with signals containing millions of samples and both
must use innovative algorithms and multiprocessor implementations to operate
efficiently. The Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at Georgia Tech has been
involved in research in digital signal processing and its applications in speech
processing, image processing, and efficient digital architectures for nearly
twenty years. All of the projects supported by this award are concerned with the
development of algorithms and architectures to operate economically on a large
number of signals.
