The aim of the project is to develop models in which the information which is
salient for problems of political philosophy can be represented and incorporated
into a formal theory. Various axiomatic approaches in bargaining theory,
cooperative game theory, and non-cooperative game theory are adapted and used to
rigorously derive implications for economic policy of different political
philosophies. The project develops new tools for modelling problems of
distributive justice. These tools do a better job of capturing our intuitions
about distributive justice and related ethical questions because they include
information about property rights and about the distribution of physical objects
which fulfill various needs and desires. Past models of social choice focus only
on the distribution of utilities and abstract from the characteristics of
economic environments. This formal theory is developed and applied to actual
resource allocation problems. For example, suppose an international organization
such as the World Health Organization takes as its objective to distribute its
limited resources in such a way as to equalize the opportunities that all
countries have to achieve an improvement in their rates of infant mortality. The
distribution of resources across countries consistent with fundamental
principles of justice can be rigorously derived from this theory.
