ALBRECHT/ABSTRACT The objective of this research is the observed structure and
evolution of continental stratocunulus clouds near Penn State University. The
observations will include liquid water, cloud base and height, microphysical
structure and composition and will be obtained using a microwave radeoriter, a
laser ceilometer, and a 94 GHz rador, radiosoules, and a research aircraft
capable of measuring the same or related quantities. The aggragate observations
should help to formulate a physical useful description of countineutal
stratocunulus clouds which, unlike its maritime couterpart, have remained
relatively unexamined.
