The 6th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST) is scheduled for
February 2008. FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage
systems, bringing in researchers and practitioners from both industry and
academia. Topics include reliability, performance, mobility, power management,
measurement, and other topics germane to file and storage systems. This NSF
proposal requested funding to support the attendance of US-based graduate
students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of
the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. The support requested
in this proposal makes possible the participation of students who would
otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention will be paid to directing
support towards underrepresented minorities including women, African-Americans,
and Native Americans.
