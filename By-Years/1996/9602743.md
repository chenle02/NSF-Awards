Frostburg State University (FSU) is the recipient of ARI funds for the
renovation of Gunter Hall. FSU, a rural Comprehensive I institution, is located
in mountainous western Maryland serving Appalachian residents from Maryland,
West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and minority students from the Baltimore-
Washington, DC metropolitan area. As part of the eleven member University of
Maryland System, FSU has the distinction of being second in the proportion of
its students who succeed in doctoral studies. The administration, recognizing
the need to maintain its position, is committed to provide modern laboratories
to facilitate the professional development of science faculty, and enhance
training programs for the next generation of scientists. FSU, with assistance
from the National Science Foundation, will provide resources to renovate Gunter
Hall. Constructed in 1960, the facility originally housed the university's
dining hall and student center. As part of the overall facilities improvement
plan, Gunter Hall when refurbished will become home to the Geography Department
and the focus of environmental science programs that are currently dispersed
among five buildings. Renovations will encompass: reconfiguring space, improving
ventilation and utility systems, and installing fixed equipment. Upon completion
the following research programs will be enhanced: Environmental Geology and
Hydrology, Soils Research, Environmental Chemistry, Engineering and Cartography,
Forest Ecology, Mammalian and Avian Ecology, Aquatic Ecology, and Aquaculture
and Toxicology. This project will unify students and faculty engaged in
environmental science studies, establish research collaborations, and increase
the number of students pursuing environmental science as a career.
