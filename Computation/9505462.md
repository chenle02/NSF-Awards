9505462 Feldstein This award will provide partial support for the Second
International Conference on the Numerical Solution of Volterra and Delay
Equations to be held at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona from May
22-25, 1996. The subject of Volterra equations includes functional differential
equations (delay, advanced, and neutral), Volterra integral equations, and
Volterra integro-differential equations. These equatiols have found applications
as models in many areas of science and engineering such as biomathematics and
medical science, control theory, electrodynamics, neutron transport, theory,
oscillation theory, and viscoelasticity. Since the solutions to such equations
can rarely be obtained in closed form, computational techniques must be used;
hence the focus of the conference will be on computational methods. The three
main themes of the conference will be convergence and order properties,
stability analysis, and implementation problems. The program will include
invited presentations and contributed talks, as well as organized mini-symposia
and panel discussions. The conference will bring together leading scholars in
this field from the international community and participants will include both
junior researchers and senior experts.
