This project encompasses the development of equipment and experiments for
teaching the behavior of structures under dynamic loading conditions to
undergraduate engineers. The laboratory development augments the facilities
available in an existing laboratory which is used to teach behavior of
structures under static loads. Tests begin with simple free vibration
experiments demonstrating how dynamic parameters characterizing motion are
measured, progressing through structures subjected to forced vibration caused by
dynamic forces (e.g., wind loads) or base motion (e.g., by an earthquake), and
application of vibration reduction techniques (e.g., by use of dampers and base
isolators). Small-scale structures will be used in most of the experiments, but
in at least one experiment, the students will evaluate the dynamic performance
of an existing prototype structure. The overall objectives in conducting such
tests include: (1) enabling the student to understand dynamic structural
behavior and related theories; (2) teaching the students the use of modern
dynamic testing equipment and data acquisition facilities; and (3) serving as a
motivational force and as a general enrichment of their educational experience.
Instruments will provide state- of-the-art experience and yet will be easy to
use. The experiments which can be performed are essentially unlimited and can be
changed to meet changing curricular needs at no additional cost.
