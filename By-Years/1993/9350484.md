ABSTRACT 9350484 Falmagne This project develops an interactive student
assessment computer system to be used in grades 4 to 8. This expert system,
where subsequent questions are based on previous responses, provides a report
for each student delivered in everyday language and which describes the
student's current strengths and weaknesses relative to the appropriate
mathematics curriculum. The report makes specific recommendations and provides a
printout of critical question missed with annotated solutions. The results for
each student are advisory to the classroom teacher. Each student session is
completed in a short amount of time. The system considers cultural and social
diversity and is constructed to accept "open" responses to the questions. The
system requires the identification and construction of a "knowledge space" which
includes a suitable family of "knowledge states," revised and refined through
peer review. Both the development and initial implementation take place in
exemplary schools in Orange County California. ***
