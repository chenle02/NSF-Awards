With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Lycoming College will acquire a glove box, Fourier-
transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS)
spectrophotometer. Research will focus on the following studies: a) synthetic
chemistry utilizing intramolecular hydroacylation; b) production of mixed metal
selenides; and c) the production of carbon-based radicals. Students at this
undergraduate institution will be heavily involved in these research projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A glove box is a critical piece of equipment when handling
air-sensitive chemicals. FTIR and UV-VIS spectrometers are mainstays of the
modern chemical laboratory, allowing rapid identification of unknown compounds.
These fundamental studies will have an impact in a variety of areas including
synthetic inorganic and organic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
