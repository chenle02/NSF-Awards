unprecedented scale of the Internet, Internet services pose challenges including
scalability, reliability, and availability to underlying networked systems. This
CAREER project concentrates on building Internet services that are resilient to
those challenges with machine learning and control techniques. Internet services
build upon cluster-based computer systems that keep growing in scale and
complexity. Such systems become so complicated that it is even a big challenge
to get a good understanding of the entire system dynamic behaviors. The
investigators take an analytical and organized approach to design an autonomous
software infrastructure on networked systems for building resilient Internet
services. The project builds empirical models using statistical learning to help
overcome the challenges of scale and complexity in networked systems. It designs
coordinated admission control and capacity planning algorithms with end-to-end
quality-of-service on multi-tier clusters. Model-independent control techniques
are used with empirical models to allocate resources and to dynamically
reconfigure the system for performance optimization needs. It develops
performance differentiation, isolation, and self-adaptive reconfiguration
capabilities for enhancing system reliability and availability. It broadens the
research impact by developing a testbed in a data center lab to demonstrate the
orchestration of designed techniques for automated arrangement, coordination,
and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services. The
research results will be disseminated to the public as technical reports. This
project also supports a new inter-disciplinary Ph.D. of Engineering in security
program.
