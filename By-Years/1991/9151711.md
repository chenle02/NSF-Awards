Students are developing an active, experimental approach to calculus and its
applications through utilization of a Computer Algebra System in conjunction
with problem solving. The major instruments of the project are a 25 workstation
computer laboratory on a local area network, augmented by portable computers
with overhead displays for classroom demonstrations, and desktop computers for
faculty use for student consultations, demonstrations, and material development.
