9361801 Jackson Current position tracking technology is inappropriate for
typical commercial applications, such as scientific visualization and computer-
aided design. Position trackers available today also tend to be too expensive
for widespread use and do not provide or facilitate haptic display. Today's
haptic display technology also has serious problems. The most commonly
experienced haptic sensations are those produced when two rigid objects contact
each other, and current haptic display technology cannot model these situations
convincingly. We propose to implement an innovative haptic display which can
effectively model contact with rigid objects. We will combine it with an
extremely accurate three- dimensional position tracker to produce a commercially
viable product for three-dimensional computer workspaces.
