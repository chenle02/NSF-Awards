This award will provide support to a group from Rutgers University to pursue
research in high energy physics. The group will continue research with the AMY
detector at the TRISTAN accelerator in Japan and will begin CP violation
experiments at Fermilab. The AMY detector provides data from electron-positron
annihilations at a center of mass energy of 60 GeV. During the next two years
the accumulated data should increase by about a factor of five over that
presently recorded. This will allow precision tests of the Standard Model of
weak interactions to be made by measuring the large forward-backward charge
asymmetries of the produced lepton and quark pairs. The program to measure CP
violation is centered on the measurement of the decay of neutral kaons to a
final state consisting of a neutral pion, an electron and a positron. In
addition a future program of measuring CP violation parameters is planned for a
phi-factory.
