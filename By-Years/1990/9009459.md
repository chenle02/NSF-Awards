This a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from the
Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The objective of this project is to
improve the reliability of the existing earthquake loss estimation models based
upon observations of the October 17 Loma Prieta earthquake. Research will be
focused on two issues: * the amplification of ground motion due to certain soil
conditions, and * a Bayesian update of the loss estimate matricies for various
classes of buildings. The study will comprise of four tasks: (1) Data collecting
and processing, (2) development of soil amplification model, (3) Bayesian update
of intensity-damage relationships, and (4) calibration of the updated integrated
loss estimation model developed earlier by the investigators at Stanford
University. A successful completion of the project will advance the state of the
art in earthquake risk management to the benefit of all segments of society.
