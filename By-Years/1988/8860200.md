Injecting biologically active solutions into cells and tissues is an integral
part of most biomedical research, but the instrumentation available for these
procedures is crude, cumbersome, and imprecise. Dr. David B. Wallace with
MicroFab Technologies, Inc. has developed a solid-state piezoelectric "pump"
that could replace mechanical pumps, iontophoresis, and pressure-injection
systems in many biomedical research applications. Compared to conventional
systems, the piezoelectric pump could provide vastly smaller pumping volumes,
greater reliability and accuracy, simultaneous "push-pull" pumping modes, and
convenient (solid-state) automation and control of fluid delivery/removal
programs. MicroFab plans to build and test piezoelectric pumps for injecting
drugs into tissues or cells. The firm has developed piezopumps for many
applications, but biomedical uses will require pumping through considerable
smaller orifices and against higher fluid resistance. MicroFab will test
piezopump performance under simulated intravital pumping conditions and
determine such matters as minimum orifice for reliable pumping, minimum and
maximum reliable flow rates, and pumping accuracy. The piezoelectric pumping
system could substantially expand the research capabilities of most biomedical
research laboratories; procedures now difficult or impossible may be come
routine with the solid-state pump.
