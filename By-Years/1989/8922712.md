Research focuses on analytical analysis of vehicle routing, including worst-
case analysis and probabilistic analysis. Such analyses can identify classes of
problems on which specific algorithms are highly effective. Further, models that
integrate vehicle routing with other important factors such as inventory routing
and network design will be studied. In addition, this work should yield new
analytical performance measures for several vehicle routing problems (VRP)
heuristics. Several new or modified heuristic procedures will be developed for
several difficult types of VRP problems.
