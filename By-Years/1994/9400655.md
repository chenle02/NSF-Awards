This award provides funding for developing a new technology, called Thermosonic
Bonding, for connections in electronic packaging applications. Such a technology
and the knowledge base resulting from the studies will have a profound impact on
solderless packaging technologies in manufacturing. The resulting technologies
can also be useful to support prototyping facilities and education in
manufacturing engineering. The technology can simplify the prototyping
procedures for multichip (MCM) modules. Such technologies are critical to low-
cost and environmentally sound prototyping and manufacturing methods.
