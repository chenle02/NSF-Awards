The laboratory provides high-speed processing and high-resolution graphics for
involving undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary area of current
interest -- Chaos. This furnishes the undergraduate students with an opportunity
for interdisciplinary work as well as experience with a contemporary research
topic. The laboratory uses technologically advanced workstations to achieve both
the speed and the resolution desired. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.//
