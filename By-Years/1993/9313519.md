Okamura The University of California at Riverside has 23 faculty members in the
Department of Chemistry that require a reliable supply of chilled water for
their research and research training activities. Currently, this department is
without such a supply and this fact is compromising their research efforts. The
research activities in which these faculty are involved include organometallic
chemistry, laser-assisted Fourier transform mass spectrometry, design, synthesis
and characterization of oligonucleotide analogs, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, organic chemistry and biochemistry. Approximately 78 personnel use
the chill water facility on a regular basis. including students and postdocs.
The modernization of this facility will make more reliable the availability of a
shared resource necessary to carry-out sophisticated chemical research and
research training that impacts greatly materials research in this country.
