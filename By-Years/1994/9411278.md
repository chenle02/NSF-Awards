IBN 94-11278 Winkler & Freeman ABSTRACT The choice of a mate is one of the most
important decisions an animal makes. A high-quality mate can provide better care
and higher biological quality for the offspring. In his doctoral dissertation
research, Mr. Corey R. Freeman will explore the dynamics of these decisions by
testing the effects of different amounts of male parental care on the mating
preferences of females. He will use a combination of field observations,
experimental interventions and DNA fingerprinting to add to our understanding of
this important aspect of the biology of social systems.
