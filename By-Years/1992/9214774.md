This career advancement award supports the research of Professor King to study
unipotent representations of a given semi- simple Lie group. This will require
precise information on the classification and structure of the nilpotent
conjugacy classes in the corresponding Lie algebra. The theory of Lie groups,
named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the
major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics.
