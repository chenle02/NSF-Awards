This project is concerned with various problems in additive combinatorics and in
particular with their applications to the Kakeya problem. The Kakeya problem
asks, loosely speaking, how small a set in Euclidean space can be if it contains
a unit line segment in every direction. More precisely, one would like lower
bounds on the Hausdorff dimension, and it is conjectured that the lower bound
should be the dimension of the Euclidean space. The conjecture has long been
known true in the plane, but is much more difficult in higher dimensions and has
inspired a great deal of work using techniques from fields ranging from harmonic
analysis to commutative algebra to logic. In a paper with Laba and Tao, the
author helped develop the connection of the Kakeya problem to sum-product
theory. This is the theory of lower bounds on the sumset and product set of some
finite subset of a field (or ring.) Sum product theory has been developing
quickly over the past decade, and we now hope we know enough to come close to
resolution in dimension 3, using some recent techniques of Bourgain, Konyagin,
and others. In particular, we hope to show that the Assouad dimension of a
Kakeya set in three dimensions is 3.

From the earliest part of our mathematical educations, we learn that addition
and multiplication are two of the most important mathematical processes, and
that they are widely applicable to a number of real world problems.
Surprisingly, not everything about the way in which addition and multiplication
are connected is completely understood. We have recently learned that in a
certain sense, addition and multiplication do not go well together - if a set
does not expand much under addition, it must expand under multiplication, and
vice versa. This principle is expressed in a number of "sum product" theorems.
Sum Product theory has led to a lot of excitement in the last few years. It has
applications in the combinatorics and geometric measure theory, the parts of
mathematics for which it was developed, as well as in theoretical computer
science, where expanding sets are used to generate pseudo-randomness. This
project deals both with the basic theory of sums and products as well as with
their deep mathematical applications. Continued work in this area is certain to
lead to further applications.
