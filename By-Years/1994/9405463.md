9405463 Bazard An important problem in the tectonics of the Pacific Northwest
concern the displacement and accretionary history of the Alexander- Wrangellia
terrane of southeast Alaska and Coastal British Columbia. There is presently no
consensus on the positions of the terrane during Jurassic through Paleocene time
and tectonic processes by which the terrane was accreted to North America are
controversial. This project, a collaborative effort between working at the
University of Arizona and the University of Mississippi., will test various
tectonic models of the area by paleomagnetic and detrital zircon age dating
methods. Results should help place new constraints on the displacement and
accretionary history of the Alexander-Wrangellia terrane.
