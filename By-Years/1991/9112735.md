Dr. Cittadino is continuing his study of the development of the science of
ecology between World Wars I and II. His project entails a thorough
investigation into the history of ecological science during the 1920s and 1930s
from an international perspective and with an effort to interrelate
intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes. The investigation
includes examination of primary and secondary sources and travel to a number of
important archives. The period between the wars witnessed the intellectual and
institutional maturation of ecology, the emergence of methodologies and concepts
usually associated with the postwar period, the emergence of methodologies and
concepts usually associated with the postwar period, the emergence of
identifiable schools, and the initial encounters between this new science and a
variety of social and ideological views and practices. This study promises a
substantial contribution to the historical understanding of ecological science,
still more or less in its infancy, and offers a unique perspective of a multi-
dimensional study carried out from an international point of view.
