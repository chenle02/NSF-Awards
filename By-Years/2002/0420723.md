This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program provides funds to
Southwest Texas State University for acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR). This instrument will help strengthen on going research
collaboration using complementary techniques of FTIR and Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) for materials and process characterization established in the physics
department at Texas State. The research includes investigations of novel
materials and processes that have potential applications in manufacturing of
semiconductors and other devices. In all cases, the high quality spatial
resolution of the AFM gives us insight into processes that occur on small scales
on the surface of the material. However, the understanding of these processes is
blind without the additional chemical information that can be obtained with
FTIR. Acquisition of these instruments will provide significant opportunities to
increase the level of undergraduate involvement and course curriculum
involvement with both instruments.
