The workshop will bring together diverse computational mechanicians dealing
with discrete (atomistic) and continuum (PDEs) phenomena. Leading experts in the
two communities will deliver extended lectures on the topics of mechanics of
single crystals at the nanoscale, the mechanics of nanostructures (nanograins,
nanotubes, and nanopatterns), and the bridging between nano-micro-macro scales.
These lectures will benefit junior researchers, including junior faculty,
research associates, post-docs, and graduate students. In particular, the junior
researchers in the field of continuum mechanics will benefit the most. In
addition to the extended lectures, leading authorities from governmental
agencies will chair a panel discussion. This panel will address the issues of
both scientific and technological/programmatic challenges to researchers of
computational mechanics. The accompanying poster presentations will provide an
opportunity for the researchers to exchange views with their peers and with the
governmental representatives.
