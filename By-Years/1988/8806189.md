Equipment is to be acquired and utilized in extending and enhancing the
capabilities of two devices used in an ongoing experimental research program on
shock wave behavior relevant to combustion systems. The first is a phase-change
shock tube, and the second is a detonation tunnel. The additional equipment will
give higher resolution information on the very rapid shocked behavior of matter
under extreme conditions, with particular emphasis on combustion and detonation.
