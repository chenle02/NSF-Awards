9527740 Hughes This award supports travel to Jordan to establish the feasibility
of developing a collaborative program of paleoclimatic research using tree
rings. The objective of the resulting project would be to develop tree-ring
records of climate over the past several centuries for this part of the Near
East, as part of an international effort to understand interannual to century
scale variability in climate. The region is currently poorly represented in
records of this kind. Benefits derive from filling this gap in global coverage,
enabling a more thorough description of climate variability in mid-latitudes and
hence an improved capability to understand this aspect of climate variability.
This study will improve our capability to understand environmental variability
on these time scales of key features of the regional environment, e.g.
persistence of drought, reliability of streamflow.
