This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Salisbury University. The project, called Explore Emerging
Computing in Science and Engineering (EXERCISE), exposes students to emerging
parallel programming models, such as GPGPU languages and MapReduce, applied to
compute intensive problems in computer networks, image and signal processing,
and geographic information system.

The project will provide an opportunity for twenty-four undergraduate students
over a three-year period to participate in a supportive environment that
encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science. It will expose
these students to parallel programming, which is an area of growing importance,
and offer them the opportunity to present their results at regional and national
professional conferences. The site will recruit participants from under-
represented groups.
