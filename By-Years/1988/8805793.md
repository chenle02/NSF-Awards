A workshop on Tissue Engineering is proposed for February 26-29, 1988, to be
held at the Granlibakken Conference Center in California. The participants will
be limited to approximately 60, including 24 invited speakers and discussants
who have established programs in the field. An additional 12-16 participants
will be drawn from industry based on responses from announcements sent to the
research directors of 200 pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with
possible activities in the area. An additional 10-12 participants will be drawn
from agencies with programs that are related to the subject matter of the
workshop. The growth and maintenance of functional tissue for use in repair of
injured tissue, as a replacement for tissue loss in degeneration or as a means
of therapy where tissue implants can alleviate an adverse medical condition is a
rapidly evolving field. The workshop will evaluate the current status of
research in this field over a range of disciplines from fundamental cell biology
to analytic engineering approaches to production of tissue or materials useful
in new tissue induction. The specific areas to be considered will include but
not be limited to cell biology and cell and tissue culture, developmental
physiology, surgical needs, skin replacements, vascular replacements,
microcirculation development including angiogenesis and angiogenic factors,
cartilage and bone, muscle including cardiac muscle and pancreas and kidney. The
workshop will consist of a short opening session followed by two complete days
of sessions, and discussion summaries, will be published within 6 months of the
workshop as part of the series: UCLA Symposia in Molecular and Cellular Biology.
This will make the content of the meeting generally accessible to the community.
Drafts of session summary discussions and a recorded tape of the discussions
will be sent to the sponsoring agency immediately after the workshop.
