The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports the work of
Professor Christopher J. A. Daley of the University of San Diego to investigate
the preparation of dissymmetric diamidato-dithiolate ligands that resemble the
chelation environment in the nitrile hydratase family of metalloenzymes.
Complexes of cobalt and iron will be prepared and assessed in catalytic
reactions. This research may lead to an increased understanding of metalloenzyme
structure and function through modeling. The University of San Diego is
increasing its efforts in hands-on undergraduate research training and this
project is expected to result in the interdisciplinary training of their
undergraduate students as well as the exposure of these students to scientists
from the University of New Mexico, a collaborating institution.
