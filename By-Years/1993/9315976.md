9315976 Jirsa This project organizes and convenes a research workshop to
identify the directions and to develop strategies for NSF's earthquake
engineering and earthquake-related earth science research in the next decade.
The objective of the workshop are threefold: 1. To review current activities and
achievements under the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) with
a focus on those under NSF sponsorship. 2. To examine NSF policies and
management of the Earthquake Hazard Mitigation (EHM) program and the Fundamental
Earthquake Studies (EAR), including problem-focused research, which may enhance
or limit the future role of NSF. 3. To develop recommendations, in broad terms,
for areas and programs where NSF can and should vigorously support NEHRP. The
Workshop program will be designed so that in addition to meeting these stated
objectives, it would (a) address the issues raised in a recommendation made by
the NEHRP Advisory Committee in its report to the Congress, and (b) develop a
long-range strategic plan of research for NEHRP components at NSF. This workshop
is jointly supported by the Biological and Critical Systems Division of the
Directorate for Engineering and the Earth Sciences Division of the Directorate
for Geosciences. ***
