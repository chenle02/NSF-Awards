Indirect evidence of the nature of source terrains and tectonism along the
paleo-Pacific margin of Antarctica is found in the upper Paleozoic-lower
Mesozoic sequence of the Transantarctic and Ellsworth Mountains. The major
objective of this investigation is the synthesis of basin studies in the
Antarctic. This will be achieved by compilation of paleocurrent and provenance
data, comparisons of sedimentologic facies in various regions, and comparison of
the relatively poorly exposed Antarctic basins with the better known basins
along the paleo-Pacific margin of other Gondwana continents. The working
hypothesis for the integration of these data is that Antarctic basins are part
of a larger foreland basin which developed in response to Permo-Triassic folding
and thrusting in West Antarctica. Part of this work will be carried out in
collaboration with Gondwanan Foreland Basin Project at Macquarie University,
Sydney, Australia.
