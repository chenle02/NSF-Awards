This award enables the PI, an anthropologist, and his co-PI, an ecologist, to
conduct research on the role of Balinese temples in managing complex irrigation
systems. The investigators will develop a computer simulation model of
irrigation management along two Balinese rivers, using data already collected.
The model will relate climate, topography and hydrology to cropping patterns,
yield and pest control through the management of irrigation by the water temple
networks. Field measurements of paddies in 1986 showed a high rate of community
metabolism. Water temples attempt to optimize food production, balancing
constraints involving rainfall, ground water, irrigation demands, sunshine and
climate, and pest control. The simulation model will define the physical
processes relevant to water temple management along two rivers. When the model
is developed the researchers will return to Bali to verify and explore its
implications with Balinese farmers, temple priests and irrigation engineers.
This research is important because it will demonstrate the ecological and
agronomic value of a holistic, anthropological approach. The Balinese farmers
combine "religion" and "farming" in their lives in a seamless web of behavior.
Analyses of the irrigation system which ignore religion have been shown to be
incorrect and incomplete; the present analysis will produce a more complete
representation of the system.
