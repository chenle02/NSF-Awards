This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Morehouse College for the repair
and renovation of Hope Hall which houses that institution's biological sciences
research and research training activities. This building was constructed in 1929
and last renovated in 1985. The ARFMP grant of $950,000 and $950,000 provided by
the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the
current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of
quantity and quality of research that can be conducted by repairing structural
deficiencies and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and all
other building systems. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science
by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of undergraduate students at Morehouse College which is outstanding
among Black liberal arts colleges in the degree of emphasis it places on the
preparation of its graduates for research careers. The project is of special
benefit to the broadening of the nation's science base because it facilitates
the provision of quality research and research training opportunities for
minorities.
