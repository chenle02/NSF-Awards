An award is made to provide partial support for a Materials Research Society
Symposium at the annual meeting of the society in Boston, MA, on December 2-6,
1991. The topic of the symposium is the Application of Multiple Scattering
Theory to Materials Science. Multiple scattering theory is a technique for
treating the propagation of waves among scattering centers. It is a powerful
technique and is used in a wide range of fields that are relevant to materials
science. Recent developments have advanced the technique to the point where more
realistic calculations are possible. The symposium will bring together major
researchers in the field to discuss these advances and to present results of
calculations of interest to the materials research community.
