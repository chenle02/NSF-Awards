Helping people, teams, and organizations achieve important goals may be one of
the most effective ways to increase productivity and promote human progress. To
achieve their goals, many organizations employ financial incentives or game
elements, such as points, levels, and badges, to motivate employees to become
more productive. This project develops a theoretical foundation and
computational tools for designing better incentive structures to help people
achieve their goals. The project connects the crucial challenges of goal
achievement studied in psychology to the computational methods from artificial
intelligence that can be used to solve them. By bridging this gap the project
provides a new way for artificial intelligence to communicate with people and
empowers them to overcome the motivational obstacles and cognitive limitations
that might otherwise prevent them from making good decisions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of this project is a mathematical theory for
optimizing incentive structures to help people make better decisions in complex,
partially unknown environments. This theory is used as the basis for two
cognitive prostheses that leverage artificial intelligence and gamification to
help people achieve their goals: an intelligent to-do list gamification system
that helps people become more productive and procrastinate less and an app that
reinforces good habits. Field experiments are used to evaluate whether these
cognitive prostheses are effective in the real world, working towards the
development of intelligent systems that can aid people in setting and achieving
their goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
