The college is developing an undergraduate astronomy laboratory. Courses in
astronomy have been part of Natural Science Division curriculum for the past
four years. The laboratory course made possible with the grant can be taken
concurrently with either Planetary or Galactic Astronomy. It is taught at an
introductory level. The equipment will be used by students learning how to use a
telescope, plan an observation, use the stellar coordinate system, photograph
celestial events and develop their own images. Furthermore, students study
planetary surfaces by means of laser video disc images. The college is matching
the award with an equal amount of funds.
