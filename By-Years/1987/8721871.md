The PI proposes to study the detailed sedimentological, geochemical, and
paleontological record of sedimentary (particularly carbonate) rocks recovered
from the Mariana forearc. The history of these sediments can help determine the
history of vertical motion and styles of tectonism in oceanic forearc regions.
This information is essential because the style and magnitude of movement or
deformation, by whatever combination of uplift and subsidence, places
constraints on thermal and mechanical models for the evolution of active
margines. The samples will be collected from the submersible ALVIN.
