The University of Tennessee Space Institute has submitted proposal No. EPS
0336647 to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Experimental Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) aimed at initiating a planning process
to (a) assess the strengths and weaknesses of the State's existing research and
education enterprise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM); (b) identify potential barriers to the development of competitive
research; (c) benchmark other successful NSF State EPSCoR programs; and (d)
develop a long-term statewide plan for improving STEM. Consistent with EPSCoR's
current guidelines, Tennessee is eligible for the submission of planning grants,
since it receives 0.75% or less of the total NSF research funds to all sources
within a state averaged over the past three years (NSF 02-027).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an eligible state for this purpose, and consistent with
EPSCoR's guidelines, Tennessee has formed a state governing committee comprised
of leaders in academe, state government, and the private sector to lead a
statewide study of barriers and possible solutions. The Tennessee EPSCoR
Committee includes the State public higher education system, Vanderbilt
University, the administrative and legislative branches of the State government,
and representatives from private industry. A team of faculty and administrators
were selected to define a process by which specific research areas could be
identified for focused investment leading to improved research competitiveness.
Likewise, a Technical Advisory Committee has been established to assist in
implementing a successful process for developing the pursued state
plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
