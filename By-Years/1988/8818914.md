Differentiation in fungi is a direct consequence of de novo synthesis of
carbohydrate polymers and their subsequent assembly, forming a cell wall. All
available information clearly shows that cell wall assembly is the key
morphogenic determinant for these organisms. in filamentous fungi, cell wall
assembly occurs at each hyphal apex resulting in polarized growth and extension.
Although the general features of cell wall structure are known, only a few
details of cell wall assembly have been elucidated. This is due, in part, to the
lack of appropriate mutants for genetic dissection. (1-3)-beta-D-glucan synthase
activity catalyzes the formation of a linear (1-3)-beta-glucan. Glucan synthase
activity is essential for normal cell wall assembly and resulting growth and
development of a large number of diverse yeasts and filamentous fungi. Dr.
Selitrennikoff proposes the detailed characterization of glucan synthase of a
filamentous Ascomycete, Neurospora crassa. This includes: i) The purification
and characterization of solubilized enzyme activity. ii) The characterization of
glucan synthesis of isolated enzyme activity. iii) The analysis of glucan
synthase mutants. %%% This combination of biochemical and genetic approaches
will lead to significant gains in our understanding of (1,3)-beta-glucan
synthase and its role in development and morphogenesis.
