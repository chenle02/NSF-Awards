This work investigates new methods to provide operating system support for
hybrid computing systems. A hybrid system includes one or more instruction-based
processors coupled with accelerator logic that exploits application parallelism
to increase performance. The work focuses on accelerators constructed from
reconfigurable hardware, such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) logic.
Reconfigurable hardware also reduces energy by directly implementing the needed
computation instead of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. Future
work will extend the investigation to other types of accelerators, such as
general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). In particular, the research
studies the interdependence of accelerator management and software thread
scheduling in multi-tasking hybrid systems, and proposes integrating these two
system-level functions to increase the overall performance and energy-
efficiency. This will encourage industry to further embrace hybrid computing in
the development of new products, and thus, enable more capable and energy-
efficient mobile devices; quiet multi-function household information appliances;
portable medical devices; and more flexible, capable, and robust infrastructure
systems in transportation, healthcare, and other key industries.

This project also targets to improve teaching, learning, and diversity in
Computer Engineering. Activities include developing curriculum and teaching
aids, outreach activities, undergraduate research, and involvement in education-
related committees. As a part of this project, participants will create new
instructional materials for Computer Engineering topics at a variety of levels
of understanding.
