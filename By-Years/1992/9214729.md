Professor Becker will continue his investigations into the role of electron
spin when electrons impact on heavy noble gas atoms. The angular distribution of
scattered electrons will permit the Becker group to characterize the correlated
behavior between photons emitted coincident with the electrons scattered. Such
measurements detail the mechanism by which the incoming electron energy and spin
angular momentum are redistributed between the outgoing scattered electrons and
the electronically excited target.
