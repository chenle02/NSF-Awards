The Arctic Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
holds an annual conference either in Alaska or western Canada. The 1988
Conference will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, October 7-10, 1988. The theme of
the Conference is Science Education and is being organized by the University of
Alaska in conjunction with the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District.
This project seeks funding to provide travel assistance to secondary school
educators from the far-reaches of the State of Alaska. The Conference is being
held in Fairbanks to coincide with the local teacher-in-service training
periods. Several hundred secondary school educators are expected to attend and
be joined by several hundred scientists from Alaska and Canada and speakers from
non-Alaskan institutions and organizations. Workshops, special sessions and
keynote speakers will cover a wide range of science education needs and
solutions unique to remote northern regions, including content, concepts,
delivery techniques and training. Scientists and educators at all levels will
have the opportunity to discuss approaches, and successes and failures in
motivating rural and native students for science and engineering careers.
