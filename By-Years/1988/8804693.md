This grant supports international scientists and graduate students to
participate in a University of Pennsylvania Earth System Science Workshop on
"The Global Water Cycle: Past, Present, and Future". The nature of the global
water cycle and its role in global change has been singled out as a major
problem area critical to an understanding of planetary change. The scientific
approaches in this workshop involve atmospheric moisture transport and
precipitation models, transfer between major reservoirs, the role of the
hydrologic cycle in climate, the role of water in the world ecosystem, the water
cycle coupled to biogeochemical cycles, hydroclimates of geologic history and
associated phenomena, societal issues and a changing water cycle and the
hydrologic cycle and future global change. Workshops in Earth System Science
sponsored by the Earth System Science Center are directed to foster
multidisciplinary interaction in the study of major problems in the sciences of
the earth. This workshop is important because it treats broadly, the processes
that control our planet's water cycle. This is a fundamental scientific problem
that must be better understood in order to advance our knowledge of the earth's
climate and its variability.
