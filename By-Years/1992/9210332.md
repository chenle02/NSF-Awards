Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of techniques from
applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as expert systems to implement the
control functions for complex industrial processes. The research funded is
showing that the design of such expert controllers (controllers implemented via
expert systems) can be accomplished using the same design philosophy as that
used for fuzzy controllers. Moreover, to ensure that such expert controllers can
be trusted in critical environments (e.g., aircraft control, spacecraft control,
process control) this research is developing a discrete event system (DES)
theoretic framework for the modeling and analysis of expert control systems. In
particular, a mathematical model is introduced that can represent "rule-based"
expert systems and a wide class of processes. Techniques from DES theory are
being developed for the analysis of reachability (to study inference chains),
cyclic behavior (to verify that the expert system will not get stuck in circular
reasoning), and stability properties (to verify critical properties related to
the safe operation of expert control systems). The application of the approach
to the solution of a load balancing problem in flexible manufacturing systems
and process control problems is being investigated. Moreover, implementation
issues for expert controllers are being investigated via the implementation of
an expert controller for a flexible link manipulator.//
