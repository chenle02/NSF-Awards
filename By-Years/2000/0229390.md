The goal of this Planning Grant is to use program theory as a tool in two
informal science education communities and compare the processes and models that
result. Program theory is built on the principle that learning and social
behavioral change is the result of the cumulative effect of multiple programs,
rather than a single experience. The participating communities are the Tucson
Association of Museums (TAM) and the Terrific Resources for Environmental
Education (TREE) organization in Columbus, Ohio. Each organization will work
collaboratively using cross-group program theory and logic modeling to initiate
a discussion on program planning and an intra-group evaluation. It is
anticipated that this project will result in collaborations between the Tucson
and Ohio informal science education communities and the creation of a plan for
evaluation of the processes involved with this work.
