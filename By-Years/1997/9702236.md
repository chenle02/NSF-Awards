In order to shorten product development cycles for integrated circuits and
systems, pre-designed cores are widely used as part of the on-chip logic.
Testing core-based designs is a major issue because the internal design of the
core may not be known if it is intellectual property. In that case standard
manufacturing test strategies will not suffice. This research is exploring new
methodologies for testing chips with embedded cores. The approach is to find
methods for synthesizing the user-defined logic, in which cores reside, so that
the whole design meets area, performance and test criteria. Synthesis algorithms
are being developed which address the following concerns: 1. Application of test
vectors to inputs of the core. 2. Observation of outputs from the user-defined
logic that drive the inputs of the core. 3. Testing the user-defined logic
driven by the outputs of the core. 4. Observation of outputs from the core.
