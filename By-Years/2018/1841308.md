Natural variability of climate at decadal timescale can have profound regional
impact. Due to the limited length of the observational record, there is a lack
of quantitative understanding of decadal climate variability. The overall goal
of this proposal is to take advantage of the large ensemble simulations from
several climate modeling groups to improve the understanding of internal climate
variability. The findings of this project will provide insights into the
characteristic, regional influence, and future evolution of decadal variability.
The research outcome will provide valuable quantitative climate information
broadly useful to other research fields as well a variety of disciplines such as
ecological response and urban planning. The integrated knowledge will better
prepare the society for the climatic trend at regional scale. Through this
project, two graduate students will be trained in the fields of climate modeling
and statistical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will investigate
how to separate internally decadal variability from the externally forced
centennial trend using a large ensemble approach. They will develop decadal
variability indices with a suite of hydroclimate related properties such as
aridity, drought index and soil moisture conditions in order to quantify the
regional influence. The project also aims to assess the potential impact of the
centennial warming on the decadal variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
