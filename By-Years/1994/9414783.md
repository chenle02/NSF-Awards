9114783 Saka A Study of the nature of boundary lubricant films will be
undertaken by a combination of laser Raman microprobe spectroscopy of wearing
surfaces, friction and wear experiments, and molecular dynamic simulations of
the lubricant-solid interface. The Raman spectra will be used to determine
coverage, orientation, and structural stability of the molecules over a wide
range of normal pressures and temperatures and the results will be used as input
to the molecular dynamics model. The configuration of the lubricant
macromolecules that lead to a stable boundary lubricant film will be determined
and visualized. ***
