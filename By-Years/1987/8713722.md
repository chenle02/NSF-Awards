Given a linear differential equation which may model a physical system one may
seek the solutions based on a knowledge of the coefficients. The problem being
addresses here is the inverse problem: Given some knowledge of the solutions try
to determine the particular differential equation and hence the underlying
physical system. The proposed research is directed to handle inverse problems in
dimensions two or more based on the success achieved by the investigator with
one-dimensional problems.
