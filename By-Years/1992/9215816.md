This award supports the travel of Dr. James Van Etten of the University of
Nebraska at Lincoln to Australia to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Jan
Rohozinski of the Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian
National University. The goal of the research is to understand the biological
function of DNA methyltransferases and DNA restriction enzymes coded by viruses
which infect eukaryotic alga. Algal viruses are icosahedral DNA containing
viruses which infect chlorella cells. Specifically, the research will attempt to
establish a transformation system in chlorella so that studies of algal viral
genes can be undertaken. Work to develop the transformation system is to be
carried out in Australia at the Australian National University in Canberra. Once
the transformation system is established, the cloning of viral genes will be
accomplished. The facilities at the University of Nebraska are recognized as a
major center for studying these viruses and the restriction modification system
they encode. The analysis of the restriction modification genes, isolated by the
Australian investigators, will be done at the University of Nebraska.
