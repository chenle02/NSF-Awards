The proposal involves investigations in the areas of algebraic K-theory,
Homological Algebra, with an emphasis on Cyclic and Hochschild Homology, and
Infinitesimal Geometry. Specifically, invariants of operators are being
constructed and studied: exotic traces, higher index invariants and regulators,
as well as their ramifications for the theory of Dirichlet series and their
behavior in the vicinity of the critical line. The structure, homology, and
invariants associated to the algebras of differential operators and symbols are
the focus of the investigation in Infinitesimal Geometry. Finally, new phenomena
in Noncommutative Geometry related to special derivations and exotic chain
homotopy equivalences that replace Koszul resolution approach to de Rham theory
are the subject of the investigation in Homological Algebra. The projects in
this proposal are concerned with fundamental topics in Noncommutative Geometry,
Homological Algebra, Functional and Global Analysis. They offer novel approaches
to some classical subjects in other areas of Mathematics and Mathematical
Physics, in particular, Algebraic Geometry -- including its Arithmetic aspects,
Singularity Theory, Fractal Geometry, Analysis on Quantum Manifolds.
