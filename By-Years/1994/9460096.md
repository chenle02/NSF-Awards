An Experimental Program is proposed to investigate thermal conductivity of
highly loaded AlN/epoxy composite as a function of processing variables. AlN has
been chosen as a filler material because of its very high thermal conductivity
as well as its capability to deform plastically under stress and epoxy resin
matrix because of its high adhesive strength for strong bonding of AlN filler
particles. AlN/epoxy composite will be tape cast and treated thermomechanically
for very high thermal conductivity. During the thermomechanical treatments
coarse AlN filler particles will be squeezed together to achieve large contact
areas and very thin interfacial layers which are essential for composite bodies
with very high thermal conductivity,
