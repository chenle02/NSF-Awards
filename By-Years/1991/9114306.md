The primary goal of this project is to develop a general and fundamental theory
of heat conduction in nanometer-scale solid structures. Existing theories for
heat conduction in bulk solids are inadequate for that in nanostructures. With
current trends towards manufacturing nanometer-scale devices, there is a
compelling need for developing a theory for heat transport at these scales. This
will be achieved by using analogies between heat conduction by electrons and
phonons and radiative transfer by photons or electromagnetic waves. The final
goal is to unify the theories of heat conduction and radiation in solids. The
results of this project could have a strong impact on the role of heat transfer
in nanotechnology. The topic and the approach described here are new and, as in
any new research venture, the initial stages will be exploratory and involve
risks. Therefore an SGER grant is appropriate to support this project.
