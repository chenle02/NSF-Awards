The investigator proposes a mix of activities aimed at a study of decays of
heavy b and c quarks. The activities include participation in the design of a
detector to be used at an asymmetric B factory at SLAC, and in the running and
analysis of data from experiment E791 at Fermilab. In the former activity, the
PI already has established her program. She has given a course of seminars at
SLAC on the subject of CP violation - the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the
universe. She has also co-led the study of the use of He based drift chamber
gases in a detector to be used at the planned facility. She also plans a long
term participation in E791 at Fermilab to study semi-leptonic decays of D
mesons, and also mixing between the matter/antimatter D0 and anti-D0 partners.
