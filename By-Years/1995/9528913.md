At present there are large computer programs capable of representing
mathematical proofs (such as NuPrl) and large computer programs capable of
symbolic computation (such as Macsyma), and many theorem-proving programs that
try to find proofs. But these three capabilities are nowhere present in the same
system. In this project, a single system smoothly integrating symbolic
computation and representation of mathematical proofs will be built, and
supplemented with proof-finding algorithms. A prototype version has already been
able to generate automatically an epsilon-delta proof of the continuity of f(x)
= x^3. The system to be built will be able to generate many other epsilon-delta
proofs and other more complicated proofs in analysis. ***
