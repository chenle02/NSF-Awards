NSF/USDOT: Dynamic and Stochastic Vehicle Dispatching with Time Dependent Travel
Times: The Next Generation of Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have long
understood that stochastic and time-dependent travel times, stochastic service
or handling times and stochastic demand arrival patterns render schedules
developed using static assignment models sub-optimal and often infeasible.
Nonetheless, the development of alternative models and solution methods has
proceeded at a relatively slow pace. The costs associated with these
infeasibilities can be very high and are borne by commercial vehicle operators,
their customers and society at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
represents a new generation of routing and scheduling models, ones that
explicitly incorporate time-dependent and stochastic travel times, dynamic
service requests and stochastic service times. The applications of interest are
local truckload trucking operations, local less-than-truckload operations, local
pickup and delivery operations and service fleets. &lt;br/&gt;
