This project concerns the spectral theory of Schrodinger operators, a central
topic in quantum mechanics. Schrodinger operators describe the movement of an
electron in a medium subject to a disordered system. The development of the
theory of Schrodinger operators is expected to enhance the understanding of many
types of physical phenomena, including conductance, quantum Hall effect,
quasicrystals, and graphene. The PI intends to develop new tools to provide
rigorous mathematical explanations for these phenomena. The tools that will be
developed will also find applications in other branches of mathematics,
including harmonic analysis, probability and number theory.

This project consists of several parts. One is to study quantum graphs in
magnetic fields. The PI intends to understand the topological structure of the
spectrum and spectral decompositions. The second part involves studying
Laplacians on discrete periodic graphs with a goal of finding the connection
between the presence of spectral gaps and the geometric structure of the
underlying lattice. The third goal concerns discrete quasi-periodic Schrodinger
operators, focusing on several well-known problems including measure of the
spectrum, continuity of the spectrum, structure of eigenfunctions in the
localization regime and quantum dynamics in the singular continuous regime for
quasi-periodic operators. Another goal is to understand Schrodinger operators
with potentials generated by skew-shift. These operators, although being
completely deterministic, are expected to resemble random features.
