This project is mathematical research that has applications to the design of
control systems. A variety of methods from functional analysis and operator
theory will be brought to bear on problems involving matrix-valued analytic
functions, in particular optimal supremum norm approximation by such functions
and multivariable Nevanlinna - Pick interpolation problems. Results here are
relevant to the computation of quantities which enable one to stabilize systems
with parameter or modeling uncertainty while at the same time meeting certain
performance specifications. Nonlinear as well as linear systems will be
considered, with due attention to development of the underlying operator theory
in the nonlinear case.
