The proposal addresses problems in model theory of o-minimal structures. The
principal investigator will continue further developing model theory and
analytic geometry associated with o-minimal structures. In developing model
theory of o-minimal structures the principal investigator is planning to use
differential-geometric techniques. In turn the principal investigator hopes to
apply model-theoretic techniques to questions in complex and real analytic
geometries. Model theory of compact complex manifolds has had remarkable success
in the recent years and the proposer plans, among the other things, to extend
these advances, using methods developed by him and his collaborators.

The proposal is in in a branch of mathematical logic called model theory. Model
theory studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order sentences
true in those structures, and the family of alternate structures that also
satisfy all of those first-order sentences. (Sentences in logic are built out of
a small repertoire of elements and constructions. "First-order" refers to the
number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.) In many cases
these alternative structures illuminate some properties of the original
mathematical objects. A good example is the non-standard analysis. A part of
this proposal is an extension on ideas of non-standard analysis to complex-
analytic functions.
