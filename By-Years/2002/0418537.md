This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will manipulate
insect behavior by interfering with the codling moth olfactory pathway. This
will result in inhibition in mating of moths and laying of unfertilized eggs.
The commercial application of project will be as an "anti-pheromone" product in
the area of pest management.
