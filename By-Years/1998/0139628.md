This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University Alabama at
Birmingham. Tracy Hamilton is the site's Program Director. Eight faculty will
serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students
will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Recruitment efforts will be
focused through the close links that the Department of Chemistry has developed
with regional HBCUs. The REU group of students will meet weekly for progress
reporting and for visits to local cultural and historical sites of interest. The
summer program will conclude with a poster session. Evaluation of the program
will be the number of refereed publications with student co-authors and the
number of students going to graduate school.
