9313237 Ousterhout In this research project, innovative analytical techniques
are developed for modeling and controlling sheet forming processes by combining
closed-loop control theory with real-time process measurements. The procedure
leads to optimum binder force profile in both space and time, and increases the
level of in-process control and disturbance rejection towards significantly
improving accuracy, part-to part consistency and flexibility. The project
includes the design, fabrication and testing of a deep-drawing apparatus with a
multivariable force controlled binder to test the analytical methods, and to
assess the performance of the multivariable force controlled binder over a wide
variety of materials and part configurations. The variable force controlled
binder has the force control characteristics to regulate the binding force, and
the capability to generate a variable force profile along the perimeter of the
binder that changes with position and time. The results of this research lead to
the development of theory and establishment of technology for improving accuracy
and flexibility in sheet forming process. ***
