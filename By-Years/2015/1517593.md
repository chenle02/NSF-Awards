Understanding how matter is distributed in the Universe is key to developing
accurate models of how it evolved. The investigators will use mapping of
filamentary structures in large samples of galaxies as a new indicator of large
scale structure that can then be compared to other data. They seek to trace the
cosmic web from these data. Broader impacts of the work include training of a
graduate student, and engagement of the broader community through public
lectures at the Allegheny Observatory, online educational games, and existing
programs for middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
cross correlate the new data with other cosmological observables like Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations and study intrinsic galaxy shapes with filaments. The
group has developed a method for identifying filaments in purely photometric
data and, with this award, will develop a pre-existing prototype into a
reconstruction tool. They will then apply the tool to simulated data.
