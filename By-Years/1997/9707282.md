9707282 Bhushan Support is provided for a symposium on the tribological research
needs in the area of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Experts in MEMS
and in nanotribology will assess the state of the art and outline the most
pressing needs for basic research to address these needs, including lubricant
design, surface treatments, silicon nanotribology, and tribological issues in
MEMS manufacturing. ***
