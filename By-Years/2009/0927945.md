The research objective of this award is to understand how tension is maintained
in dynamic stress fibers despite the continual addition of new actomyosin at
focal adhesions. Forces generated in stress fibers are established through
interactions between repeating functional units called sarcomeres. While these
structures are similar to the building blocks of muscle, preliminary results
suggest a fundamental difference. Nascent sarcomeres are continuously produced
and added to the fiber at focal adhesions, where new actin is polymerized, and
translated into the stress fiber interior. It is not understood how sarcomeres
are dynamically added to the stress fiber in a way that maintains tension.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve current understanding of
myosin-based force generation by putting it on a quantitative foundation. The
proposed effort is of value to theoretical efforts on bridging multiple length
scales for models of cellular contractility. Understanding how tension is
maintained in the dynamic, multi-scale stress fiber can inspire a new generation
of intelligent mechanical devices that have capabilities of self-regulation and
self-healing. By improving our understanding of how tension is maintained in
dynamic stress fibers, this research can aid the success of tissue engineered
substitutes. The state of Florida has a large population of minority students
that deserve opportunities to work in research laboratories. The research
program will provide opportunities to outstanding minority undergraduate
students to perform research. The results of the research will be integrated
into two different courses which are part of a new, biomolecular engineering
minor at the University of Florida. &lt;br/&gt;
