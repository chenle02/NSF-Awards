This action will enable a small group of physicists at Virginia Polytechnic to
continue its research. The group consists of two faculty members, one senior
engineer, one research associate and one student. The group is working on the
fabrication of a particle detector to be used at the electron-proton colliding
beam facility currently under construction in Hamburg, Germany. The fabrication
of the detector is an international effort involving physicists from ten
countries. The US component of the collaboration, consisting of seven
universities and one national laboratory, has responsibility for the barrel
calorimeter, one of the major subsystems of the detector. The photomultipliers
bases for the calorimeter were developed and are being built by VPI. Other NSF
supported groups in the collaboration are from Columbia University, Pennsylvania
State University and the University of Iowa. Operation of the detector is
scheduled for 1991. VPI is developing software and studying the radiative
corrections required for the interpretation of the data. The group will also
conduct R&amp;D on detectors for the Superconducting Super Collider.
