This project explores the relationship of hard physical labor under natural
conditions (Polish peasant women in a mountainous region), and fertility
(specifically ovarian function as assayed by steroid levels in saliva). The
working hypothesis is that, even with adequate diet, physical exertion can cause
the suppression of what we think of as normal female ovarian cycling, which has
been shown to be the case in female athletes in the U.S.A. The student will go
to Poland in the winter to collect data during that seasonal period to compare
already collected and analyzed materials from the summer, to see if seasonal
variation in ovarian function exists among the harder working women. The working
hypothesis is that their steroid levels will fluctuate with workload, while less
hard working women's levels will remain roughly the same.
