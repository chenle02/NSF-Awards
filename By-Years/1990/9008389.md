This research is concerned with the use of coupled vibrational stirring during
the growth of crystals. The technique is non- invasive, and works on the
principle of removal of unwanted species segregating at the growth interface,
thereby leading to improved uniformity of chemical composition of the growing
crystal. The research examines the fluid dynamic aspects of the technique and
its aplication to the Bridgman crystal growth process. Two specific areas are
being emphasized: (1) effects of the technique on rate of growth, shape of the
growth interface, chemical homogeneity, and formation of deffects, (2)
parametric study of the mass and thermal transport during crystal growth,
inclufing thermal gradients and thermal ossilations. THe materials systems being
studied incllude cesium cadmium chloride, cadmium telluride, germanium, and
silver gallium selenide.
