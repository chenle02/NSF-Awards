The fundamental scientific question to be addressed by this research is: "How
do different physical processes influence the response of sea ice to a heat flux
perturbation?" A new 3-D sea ice model for climate applications will be
developed. This research is motivated by large discrepancies between the
response of the 1-D thermodynamic and 2-D dynamic/thermodynamia models (both
widely used in climate simulations) to a surface heat flux perturbation such as
would arise from a CO2doubling. Uncertainties regarding important physical
processes occurring in sea ice still remain, and further observational data (and
analyses of existing data) are required. However, there is a sufficient amount
known about the individual physical processes and significant progress can be
made in sea ice modeling by synthesizing state-of-the-art understanding of the
different physical processes currently included in l-D and 2-D models into a 3-D
dynamic/thermodynamic sea ice model. The success of a single-cell
thermodynamic/dynamic sea ice model that was developed recently by the
investigator's research group is very encouraging in this regard. Building upon
previous and ongoing research activities, sea ice modeling for applications in
climate models will be developed as follows; a) improve a single-cell
thermodynamic/dynamic sea ice model and test it against field and satellite
observations b) conduct sensitivity studies using the single-cell model to
assess simplifications that can be made to improve computational efficiency c)
incorporate the processes deemed necessary in the single-cell studies into a 3-D
dynamic/thermodynamic sea ice model; d) assess if further simplifications of the
3-D model can be made to improve computational efficiency e) conduct basin-wide
simulations to assess model performance be comparing with observations and to
assess model sensitivity to heat flux and momentum perturbations. A product of
this work will be a comprehensive, modular, well-documented, and publi
clyavailable 3-D sea ice model that can serve as a tool for a variety of
researchers involved in polar applications, and that could provide an improved
sea ice component for regional and climate system models.
