The Sakun language documentation project will produce a grammar of the
endangered and undocumented Chadic language spoken by approximately 15,000
people at the UNESCO World Heritage Sukur Cultural Landscape. The Chadic
language family constitutes over half the languages of the Afroasiatic phylum,
but is the least studied. Many members of this family, including Sakun, are
giving way to Hausa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will place an
experienced fieldworker familiar with Sakun and with established ties to the
community on site to conduct the research. Sakun contains a number of
grammatical features that have yet to be described for languages of the Mandara
mountains. A detailed description of the language will fill a crucial gap in the
empirical base of knowledge about Chadic, and will contribute important evidence
for more general theoretical questions about language structure and use.
Building on the success of the pilot project conducted in May-August, 2008, a
broad range of audio and video texts will be collected and analyzed with the aid
of Sakun language consultants over a 5-month period. The collected texts will
provide the corpus for the grammar. The word lists collected will provide the
foundation for a future dictionary. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Time is short due to
increased contact and development resulting from UNESCO enlistment, which has
increased pressure to use languages other than Sakun. The long term goals of
producing a dictionary, grammar and texts, coupled with the training of Sakun
consultants participating in the fieldwork, will support the local community in
their ongoing initiatives towards maintaining their language and culture. This
project will build important institutional connections between the Sakun
Development Association, the University of Colorado, Nigeria's National
Commission on Museums and Monuments, UNESCO and the University of Maiduguri.
