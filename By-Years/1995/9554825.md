We propose to develop, test, and produce a set of educational modules that use
computer and network-based resources to teach science topics in an integrated
way to non-science majors. These modules will consist of hypertext documents
combining text, still images, video, and sound using state-of- the-art
technology. Two prototype units covering topics of a successful new two-semester
course taught at Syracuse University called Science for the 21st Century have
already been tested in the classroom. Advanced information-transfer technologies
such as video-on-demand and simulation-on- demand will be implemented to
increase active student involvement. New units will be developed to cover other
important science topics, such as evolution and imaging science phenomena. The
five modules will constitute an introduction to science for undergraduates who
are not science majors. Each module will be self-contained and easily
expandable; it will be portable since it will be delivered through the Internet
or in other formats, such as CD-ROM. There will be three phases of this project:
a) design and development of modules, b) implementation, testing, and assessment
of modules in our course, and c) dissemination of products and training of
teachers. Through this pioneering project, we hope to contribute to the process
through which revolutionary information technology connects with improvements in
our ability to educate our citizenry.
