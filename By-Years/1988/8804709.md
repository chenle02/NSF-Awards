We intend to make a strong contribution toward the achievement of a density
approaching 109 bits per square inch in high data rate mass storage systems
within the next decade. We are placing primary emphasis on principles and
techniques that will permit the increase of track density in longitudinal and
perpendicular magnetic recording, with a provisional goal of order 104 turns per
inch. The thrust of the work will be in magnetics, and will involve studies of
the edge- reading and writing properties of inductive and magnetoresistive
recording heads and of the edge definition of thin film media. The work will be
carried out as a collaboration between Washington University and Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories. The individual tasks to be undertaken have been formulated
jointly, based on the experience of the current NSF supported collaboration.
This collaboration is producing tools appropriate for the proposed work, and has
resulted in a more sharply focused approach. Theoretical work and interpretation
of experimental results will be concentrated at WU, fabrication of media and
devices, experimental facilities, and large scale computation will be provided
by HP labs for the WU principal investigator and graduate students and for the
HP engineers and scientists directly participating in the work.
