The Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU)Site at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Professor Gary Sulikowski and colleagues recruit a diverse group of 29 rising
junior and senior chemistry, biochemistry, and biology majors with high
potential for careers in the chemical and/or biomedical research for a 10 week
program. Students are co-mentored by collaborating faculty in the Chemistry
Department and the College of Medicine on one of 22 ongoing research projects.
Students broaden their horizons though a variety of scientific workshops and
symposia on small molecule probe and drug development, and participate in career
mentoring and professional development. Specially-trained graduate student
mentors provide scientific and professional guidance that is tailored to each
student's needs. Through extensive mentoring and authentic research experiences,
this program may impact students' understanding of the research process and the
interdisciplinary nature of contemporary chemical biology
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program at Vanderbilt University offers a
unique interdisciplinary training environment supported by existing
collaborations between faculty at the School of Medicine and in the College of
Science. Student participants make contributions in emerging areas under the
description of chemical biology including chemical genetics, nanomedicine,
chemical imaging, metabolomics, and synthetic biology while learning to work in
a team-science environment. This program creates a uniquely trained and highly
diverse student pool that meets the needs of the 21st century scientific
workforce.
