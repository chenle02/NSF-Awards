This award will support the initial phase of development of the ion microprobe
facility at the University of California-Los Angeles. During the two-year period
of this award a new high- transmission, high-mass resolution secondary ion
microprobe instrument is to be delivered and commissioned in the Department of
Earth and Space Sciences at UCLA. The purchase of the instrument was supported
by funds from UCLA, the William Keck Foundation, and the National Science
Foundation. The facility will be the first of its kind in the U.S. and will be
operated as a national facility available to researchers in geochemistry. The
new ion microprobe will have the capability to analyze very small regions of
minerals (on the order of ten micrometers) for precise isotopic ratios and will
be of particular usefulness in geochronology and geochemical tracer studies.
