9315112 Dappen Although stellar interior models have generally been in
satisfactory agreement with observation, the results of helio- and astero-
seismology are beginning to demonstrate their deficiencies. A major contributor
to these deficiencies is uncertainty in the equation of state used in
constructing the models. Improved calculations of the equation of state will be
performed to remedy this situation. The new equation of state formulation will
be valid over a wide range of conditions and will be useful for studies of the
interiors of planets as well as stars. ***
