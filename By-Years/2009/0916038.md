This project develops semi-supervised machine learning algorithms that are
practical, and at the same time guided by rigorous theory. In particular, the
project is developing learning theory that quantifies when and to what extent
the combination of labeled and unlabeled data is provably beneficial. Based on
the theory, novel algorithms are being developed to address issues that
currently hinder the wide adoption of semi-supervised learning. The new
algorithms will be able to guarantee that using unlabeled data is at least no
worse, and often better, than supervised learning. The new algorithms will also
be able to learn from unlimited amounts of supervised and unsupervised data as
they arrive in real-time, something humans can do but computers cannot so far.

This project has a number of broader impacts: (1) An open-source software will
be an enabling tool for new discoveries in science and technology, by making
machine learning possible or better in situations where labeled data is scarce.
Since the software specifically targets non-machine-learning-experts, the impact
is expected to be across the whole spectrum of science and technology that
utilizes machine learning. (2) It advances our understanding of the learning
process via new machine learning theory, which can be applied to both computers
and humans. (3) The proposal contains projects ideally suited to engage students
in computer science education and research.
