The mathematics and physics departments at Williams College are planning to
offer a REU program in theoretical physics: one on quantum information theory
and one on the structure of quasicrystals. Six physics majors will participate
in the program. The project will have a strong interdisciplinary focus: each
physics student, in addition to joining one of the physics groups, will also
participate in a group offered by the mathematics department, and mathematics
students will be included in the physics groups. At least two of the six physics
students will come from other campuses.
