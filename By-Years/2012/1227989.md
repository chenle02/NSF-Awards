Objective: The objective of this workshop is to bring together leading
scientists from around the world working at the forefront of 2D material
systems, to discuss the future and impact of non-graphene 2D atomic layers and
devices that can have both scientific and technological implications and
applications in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
workshop intends to provide an open forum for experts in the field to address
important aspects of a variety of 2D material systems and devices that could be
complimentary to graphene. Example of materials include boron nitride, di-
chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides that can
be exfoliated and isolated as stable single atomic layers. Studies on the
synthesis, chemical modification, device fabrication and testing and theoretical
explorations have been proposed on these stable 2D materials and the field is
about to see an explosion of activities in the near future. The workshop is
timely in addressing many of these issues and highlighting the impact this field
can have in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader
impacts are two-folds. First, this new and emerging technical area and the
ensuing interdisciplinary activities will be in perfect synergy with the already
well-established graphene science and will impact different fields of science,
chemistry and engineering in the next decade. Second, efforts in this area will
also positively impact learning in science and engineering disciplines. Graduate
students and post-docs will be undertaking important research assignments and
the workshop will set broad directions for future research and learning in this
area.
