This is a proposal to develop a curriculum and the necessary support materials
to introduce parallelism into the mainstream of undergraduate computer science
education. The material will first be organized into four modules: o Parallel
Computation: architecture, organization and hardware o Parallel Computation:
theory, algorithms and data structures o Parallel Computation: languages and
tools o Parallel Computation: applications These modules will then be used to
provide topics to be covered in six new courses on parallel computing. The
University will offer workshops for educators and industrial partners.
