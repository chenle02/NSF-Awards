The PI plans to explore the geometry of parameter spaces of sheaves
on&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves and surfaces. She wants to calculate some of
the&lt;br/&gt;intersection theory, in particular Verlinde numbers, on Gieseker
moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of semistable sheaves on a smooth surface.
These&lt;br/&gt;intersection-theoretic calculations will help the PI probe
whether the&lt;br/&gt;level-rank duality which is a feature of moduli spaces of
bundles on a&lt;br/&gt;curve, can be associated with moduli spaces of sheaves on
a surface as&lt;br/&gt;well. The author also wishes to explore some of the
representation theory&lt;br/&gt;of classical and affine Lie algebras on the
cohomology of Grothendieck&lt;br/&gt;quot schemes on curves, as well as on the
cohomology of Gieseker moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of sheaves on a surface, which
would result in a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the geometric structure of
these moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of vector bundles in
algebraic geometry parallels that of gauge &lt;br/&gt;field theories in physics.
The most familiar example of a gauge field is &lt;br/&gt;the electromagnetic
field. Higher-rank vector bundles correspond to &lt;br/&gt;nonabelian gauge
fields, which appear in high-energy physics, and &lt;br/&gt;mathematically are
organized as the entries of a matrix. Studying the &lt;br/&gt;geometry and
intersection theory on the moduli space of bundles, which is &lt;br/&gt;the goal
of this project, leads in particular to understanding the &lt;br/&gt;structure
of various integrals on the space of all possible gauge fields. &lt;br/&gt;These
integrals are mathematical expressions for scattering amplitudes of
&lt;br/&gt;various physical processes in high-energy physics.&lt;br/&gt;
