This workshop brings together representatives of undergraduate Bioengineering
curricula and others who have an interest and concern with the quality of such
undergraduate programs. The workshop is a 2.5 day event meeting an important
need to discuss common problems, identify future directions and study possible
avenues to significantly improve these programs. Participants in this workshop
will attend the first national meeting of this type since the first
undergraduate program was accredited in 1972. The steering committee, consisting
of four experienced Bioengineering Department Heads, are directing sessions
aimed at the curricula, the student, curricula resources and networking. As a
result of this workshop, all bioengineering departments in this country will
receive a copy of the report with recommendations for action and responsible
agencies or individuals. Participants will contribute about 32% of the award
toward the operation of this project.
