150 Years of Progress in the Mathematical Sciences An Event to Honor the
Sesquicentennial of Washington University in St. Louis

We will organize a conference, on the occasion of the Sesquicentennial of
Washington University in St. Louis, to celebrate 150 years of progress in the
mathematical sciences. The program will showcase seven distinguished scholars
from a broad range of mathematical subject areas:

Robert Bryant Duke University geometry R. R. Coifman Yale University wavelets,
applied mathematics John P. D'Angelo University of Illinois geometric analysis
Joseph J. Kohn Princeton University partial differential equations Blaine Lawson
SUNY at Stony Brook geometry Yves Meyer Universite de Paris harmonic analysis
Richard Schoen Stanford University geometry Elias M. Stein Princeton University
harmonic analysis

Our conference will feature both lectures for the public and specialized
seminars for mathematicians.

We see our activity as having two vectors: (1) to inform the public about
progress in the mathematical sciences and (2) to stimulate mathematical activity
in the mathematics departments at Washington University and nearby universities.
Our conference will not concentrate on achievements of the past 150 years. It
will look forward to prospects for the future.

A number of Washington University graduate and undergraduate alumni as well as
former postdocs have agreed to attend the event. We will make special efforts to
include mathematicians from the greater St.Louis area and across the country in
our conference. We are using direct mail, e-mail, and personal contacts to make
the mathematical community aware of our event. A significant portion of our
funding will be dedicated to subventing the travel expenses of women, young
people, graduate students, and under-represented groups.
