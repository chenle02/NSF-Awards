This research is concerned with investigations into the stability properties of
waves of certain partial differential equations, including the generalized kdV-
Burgers equation, the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the Becker-Doring
cluster equations. Numerical experiments will be performed to identify and to
clarify issues for theoretical study.
