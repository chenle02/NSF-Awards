The investigator proposes to assess the effects of substituent and solvent
variations on proton transfer reactions of organic molecules. For appropriately
substituted amines and carboxylic acids, he will conduct proton transfer
equilibrium measurements in selected solvents. Recently developed substituent
parameters (resonance, field/inductive and polarizability) will be used to
identify, quantify and analyze substituent effects on the basicities and
acidities of these molecules in various solvents. Comparison with reported gas
phase basicities and acidities will allow solvent attenuation factors (SAF) to
be determined. The SAF values will provide detailed insight into solvation
effects on each species involved in the proton transfer reactions. Attention
will then be focused upon the structurally more complicated alpha-amino acids
which possess both amino and carboxyl functional groups in a single molecule.
Substituent and medium effects on the acidity and basicity of substituted alpha-
amino acids will then be evaluated in terms of the information gained regarding
substituent and medium effects on the basicity of substituted amines and the
acidity of substituted carboxylic acids.
