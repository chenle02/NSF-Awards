Planning Grant for an I/UCRC in Grid-connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems
(GRAPES) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832538 University of Arkansas (lead
institution); Homer Mantooth &lt;br/&gt;0832467 University of South Carolina;
Roger Dougal &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University of Arkansas and University of
South Carolina propose a planning grant for a collaborative center "Center for
Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES)." Advanced grid
control is a critical issue facing the US power grid today, especially with the
increase in renewable power generation. The main objectives of the proposed
center are the following: to develop new advanced power electronic systems, to
develop the analysis tools for predicting and controlling the system behavior,
and to educate and train the qualified manpower who understand the system
benefits derived from the emerging technologies. The University of Arkansas has
recently developed a major test facility, which will be critical to a number of
the proposed projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will develop
leading-edge industry relevant research that will provide the basis for
effective development of the 21st century Future Grid. Continuing education of
working power and utility engineers will be an important part of the GRAPES
plan. The center will address the shortage of power engineers that is forecasted
to emerge by 2010 by educating graduates for power management industries.
Preliminary plans to add other universities to the proposed center, including
universities in other countries, will be finalized during the planning period.
Both the University of Arkansas and University of South Carolina have important
initiatives that will serve to broaden representation of all people groups in
this field. The center research theme will inherently have a major impact on
society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
