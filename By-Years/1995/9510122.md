ABSTRACT U of Cal San Diego Joe D. Godard CTS-9510122 The proposal is to
partially support an intensive two-day workshop on Material Instabilities in the
Fall of 1995. The workshop will bring together established experts to discuss
basic ideas and summarize recent theoretical and experimental advances in the
field. The workshop will cover solid metals and polymers, granular media and
particulate suspensions, and viscoelastic polymer solutions and melts. The
meeting will be just prior to the Society of Rheology Conference to assure wide
interest and increase attendance by interested researchers.
