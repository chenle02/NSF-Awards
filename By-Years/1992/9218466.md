Naturally induced electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric fields) are highly
dependent on both the vertical and horizontal conductivity structure of the
earth and are greatly influenced by three-dimensional features. Three-
dimensional magnetotelluric modeling algorithms are critical for correctly
interpreting observed data, but the current generation of algorithms are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. The objective of this proposal is
to develop three-dimensional magnetotelluric modeling algorithms that can model
fully inhomogeneous earth models and that are quick and can be run on modern
scientific workstations. The algorithm to be developed through this project will
use conjugate direction relaxation algorithms coupled with appropriate
preconditioners and a multiple scaling technique.
