9351733 Retelle A recording CTD, an acoustic sub-bottom profiling system, and a
magnetic susceptibility system are being used in the analysis of sedimentary
processes and stratigraphy in lacustrine and nearshore marine environments. The
addition of this equipment is allowing for development of field and lab
exercises in courses in Sedimentology, Glacial, and Quaternary Geology, in two
current field courses, and in faculty-student research. The CTD unit is being
used to monitor controls on modern sediment transport and deposition such as
salinity, temperature, and oxygen in the water column. The acoustic sub- bottom
profiler is an "echo-sounding" system that is being used to obtain detailed
continuous records of sediment fill in transects across the lake or marine
basins. The magnetic susceptibility system is being used to determine the
magnetostratigraphy of sediment cores recovered from the lakes and marine basins
which will subsequently provide a means for correlation of cores within the
basin. The new equipment is greatly strengthening our existing program of
environmental and paleoenvironmental studies by introducing students to modern
sedimentological and stratigraphical techniques that provide detailed
information on sedimentary processes and depositional environments. ***
