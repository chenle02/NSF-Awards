The extreme environment of the McMurdo Dry Valleys will be the focus of a Long
Term Ecological Research (LTER) project located approximately 100 km west of
McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The dry valleys are among the most extreme deserts
in the world. The perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams, and
extensive areas of soil within the valleys are subject to low temperatures, very
limited precipitation, and salt accumulation. The biological systems in the
valleys are relatively simple, with no vascular plants or vertebrates and very
few insects. Trophic interactions and biogeochemical nutrient cycles are largely
limited to microbial populations and micro-invertebrates. Species diversity and
abundance are low as would be predicted for such extreme environments. Despite
this simplicity, complex interactions among species and between the biological
and physico-chemical environment exist in the lakes, streams and soils.
Furthermore, interactions between various components of the ecosystem enhance
the overall productivity of the dry valley landscapes. All ecosystems are shaped
to varying degrees by climate and material transport, but nowhere is this more
apparent than in the dry valleys. The obvious effects of an extreme environment
coupled with the general simplicity of ecosystem structure makes the dry valleys
an ideal location to study these basic relationships. Two central hypotheses
will be the focus of this research: 1) The structure and function of dry valley
ecosystems are primarily controlled by physical constraints, and 2) The
structure and function of dry valley ecosystems are modified by material
transport. The dry valley LTER will address these hypotheses and the five core
areas of LTER research emphasis through a program of systematic environmental
data collection, long-term experiments, and model development. Efforts will
focus on the integration of the biological processes within and material
transport between the lakes, streams and terrestrial ecosystems comprising the
McMurdo Dry Valley landscape.
