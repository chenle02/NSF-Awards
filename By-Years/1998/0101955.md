The mission of "High Expectations for Learning Middle School Science (HELMSS)"
Pilot Local Systemic Change (LSC) is to nurture middle level scientific literacy
throughout Rhode Island. The project is managed by a partnership of Rhode Island
College, East Bay Educational Collaborative and ten partnering districts. The
$658,000 project is funded by $200,000 from the National Science Foundation and
$458,000 from Rhode Island College and the ten partnering districts.

Goals include building a foundation for middle level science systemic change,
developing cooperative relationships, building the capacity to implement
standards-based curricula to deliver effective professional development and to
provide materials support for all middle schools in Rhode Island.

HELMSS is conceptualized as a three-phase, six-year project. Phase 1,
"Initiating," began in 2000. Project personnel assessed teacher and system
needs, designed courses, examined science frameworks and existing curricula and
supported the piloting of middle school science instructional materials such as
FOSS for Middle School and NSRC's Science and Technology Concepts for Middle
Schools.

Phase 2, "Building Capacity," (2001-2003) is the HELMSS Pilot LSC. The primary
work of this phase is to build awareness of middle school science reform, forge
new partnerships among other districts in the region, and develop middle school
science teachers' capacity to lead their peers.

Eighteen teachers will participate in three 45-hour science content courses and
a seminar focusing on leadership, pedagogy, and curriculum. A principal seminar
will enable them to work effectively with teachers on-site to support standards-
based teaching and learning. By working closely with K-12 teachers and
administrators, higher education faculty will improve middle level teacher
preparation programs.

Phase 3, "Scaling Up," (2003-2006) is the HELMSS Comprehensive LSC. More than
100 Rhode Island middle level teachers will improve student performance in
middle level science. All teachers will implement NSF-funded instructional
materials and engage in professional development opportunities created during
Phase 2, "Building Capacity".
