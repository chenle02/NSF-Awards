9412618 Bloomfield The objective of the program is to develop an atomic and
molecular viewpoint for electronic ordering in solids through the study of
atomic clusters. By examining the electronic and magnetic properties of clusters
of atoms from two to five hundred atoms using beam and photodetachment
techniques, it is possible to examine the transition from simple atomic behavior
to that observed in bulk solids. % % % This project seeks an atomic and
molecular picture for electronic ordering in solids through the study of atomic
clusters. As they evolve in size from 2 to 500 atoms, clusters of atoms make a
transition from molecules to small solids or liquids. By studying the
development of magnetic and electronic properties in small particles, the
research will improve the understanding of the relationship between atoms,
molecules, and condensed matter. Such studies will provide understanding of the
molecular origins of metallic and nonmetallic behaviors as well as metal-
nonmetal transitions. ***
