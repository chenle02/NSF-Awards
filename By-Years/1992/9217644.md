The adsorption of macromolecules at interfaces of materials plays a key role in
many of today's critical technologies. Many advanced materials rely heavily on
the effects of polymer adsorption. For example. impact resistant polymer blends
for automotive applications and multilayer film laminates for "smart" barriers
and imaging technologies enjoy dramatically improved performance and/or
processibility when the interfacial regions are modified by polymer adsorption.
Materials technologies relying on colloidal suspensions (e.g. coating processes
and "slip-casting" for ceramics manufacture) utilize polymer adsorption for
crucial improvement in suspensions properties. Polymer adsorption also plays a
key role in biomedicine. For example, the adsorption of blood proteins is a key
issue in developing protheses, blood- contacting devices and drug-delivery
systems. In the separations field, adsorption chromatography, which relies on
competitive adsorption, is the most effective means of separating subtly
different macromolecules. The dynamic and nonequilibrium aspects of polymer
adsorption are largely unexplored. The principal goal of this work is to study
these aspects in model materials (linear homopolymers and diblock copolymers on
dielectric and metal surfaces) using a quartz microbalance, ESR, and
fluorescence spectroscopies and pattern photobleacing. These methods will probe
elementary dynamic phenomenal in adsorbed layers and will clarify the mechanisms
of adsorption. The results will provide a basis for controlling adsorption
processes crucial in application. The project involves close collaboration
between the Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at Columbia
University.
