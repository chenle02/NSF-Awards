This research will focus on the science and applications of ultra-small surface
structures. Scanning tunneling microscopy has been used to characterize both the
topography and electronic states of such structures. In-situ electrical
measurements are also carried out to gain an understanding of the transport
mechanisms along the interface. The particular systems currently under study
involve cobalt and palladium on Si(111) and the formation of their silicides. A
related project involves electrical transport measurements on quenched condensed
metal films.
