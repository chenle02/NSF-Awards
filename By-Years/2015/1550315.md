This action supports a research and training plan to broaden participation of
Native American Indians in biology. The project will support Dale C. Brunelle to
complete doctoral research at the University of North Dakota in the lab of
sponsoring scientist Dr. William F. Sheridan. The goal of the research is to
identify and characterize genes crucial for all aspects of maize embryo
development using functional genomics as well as traditional genetics and
molecular biology strategies.

Training objectives include genetics, developmental biology, and functional
genomics. Broader impacts include broadening the participation of Native
American Indians as independent investigators with Ph.D.s in the Biological
Sciences.
