9614108 Scholz The P.I.s propose an experimental study of the dynamics of
coupled mechanical and chemical processes that occur during the deformation and
diagenesis of sediments under hydrothermal conditions. During this award period,
the P. I.'s will begin experimentation on a system more typical of that which
occurs in natural sedimentary basins. A sand with the composition of a
2-feldspar granite will be deformed under hydrothermal conditions with a pore
fluid of aqueous brine with a composition typical of that found in sedimentary
basins. The hot fluid will be continuously circulated through the sample and
permeability measured as a function of time in order to study the precipitation
sealing mechanism discovered in our their work. Both closed and open fluid
systems will be studied. The pore fluids will be sampled periodically to monitor
its chemical evolution. The post-experimental material will be studied to
determine the dissolution and precipitation mechanisms, species and their
localization. ***
