Intense swarms of microearthquakes centered at mid-crustal depths are a near-
universal precursor to volcanic eruptions. However, such earthquake swarms do
not always culminate in an eruption, and the relationship of these noneruptive
earthquake swarms to magma ascent is often highly ambiguous, posing a
significant challenge to scientists in charge of assessing the likelihood of
eruptive activity indicated by swarm episodes. While such swarms, when they
occur beneath a known volcanic vent, are frequently attributed to stalled
intrusions of magma in the mid-crust, it is often equally possible that the
swarm represents tectonic processes accelerated by perturbation to fluid
circulation patterns in the mid-crust. This study aims to test the hypothesis
that analysis of changes in the orientation of principal stresses in the volume
of rock hosting a 'cryptovolcanic' earthquake swarm can provide a robust
indication of the proximal cause (magmatic or tectonic) of the swarm. Earthquake
swarms that are the direct result of midcrustal magma emplacement should be
accompanied by a systematic ~90ยบ change in the orientation of the crustal stress
field resulting from pressurization by the emplaced magma. In contrast,
earthquake swarms that are the result of tectonic processes should simply
reflect the orientation of the ambient stress field. We plan to test this
hypothesis through combined application of two independent stress field
analytical techniques (fault-plane solution analysis and shear-wave splitting
analysis) to seismic data comprising three recent cryptovolcanic earthquake
swarms along Alaska's Aleutian arc. The three case studies represent a range of
magmatic-tectonic affinities based on their location with respect to known
volcanic vents and other indicators of mid-crustal magma ascent recorded during
each swarm. Furthermore, we aim to show that a combination of independent stress
field analytical techniques is necessary to overcome ambiguities inherent in
each technique when assessing changes in stress produced by magma ascent. The
results of our study are intended to establish a framework for the analysis and
interpretation of future cryptovolcanic earthquake swarms in a volcano
monitoring context, and to provide insight into the nature and frequency of non-
eruptive shallow magma intrusions.
