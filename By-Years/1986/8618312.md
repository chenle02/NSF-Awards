The work proposed will attempt to take full advantage of information generated
by the recent Michoacan, Mexico earthquake of September 19, 1985, and
information potentially available from another large earthquake anticipated in
the near future in the adjacent Guerrero seismic gap and/or Omtepec seismic gap
to the southeast.
