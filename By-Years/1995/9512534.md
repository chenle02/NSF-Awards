With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tim White will purchase a four
wheel drive Toyota Landcruiser. Dr. White and his collaborators conduct NSF
supported paleoanthropological field research in the Middle Awash region of
Ethiopia. Because there are no roads in this region and the rugged nature of the
terrain, four wheel drive vehicles provide the only feasible means of ground
transportation. Given the multidisciplinary nature of the work and the number of
investigators involved, the team is critically short of field vehicles and this
purchase will allow the research to proceed in a more efficient manner. The
Middle Awash paleoanthropological research project is a multidisciplinary effort
whose objective is the elucidation of human origins and evolution. The research
area contains a succession of fossiliferous sediments spanning the last six
million years. Recent finds have established the Middle Awash as one of the
world's most important paleoanthropological areas and the project is devoted to
recovering evidence for early hominid origins and evolution and placing this
evidence in precisely controlled spatial, temporal and environmental contexts.
In 1992 and 1993 the team recovered evidence of the earliest hominid species
Australopithecus ramidus. In 1994 the site of Aramis yielded the oldest partial
skeleton of a human ancestor yet recovered. This research is clearly important
and productive. Purchase of an additional vehicle will make it more so.
