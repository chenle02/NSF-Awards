The Electronic Design Automation Workshop acquaints electrical engineering
faculty with the overall methodology used in the design of electronic circuits,
from the development of a behavioral model to its physical implementation. The
workshop provides an overview of currently available computer workstation
hardware and software for electronic circuit schematic capture, simulation,
component layout, circuit routing, fabrication and testing, together with
guidance for implementing these capabilities in the undergraduate curriculum.
