The purpose of this research is to analyze the macroeconomic consequences of
credit market imperfections and examine the channels through which monetary
policy affects real economic activity. In previous research, the authors have
identified episodes when the Federal Reserve undertook major shifts in monetary
policy out of a desire to reduce inflation. Because these policy changes were
essentially independent of real economic developments, they can be used to
disentangle the effects of monetary policy, and the mechanisms through which
those effects occur, from the effects of real economic developments on financial
variables. In particular, the information provided by these episodes will be
used to test between theories in which the impact of monetary policy on the
money stock is central to the transmission mechanism and theories in which it is
the impact on lending by financial intermediaries that are central. This
research is important because it will provide a better understanding of the role
that credit market imperfections may play in causing or contributing to
macroeconomic fluctuations.
