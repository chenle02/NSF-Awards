The value of time-series measurements for the understanding of natural
processes, the assessment of anthropogenic effects on the environment, and the
entire complex of issues referred to as "Global Change" is increasingly
appreciated. This proposal requests funds to continue time-series sediment
trapping at depths of 500, 1500, and 3200 m in the sargasso Sea for three years.
At this time, the 3200 m series extends over twelve and a half years. It is by
far the longest such series in existence, and its sampling site has been
designated the JGOFS time-series site in the North Atlantic. Together with the
hydrographic time series at nearby Station "S" and with the growing number of
JGOFS measurements, it provides an unequaled data base on physical, chemical and
biological variables in the open ocean. The series has demonstrated the
existence of temporal variability in the deep ocean, revealed the efficiency of
processes removing materials from the surface ocean, and the effects of those
processes on the chemistry and biology of the deep ocean. Continuation of the
Bermuda series will be an efficient route towards identifying the forcing
functions of carbon flux to the deep ocean, assessing decade-scale trends in the
efficacy of the "biological pump," and monitoring transport of antropogenic
components to the deep ocean.//
