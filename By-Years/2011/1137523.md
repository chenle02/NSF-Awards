Cheyney Universitys implementation project entitled - Building Excellence and
Access through Research (BEAR) - has the goal to increase the recruitment,
retention, and graduation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) students, as well as increase their admission rate to STEM graduate
programs or to the STEM workforce. This goal will be attained through three
interrelated activities: curriculum development and instrumentation, faculty
development, and student development. The project is based on the lessons
learned from the previous HBCU-UP implementation project, interventions and
strategies adapted from best practices described in the literature, formative
and outcome-based evaluation results, and the overall mission and priorities of
the University.

The expected project outcomes include: increased STEM student graduation rates;
increased use of technology in teaching and research by STEM faculty;
strengthened relationships and partnerships with other academic institutions and
industry partners; increased faculty participation in research, grant writing
and other scholarly activities; enhanced quality of undergraduate research
experiences; and increased numbers of students going to graduate school.
