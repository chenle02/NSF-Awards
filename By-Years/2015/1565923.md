The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by
Professor Oleg Ozerov, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Texas
A&M University. The work in the Ozerov group straddles the fields of organic and
inorganic chemistry. His group is exploring recently discovered catalytic
processes to introduce carbon-boron bonds into organic compounds, especially
around carbon-carbon triple bonds (alkynes) and double bonds (alkenes). The
importance of these borylated compounds is in their versatility as building
blocks for more complex organic molecules, with potential applications in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals and new materials. The project benefits from a
network of US and international collaborators, including those at primarily
undergraduate institutions (PUI). It also serves as a vehicle for broadening
participation in the Texas A&M graduate program and educating Texas A&M graduate
students about PUI careers and introducing them to secondary school outreach.

The primary goal of this project is the exploration of the full potential of
dehydrogenative borylation of terminal alkynes (DHBTA) and the reactions derived
from it. Successful implementation of the borylation processes of interest
requires development of molecular transition metal catalysts in a framework of
specifically designed supporting ligands. The project aims to gain fundamental
insight into the mechanism of iridium-catalyzed DHBTA and other borylation
reactions and the role of the supporting ligand in influencing reaction
outcomes. Other goals being investigated include 1) the cyclization reactions of
DHBTA products, alkynylboronates, and 2) the potential of the DHBTA-inspired
reactivity in catalysis of other C-H borylation reactions. Undergraduate
students are involved directly in the Ozerov group and via collaboration with
Prof. Larsen at Ithaca College and other PUI faculty. PUI collaborations
introduce Texas A&M graduate students to PUI opportunities and careers and draw
more undergraduates into research and into graduate education.
