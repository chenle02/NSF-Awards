conference on probability models to be held at the University of Colorado at
Colorado Springs, May 28-30, 1999. The purpose of the conference is to bring
together probabilists, physicists, and biologists with interests in this area of
research. This is currently an active area of research in probability, and these
models have applications to problems in physics and biology.
