The objective of this work is to develop a short-term (in the order of days) ice
hazard warning system for shallow, partially ice-covered waters. This system
will vastly improve the present capability of accurately predicting the movement
of individual ice floes, while retaining sufficient numerical efficiency so as
to facilitate its use on small, e.g., shipborne, computers. The formulation of
this system will couple the ice floe motion and the underlying water
circulation, and will apply the Eulerian-Lagrangian concept of transport
modelling to ice drift prediction. A detailed investigation of the range and
variation of the drag coefficients at the ice surface and bottom will be carried
out as well, so as to establish guidelines for estimating these coefficients
under a variety of environmental conditions and for a range of ice floe
characteristics.
