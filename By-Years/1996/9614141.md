National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering Retention of Under
represented Minority Students in Engineering: A Longitudinal Study at Seven
Sites Amount: $1,867,833 Submitted by NACME to establish the relative importance
of factors that will improve the retention of under represented minority
undergraduate engineering students. It further sought to clarify the factors
that contribute to the retention of particular ethnic or racial groups and which
apply to most or all minority engineering students. The study hypothesis was
that policy implications required change in the culture of institutions of
engineering. The goals of the study were to understand the processes of minority
retention, to provide information on the mechanisms that enable changes in
policies and practices, and to generalize to a broader policy for other
engineering programs in higher education.
