The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) and the
National Inventors Hall of Fame (NIHF) are interested in investigating ways to
get more high school students interested in the sciences. In this research there
is a need to know how a research university and its corporate partners motivate
students to consider their academic and career options in STEM through an
abbreviated research mentoring. In the program teams of students, teachers and
expert mentors will participate in an urban initiative pilot to understand,
document and assess how to create a long-term model for other school systems
across the United States. The program consists of a group of conferences that is
based on mentoring by professionals in
Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics (STEM) fields and by Inventors in the
same areas of expertise. Existing teachers involved in the Research Experiences
for Teachers (RET) program from the Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) around
the USP sites will bring their students to the conferences. The project provides
a collaboration between NSF's Engineering and Educational Directorates through
the Engineering Research Centers that involves teachers in the RET program and
the USP program.
