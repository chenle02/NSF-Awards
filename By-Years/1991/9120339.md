In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Robert Field of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will study
the high resolution electronic spectroscopy of various diatomic metal halides,
hydrides, oxides and dimers in order to test atom-in-molecule electronic
structure models. These models use atomic data to interpret, predict, and
interrelate diverse properties of diatomic molecules, affording insight and
identifying relationships between disparate observables. These models identify
key experiments which can further test them and help provide insight into
understanding more complex molecular systems. %%% In going from atoms to
diatomic and larger and heavier molecules, the electronic spectra become more
and more complex. The unravelling of electronic spectra provides information
about the fundamental structure of the atoms and molecules, and therefore it is
desirable to understand these spectra in detail. The current project will aid in
the understanding of the structure of diatomic molecules and will provide an
excellent framework for understanding more complex molecular systems.
