The California State University, San Bernardino proposal seeks to build capacity
for training students in cyber security and intelligence by developing a
national model curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It builds
upon its two existing Centers of Academic Excellence (Information Assurance and
Intelligence Community), leveraging a strong SFS Scholarship program,
partnership with a grant funded ATE center, regional community colleges, and the
relationship with five other California State Universities and three regional
universities that are part of the IC Center of Academic Excellence (IC CAE)
consortium. This grant enhances the SFS program by building a national model
curriculum that reflects the needs of the federal government as described in the
President's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. Major activities
include developing new curriculum, new courses, faculty workshops to improve
cross-disciplinary understanding, symposia and seminars to enhance student
skills and online curriculum modules. The new curriculum provides opportunities
for CSUSB students, regional articulation and transfer paths for regional
community colleges as well as opportunities for graduate work for students at IC
CAE consortium universities. In addition, the national model curriculum is
disseminated to the Intelligence Community and Information Assurance Centers of
Academic Excellence nationally. The NSF SFS Cybercorps program benefits from a
new pool of highly qualified students who meet the immediate needs of the
federal government.
