The objective of this project is to determine the engineering design
characteristics of equipment and devices for utilizing high-energy electrons to
decontaminate water and to reduce emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds
from power plant exhaust gases. This project addresses the influence of
temperature on the effects produced by the electron beam, determination of the
relative effectiveness of a dose delivered by pulsed delivery versus a constant
beam, and innovations in design of the acceleration tube and exit window for
reliable operation of electron beam devices. The proposal leading to this Phase
I award was submitted in response to the Small Business Innovation Research
Program Solicitation, NSF 89-30. The project addresses engineering design
considerations for devices to deliver electron beam radiation for potential
application in reducing emissions of pollutants in domestic and industrial
wastewaters and gaseous emissions produced by combustion of fossil fuels and
solid wastes.
