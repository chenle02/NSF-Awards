One of the classic model compounds for membrane ion channel permeation is
Amphotericin B, although the structure of the channel is still unknown. This
polyene macrolide is thought to form ion permeable pores in lipid membranes by
organizing into a barrel stave like arrangement of molecules with the polar
polyol region in the middle. However, the size and nature of the channels seem
to vary depending upon which sterol, ergosterol or cholesterol, is present in
the phospholipid membrane. The supramolecular structure of such channels may be
revealed by studying its ion permeation properties, especially the selectivity
sequence of related ions (e.g. the alkali metal series). The three basic goals
for this research are: 1)Obtain complete Group IA and IIA metal cation and
halide selectivity sequences for Amphotericin channels in different phospholipid
and sterol membrane environments, 2) Determine the temperature dependence,
aggregation state and molecularity of channel formation in these environments,
3) Using these data in conjunction with electrostatic molecular modeling
software, design consistent models for Amphotericin channel structures. %%%
Biological membrane ion channels play a central role in many processes from
neurotransmission to cystic fibrosis. This research should advance on knowledge
of Amphotericin channels and ion channels in general.
