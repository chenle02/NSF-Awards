The three goals of this project are to demonstrate a photomorphon (the basic
building block of a smart material that changes shape in response to light), to
interconnect photomorphons with light in optical fibers, and to use
interconnected photomorphons to create novel devices. Like the transistor, which
endows integrated circuits with complex functionality, photomorphons
interconnected with light will make photonic circuits with exceptional
capabilities. Each element within such a photomorphon network is both a sensor
and an actuator, making a morphing material that intelligently changes shape in
response to external stimuli. This project is working from the ground up to
develop new materials with enhanced photomechanical response, creating
photomorphons from the new materials, and integrating these to explore
applications enabled by morphing materials. Applications include tactile haptics
and sensors, ultra-smart active textiles, and adaptive stretchable electronics,
antennas and mirrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fruits of this project will be
the scientific and engineering foundations that enable technologies that are
unimaginable today. A tool-set is being developed to build photomorphon networks
and to understand how to program them. As proof-of-principle of a photomorphon
device, this project is collaborating with physicians to make a light-actuated
electrode positioner to be used for deep brain stimulation, which is currently
in clinical trials and hold great promise for treatment of neural diseases such
as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The focus on using light to bend fibers into
arbitrary space curves is an excellent paradigm for exploring the connections
with art, and connecting art with soft-matter science in a way that will attract
curious and creative young students to explore exciting new research embodying
the union of art and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly
funded by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of
Scientific Research.
