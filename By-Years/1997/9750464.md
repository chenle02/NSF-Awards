The primary objective of this project is to enhance student understanding of
computer science. This goal is being achieved by instilling in students an
appreciation for the conceptual links between the principles and techniques of
the varied areas within computer science. In particular, the project is designed
to (1) integrate courses to present material within the context of the
discipline as a whole, (2) design courses to focus student learning on realistic
projects that demonstrate a synergism of concepts and techniques from multiple
areas within computer science, and (3) deliver the content and projects of the
upper-division curriculum through a medium that supports collaborative team
learning. Many current approaches to undergraduate curricula seem to encourage
students' misperception of computer science as a loosely linked collection of
technical topics. Students do not experience, and often fail to appreciate, the
synergetic integration of topics that occurs during the analysis, design, and
implementation of practical computer science applications. *
