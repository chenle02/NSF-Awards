Plasmodesmata are plant-unique intercellular communication channels, which allow
plant cells to share their cytoplasm and build a multicellular or supracellular
organism. These fundamental structures are expected to play crucial roles in
orchestrating physiological and developmental programs as well as in controlling
systemic defense responses against pathogens. However, what molecular players
mediate the signaling through this unique communication system and how this
process is mechanistically controlled are not known. The focus of this project
is on gaining new insight into how the regulation of plasmodesmal signaling is
specifically linked to the onset or progression of programmed cell death induced
during developmental progression or by defense responses. By employing novel
molecular tools, this project will attempt to correlate the inhibition of
plasmodesmal function with controlled cell deaths. The two pressing questions
driving this project are: what is the role of plasmodesmal signaling in cell
death during defense response? How does a signal sensed at or transduced to the
plasmodesmata link to a cell death pathway? Successful outcomes of this research
project would provide compelling insights into the role of intercellular
communication in death and survival of plant cells. In addition, new discoveries
resulting from this project will also contribute to gaining a fundamental
insight into how different organisms have independently evolved to meet the same
goal of survival as multicellular organisms. As plasmodesmal function is
essential for both cell-to-cell communication and long-distance signaling in
plants, insights gained by this study could lead to the development of new
agricultural technology. For example, manipulation of plants for resistance to
the spread of pathogens could be achieved. This research project will actively
engage undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research and
scientific communications as well as K-12 students in firsthand cell biology
experience.
