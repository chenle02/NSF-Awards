The investigators will perform a detailed analysis of the transport process at
the magnetopause. The magnetopause is a complex boundary which separates the
shocked solar wind from the Earth's magnetosphere. Understanding the processes
by which plasma crosses the boundary remains a key problem in magnetospheric
physics. Since the reconnection process is the dominant means of transport at
the magnetopause, most of the effort will be directed at the understanding of
the role of collisionless tearing/coalescence instabilities as an onset
mechanism for reconnection and the resulting transport. By incorporating effects
such as velocity shear and thermal anisotropies, a much better understanding of
the reconnection process at the magnetopause can be gained. The primary tools
for the investigation are state-of-the-art kinetic numerical simulations and a
linear particle-in-cell code.
