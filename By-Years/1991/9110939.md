The aim of this project is to explore the ethical issues that arise when
computer decision procedures (which can also be thought of as computer models)
are applied in decisions affecting the public interest. These systems have
become pervasive; examples include air-traffic control, forest service planning,
military conflict simulations, and so forth. The development and use of these
models raise ethical issues, but these issues are often hidden by the technical
nature of the models. In this project, the investigators will examine two real
world cases; one will be computer decision procedures (CDPs) used in pension
plan decision making. This investigation will identify, classify, and analyse
ethical issues in the development and use of these models. It will search for
generic issues that are likely to be common to many models, and explore ways to
ensure that the ethical issues are addressed in the future. The analysis will
examine ethical issues that arise for the designers, the decision makers, and
the public. With respect to each group, analyses will be developed from the
standpoint of different ethical theories and frameworks, and their implications
for action will be identified. This process can lead to suggestions for change
in policy or procedure for modellers and modelling. For example, a concern for
paternalism and consent would lead to the recommendation that CDPs be developed
in ways that are transparent to clients or users. Results will include
presentations at professional society meetings and publications in appropriate
journals. The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and
Values Studies. The qualifications and track record of these investigators are
excellent. The project provides an important test for theories and methodologies
to study ethical issues in development and applications of computer models.
Results will be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups. The budget is
modest. The proposal is recommended for support.
