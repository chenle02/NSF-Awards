This proposal supports the National Center for Atmospheric Research to assist
the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)in preparing a written description of the
observation-nudging code data assimilation in the community version of the
Advanced Research Weather (ARW) Research Forecast model. The document might
suggest changes to the available configurations of the ARW. In addition, NCAR
will collaborate with ARL on a studey of the relative performances of the
observation nudging in the community ARW and the observation nudging in the 4DWX
system developed by NCAR Research Aviation Laboratory. The result will be a
written at least one journal article. Furthermore, a white paper will be
produced conveying best practices for applying the ARW for simulations at gride
intervals less than 1.0km.
