This project supports the dissertation research by Co PI Joshua Reuther. The
research supported will complete laboratory analyses on aeolian geologic records
of dune formation and deflation in the Tanana river basin in order to
reconstruct the terrestrial paleoenvironment during the end of the Pleistocene
and early Holocene. This research is particularly important in light of the
11,500 yo child creation found at the renamed Upward Sun River site in the
Tanana Valley in 2010. The reconstruction of the paleoenvironment will give the
archeologist working in this region a better sense of the social and cultural
adaptations that they are uncovering for this time period. In addition, the
research is important because it will give a more complete picture of how the
environment was changing during this critical period of human migration into
North America.
