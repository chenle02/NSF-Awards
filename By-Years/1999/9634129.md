9634129 Keene Chemical processes involving sea-salt aerosol in the marine
boundary layer (MBL) may significantly impact tropospheric oxidation processes;
sulfur cycling, radiation balance and climate; and trace-metal fertilization of
the surface ocean. Solution pH controls many chemical processes involving
atmospheric sea salt. However, acid-base relationships in sea-salt aerosol are
very poorly characterized; estimates of aerosol pH based on measurements and
models range from &lt;1 to &gt;9. Reliable measurements would provide critical
constraints in resolving the chemical cycling of halogens, sulfur, nitrogen, and
trace metals in the MBL. The specific research objectives of this study are: (1)
to sample size-segregated marine aerosol during discrete day and night periods
and to measure major ionic constituents; (2) to estimate sea-salt aerosol pH as
a function of particle size via direct measurements in the field using micro-
electrodes, measurement of total carbonate in extracts, and ion-balance
analyses; and (3) to assess related implications for aqueous- phase and multi-
phase chemical processes in marine air. MBL air will be sampled during late
April and May 1997 at the AEROCE station on Bermuda. Aerosols will be collected
with high-volume cascade impactors over discrete, 12-hour, day or night periods.
The concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, black carbon, and radon, the ionic
composition of bulk aerosols, the physical and optical properties of aerosols,
as well as site meteorological parameters will be measured concurrently during
all or some intervals, and routine air parcel trajectory calculations will be
available. ***
