In recent years it has become increasingly recognized that brominated compounds
(BrC's) in the atmosphere may play a significant role in stratospheric ozone
depletion, especially in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. Most of the
attention, to date, concerning stratospheric ozone depletion has centered on the
role of chlorinated compounds (ClC's), due in part to their relatively high
concentrations in the troposphere, now totaling well over a part per billion
(mole ratio). One of the greatest challenges associated with atmospheric studies
of the BrC's is related to their relatively low concentrations in the
troposphere, typically in the low or sub parts per trillion range. The BrC's are
therefore relatively difficult to detect and quantitatively analyze in
atmospheric samples that invariably contain a large excess of other organic
compounds, including the ClC's. In this research, a new instrument, will be
applied to the analysis of BrC's in atmospheric samples. This instrument is
called the SiF4-doped Photodetachment-Modulated Electron Capture Detector
(SiF4-PDMECD) and has been shown to provide sensitive responses to BrC's, but
does not respond to ClC's or other organic compounds. In this project, the
SiF4-PDMECD will be evaluated specifically for the analysis of BrC's in the
atmosphere and will thereby provide the field of atmospheric chemistry with an
additional and very possibly a superior analysis capability for future
investigations of the atmospheric chemistry of brominated compounds.
