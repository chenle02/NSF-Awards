This NSF award supports the Midwest Topology Seminar, from 2017 to 2020. This is
a continuation of a previously supported regional conference series in algebraic
topology that meets three times per year and rotates between universities in the
Midwest and Great Lakes areas. The next two meetings are at Wayne State
University (October 2017) and Northwestern University (Winter 2018). The Midwest
Topology Seminar has been running continuously since the early 1970s, with at
least one of the yearly meetings held in Chicago, the hub of the network.
Algebraic topology has always been broadly construed to include homotopy theory,
algebraic K-theory, geometric group theory, and high dimensional manifolds; more
recently the series has explored connections to algebraic geometry,
representation theory, number theory, low-dimensional manifolds, and
mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest Topology Seminar is a
long-standing, reliable, low-key, and low-cost way for participants to keep up
with the field. The Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic
topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are
augmented with featured speakers from around the country. The audiences are
always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad
range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a
vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new
ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians
and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research. This award
supports travel expenses for approximately fifteen participants to each meeting.
Support goes to graduate students and also to research mathematicians with
limited funds from other sources. Conference web site is at
