9316137 Bjarnason This research is to demonstrate that melt flow patterns can be
determined seismically by imaging the upper mantle beneath the mid- Atlantic in
northern Iceland by deploying an array of 30 PASSCAL seismic instruments for 9
months. Oceanic crustal material is created by the pressure-release melting of
upwelling mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges; however, the details of the mantle
flow pattern and the processes by which melt segregates and ascends to crustal
levels are poorly understood. From surface wave phase velocities and body wave
travel time delays, the researchers will construct images of compressional and
shear velocity in the upper mantle down to about 150 km. The objectives are: 1)
to determine if mantle upwelling beneath the ridge is narrowly or broadly
focused and to explore the effects of the Iceland hotspot, 2) to determine if
retained partial melt exists within the shallow mantle beneath the ridge, 3) to
define the depth range of any zone of retained partial melt, and 4) to
distinguish among theoretical mantle flow and melt transport models on the basis
of the width of the zones of upwelling and melt generation. ***
