The combined efforts of field linguists will not be sufficient to document the
thousands of languages that are expected to disappear by the end of this
century. Creating a lasting record of these disappearing languages is essential
since all languages provide clues about how humans learn and process language.
Language description and analysis could be facilitated by deploying
computational analytic techniques on existing and ever growing repositories of
digital audio and video language data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
organize a workshop bringing together researchers in speech and language
technology, researchers on endangered languages, field linguists, and language
repository archivists to help drive the development of this computational
technology. The workshop participants will discuss how Shared Task Evaluation
Campaigns (STECs) can promote the development of speech and language technology
for documenting endangered and low-resourced languages. Designed to enable
comparability across systems and leverage the costs of data preparation, Shared
Task Evaluation Campaigns operationalize research problems as tasks that are
open to participation by researchers with uniform data, task specifications,
evaluation metrics, and open reporting of results and system
methodologies.Experience with STECs for speech and language technologies has
shown that they have helped standardize shared data, create useful evaluation
tools, and provide venues for publishing, comparing, and discussing results.
Participants will evaluate both the language archive data available for
computational processing and the types of STECs that should be undertaken. The
results of the workshop can have long term impacts through acceleration of
endangered language documentation, enhancement of digital language archives, and
development of novel computational techniques for low-resource languages.
