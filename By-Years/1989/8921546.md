Cavity QED investigations are being continued into the properties of atoms
confined to a very narrow space between two plane mirrors. In this situation
energy levels and radiation rates are modified, sometimes dramatically, by the
interaction between the atom and the metallic boundaries. It is now planned to
measure spectroscopically the van der Waals shifts of the levels when atoms are
placed at well defined locations within the channel and subsequently excited
into a highly polarizable Rydberg state. The position is manipulated using the
force produced by a standing wave of laser light; the atoms are trapped in the
lowest vibrational quantum states of the optical potential wells centered on the
nudes of the standing water.
