9522189 Tekula The research conducted under this award will investigate a
critical molecule detector for single biological cells. This non-invasive, real-
time, high resolution device employs stimulated Raman scattering to measure the
concentrations and temporal evolution of several different molecular species.
The Raman scattering diagnostic technique offers an attractive alternative to
the often used laser induced flourescence. It allows the measurement of multiple
species even in aqueous solutions, and signal enhancement is possible by
utilizing resonance Raman techniques. The proposed detection device has
applications in many fields for the continuous measurement of several molecular
concentrations in small samples. This includes virus and cholesterol
measurements, blood gas analysis, drug monitoring and manufacturing, and
possibly environmental analysis.
