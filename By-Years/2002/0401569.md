ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0401569&lt;br/&gt;James Hook&lt;br/&gt;Oregon Health &amp;
Science U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium on Software, Science &amp; Society
is one of three events honoring the distinguished career of Professor Richard B.
Kieburtz. The symposium consists of a full days worth of activities directed
towards creating a consensus on the role of software in society. The highlight
of the symposium is a series of internationally respected researchers addressing
this topic. The symposium will capitalize on the gathering of the speakers in
one place, at one time, speaking at an open symposium, to facilitate the
reaching of a consensus about challenges for the software research community in
the next decade. The symposium program includes directed focused discussion on
particular topics, and a final wrap up discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
