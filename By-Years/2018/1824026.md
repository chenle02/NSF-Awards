Title: Strategies of Influence and Persuasion in Legal Networks

Abstract:

Numerous participants are involved in the process of interpreting and shaping
human rights law, including judges, court staff lawyers, policymakers, and
advocacy organizations. By analyzing strategies of influence and dialogue that
shape human rights law, this project will show how judgements at a human rights
court are just one point in a larger process of influence and communication
among several legal actors. Showing how legal decisions emerge through
interactions among these different legal actors offers important information
with respect to human rights law.

This project will focus on how the social interactions across a diverse network
of legal actors shape the influence of the European Court of Human Rights, which
draws together judges from 47 Council of Europe countries, hundreds of registry
lawyers, and tens of thousands of individual applicants. The project will track
strategies and concepts that these legal actors use to influence each other in
processing applications, litigating cases, and delivering and executing
judgements. In a mixed-methods study, the project will include interviews,
participant observation, interactive mapping, and analysis of legal texts and
judgements to analyze the mechanisms of language framing and circulation through
which legal concepts become authoritative. By researching how social actors
influence the scope and direction of international law while maintaining the
integrity of domestic legal commitments, the project's findings will offer
insight within a comparative legal framework of human rights law.
