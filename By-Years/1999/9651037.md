The Department of Chemistry is revising its entire upper-level undergraduate
physical chemistry curriculum and is introducing a new Computational Chemistry
Laboratory Course to be required of the 60 to 100 chemistry and biochemistry
majors graduated each year and to be elected by a number of chemical engineering
and cellular/molecular biology majors. The object of this new course is to
acquaint the students through hands-on experience with three major areas of
computational chemistry, namely the use of symbolic mathematics programs in
manipulating and graphing analytic relationships, the use of semi-empirical and
ab initio electronic structure programs in studying molecular energies and
structures, and the use of molecular modeling programs in further characterizing
molecular structures and reaction processes. To this end, this project provides
support for the acquisition of a set of 21 Macintosh PowerMac computers and the
necessary software packages. The equipment is being housed in newly renovated
laboratory space in the Science Learning Center (located in the Chemical
Sciences Laboratory) and Ethernetted to the Departmental Computing Facility with
its high-end workstations and electronic structure software. Through their
computational chemistry laboratory experiences, the students can gain skills and
insights that enhance their lecture course and conventional laboratory studies
of physical chemistry.
