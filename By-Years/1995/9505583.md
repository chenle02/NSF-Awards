Proposal: 9505583 PI: Ker-Chau Li Institution: UCLA Title: High Dimensional Data
Analysis Abstract: The research concerns the development of new statistical
methods for exploring nonlinearity in high dimensional data. Two tools, sliced
inverse regression (SIR) and principal Hessian directions (PHD), have been
developed based on a dimension reduction theory which underlies the
investigator's approach in the high-Dimension area. To continue this line of
research, the investigator studies several new problems which have more
complicated structures than the basic regression formulation. The research
topics include the generalization of SIR/PHD to multiple outcomes, development
of PHD-based tree-structured methods, study of visualization for
mathematical/physical/computer models, and analysis of nonlinear time series
data. The research takes a combination of dynamic graphics, computation, and
statistical theory to study high dimensional data. Dimensionality is one of the
most challenging problems in maly scientific areas today. Immediate applications
of these research results include analysis of longitudinal data in biomedical,
socio-economic, or industrial studies, and groundwater modeling in hydrological
studies.
