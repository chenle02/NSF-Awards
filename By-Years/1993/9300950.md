This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of how intra-elite competition and alliances in the state
of Pernambuco in the early 19th century influenced the development of the
Brazilian state. The research involves documentary research in local and
regional archives in Brazil. Results will be analyzed in terms of competing
theories of state formation. This research will contribute to a rapidly-
developing literature on the emergence of the modern nation state, providing
data on how a centralized state emerges partly as a result of political
competition and pressure from below, rather that simply through vigorous
imposition from above. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
