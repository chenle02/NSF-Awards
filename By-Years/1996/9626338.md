This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
addresses a broad range of topics in ultra high vacuum surface chemistry carried
out in Professor Weinberg's laboratory at the University of California-Santa
Barbara. The use of atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen sources to probe the
details of Eley-Rideal reactions at well characterized Group VIII metal surfaces
is a major focus of the work. Vibrational spectroscopic characterization of
intermediates on these surfaces is enabled by the development of digital
processing methods for resolution enhancement in electron loss spectroscopy.
Time resolved vibrational spectroscopy is used to quantify the process of
adsorption assisted desorption of small molecules on these transition metal
surfaces, and molecular beam methods are used to probe the flux dependence of
adsorption of oxygen and other small molecules. This work provides the knowledge
base necessary for the design and understanding of important catalytic and
electronic device processing technologies. The detailed study of the mechanisms
of surface reaction chemistry on platinum, iridium, and ruthenium surfaces forms
the focus of this work. A combination of experimental method development and
examination of model reaction systems provides a clearer understanding of the
mechanisms of surface reactions and the intermediates involved. This knowledge
proves useful in the design and implementation of catalytic and electronic
device manufacturing processes.
