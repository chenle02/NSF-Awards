Diagenesis of Young and Shallowly Buried Sands This research will study the
diagenesis of sands that are young and shallow, at depths from 0 to 4000 feet.
It will examine Quaternary and Tertiary sands from the Gulf coast, and document
changes in texture and mineralogy with shallow burial. The purpose is to
document changes in texture and mineralogy that take place in sands during
shallow burial and under conditions where pore fluids have ranged from meteoric
to hypersaline. Modern samples will be used as a reference for Pleistocene
samples, which will be examined in thin section for matrix and pore space.
Compaction effects will be studied using an image analyzing system.
