M. Gross plans to study the geometry of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau
manifolds. This will be done from the perspective of an algebro-geometric
version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture introduced by M. Gross and B.
Siebert. Associated to certain sorts of large complex structure limit
degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds one can define a dual intersection
complex, which is an affine manifold with singularities. Conversely, given an
affine manifold with singularities, it is possible to build the degenerate fibre
of such a degeneration, along with the structure of a log scheme. Gross first
plans to complete the correspondence between affine manifolds with singularities
and large complex structure limit degenerations of Calabi-Yau varieties by
showing that these log schemes can be smoothed. Furthermore, Gross plans to
compute invariants of these smoothings in terms of structures on the affine
manifolds. One expects Hodge numbers, and more importantly, variations of Hodge
structure, can be calculated directly from computations on the affine manifold.
The ultimate goal will be to compare these results with calculations of Gromov-
Witten invariants for the mirror, thereby eventually providing an explanation
for mirror symmetry.

The work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory and
geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point particle
with a small loop of string, moving through space-time. To make string theory
compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional. Since
space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions to be a
very small `curled up' geometric object. These geometric objects are called
Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable
association between completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain
calculations extremely difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be
completed by performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on a
different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.
Since this time, many geometers have been trying to understand the mathematics
behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross hopes to give
mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon of mirror symmetry.
