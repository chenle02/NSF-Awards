Andrew Casson will study aspects of the geometrization problem for 3-manifolds.
He will attempt to improve the "Strong torus theorem" to conclude that
irreducible 3-manifolds which contain essential singular tori either contain
essential embedded surfaces of genus one or are Seifert fibered spaces. His
method is related to one used by Tukia. He will also attempt to find good usable
conditions on a 3-manifold guaranteeing the existence of representations of the
fundamental group in PSL2(C). In particular, he will seek methods of finding
hyperbolic or other geometrically interesting representations. Robion Kirby will
continue studying Witten's program for defining an invariant of framed
3-manifolds via an "average" of the Chern-Simons invariants for SU(n) valued
connections. He will also work on the diffeomorphism classification of smooth
4-manifolds obtained by "Gluck twists" on imbedded 2-spheres, or a
generalization to immersed 2-spheres with one double point. Yakov Eliashberg
will study invariants of Legendrian knots. All three projects concern different
aspects of 3-dimensional manifolds, which are natural geometric objects
describable locally by 3 independent coordinates. The structure of 3-manifolds
has relevance to other parts of mathematics inasmuch as such manifolds occur as
solution sets of ordinary or differential equations. Relevance to physical
theories is also evident.
