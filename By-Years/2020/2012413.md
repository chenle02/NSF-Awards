It is well known that protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called
quarks and gluons, which make up the substructure of protons and neutrons. The
goal of this project is to make measurements of the position and momentum
distributions of the quarks and build a three-dimensional map of quarks in the
nuclear medium. This knowledge provides the basis of our understanding of
nuclear matter in terms of the dynamics of their internal constituents. Using
this information, theoretical models show how the constituent parts of the
proton and neutron can be used to build up their fundamental intrinsic
properties, such as their overall size and quantum mechanical spin. This award
will support two undergraduate students each year as they learn both hardware
and software skills that will prepare them for careers in the STEM workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project engages the PI and Duquesne University's
undergraduate students in research aimed at the study of parton distributions
using semi-inclusive production of pions and kaons with CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab.
Data taking and analysis for unpolarized and polarized deuterium and hydrogen
targets are part of this project. In addition, the PI will lead the efforts in
software development, characterization, reconstruction, and calibration as the
analysis coordinator of a second hybrid ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH)
which is under construction. This detector will identify in the momentum range
of 3 to 8 GeV/c. Undergraduates play an integral part in this project, which
provides them with opportunities to further their training and education outside
of the classroom. This will include: gaining experience in the design, assembly,
and testing of modern particle physics detectors, high tech fast electronics,
and scientific data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
