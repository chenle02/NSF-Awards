This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in
support of the 39th Northeast Bioengineering Conference is cofunded by the
Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, and Environment,
Health, Safety of Nanotechnology program, both in the Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This conference is a
multidisciplinary forum for dissemination of advances in biomedical engineering,
including biomaterials, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. This
meeting is expected to enhance the interactions at all levels, and facilitate
sharing of knowledge across interdisciplinary barriers. The conference serves as
an open forum for discussion of new directions, ideas, and approaches in
research and education. Additionally, this is expected to provide a setting to
reinforce existing contacts and in establishing new collaborations. Sessions
will be organized covering a broad range of topics related to
Biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The conference will serve as
a forum for students to present their research and provides them an opportunity
to discuss potential career choices with scientists from academia, government,
and industry. The conference organizers plan to broadly disseminate the
scientific presentations at the conference by electronic media.
