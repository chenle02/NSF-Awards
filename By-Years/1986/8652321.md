Wisconsin Public Television Network (WPTN) will develop the Science/Technology/
Society (S/T/S) project which will emphasize the presentation of scientific
concepts in a context of real-world problems that are social/technical in
nature, in order to teach the mutual dependence of science and society. The
pilot phase of the project was partially funded by NSF. This proposal will work
towards the completion of the Secondary Grades Science S/T/S Project whose
design is to enable teachers to incorporate essential instruction about the
interrelatedness between science/technology/society in secondary grades
curricula. The project includes production and evaluation of classroom video and
computer materials for students and of video programs for in-service teacher
training accompanied by printed materials. The video programs will use the
facilities of WHA-TV in Madison, Wisconsin. The project will draw on the skills
of specialists in the design and creation of instructional media, subject-matter
experts, and other educators. The project director, Nancy Bauer, will coordinate
the efforts of these individuals, the agencies, and organizations they
represent. Ms. Bauer is well qualified to serve in this capacity. WPTN's project
strongly addresses the goals and scope of the Instructional Materials
Development Program in establishing basic science literacy for the general
student through an alternative method delivering instructions.
