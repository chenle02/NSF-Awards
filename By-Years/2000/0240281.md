The World Summit will be the largest summit in UN history. This global summit is
a follow-on to the1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio
de Janeiro. The WSSD will be in Johannesburg 26 August-7 September and over 100
heads of state are expected to attend.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A key U.S. message
for the WSSD is the importance of concrete action on sustainable development. To
reinforce this message, the Smithsonian Institution is developing an exhibit
that showcases projects and activities demonstrating the key U.S. themes for
WSSD, interweaving governance, finance, science &amp; technology, and
partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Smithsonian has taken the leadership in
the USG interagency process on developing and coordinating the US exhibit at the
World Summit. Federal Departments and agencies are co-funding the U.S. presence.
NSF co-funding will provide supplies and services necessary to develop, install,
and maintain the joint U.S. exhibit and to support the NSF involvement at the
Exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;
