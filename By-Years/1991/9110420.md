HeII (superfluid helium), the low temperature phase of liquid helium existing
below 2.2 K, has numerous technical applications. Because of its unique
properties, namely extremely high heat conductivity and in some cases vanishing
viscosity, He II is the preferred coolant for a variety of low temperature
devices, including superconducting magnet systems and space based cryogenic
facilities. An understanding of basic HeII heat transfer mechanisms is important
for these applications. This project addresses this need through analytical and
experimental studies of HeII in parallel and counterflow heat exchangers. The
analytical work consists of obtaining solutions to the HeII energy equation
applied to two forced flow HeII channels thermally coupled by a heat exchange
surface. Experimental measurements are required to benchmark the analytical work
as well as to provide quantitative values for physical parameters, particularly
the Kapitza conductance. The primary measurements consist of temperature
profiles within the flowing HeII contained on both sides of a
parallel/counterflow heat exchanger. Heat exchanger length-to-diameter ratio,
fluid velocity and bath temperature are varied to obtain a range of parameters
necessary for developing correlations. Although the immediate goal of the work
is a comparison of analytical results with experimental measurements, a
secondary purpose is to develop a design procedure for HeII parallel/counterflow
heat exchangers using correlations or other empirical expressions derived from
our fundamental studies.
