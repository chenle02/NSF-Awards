The Archaeogastropoda appeared in the Late Cambrian and rapidly radiated to
encompass a wide range of morphologies. These included most of the morphotypes
associated with basic gastropod lifestyles. A minor morphologic radiation
occurred later with changes in shell ornamentation. Archaeogastropods thus offer
multiple character types and morphologic levels for describing changes through
time in the patterns of morphology. This project includes both phylogenetic and
morphometric analyses of Early Paleozoic archaeogastropods. These approaches
will be used to compare typical morphological distances of differences between
sister species in three different morphospaces: 1) one based upon twelve "basic-
shell" characters appearing at the group's origin; 2) one based upon shell
ornamentation, which did not appear in most subgroups until the Late Ordovician;
and 3) one based upon character complexes thought to have a basic functional
utility. Using ornamentation to compare the temporal patterns of clade expansion
in both "early" and "later" shell characters will provide information on whether
inter- and intraclade variation depend more on the time in which the clade
radiated (i.e., extrinsic factors) or upon the ages of the character states
distinguishing them (i.e., intrinsic factors). Examining phylogenetic patterns
in a morphospace of character complexes will describe the archaeogastgropod
radiation in a biologically more meaningful manner and also provide an
additional morphologic "level" to test for non-random sorting of clades.
