Failure-proof performance of tied-back walls during earthquakes is critical to
maintaining transportation corridors for emergency vehicles. Yet very little
research has been done on the seismic response of tied- back walls. More
importantly, there are no formalized procedures for the seismic design of tied-
back walls. Possible failure modes have been identified through computer finite
element studies: what is lacking is observation of the performance of actual
tied-back walls during moderate to large earthquake shaking. During the Whittier
Narrows earthquake, a number of tie-back walls for building excavations - mostly
temporary - were subjected to moderate earthquake shaking. Because of temporary
nature of these walls, the information is available for a relatively short time,
after which the data is lost. In addition, eye witness accounts of the
excavation response may provide information for interpreting the data. The
objective of this research is to collect data on tied-back wall response during
the Whittier Narrows earthquake in order to compare the field observation of the
performance of the tied-back walls to the results of numerical analyses. This
will help validate the analytical models for the performance and damage of tied-
back walls to earthquake loading, and it will also help to determine the
dependence on wall geometry, soil profile, location of the anchors, tieoff
loads, and ground motion. Each case history is being documented in sufficient
detail to facilitate comparison between sites with the numerical studies.
