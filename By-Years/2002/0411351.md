Chemistry (12) An Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AA) is being used as the
centerpiece for developing a research project based chemistry lab curriculum
that has been introduced into the third quarter of General Chemistry. The AA is
being used by students to study the phytoremediation of heavy metals by plants
as a means for environmental detoxification. Analytical methods from both the
educational and research literature are being adapted for use in the project.
Using the AA, General Chemistry students are conducting ongoing research
projects that are providing them with experience with the scientific method and
that are allowing them to experience the interconnectivity between chemistry and
biology. An artificial marsh is being utilized by students to research the
effects of various physical parameters on the uptake of heavy metals by plants
and to screen local marsh plants for their ability to hyperaccumulate heavy
metals. After incorporating the AA and the research studies into the General
Chemistry lab curriculum, the project will be expanded to include faculty who
teach in the areas of physical science, biology and geology at both the college
and local high schools.
