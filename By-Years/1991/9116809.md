A database system for computer vision must be able to manipulate data in
numerous forms, running a full spectrum from values of scalar features, through
arrays of light intensities, to complex linked data structures representing
networks of partially and tentatively recognized shapes and models. This work
entails the design and partial implementation of a prototype vision database
system based on a hierarchical, relational data structure that can handle a wide
variety of types of data. The design also includes a novel visual user interface
that allows the user to examine and comprehend the entities being processed. In
this work, the organization and access functions for the database system are
developed through a study of the kinds of structures and operations used in two
different vision application domains: robotics and medicine. Both primitive
access functions and some higher-level vision operations are implemented in the
prototype system. The flexibility and efficiency of the system are evaluated for
vision algorithms being developed in robot vision and medical image processing
research projects. The result will be a general scientific database system that
can be accessed via both graphical and application program interface and that
will satisfy the needs of computer vision systems.
