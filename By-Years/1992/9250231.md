A UV/VIS scanning spectrophotometer is being purchased for use primarily by
introductory chemistry students. General chemistry students are learning to
conduct spectrophotometric quantitative analyses, spectral analysis, kinetic
assays, computer controlled operations, and computer database investigations.
The instrument is used by students in organic chemistry to study geometric
isomerism and reaction mechanisms.
