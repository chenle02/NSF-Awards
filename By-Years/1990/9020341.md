This proposal is to develop methods for controlling a device that extends human
mechanical ability. The "extender" is a sleeve that fits over the arm of an
individual, and that can be controlled by weak voluntary movements. The
"extender" provides amplification so that the weak signals may be used to
control a powerful orthosis. The thrust of the proposal is to build a computer-
driven mechanical simulator for developing algorithms for controlling the device
in spite of wide variations of the characteristics of the human arm. Realistic
measurement will be used to derive input-output relationship for the human arm;
these measurements will then be used as reproducible representations of the
living system for exploring different control algorithms. If successful, the
research will have application in restoring function to some individuals with
movement disorders (including partial paralysis), and in the design of human-
controlled robots.
