Discrete geometry and topological combinatorics are important areas of
mathematics. They highlight connections between different areas of mathematics
in novel ways. The research in these subjects has applications in computer
science, such as in search algorithms and optimization. This award will support
the PI's research to develop new mathematical methods to solve problems on the
boundary of combinatorics and topology. Problems in discrete geometry are often
easy to state, and a good subject for popularization of mathematics. The PI will
aim at involving undergraduate students in his research.

The research of this project will focus on three main types of open problems.
These type of problems highlight different aspects of discrete geometry and are
multi-disciplinary; involving combinatorics, topology and linear algebra. As
they are closely related, progress in one area will benefit the research in the
others. The first kind of problems, partitions of measures, is a cornerstone of
the interaction of equivariant topology and discrete geometry. The PI will focus
on the effect of additional geometric constraints to classic problems in the
field. The second is Tverberg theory, which focuses on understanding the convex
hulls of finite sets of points from a combinatorial point of view. The PI has
extended the linear-algebraic methods used for this area, and aims at working on
topological versions of recent results. The third kind focuses on understanding
the intersection structure of finite families of convex sets in Euclidean
spaces. The work will focus on continuing a recent trend of developing
quantitative versions of classic results, such as Helly-type theorems. Several
of these problems have as additional motivation applications in computer science
and other areas of mathematics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
