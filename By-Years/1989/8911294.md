This proposal aims to provide a software engineering laboratory in its computer
science department so that the PI can conduct intensive research in areas of
software engineering. The focus will be on an investigation of software
engineering tools that are appropriate for students studying software
engineering courses. The resulting competitive proposal will center on research
for evaluating the appropriate software engineering tools for the laboratory.
