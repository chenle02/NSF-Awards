The ability to adjust to changes in the external light environment is especially
important to plant survival because, unlike animals, plants depend on sunlight
for photosynthesis and they do not have a neuromuscular system which allows them
to move to a more optimum light environment. Plants therefore possess the unique
light-sensing photoreceptor molecule phytochrome which enables them to perceive
the frequent fluctuations of intensity, direction and spectral quality of light
in their environment. Experiments outlines in this proposal seek to provide new
information on phytochrome structure and to address the hypothesis that
phytochrome is a light-regulated enzyme. The long tern goal of these studies is
to define the structural basis for phytochrome function. For a number of our
studies, we will; employ the unicellular green alga Mesotaenium caldariorum as a
model system. Identification of the components of the phytochrome signal
transduction pathway in this algal should produce useful tools for analysis of
phytochrome response pathways in considerably more complex higher plant tissues.
%%% The ability to adjust to changes in the external light environment is
especially important to plant survival because, unlike animals, plants depend on
sunlight for photosynthesis and they do not have a neuromuscular system which
allows them to move to a more optimum light environment. This project focuses on
phytochrome, a light-sensing protein found in all plants which perceives the
direction, intensity and color of light that impinges on the plant.
Specifically, we are interested in how this information is received by
phytochrome, how it passed on to other molecules, and ultimately how these
processes lead to changes in plant growth and development (e.g. seed
germination, flowering and growth rate). Since all life on earth depends on
photosynthesis by green plants, a basic understanding of the biochemical
processes which enable plants to adapt to their light environment is of great
importance.
