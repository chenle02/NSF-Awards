Research into the implementation of multigrid on block-structured grids will be
conducted. The major area of investigations is the intergrid boundaries, common
to block-structured grids. The treatment of the boundary conditions is a crucial
component in achieving efficient and accurate numerical schemes. Investigation
into new ways of implementing the boundary conditions in a multigrid multiblock
scheme is proposed here. Areas of investigation are data structure,
interpolation and restriction operators and conservation across boundaries. The
resulting new method will be implemented on shared-memory parallel computers to
achieve high turn around times.
