Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) interfaced with a modern computer
(COMP) gives the chemist a powerful tool for analyzing mixtures of compounds and
monitoring reactions as they progress. The use of GC-MS-COMP in the
undergraduate laboratory gives students experience with current instrumental
methods for molecular analysis, introduces students to the fundamentals of
information theory, and demonstrates by experiment the role of computers in
instrumental control, data acquisition, and data manipulation. This ILI award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale to acquire a GC-MS-COMP
system that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
