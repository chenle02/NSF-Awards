This proposal outlines a two-year course of study to fully analyze and
synthesize petrologic and geochemical data together with geologic and
geophysical constraints to come up with fully integrated models of melting, melt
ascent, plumbing and eruptive systems at the fast-spreading EPR 8 degrees -10
degrees N. The PI will collaborate with geologists and geophysicists at IPGP in
Paris and WHOI. Distinct goals include using existing and new analyses to
understand the mantle sources, melting, and fractionation of the axial and off-
axis basalts, using gabbroic xenoliths, U-series dating, and geologic
information to paint a picture of layer 2a thickening and the role of off-axis
eruptions, and to evaluate the correlations between U-series ages, magnetic
paleointensity values, and volcanic and geomorphic features. This ABR will bring
together a decade of sampling and analytical work to produce a fully integrated
interpretive model of crustal growth and evolution at fast spreading rates.
