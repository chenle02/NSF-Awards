The Faculty Associates in Science and Technology Leadership Corps Project for
Enhancing Environmental Technology Education The Partnership for Environmental
Technology Education (PETE) is a national non-profit public-private partnership
designed to link the resources of federal laboratories, federal and state
agencies, private industry and professional societies with community and
technical colleges. The primary goal is to assist approximately 460
participating colleges in developing quality programs for the education of
environmental technicians and transfer students to four-year institutions.
Faculty development has been and remains a key element of the PETE program. PETE
is a partner in the NSF/ATE Program-funded Advanced Technology Environmental
Education Center (ATEEC). This proposal is closely linked with ATEEC's
programmatic objectives. This project is establishing within PETE a Faculty
Associates in Science and Technology (FAST) program. Under this initiative, up
to 60 community and technical college faculty are being placed annually in 4 to
8 week summer internships in private industry, national laboratories, DoD
facilities, remediation sites and regulatory organizations. Four phases of this
program are defined in the project, including providing environmental technology
faculty with real world experiences which translates into improved community
college curricula and the development of a nationwide network of experienced
professional educators (FAST Leadership Corps) to serve as a resource to other
community and technical college faculty delivering environmental programs. PETE
provides the organizational framework for a national impact of program results.
The FAST Project is based upon four years experience with the faculty internship
program developed in the Western PETE region.
