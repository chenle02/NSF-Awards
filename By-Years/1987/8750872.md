A course in Molecular Genetics is being developed with a laboratory that
emphasizes gene cloning techniques. This project is providing a high speed
refrigerated centrifuge for use in large-scale preparative procedures (plasmids,
competent cells, DNA fragments). Other equipment needed for this laboratory
already has been acquired and currently is being used by undergraduates to test
suggested protocols for actual class experiments in Molecular Genetics --
experiments that are designed to enable the undergraduates to understand and
apply modern methods for analyzing genetic systems at the molecular level. The
unique value of this project for small, undergraduate Biology programs is that
it uses readily available equipment, microbial strains, reagents and procedures;
provides exposure to nucleotide sequencing and Southern blotting techniques
without use of radioactive isotopes; and is one that can be implemented safely
in any physical facility which conforms to the standard safety features found in
most college Microbiology laboratories. Available microcomputer software, some
in the public domain, is incorporated in laboratory applications used for sizing
restriction fragments of DNA and for nucleotide sequence analysis.
