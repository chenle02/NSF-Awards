This proposal seeks funds to acquire a research microscipe,computer, and
digitizer to continue research into siliceous microfossils. The equipment will
be used initailly for a shore-based study associated with Ocean Drilling Program
Leg 138 to the east Pacific to study silcoflagellates and minor microorganism
groups. Emphasis on the research project will be onchanges in silicoflagellate
skeletal morphology during the Miocene and Plisocene, which will be compared to
changes in the surrounding environment. Research on other siliceous microfossil
groups, such as sponge spicules, will be conducted by undergraduate students
under the principle investigator'ssupervision.
