The purpose of this project is to develop numerical methods for solving large
scale unconstrained optimization problems. Special attention will be given to
strategies for dynamically scaling the variables, and to the study of the
structure of problems arising in areas such as transonic flow, neuron networks
and meteorology. New preconditioners will be developed to be used in conjunction
with the discrete truncated Newton method, and the performance of this method
will be compared with that of limited memory and partitioned quasi.Newton
methods. The project will also investigate decomposition principles which allow
solving a large nonlinear problem as a sequence of simpler problems. limited
memory BFGS code for solving very large nonlinear problems will be developed and
made available for public distribution.
