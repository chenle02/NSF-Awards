The principal objective of this proposal is to utilize the UV radiation data to
be gathered under NSF sponsorship in Antarctica to provide the missing link
between ozone and UV radiation. The relationship between UV radiation measured
at the ground and the corresponding ozone column densities will be quantified.
In particular, the project will do the following analysis: Use the UV radiation
data to 1) determine the column ozone content from measured intensity ratios for
wavelength pairs in the Huggins band, 2) compute UV doses and relate to ozone
amounts, 3) compare measured spectra with detailed radiative transfer
calculations. The computations will be used to assess the effects of other
environmental parameters such as ground albedo, aerosols and clouds on the
transmitted UV radiation.
