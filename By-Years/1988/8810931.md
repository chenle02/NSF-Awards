Dr. Ellison and his colleagues will examine two samples of women, one from
Cambridge, Massachusetts and the other from the Ituri Forest in Zaire, to
investigate the suppression of ovarian function that is associated with young
chronological age, weight loss, and moderate exercise. Saliva samples will be
collected at frequent intervals throughout the day during the luteal phase of
the ovulatory cycle and assayed for progesterone concentration. For each group,
the frequency, amplitude and duration of progesterone pulses will be studied and
patterns of ovarian function suppression (relative to 25-35 year old control
groups) will be compared both within and between geographical settings. These
data will provide information on ovulatory status and thus indicate fertility.
The research will address two questions. First, to what extent are patterns of
ovarian suppression associated with youth, weight loss, and exercise similar.
Second, to what extent are the patterns of ovarian suppression observed among
healthy western women similar to those observed among women leading traditional
lives in a non-western natural fertility population. This research is important
because of the information it will provide on the natural factors which regulate
fertility. Many areas of the third world are characterized by high rates of
population growth and this increase defeats economic development efforts. If the
relationship between fertility and other variables such as age, diet and
exercise levels are established, this will, at the minimum, provide a basis for
estimating area specific future changes in population growth.
