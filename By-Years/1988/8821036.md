In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, an undergraduate student, Magdalena Dudas, will
assist Prof. Ermler in the analysis of vibrational-rotational polyatomic
potential energy surfaces. The project will use certain codes based on artifical
intelligence to generate the necessary equations to treat problems involving
complicated coupled interactions such as resonances and Coriolis effects. The
perturbation equations will be solved to successively higher orders by making
use of such AI-based codes as 'MACSYMA" and 'Mathematica'. The efficiency of the
procedure will be monitored in terms of the rate of convergence to stable wave
functions as a function of the order of perturbation theory.
