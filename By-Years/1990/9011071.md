Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a pilot model of a novel non-
intrusive laser velocimeter system will be built and tested. The system tracks
laser illuminated particles across an array of very small photodiodes and times
them with an electronic clock. Multi-dimensional velocity capability is
achievable with a single beam and suitable arrangements of diode arrays. The
system is in principle much more simple than conventional LDV flow diagnostic
systems. If a workable system based on this idea can be developed, it would
offer a rugged, portable, and inexpensive alternative for LDV systems.
