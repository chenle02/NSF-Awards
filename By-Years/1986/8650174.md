This three-year project will train 260 science teachers and administrators in
the Pikes Peak region to use the computer to enhance learning/teaching. Thirty
of those participants will be trained as leaders in educational computing in
their school districts. Upon completion of year three, these district leaders
should be fully trained to prepare and supervise science teachers in educational
computing. The task of maintaining the teacher preparation activities will be
assumed by these leaders with support from their districts. During year three,
the project staff will concentrate on evaluating the effectiveness of this
teacher preparation model, and establishing a self-sustaining teacher
preparation network in the Pikes Peak region. The network will include advisory
committees on educational computing in the sciences within each district and a
committee for the Pikes Peak region to facilitate interactions among cooperating
districts. During year three, the project will be operating independent of the
project staff, and the management of the network will be the responsibility of
the districts.
