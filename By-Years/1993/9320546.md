9320546 Kiyotaki One of the major features of the business cycle is the large,
persistent, and correlated fluctuations of aggregate output, amount of credit
and asset prices. This project will study theoretically how credit constraints
interact with aggregate economic activity over the business cycle. In
particular, for an economy where credit limits are endogenously determined the
research will focus how relatively small, temporary shocks to technology or
income generate large, persistent fluctuations in output and asset prices. Also,
it is asked how shocks to a particular sector of the economy can transmit to the
other sectors so that output and the amount of credit of different sectors move
together. A dynamic general-equilibrium model of an economy is developed in
which credit constraints arise naturally because lenders cannot force borrowers
to repay debts unless debts are secured. The dynamic interaction between credit
limits and asset prices is expected to be a powerful transmission mechanism by
which the effects of shock persist, amplify, and spill over to the other
sectors. This research is important because it will not only provide for a
better understanding of the propagation mechanism of cycles through the credit
system, but will also provide a useful framework for the empirical studies on
business and residential investment and credit constraints. ***
