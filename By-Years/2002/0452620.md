This award funds research on three distinct problems in microeconomic theory.
The PI will build and analyze three different models. The first part of the
project will consider the role of lobbying and vote buying in determining
electoral outcomes. The goal is to develop results about the efficiency and
distributional consequences of voting outcomes when vote trading is possible.
The second project considers how prices are determined in a market where a buyer
must approach sellers one-by-one for price quotes. If the sellers have private
information about the cost of production, then the buyer knows that each quoted
price gives some information about the likely quotes that she could get by
approaching yet another seller. The goal here is to determine how the level of
search costs -- the costs in time and effort that the buyer must incur to get a
quote from an additional seller -- affect the price that the buyer finally
accepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third project is motivated by a phenomenon
observed in some employer/employee relationships. On occasion, the compensation
of employees is affected considerably by actual outside offers that the employee
generates by searching for a new job. In other employement relations, such
offers are not necessary in order to earn salary increases. The PI will
construct a formal model that can predict when outside offers are used by
employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of this project will contribute
the public debate on possible restrictions on lobbying. The second project will
improve our understanding of a sequential search process that is commonly used
by small businesses who seek to purchase one or more components from another
"upstream" firm. The results will be useful for antitrust enforcers and others
interested in determining the degree of competition in these markets. The third
project may yield implications for the design of employment contracts in
organizations that employee skilled workers.
