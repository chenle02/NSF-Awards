International Conference on Geometry and Physics

Aissa Wade Department of Mathematics Pennsylvania State University at University
Park We propose to co-sponsor an international conference on geometry and
mathematical physics, which will be held at the University of Dakar, Senegal,
from May 14 to May 18, 2007. The aim of this annual event is to bring together
worldwide experts, young researchers and advanced graduate students with common
interests in geometry and mathematical physics. This year, the meeting will
feature recent advances in symplectic geometry, Lie group and groupoid actions,
as well as their interrelations with Riemannian and Poisson geometry.

The cross-fertilization of geometry and physics has led to important
developments in mathematics. This meeting includes several lecture series
delivered by leading experts in the field. It will provide an opportunity for
graduate students and postdocs to meet and interact with researchers from all
over the world.
