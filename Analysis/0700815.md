Loredana Lanzani will study a number of problems in the areas of complex analyis
and partial differential equations, with emphasis on the ambient domain's lack
of boundary regularity. The probems to be studied include: integral
representations of holomorphic functions on non-smooth domains; boundary
regularity of Cauchy-type integrals; representations of Hardy spaces of boundary
values of holomorphic functions.

In order to study these classical problems of complex analysis in the non-
classical context brought by the lack of smoothness, Loredana Lanzani and her
collaborators will develop new techniques that hinge upon an interplay of real
harmonic analysis and complex variables methods.
