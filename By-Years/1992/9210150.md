Funded by a Research Planning Grant, details are to be determined for an
experimental investigation of non-linear water waves in a water tank driven by
longitudinal oscillations. Resonance effects, interaction between various wave
modes, and comparison of experimental data to existing models and an improved
model, will be the main thrusts of the investigation. Certain inconsistencies
between existing measurements and experimental data remain as an impediment to
the confident application of theory to predict the interaction of non-linear
waves with each other and with man-made structures.
