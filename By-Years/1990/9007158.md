Management of the design of a large mechanical system such as a passenger
vehicle is a complex task involving hundreds of resources and thousands of
design activities. The objective of this project is to develop a methodology for
decomposition of the design system, collection of technical data at the design
activity level, and planning of the design process for enhanced concurrency. The
project also includes the formulation of a multicriteria optimization model and
solution algorithms for scheduling of design activities. This research should
yield useful knowledge resulting in infrared methods, traits and practice in the
mechanical and structural design of passenger vehicles.
