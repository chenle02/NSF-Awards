This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will support the
development of submillimeter instrumentation. The principal investigator, Dr.
John Carlstrom, plans to develop improved submillimeter receivers and build the
first submillimeter astronomical interferometer. These instruments will be used
to study the complex processes that guide star formation in our own Galaxy and
in external galaxies.
