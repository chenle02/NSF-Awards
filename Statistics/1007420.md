The principal investigator (PI) aims to develop new statistical methodology for
analyzing incomplete data using regression of quantiles where causes of
incomplete data are due to either censoring or measurement error. The research
is challenging mainly because quantile regression aims to avoid parametric error
distributional assumptions so the standard likelihood-based methods cannot be
used. The PI will focus on three different but related problems. First, new
approaches to estimation based on corrected scores will be developed to account
for a class of measurement errors in the covariates. Second, an index-based
estimation method will be proposed for censored quantile regression to
accommodate high dimensional covariates. Penalization methods will be developed
for variable selection. The third problem focuses on data with covariates
subject to fixed censoring. To improve the efficiency over estimators from
complete samples, a new multiple imputation approach based on censored
regression of quantiles will be developed. The new imputation method can be used
to improve statistical inference for not only quantile regression but also more
general regression problems.

The proposed research will have broad and valuable applicability in various
fields, for instance, in microarray studies where the gene expression data are
often measured with errors, in survival studies where random censoring is
common, and in environmental and geological studies where measurements are often
subject to fixed censoring. For example, in contrast to conventional statistical
methods, quantile regression models can help discover heterogeneous effects of
drug treatments on survival times of both high and low risk patients. The
project will integrate research and education by developing advanced topics
courses, mentoring students especially those from under-represented groups.
