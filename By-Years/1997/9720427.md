9720427 Roesset This award provides funding for the Engineering Research Center
at Texas A&amp;M University/University of Texas at Austin entitled "Offshore
Technology Research Center" (OTRC) to work with researchers from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology (NTNU) and MARINTEK (NTNU's commercial/research wave basin
operation) to benchmark analytical results from numerical wave basin simulators
and wave basin experiments at these institutions. Benchmarking will be done
comparing the results of the numerical wave tanks and algorithms developed at
OTRC, MIT, and NTNU with experimental data from physical wave basin tests at
OTRC and MARINTEK using a cylinder and a mini tension leg platform provided by
the Norwegian oil company STATOIL. This benchmarking will lead to improved
numerical wave tank modeling and improved wave kinematics in a physical wave
basin used to reproduce multidirectional sea states and the forces acting on
structures under the conditions and effects of side reflections. Eventually,
well-developed numerical wave tanks will be able to complement or replace a
number of very expensive physical model tests.
