Recently, it has been shown that one major source of errors in numerical weather
predictions is generated by using comparatively deterministic functions of
resolvable variables to represent the unresolved sub-grid processes. One effort
in improving ensemble predictions involves perturbing the physical
parameterizations of the model. To tackle the problem, the PI will study the
sub-grid scale signatures in various verification measures and use a combination
of them to improve the ensemble forecasts. An idealized model with low-dimension
configurations will be used for the study. The research focus will be on the
interactions of the resolvable variables and unresolved processes with
particular attention on the effects of different perturbation amplitudes,
correlation scales for the random element of physical parameterizations, and
possible signatures of these errors in appropriate diagnostics. The overall goal
of the research is to provide knowledge on the structure of perturbations in
physical parameterizations and to represent them properly in ensemble forecasts.

The research study has the potential of generating useful information for
operational weather prediction.
