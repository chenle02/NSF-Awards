"Long" structures in deep water marine environments, such as mooring cables and
drilling risers, are susceptible to flow-induced vibrations due to vortex
shedding forces. This project will investigate the three-dimensional aspects of
vortex forcing by implementing a solution technique based on traveling waves.
The approach can be used to investigate various ocean engineering problems, such
as the response of slack cables in spanwise variable flow conditions, by
considering the spanwise correlation of vortex shedding, and the interaction of
the various frequency components of vibration.
