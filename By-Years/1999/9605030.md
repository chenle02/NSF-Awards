9605030 Peressini This study will provide systematic information about the
nature of two reform-based teacher education programs and their impact on
prospective teachers. The researchers will follow a number of preservice
secondary mathematics teachers as they participate in two university-based
teacher education programs and through their first two years of teaching, in
order to study closely how teacher education impacts their learning and
development as mathematics teachers. Data will be gathered predominantly through
semi-structured interviews, observations, and the collection and analysis of
artifacts. The data gathering process will be organized around participants'
knowledge and beliefs, participants' teaching, university teacher education
experiences, and public school experiences. Products will be conference
presentations, peer-reviewed journal articles, and postings to a website.
