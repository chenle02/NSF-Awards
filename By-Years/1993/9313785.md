9313785 Emanuel One and two day forecasts of weather in the midlatitudes at the
synoptic-scale and greater are highly accurate, and longer- range forecasts
simulate the general behavior, if not the details, of the atmosphere. Despite
this, the dynamics of synoptic-scale waves and instabilities are not altogether
well understood. Moreover, synoptic-scale waves and instabilities are yet to be
parameterized as in terms of planetary-scale processes, even though there is
evidence that these waves are in a state of statistical quasi-equilibrium with
the planetary waves on time scales longer than a few weeks. This research effort
involves two related objectives which are directed at improving our
understanding of the dynamical processes involved in baroclinic situations. The
first is to deduce a mathematical expression of an effective refractive index
for Rossby waves using balance approximations of order higher than quasi-
geostrophy. The second is to develop and apply a methodology for calculating
climatological distributions of this effective refractive index (a function of
potential vorticity) from observations, not a straight-forward task given the
extremely inhomogeneous distributions potential vorticity in the real
atmosphere. Once these are determined, the PIs can better understand the wave
propagation characteristics in the atmosphere. Their intention is to apply their
results to the study of atmospheric blocking events and low-frequency
variability. ***
