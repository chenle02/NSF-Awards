The main goal of this research project is to improve the realism of computer
generated images. Concepts used in ray tracing, radiosity and nonparametric
density estimation have been combined into a single algorithm which is capable
of handling diffuse illumination, indirect lighting, the separation of
wavelengths by prisms, and the focusing of light through lenses. In the new
algorithm, images are created using a two step method. The first step uses light
sources in the scene to create internal lighting functions. These functions can
then be used in a distributed ray tracing environment and the final image can be
created. The new algorithm is a synthesis of the radiosity and ray tracing
paradigms and the project will help clarify the relationship between these two
methods. By taking advantage of the strengths of reach of these methods, this
technique efficiently solves a wide range of computer graphics problems.
