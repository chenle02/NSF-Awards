Benchmarks have been used to test everything from the speed of a processor to
the access time of a memory system. The computing community relies on them to
assess how fast a given hardware or software system operates. They are of
importance in everyday computing. However, until now, the study of the art of
designing a good benchmark has focused on making the benchmark ``realistic'' in
predicting how well it will perform for the intended applications; the issue of
making benchmark results trustworthy has been relegated to ``trusted'' or third
party agents, and little attention has been paid to the question of making
benchmarks themselves ``uncheatable.'' The project studies the problem of how to
make benchmarks resistant to tampering and hence more trustworthy. The plan is
to use modern cryptography and complexity theory to make this possible.
Basically the trust in individuals and organizations will be replaced by trust
in the impossibility of breaking certain computational problems. The advantage
of this approach is clear: the schemes will be scientifically trustworthy. There
is an array of problems that need to be formulated and solved, which are
important in making uncheatable benchmarks; some are practical issues, some are
theoretical.
