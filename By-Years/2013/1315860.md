This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to increase
yield in wheat by using TILLING, a reverse genetics tool, to identify novel
alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In
crops such as wheat with more complex genome structures and less advanced
genomic tools, the major genes underlying many aspects of plant architecture are
yet to be identified. However, due to functional conservation, genes regulating
traits in rice (and other crops) are likely to play similar roles in wheat. Once
new alleles of these genes have been identified they will be subsequently
evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the
greenhouse and in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can
rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory
restrictions.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be
the economic impact of improved wheat yields. The U.S. is the largest wheat
exporter globally, yet the competitiveness of U.S. wheat, both globally and
domestically, is declining significantly. Planted acreage is down thirty percent
since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher
returns. Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than
that from corn and soy. With a conservative 5% increase in yield resulting from
this project, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over
$30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed
company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million
annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a
commercial wheat breeding program, it is believed that this project will make a
significant contribution to improving the competitiveness of U.S. wheat.
