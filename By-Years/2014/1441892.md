The United States has historically been the global leader in the field of
Intelligent Tutoring Systems, or ways to use computerized artificial
intelligence to enhance teaching and learning in contexts ranging from children
learning math in school, to soldiers learning highly technical jobs in the US
military. The preeminent conference in this field is the ITS conference; at this
conference the latest research is presented and practitioners learn the state of
the art techniques that allow creation of these important educational
technologies.

This proposal would support seven Ph.D. students, selected through a competitive
process, to attend the conference, present their work, and receive additional
mentoring outside of their dissertation committees. The intellectual merit of
the work rests on the studies the graduate students submit to be considered for
participation in the early career track of the conference; this work is then
enhanced by guidance from world-class mentors who meet with the students in a
structured format to improve their research. The broader impact includes the
career impact on the seven selected students, especially since promising
graduate students whose advisors may not have funding to send them to the
conference can still be included, and their work can be showcased and improved.
Possible long-term broader impacts include building the field of ITS researchers
and improving the quality of tutoring systems, and thus eventually, improving
the quality of education.
