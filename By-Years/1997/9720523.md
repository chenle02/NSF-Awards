9720523 Beck The PI will consider the investigation and construction of
multivariable pharmacodynamic models to describe human response to anesthesia.
The modeling framework used will be that of uncertain systems, with the goal of
developing robust feedback control methods for the purposes of automated
anesthesia delivery. This award, the PI's first federally funded research grant,
will allow her to establish an entirely new approach to patient modeling and the
use of control in bioengineering systems, as well as to advance the
implementation of modern control techniques for uncertain systems in general.
