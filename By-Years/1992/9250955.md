Central Michigan University is developing a new sophomore- junior level
undergraduate inorganic lecture-laboratory course focussing on synthesis and
characterization. The availability of the newly acquired automatic polarimeter,
Evans magnetic susceptibility balance, and high temperature box furnace make it
possible for undergraduates to: study of optical isomerism in transition metal
complexes; determine of magnetic moments of complexes; and, the synthesis and
characterization of solids. The equipment is also being used by students
conducting undergraduate research.
