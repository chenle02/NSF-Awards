We will develop new algorithms, mathematical foundations, and a new programming
methodology for the fast parallel solution of elliptic problems with aspects
that are crucial in practice but present serious difficulties to existing
methods. We will investigate new robust iterative substructuring methods that
perform well even in the presence of interface roughness on element scale. The
performance of existing methods deteriorates in this case, but smooth
decompositions are typically not available in practice. We also propose to
investigate fast methods for the discretization and iterative solution of high
frequency wave propagation and scattering problems by representing the solution
locally as a combination of waves on a coarse mesh and exploiting connections
with the fast multipole method. Finally, we propose to develop new programming
approaches and prototype tools for latency tolerant implementation on parallel
machines, transforming a high level program with new directives into multiple
independent tasks queued on processors.

The project will advance the state of the art in modeling complicated problems
in Mechanical Engineering with irregular geometries on high-performance
computers with high accuracy and efficiency, improve the technology underlying
radar, sonar, and ultrasound imaging, and create a new highly efficient
methodology and prototype tools for High-Performance Computing. Potential
applications include computational analysis and modeling of automobiles and
aircrafts and accurate high resolution ultrasound imaging. It is expected that
the new methodology for High-Performance Computing will be important for
futuristic technologies, where the speed of light is the limiting factor of
communication between the processors, as well as for more immediate distributed
computing on networks of computers.
