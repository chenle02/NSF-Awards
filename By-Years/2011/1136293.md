The TigersTeach Noyce Initiative is a partnership involving Clemson's Eugene T.
Moore School of Education, College of Engineering and Science, and College of
Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences in collaboration with partner school
districts in Anderson, Oconee, Pickens and Greenville Counties, SC. The project
is providing scholarships for 30 undergraduates or post-baccalaureate students
to become mathematics and science teachers. Teacher candidates participate in
early field experiences guided by Master Teachers. The project provides multiple
entry points for students from first-year engineering and science majors through
post-baccalaureate students. Students either enter a dual degree program
completing a degree in a STEM major plus a STEM education degree or enter a
graduate level MAT program in secondary science or mathematics after completing
a STEM undergraduate degree. The project uses a servant-leader model focusing on
a commitment of service to high-needs communities and providing substantive
immersive experiences in school and community agencies. Using Clemson
University's innovative Call Me Mister program as a model, the project is
creating a comprehensive set of activities to develop a program with service and
leadership as intended outcomes, both on campus and in partner schools. These
program activities educate students about the teaching profession by involving
them in seminars with veteran scientists and teachers, by encouraging
participation in professional conferences, and by working in local schools and
agencies. Students learn about and contribute back to the community and
profession by being engaged in a continuous series of mentoring, tutoring, and
teaching events throughout the program.
