An international conference, Global Scientific and Technical Resources, was
held in June, 1992, Stresa, Italy. A group of U.S. academic participants serve
as rapporteurs for the Conference, and convene to prepare a special analysis of
Conference materials and discussions for NSF. This report is intended to
contribute to an informatiion and data base for planning NSF international
activities. As one issue,the special analysis will consider how mulilateral
organizations facilitate S&T cooperation among institutions of member countries
and with non- member countries. Other international issues will be addressed
concerning S&T relations between industrial and develping countries. The special
analysis will serve as highly useful input to NSF and INT in planning
international initiatives. *** //
