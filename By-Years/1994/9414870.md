Constructed almost seventy years ago and last renovated more than 40 years
later, Chandler Laboratories on the Columbia University campus will undergo
significant renovation with the support of NSF. The project will renew the
obsolete heating, ventilation/exhaust, electrical distribution, plumbing and
fire protection systems and renovate research laboratories in the oldest
research wing of the Chemical Science Center. The facilities currently house the
research activity of eight faculty whose work examines synthesis, physical
organic chemistry, the chemistry of natural products, organic photochemistry,
and structural theory, and whose research activity has been limited by
deteriorating and obsolete systems. The project will replace obsolete and
defective steam radiators with a hydronic fan coil system, increase the capacity
of air handling systems, boost fume hood exhaust capacity to assure appropriate
safety measures, install a new electric distribution system, replace 67-year old
plumbing for water, steam, gas and compressed air, build a corridor fire
separation system, and remove all asbestos ceiling tiles. Building renovations
will substantially improve the research environment for 8 faculty, and the 53
post docs, 65 graduate students, and 13 undergraduates who work with them. In
addition, it will significantly enhance the department's effort to recruit new
faculty to premier projects in computer-based visualization and computation,
biotechnology, and advanced materials. The facilities will strengthen research
in these areas and research relationships with other academic institutions and
with the pharmaceutical, computer and telecommunications industries.
