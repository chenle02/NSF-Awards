9453678 Lambert The goal of the project, Science of Living Spaces, is to
encourage girls in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) and give them the
knowledge and confidence to consider SEM as a career choice. The mechasism is an
intensive 3 week summer session in which 25 7th and 8th grade girls from rural
areas (Isle of Wight and Charles City counties) reside at CNU during the week.
The girls will participate in projects in biology, chemistry, computer science,
math, engineering, and physics, all of which relate to the theme of living
spaces. There will be almost no lecture - - the girls will actually learn by
doing: for living in the home, they will study electricity and build circuits;
for living in the community, they will study the environment and measure
greenhouse gases; and, for living in space, they will visit the Richmond Math
and Science Center, and experiment with being scientists in a simulated control
lab, as well as being astronauts in (simulated) space. In addition to doing SEM
activities, the girls will learn about themselves and about careers in science
through off-site visits and through guest speakers. Contact will be maintained
with the girls after they leave through email, and with two visits during the
next school year. ***
