This planning grant will lay the foundation for establishing a successful IUCRC
site at University of North Carolina - Charlotte, affiliated with the existing
IUCRC center - the Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI). The UNC
Charlotte site will focus on establishing, promoting, and disseminating best
practices for research, development, and application of big data-driven analysis
of risk management and mitigation in sustainable societies (social good) and
regional industries, including financial services, healthcare, energy, and
retail. The site will use the existing UNC Charlotte big data repository and
analytics tools framework, called SOPHI, to establish a computational platform
for corporations, governments, and universities to jointly address the issue of
risk management and mitigation through the use of data, analytics, actionable
policies, and verifiable outcomes.

The diversity of businesses around the Charlotte region has proven to be of
interest to a diverse group of students. With the existing graduate programs in
analytics already more diverse than other UNC Charlotte STEM graduate programs
achieving 40% women enrollment, the PIs aim to attract underrepresented groups
into the IUCRC activities and analytics programs on campus, both to augment
those programs and to offer these students enhanced career opportunities in
sought-after disciplines. As part of the award activities, the PIs will create a
strategy and assign responsibilities for all aspects of this process.
