The National Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Sciences, Inc. seeks funds for a
six-month planning project to help prepare the teachers in the territory of
American Samoa in mathematics. Over 80% of the teachers have only a two year
degree and very few of the rest have four year degrees and certification. The
aim of the project is to identify the primary academic and pedagogical needs of
teachers who are not certified, to provide initial assistance through the
National Faculty scholars in meeting those needs, and to develop a plan for a
multi-year program to address the needs of American Samoa teachers in
mathematics. The planning project will bring together in a collaborative effort
American Samoa teachers, administrators, Territorial education officers,
government officials, and National Faculty scholars and staff. The National
Faculty will share the costs of the project by covering over 20% of the
expenses. The total funding awarded is $49,900.00
