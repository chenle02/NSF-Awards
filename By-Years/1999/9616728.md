9616728 Arritt The summertime Great Plains low-level jet is phenomenon known to
be associated with severe weather events. Better understanding of the low-level
jet could lead to better forecasts of severe weather within the Great Plains.
The Principal Investigator will use a combination of numerical modeling and
observational analysis to quantify the relative contributions of boundary-layer
processes and synoptic dynamical forcing in the formation of the Great Plains
low- level jet. The effect of divergence induced by the low-level jet on
mesoscale rainfall systems also will be investigated. The project will use data
from recently implemented observing systems and will adopt new strategies for
isolating the contributions of the various processes that lead to the low-level
jet. Emphasis will be given to the examination of physical processes that have
been indicated in previous modeling studies as important for the low-level jet
and its subsequent effects on mesoscale precipitation systems, but have not yet
been confirmed by observations. Accomplishment of the research will provide
improvements in our understanding of the fundamental issues in the dynamics of
the low-level jet, and will support improvements in the prediction of nocturnal
rainfall in the Great Plains region. ***
