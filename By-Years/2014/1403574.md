Proposal: 1403574&lt;br/&gt;PI: Agarwal, Gunjan&lt;br/&gt;Title: Indirect MFM
for sensing magnetic nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron can exist in the
human body in the form of nanoparticles. In addition, magnetic nanoparticles are
widely used in a number of biological applications. Biosensing techniques to
accurately detect magnetic nanoparticles are not well-developed. This project
will develop a new microscopy-based technique to detect magnetic nanoparticles.
The proposed development can help a more accurate determination of iron content
in human tissue for multiple pathologies and in bio-nanotechnology
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of superparamagnetic nanoparticles
with unique and multi-functional properties are utilized in biosensing
applications. Nanoscale iron-deposits found in-vivo are also superparamagnetic
in nature. Techniques to characterize these nanoscale magnetic (iron) particles
in biological systems at the single particle level are not well-developed. The
overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel biosensing modality, namely,
InDirect Magnetic Force Microscopy (ID-MFM), to detect nanoscale magnetic
particles. ID-MFM is expected to offer very high sensitivity and spatial
resolution beyond the capabilities of existing biosensors and imaging
modalities. This unique approach can be used to determine magnetic (iron)
content in small quantities of samples and is expected to find a wide variety of
applications in evaluating biological fluids, cells and tissue sections. The
iron-encapsulating protein, ferritin, will be studied as a model magnetic
nanoparticle because of its versatile applications in biomedicine and bio-
nanotechnology. ID-MFM will be developed to detect ferritin in-vitro, in ambient
air and in a fluid environment. The proposed efforts also include a multi-level
enrichment plan in nanotechnology for K-8 students, undergraduates and graduate
students through a hands-on workshop, research experience and inter-
institutional collaboration.
