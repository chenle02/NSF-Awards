The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Spectrometer (FT NMR) with variable temperature capability. Students
in organic chemistry are obtaining 1H and 13C spectra to identify unknowns,
reaction products, and the compositions of mixtures. Atomic connectivity,
molecular geometry and stereochemistry are obtained from 2-D experiments, as
well as estimates of average bond lengths from Nuclear Overhauser Effects. In
Biochemistry, Physical and Inorganic Chemistry, the variable temperature ability
allows the measurement of DNA conformations, reaction rates, and activation
