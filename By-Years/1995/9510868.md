The central analytic-theoretical task of the project is to integrate the
constraint-based core-periphery model of the phonological lexicon into
Optimality Theory (OT). Optimality Theory deals with the interaction of
phonological constraints with each other and is built on the idea that
constraints are ranked and violable. Exploratory work on Japanese indicates that
developing the core-periphery model of the lexicon within OT not only leads to a
much improved understanding of lexical organization and of the principles that
give rise to it, but in turn also makes a contribution to Optimality Theory
itself, and leads to many new empirical and theoretical issues. These issues
will be investigated through detailed empirical analyses of the phonological
lexica of particular languages (in order to sharpen and test the details of the
theory) and through cross-language surveys (in order to secure the topological
validity of the predictions). The results of the project will be reported in
research articles and conference papers as they become available; and the main
empirical findings and theoretical conclusions will be consolidated and
summarized In a monograph at the end of the project.
