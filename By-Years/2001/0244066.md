Theoretical and computational investigation of the interaction of hydrogen atoms
at long range is undertaken in order to understand the collision behavior of
these atoms at ultra low energies. The PI will compute the necessary interaction
potentials and then use them in multichannel scattering calculations to compute
the needed cross sections.
