The problem of voltage collapse in power systems is emerging as one of the
potentially serious operating problems for future systems. It currently is one
of the least understood and least characterized system problems in existence
today. This research is aimed at basic understanding of dynamic mechanisms for
collapse and its solution by application of an expert system with integrated
algorithmic techniques.
