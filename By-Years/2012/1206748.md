Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1206748, Principal Investigator: Zhiqin
Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this proposal is to continue to study
several fundamental problems in differential geometry and related fields. The
long-term goal is to study the higher order BCOV conjecture and relations
between the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics and the stability of complex
manifolds. One of the short-term goals is to study the different notations of
stability. In particular, the proposer will study the relations between the
Donaldson-Futaki invariant and the Tian-Futaki invariant. The proposer believes
that, like the Futaki invariant, both invariants are combinatorial. He will also
generalize the Tian-Yau-Zelditch expansion, study the gap problem, study the
spectral problem of quantum layers, and study some fundamental linear algebra
problems related to the mean curvature flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
problems are important in differential geometry and mathematical physics. It has
significant impacts in our understanding of the Universe. As before, he will
convey his mathematical insights to students and to the general public by giving
talks and advising students. He will continue to encourage more people,
especially women and minorities, to study mathematics. To achieve the goal, the
proposer is involved in many educational activities such as the California Math
Counts, the UCI Anteater Math Club, the UCI School of Physical Sciences Mentor
Program, etc. He is involved in the innovation of both undergraduate and
graduate courses.
