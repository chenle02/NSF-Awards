The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Mary Jane Shultz of Tufts University.
Prof. Shultz and her students will develop and employ sum frequency generation
(SFG) spectroscopy and microscopy to study the interactions between gas phase
adsorbates and water and ice interfaces. SFG spectroscopy studies will be used
to associate features in the largely unexplored hydrogen bonding region of the
IR spectrum with specific binding of adsorbates to the ice surface. SFG
microscopy studies will be used to differentiate reactions at defects such as
grain boundaries from those on the ice crystal faces. The project is of great
environmental importance since molecular level encounters between adsorbates and
water or ice determine the fate of substances that are released to the
atmosphere. These include, for rexample chloro-fluoro carbons that ultimately
form a hole in the ozone layer and combustion generated oxides that acidify the
environment. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to
students in an area of great importance to society. In addition, Prof. Shultz
and her students will use advanced imaging and visualization techniques to
educate K-12 students about environmental processes that involve water and ice
surfaces.
