9416994 McAlister Drs. McAlister and Hartkopf at Georgia State University will
continue a program of high angular resolution observations of binary star
systems using speckle techniques. Binary stars are the only source for the
fundamental determination of stellar masses and can provide direct
determinations of stellar distances, radii, luminosities, and effective
temperatures. The Georgia State University program of binary star speckle
interferometry began in 1975 and has continued its original emphasis on
obtaining significant numbers of well calibrated observations at large aperture
telescopes. These data are being used to greatly improve the orbital elements of
known binaries and to calculate the orbits of resolved spectroscopic systems and
other newly discovered binaries.
