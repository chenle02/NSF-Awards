The project is allowing the introduction of the important analytical technique
of Fourier Transform Spectroscopy into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.
Laboratory experiences in organic, physical, inorganic, biochemical, and
analytical chemistry is being significantly enhanced by the acquisition of an
FTIR spectrometer. The improvements in spectral quality and speed of acquisition
of spectra is allowing upgrading of the laboratory exercises in IR spectroscopy
and is permitting the introduction of new experiments into the curriculum.
Experiments with data handling techniques possible on a computer- controlled
FTIR instrument is providing students with relevant skills to take with them to
graduate school or to industry. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
