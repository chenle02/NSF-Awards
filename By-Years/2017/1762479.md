Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to
be quite challenging. Professors Matthew Whited of Carlton College and Gordana
Dukovic of the University of Colorado are organizing a workshop that seeks to
provide new faculty with insight about proposal writing and reviewing processes.
The workshop also seeks to position newer faculty to write more competitive
proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the opportunity to
network with successful grant recipients and program officers. They engage in
mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities designed to provide
them with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is
ambitious, yet realistic. Broader impact criteria is also discussed in terms of
educational activities, outreach, and applications to societal problems.

The workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, "Chemistry
Early Career Investigator Workshop," will be held on March 26-27, 2018 in
Alexandria, Virginia. This workshop will bring together 100 junior faculty from
a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically
crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and
assessing and evaluating project aims. Potential participants can access more
