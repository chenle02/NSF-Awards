An experimental study will be carried out of bifurcation phenomena in flows
under steady, oscillating, and pulsating conditions. Flows approaching a
divergent, Y-shaped branch from a single conduit upstream are subject to a
variety of unsteady flow phenomena near the junction. These will be explored.
Flow visualization will be utilized, employing tracer particles and Laser-
Doppler anemometry. Application areas range from pipelines to respiratory
systems.
