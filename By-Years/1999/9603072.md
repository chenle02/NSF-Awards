The proposal requests funds to purchase several instruments for image analysis:
an integrated phosphor-imager and direct fluorescence/chemifluorescence system,
a film recorder, and a MacIntosh computer and dedicated system laser printer.
The three instruments will provide critical image analysis capabilities
presently unavailable to Chemistry and Biology Department graduate students,
post-doctoral fellows and faculty. Major research projects that will benefit
from these instruments are as follows: (1) Definition of structural and
energetic parameters for specific DNA binding and cleavage by a restriction
endonuclease- a model system for studying enzyme-DNA complexes; (2) Definition
of catalytic and recognition mechanisms of bacterial DNA methyltransferases; (3)
Mechanisms of iron acquisition by marine micro-organisms; (4) Expression and
characterization of double-stranded RNA dependent enzymes under interferon
regulation; (5) Definition of the molecular mechanisms involved in Ras function;
(6) Structure- function relationships of nuceic acid polymerases and
microtubule-binding proteins studied by crystallographic and biochemical
approaches; (7) Structure-function analysis of the acetylcholine transporter of
synaptic vesicles.
