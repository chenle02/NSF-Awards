ABSTRACT OF PROJECT

The goal of this project is to formulate, analyze and numerically test new
computational algorithms geared towards solving problems of deformation and
failure in structures and materials. We use the p/hp finite element methods,
where the degree p of polynomials used can be increased to achieve accuracy. The
first topic is the investigation of a linearized algorithm for the buckling of
three-dimensional objects, recently implemented in the commercial hp code STRESS
CHECK. Spurious predictions are unavoidable due to the non-compactness of an
underlying eigenvalue problem. We develop a mathematical theory which analyzes
the algorithm, helps in ensuring the reliability of the computations, and leads
to useful extensions. The second topic is the development of a p finite element
method for woven composite materials. An algorithm will be developed whereby
each periodic cell is identified with a specialized p-type element, which can
incorporate the various geometric and material properties. The periodicity is
exploited since no mesh sub-division is used, but accuracy achieved by
increasing the degree in the local elements.

It is well known that when a thin vertical beam is loaded too much, it will
eventually buckle. This project mathematically develops a new engineering method
for predicting such maximum buckling loads for complicated three-dimensional
structures. The goal is to ensure that the results predicted by the engineering
method (already in use in the commercial software STRESS CHECK, which has been
used e.g. to study the buckling of space shuttle panels) are reliable. The
second part of this project develops a new method to computationally study woven
composite materials. These materials, which are composed of fibers that are
woven together and imbedded in a surrounding matrix are often both very strong
and lightweight, and have several useful industrial applications (e.g.
aeronautical components). Due to their complicated structure, their analysis by
conventional methods can be quite cumbersome and expensive. Our new method
overcomes several difficulties by exploiting the repeating nature of the
material, and will lead to useful materials science applications, such as the
design of new composites with specific properties.
