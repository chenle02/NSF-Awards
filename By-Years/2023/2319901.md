To mitigate climate change, a growing coalition of governments, businesses, and
other institutions have adopted “net zero” goals and engaged in decarbonization,
an energy transition process that results from the replacement of fuels with
high carbon content by those with low carbon content. This project examines
three interrelated questions: Why are some companies communicating their
adoption of different types of net zero goals while others are not? What
activities are associated with net zero goals? What are the outcomes of net zero
communication and activities on firms’ financial performance and media coverage?
This project benefits society by exploring the factors that shape businesses’
involvement in the development of the market for clean energy.

The project constructs three datasets. First, a corporate decarbonization
communication dataset includes all corporate communications related to net zero
and climate change mitigation goals for U.S. Fortune 1000 companies during the
2015-2024 period. Researchers collect these data by searching firms’ websites
and annual reports and coding corporate communication of general climate change
mitigation statements and specific net zero goals. Second, investigators collect
data on corporate decarbonization activities by applying text analysis to the
corporate decarbonization communication dataset and by collecting information
from third parties. Third, a corporate decarbonization media coverage dataset
draws from all articles from major newspapers that mention climate change and
net zero during the 2015-2024 period. Researchers extract the full text of all
climate and environment-related major news articles associated with each of
these firms, and filter, clean, and code these articles. These are then
converted into annual indicators and analyzed using panel-based statistical
methods.
