Science Weekly, Inc., the publisher of a K-6 science magazine, will develop and
publish a teacher focused newsletter to improve elementary teachers' skills in
teaching science and mathematics in geographical areas where there are high
concentrations of low income and minority students. The newsletter will be
designed for the purpose of increasing teachers' knowledge of content, to inform
and instruct them in strategies and techniques necessary to assure quality
classroom science and mathematics instruction, and to provide up-to-date
bibliographies and developments in classroom teaching and learning. The
newsletter will highlight high-interest topics in science and mathematics and
will incorporate graphics to maintain the teacher's attention and interest.
Technology content will be used as a bridge to demonstrate the relationship
between science and mathematics and the varied applications of this subject
matter. Science Weekly, Inc. will involve the most capable science and
mathematics educators, teachers, administrators and educational technologists by
utilizing their expertise on an advisory/ editorial board and curriculum focus
groups. The board will provide the primary leadership and direction. The
teacher-focused groups will provide feedback and information on format, content,
tone and message of the publication. The project will involve urban, suburban
and rural school systems to test prototypes during the development of the
premier issue to ensure that the content, format and tone are appropriate for
teachers in all settings and is scientifically and educationally sound.
