Volcanic lightning is a common but understudied phenomenon that is poorly
parameterized. This project focuses on learning more about the properties of ash
particles relating to their role in the generation of electrical fields in
volcanic plumes and in volcanic lightning. In addition to being a charge
carrier, volcanic ash may also influence the production of lightning due to its
potential role in ice nucleation and as polarized, conducting particles. A range
of material laboratory testing and characterization techniques will be used on
samples obtained from several Alaskan volcanoes to determine if ash samples of
different mineral and structurally bound water content will affect the
functionality of conducting/insulating ash materials, and their ice nucleation
affinity. Generation of volcanic (silicic glass) spherules as an indicator of
the production of specific ash grain textures during volcanic lightning episodes
will also be sought for. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
proposed research include the training of undergraduate students, creation of
teaching materials, and the support of an early career researcher. Improved
understanding of volcanic hazards for the aviation, communication, and power
generation industries are additional potential societal impacts
