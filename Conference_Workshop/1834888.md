This award will support undergraduate participants of the Texas Undergraduate
Mathematics Conference (TUMC) which will be hosted on November 2-3, 2018 by
Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. In fall 2019, TUMC
will be hosted by the University of Texas at Tyler. The conference focus is on
research done by undergraduate students or in conjunction with undergraduates.
This conference offers undergraduates the opportunity to see the research being
done by their peers and to start the transition into the larger community of
mathematical research.

Now in its 15th year, the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC)
seeks to provide students with a forum to present their work, to discover
research opportunities, and to learn more about graduate school and non-academic
careers in mathematics. Conference attendees often come from groups that are
underrepresented at research conferences: TUMC recruits many students from
community colleges, Hispanic serving institutions, historically black colleges
and universities, and institutions having at least 40% first generation college
students. As part of this vital link between underserved undergraduate students
and the mathematical research community, TUMC will be run without any associated
cost for undergraduate participants. This support is meant to increase
participation from institutions with limited resources, such as community
colleges. The Executive Committee for TUMC will also expand their efforts in
collecting demographic information to include information about the research
activities of student and faculty participants. In particular, they will
investigate the ways in which the uptake of research activities occurs in the
year after attending TUMC. Additional information about the conference can be
found on the website: http://sections.maa.org/texas/tumc/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
