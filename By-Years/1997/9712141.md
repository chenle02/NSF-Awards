9712141 Takacs This grant investigates the mechanochemical processes involved in
the initiation of combustion by ball milling. When a highly exothermic powder
mixture is milled, the mechanical agitation ignites a self-sustained combustion
after an activation time. Milling is the ideal tool with which to study the
mechanism of mechanochemical reactions because the ignition phase is a well-
defined critical state in the activation process. The theoretical modeling
includes consideration of the initiation of combustion by single collisions of
the milling balls and the propagation of the combustion front away from the
impact sites. The modeling of ignition is supported by experimental studies of
the interrupted combustion effect, the mutual suppression of combustion in a
mixture of combustive powders, and the repeated combustion effect. Reactions
with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium and the formation of chalcogenides are
among the reactions to be examined. Measurements include the temperature of the
milling vial and activation times to combustion. X-ray diffraction and electron
microscopy are used to characterize the powder at different stages of the
process with emphasis on samples taken just prior to combustion. The thermal
ignition of combustion and the relaxation of activated samples are studied by
differential thermal analysis and heating curve measurements. %%% The initiation
of chemical reactions by ball milling is used in several technologies, including
the preparation of metastable alloys, refractory powders, and nanocrystalline
materials. Further advancements depend on improved fundamental understanding of
the complex processes involved. ***
