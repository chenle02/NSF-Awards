This award supports research into the theoretical and experimental foundation
required to organize and orient particles dispersed in a fluid medium into
specific patterns, using the forces associated with an ultrasound wave field.
The research specifically focuses on using multi-frequency rather than single-
frequency ultrasound wave fields to enable assembling arbitrary, non-periodic
patterns of particles. A host of engineering applications could benefit from
this research, including particle and cell separation processes, mixing and
dispersion control of suspensions, non-contact particle manipulation, and
manufacturing of engineered composite materials with tailored properties.
Fundamental theory to optimize the parameters (amplitude, phase, and set of
frequencies) to assemble any pattern of spherical particles in multiple
dimensions will be developed. Broadening participation of underrepresented
groups in STEM education will be promoted by partnering with the Center for
Enhancement of Engineering Diversity at Virginia Tech and contributing to the
Computers and Technology summer camp and the Womenâ€™s Preview
Weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to
theoretically derive and experimentally validate the scientific foundation that
enables organizing and orienting particles dispersed in a fluid medium into any
periodic or non-periodic pattern, utilizing the forces associated with a multi-
frequency ultrasound wave field. A theoretical and experimental study will be
implemented that covers four technical thrusts to solve this problem. They
include: 1) derivation of multi-frequency ultrasound directed self-assembly
(DSA) theory for both spherical and high aspect ratio particles, 2) experimental
validation of the multi-frequency ultrasound DSA theory, 3) integration of
multi-frequency ultrasound DSA with vat-polymerization AM to demonstrate proof-
of-concept of manufacturing polymer matrix composite materials with tailored
properties, and 4) packaging the knowledge resulting from this research in an
open-source software tool to make it accessible for other users. Together, the
outcomes of these four research thrusts will describe the physical underpinnings
of ultrasound DSA based on multi-frequency wave fields. The results of this
award will advance discovery, implementation, and deployment of external field
DSA methods, and control of organization and orientation of particulates within
multiphase mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
