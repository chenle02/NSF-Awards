Abstract:

Wenzl is continuing his study of tensor categories related to quantum groups and
conformal field theory, with a particular emphasis on their connection with
subfactors. Braided tensor categories related to classical Lie groups can be
conveniently studied via Hecke algebras and q-versions of Brauer algebras, also
called BMW algebras. Wenzl plans to study the question whether categories
related to exceptional Lie groups can similarly be described via suitable braid
representations. Moreover, a detailed knowledge of such braid representations,
combined with additional categorical constructions, such as the double
construction, might also be useful for understanding various exotic subfactors.

Physical systems usually have symmetries which can be expressed via groups and
their representations. In recent years, one has encountered new situations in
confomal field theory with a highly nontrivial tensor product operation called
fusion. Unlike the group case, it is no longer symmetric, but only braided.
Moreover, the numbers which naturally occur as 'dimensions' of representations
of the symmetries are no longer integers. This is a situation very familiar in
the theory of von Neumann algebras. Wenzl plans to study the above mentioned
symmetries in the context of von Neumann algebras. He will mainly consider
algebras generated by unitary representations of braid groups. Such
representations are comparatively rare, and hence provide a good tool for
classifying models of the type mentioned above.
