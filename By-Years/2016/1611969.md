The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier
international conference in information theory, the scientific discipline that
studies the mathematical foundations of reliable communications, whether by
telephony, television, wireless or optical systems, and the fundamental limits
of data storage, such as CDs, DVDs, flash drives, or other semiconductor media.
The symposium series has run since 1954, originally every two years, and yearly
since 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students form an integral part of the
Information Theory community, and the IEEE Information Theory Society continues
to promote student participation, including the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student
Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information
Theory Society Student Committee. In recent years, students comprise about one-
third of the participants to ISIT, and the travel funds offered through this
award will support the attendance at the 2016 ISIT by students enrolled in a
graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have
been accepted for presentation.
