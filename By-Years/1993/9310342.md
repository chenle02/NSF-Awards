9310342 Stahl This U.S.-Argentina Program award will support the collaboration
of Philip Stahl of Washington University and Luis Mayorga of the University of
Cuyo in Mendoza, Argentina. The project aims to advance knowledge of
phagocytosis, a receptor-mediated process carried out by eucaryotic cell types
specializing in host defense. The project will explore mechanisms whereby
phagosomes, containing newly internalized materials, fuse with the appropriate
intracellular vesicles (endosomes) to achieve targeting of the endocytosed
materials. This is an important process for eukaryotic cells, with broad
implications for such diverse processes as food uptake in unicellular organisms,
vertebrate immune functions, the function of retinal photoreceptors in vision,
and general homeostasis in multicellular organisms. The U.S. group will focus on
the reconstitution of fusion events in permeabilized cell preparations and in
identifying protein factors. The Argentine group will use magnetic latex spheres
to purify phagosomes and to determine the role of receptors in intracellular
fusion events. ***
