This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at East Carolina University. The focus of the site is on the
foundations, tools, and applications of software testing. Software testing is
widely used to ensure the quality of software systems. Improvements to the
foundations, tools, and applications of software testing will help improve the
quality of software systems and reduce the cost of software development. The
site will provide undergraduate students with research experience in software
testing and give them a solid research foundation by participating in
activities, such as developing solutions and algorithms for fundamental issues
in software testing, developing tools to improve testing effectiveness and
performance, and testing complex real systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site
will provide the opportunity for 30 undergraduate students over three years to
participate in a supportive environment that encourages them to pursue graduate
studies in computer science. The REU project will also provide students an
opportunity to collaborate with their faculty mentors and/or student peers after
the summer program.
