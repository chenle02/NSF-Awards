The project proposes a study that examines how social and professional networks
mediate the conversion of women's qualifications to career outcomes and
specifically addresses how and why do networks matter for women's career
outcomes in science and engineering. The study proposes a two-phase approach:
(1) conduct a baseline national survey of scientists and engineers in six STEP
fields; (2) conduct a network analysis of "critical mentors" aimed at uncovering
the networks that emerge around key faculty. The two-stage design will provide
detailed multi-level quantitative data for statistically modeling and rich
qualitative evidence that enhance the quantitative analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
