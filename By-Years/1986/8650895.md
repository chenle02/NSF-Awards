The goal of this project is to integrate into the chemistry laboratory
curriculum multi-element Fourier transform NMR capability. Acquisition of an
80-MHz Fourier transform NMR will facilitate the research efforts of the
undergraduate chemistry majors, and will allow students to measure and interpret
NMR spectra of a number of elements besides hydrogen, such as carbon-13,
phosphorus-31, and cobalt-59. Students will be introduced to FT-NMR with routine
applications in the introductory organic chemistry laboratory, and will progress
in more advance courses through increasingly sophisticated and specialized
applications of this powerful experimental tool. Chemistry students will first
use the instrument independently in the sophomore-level course Synthesis of
Chemical Compounds. In the course Interpretive Spectroscopy, the FT-NMR will
provide students with rigorous experience in the application of NMR spectra to
structural problems. In laboratory courses in Chemical Analysis, Chemical
Instrumentation, and Physical Measurements, students will study and exploit fast
Fourier transform techniques and the computer capability of the instrument.
Through this new experimental capability, the instrument will produce a
significant improvement in chemistry education at Juniata College.
