This project is concerned with performance optimization of high- speed
synchronous digital circuits It addresses the application of timing
optimizations to pipelines and general sequential circuits in high-performance
systems. The core of the research effort is directed towards the method of
retiming at the gate level. Retiming is a sequential logic optimization
technique that repositions memory elements, namely, edge-triggered flip-flops
and level-triggered latches, within a circuits to optimize the timing behavior
of the circuit. The use of retiming optimization methods, chiefly device sizing,
is also being investigated. Under the educational part of this project, the PI
is incorporating CAD techniques in the undergraduate program from the sophomore
level by the use of CAD tools in teaching. At the graduate level, he is involved
in developing courses, the supporting existing courses, and in advising graduate
students. He is also exposing undergraduates to his research for a better
appreciation of the state of the art, and to motivate them towards higher
education. he is also contributing towards outreach activities by focusing
towards distance education through teaching courses to sites in the state of
Iowa via television, and around the country through the medium of satellite.
