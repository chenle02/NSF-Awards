Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Existing petrologic and geochemical data for Ross
Island volcanic centers are sparse and outdated, with the exception of the well-
studied Mt. Erebus stratovolcano. Therefore, understanding of the genesis,
evolution and tectonic context of alkaline magmatism on Ross Island is extremely
limited. The PIs propose to conduct a field and laboratory based geochemical,
isotopic, and petrologic study to investigate alkaline volcanism across the
entirety of Ross Island. This study will provide: state-of-the-art isotopic
abundances of Nd, Sr, Hf and Pb; pre-eruptive volatile concentrations as
determined in melt inclusion studies; petrological and mineralogical
information, and major and trace element concentrations for samples from Mt.
Terror, Mt.Bird and Hut Point Peninsula. When combined with the published
compositional and isotopic data from Mount Erebus, and the published Ar-Ar ages
from Ross Island, these data will provide essential information on the nature of
the mantle source and the processes and causes of magma genesis beneath Ross
Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal will
train two PhD students, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups,
promote and enhance secondary educational experiences in a formal class room
setting, and encourage new investigators to become involved in USAP. The
proposed research includes a collaboration with ENS, Lyon, France. This study
will also establish a suite of well-described and geochemically well-
characterized samples available to other researchers.
