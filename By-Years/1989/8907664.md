The recently discovered high temperature superconductors exhibit many novel
magnetic effects. This has caused physicists to revisit the intimate connections
between magnetism and superconductivity. The proposed research will look at the
static and dynamic properties of quantum antiferromagnets which characterize
LaCuO. Also, theoretical studies of thin film granular superconductors are
characterized by two energy scales: a scale at which the amplitude of the order
parameter developes and a second scale at which phase coherence develops across
the entire sample. Research on these systems requires novel ideas concerning
quantum fluctuations of the phase order parameter. The final reserach thrust
will look at Mott insulators using a principle of local gauge invariance to
understand transitions from the insulating state to a metallic or
superconducting one.
