This project will use number theory from mathematics for application to waveform
design for radar, sonar and communications signals. Typical applications are in
public key cryptography, image processing, and frequency hopping techniques. The
research will examine GOLOMB conjectures A, B and C as found in the scientific
literature referenced in the research proposal. The principal investigator
expects to prove conjecture A and to give as complete a proof as possible for
conjectures B and C. He recently proved conjecture D (there exists a primitive
quadratic of trace 1 over every finite field GF ( ) -- a polynominal x -x+g over
GF ( ) whose roots are primitive elements of GF ( )) and intends to extend that
to a new Conjecture D .
