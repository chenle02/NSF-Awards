The occurrence of a Class F4 "devastating tornado" in the old-growth forest of
the Tionesta Scenic Area provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of
catastrophic wind disturbance on forest regeneration. Such events, although
critical to the organization of mesic broadleaved forest, have been studied only
rarely, particularly in old-growth forest. It is proposed that castastrophic
wind disturbance in old-growth forest should produce much patchiness, which will
have a lasting effect on regeneration. The patchiness at several scales,
including the previously unstudied fine scale on which plants become established
and first interact will be measured. How the patterns of patches change will be
determined in close spatial and temporal detail and their biological
significance, using both environmental measurement and experimental modification
of patches will be evaluated. Although the details of patchiness and
regeneration are likely to be unique to each disturbance and site, this research
will provide a mechanistic basis for generalization about catastrophic
disturbances.
