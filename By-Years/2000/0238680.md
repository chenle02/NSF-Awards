The objective of this proposed research is the creation of cell-based sensors of
DNA-damaging agents. Eukaryotic cells have evolved extremely sensitive and rapid
mechanisms to sense and respond to DNA damage. The first stage of this project
will quantitatively determine the dose and time-dependence of DNA damage-
sensitive gene transcription in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in
response to a panel of selected damaging agents. Clusters of genes sensitive and
selective for DNA-damaging agents will serve as the basis for biosensor design.
Next, the damage-regulated genes will be replaced with reporter genes to
facilitate measurement of gene transcription. The third stage of the project
will enhance the sensitivity of the cells to DNA damage by disabling endogenous
DNA damage pathways. Finally, this project will create new laboratory materials
in molecular and cellular bioengineering for undergraduate engineering and high
school students. The labs will illustrate the ability to quantitatively control
how cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering the genetic makeup of the
cells.
