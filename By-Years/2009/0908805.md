This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Steidel will make a detailed study
of the galaxies and gas within a few million light years of bright quasars that
we observe as they were 10 billion years ago. Using the Keck telescopes, he will
take high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectra to measure the absorption
lines of gas lying between us and the quasar. These spectra will target lines of
highly ionized oxygen to trace warm and hot gas, Lyman-beta to measure neutral
hydrogen, and additional lines that probe the chemical abundance and physical
conditions in the gas. These observations will be compared with theoretical
models for the effect that active galactic nuclei such as quasars should have on
their surroundings. Deep optical and near-infrared images will be taken to pick
out galaxies likely to lie close to the quasar. Optical and infrared spectra of
these objects should yield accurate redshifts (and hence distances), dynamical
masses and chemical abundances for about 150 galaxies around each quasar. The
infrared spectroscopy should be particularly effective when the galaxies are
partially obscured by dust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two or three graduate students
will be trained as they participate in the research. Both the published results
and primary data will be made available as soon as possible to the astronomical
community. Dr Steidel is Project Scientist for the MOSFIRE imaging spectrograph
(Multi-Object Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration); this new instrument will
serve the Keck Observatory's large user community.
