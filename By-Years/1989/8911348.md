This is a study of the biochemistry and photochemistry of flavins in seawater.
Flavins are now being found in many parts of the oceanic water column. They hold
potential as being useful biomarkers and water mass tracers, but their potential
can not be exploited until their chemistry in the seawater medium is well
understood. This research project will be focused on laboratory investigations
of this chemistry. Lumichrome, lumiflavin, and riboflavin will be targets of
these studies. Their production, loss, and binding to other organics will be
determined.
