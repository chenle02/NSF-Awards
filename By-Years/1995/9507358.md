9507358 Wourms Viviparity, i.e. giving birth to living young, first evolved
among the vertebrates in fishes. Fishes display an extraordinary diversity of
specializations for viviparity. The transition from oviparity (egg-laying) to
viviparity established a variety of new functional relationships, one of which
involves maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer. Specialized tissues, such as the
placenta, evolved for transfer. Live-bearing goodeid fishes will be used as a
model system to study maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer across a structure
known as the trophotaenial placenta, comprised of the epithelial lining of the
ovary and external projections of the embryonic intestine, termed trophotaeniae.
The cellular basis of maternal-embryonic transfer of nutrients across the
trophotaenial placenta will be characterized using fluorescence and electron
microscopy and immunocytochemistry to trace the uptake, transport, and fate of
proteins. The differentiation of embryonic gut and trophotaenial cells will be
analyzed using fluorescence and electron microscopy. An evolutionary model that
trophotaeniae evolved from embryonic gut tissue by an acceleration of the rates
of cell division and differentiation in the hindgut relative to other regions of
the gut and the overall growth of the embryo will be tested. These studies will
enhance the understanding of viviparity; provide a detailed functional analysis
of placental development in fishes; and contribute to evolutionary biology by
elucidating the evolution of a new organ through modification of embryonic
development. ***
