This award provides partial support for the acquisition of 600 MHz NMR
spectrometer with a cryoprobe accessory. The instrument will be used by six
faculty research groups at the University of Washington, all of whom study
aspects of biomolecular structure, function, and design. The instrument will be
fully equipped to perform multidimensional heteronuclear NMR on biomolecules,
including those that are perdeuterated. In addition to the four-channel
spectrometer, three-axis gradient unit, a cryoprobe accessory will be acquired.
A cryoprobe accessory will significantly enhance the impact of the spectrometer
in two ways: (1) it will allow for faster data collection, and hence more data
collection in a given time frame, for samples that can be produced at reasonable
concentrations (above approx. 0.5 mM), and (2) it will allow data to be
collected on more dilute samples that are currently not amenable to study with
our existing equipment. The higher sensitivity is especially relevant to a
number of ongoing projects that involve designed proteins and large multi-
protein complexes, both of which have limited solubility issues.&lt;br/&gt;
