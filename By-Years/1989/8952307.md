This project upgrades the quality of laboratory instruction in analytical
chemistry at IUP by the purchase of a modern atomic absorption spectrometer.
This project has a beneficial effect on the professional education of all the
students majoring or minoring chemistry or chemical education, as well as on the
medical technology majors and many related fields. Included in this project are
a variety of specific laboratory exercises in flame, electrothermal, and cold-
vapor techniques of atomic absorption spectrometry. Students also sue this
instrument in undergraduate research in projects such as trace heavy metal
analysis of environmental samples and development of new techniques for
preconcentration/speciation of traces of metal species in solution. The
instutution is matching the NLSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
