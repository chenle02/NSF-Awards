9604537 Belanger Many cultivated and wild grass species are hosts to fungal
endophytes of the tribe balansieae. These associations are ecologically and
agronomically significant, yet little is know about the physiological aspects of
the interactions. One benefit for the plant hosts that results from the
interaction is reduced herbivory due to the production of toxic alkaloids by the
endophytes. The investigation targets the physiology of the interaction between
fungus and host grasses in a model system. In particular, the role of a
subtilisin-like proteinase is in the focus of the investigations. This protease
is an abundant protein only when endophytes are present. It is homologous to
proteases that are considered virulence factors in pathogenic interactions
between fungi and plants. The focus of the work is on the expression of the
enzyme, its importance to the mutualistic association and evolutionary
implications of the protease gene family in relation to mutualistic interactions
across kingdoms.
