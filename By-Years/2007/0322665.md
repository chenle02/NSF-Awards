The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History promotes fluency in information
technology through self-directed design experiences for 160 urban minority and
underserved students in middle school. Each student is engaged in at least 180
hours of creative skill building experiences with information technologies in a
wide range of scientific contexts. As part of the project, four design studios
are installed--one at the museum, two at Boys and Girls Clubs and one at the
Applied Learning Academy, a magnet middle school. Each of these organizations
will recruit their own students. A blueprint for design, IT studios and a one-
year basic skills curriculum are developed, evaluated and disseminated as part
of the effort. Engineers from area industries participate in a one-week workshop
to learn how to serve as mentors. Parents are engaged in special activities to
support the youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
