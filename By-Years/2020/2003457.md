How predictable is evolution? Given broadly similar environmental conditions,
does natural selection always favor similar traits and genes? If evolution is
predictable, then humanity will be better able to anticipate evolutionary
changes in diseases, agricultural pests, or species we wish to preserve in the
face of environmental change. This study will examine the degree to which
evolution is predictable. Specifically, the researchers will test whether the
repeated evolution of certain traits in many replicate populations is evidence
of similar natural selection, as has been widely assumed but never tested in
nature. The work has broad scope, integrating environmental, ecological,
morphological, immunological, and genomic data, and so will provide a benchmark
for future studies of evolution. Moreover, the study organism -- the threespine
stickleback fish -- is abundant, diverse, and well-studied, making it an
excellent tool for teaching biology to both K-12 science teachers and their
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study asks the following questions: (1) where
we observe repeated evolution, is natural selection also very similar?, (2) do
immune traits evolve in a predictable manner?, (3) does parallel natural
selection act on the same genomic regions?, (4) how thoroughly can we explain
genetic responses to selection? To answer these questions, the researchers will
place F2 hybrids between lake and stream fish into enclosures in natural
habitats, to measure selection on many traits and genomic loci. By repeating
these measures of selection in four independent lake-stream pairs, they can, for
the first time, evaluate the relationship between parallel selection and
parallel evolution in the wild.
