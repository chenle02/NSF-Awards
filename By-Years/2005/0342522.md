Calder, Bradely&lt;br/&gt;CCF-0342522&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crucial problem for
architecture and systems research involving program simulation is how to
simulate the smallest amount of the program (to gather the results as fast as
possible), and still achieve accurate results representative of the complete
execution of the program. The goal of this proposal is to address this problem
by fully developing techniques using phase analysis to guide efficient and
accurate simulation and program analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our focus is to
create new phase analysis techniques to provide very accurate and efficient
simulation infrastructure for single program, and multi-threaded workloads.
These new phase analysis techniques will also incorporate statistical sampling
to provide a minimal set of simulation points with statistical
guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
