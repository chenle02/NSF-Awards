ABSTRACT 0203586 Johnstone, John U of Alabama @ Birmingham

The work of this proposal can be divided into three categories: (1) the study of
dual representations of the tangent space of a curve and surface, (2) the
application of these dual representations to the computation of bitangency, and
(3) the application of bitangency to several problems in geometric modeling,
computer graphics and robotics such as visibility, lighting and motion. The
problem that binds together these areas of study is bitangency. There are
basically three bitangent structures: the bitangent line (a line that is tangent
to two curves), the bitangent plane (a plane that is tangent totwo surfaces),
and the bitangent developable (the envelope of a familyof bitangent planes).
While the tangent is important in the analysis of individual curves and surfaces
in isolation, the bitangent is important in the analysis of collections of
curves and surfaces, since it relates two curves or two surfaces. As the
analysis of large scenes becomes increasingly important, the bitangent becomes
an important tool.
