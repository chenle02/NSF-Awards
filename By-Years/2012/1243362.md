This award will provide support for the International Neutrino Summer School
(INSS 2012) to be held at Virginia Tech from July 10-21, 2012. The funds will be
used to help support young scientists from US institutions to enable them to
attend the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school aims to serve as a broad
introduction to neutrino physics that covers both accelerator and non-
accelerator neutrino experiments, both neutrino properties and neutrino
interactions, and both theory and experiment. The goal of this series is to
train the next generation of neutrino physicists, and the curriculum covers many
topics: introductions to both the Standard Model and oscillation phenomenology,
accelerator and reactor neutrinos, neutrino cross sections, and neutrinos in
cosmology, just to name a few. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has
a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. The target
audience consists of graduate students and recent post-docs in both theory and
experiment.
