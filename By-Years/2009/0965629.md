Wake Tech is addressing the shortage of qualified STEM technicians in the region
by increasing the number of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) STEM graduates
from six program areas. One hundred and twenty four scholars are to be supported
through two year degree completion. The goals of this grant are; increase the
number of enrolled students graduating from high school in the STEM majors,
reduce the time spent in the degree program to two years, offer valuable
internship and co-op opportunities, and enable academically talented but
financially needy and diverse students to maintain full time enrollment through
completion of the AAS degree.
