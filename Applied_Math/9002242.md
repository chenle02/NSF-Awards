With this award the principal investigator will continue his analytical studies
of free boundary problems using asymptotic methods and he will initiate attempts
to construct efficient numerical schemes for the resolution of interfacial
phenomena. Overall he plans to develop a unified theory of free boundary
problems that arise in phase transitions based upon the Phase Field Model that
he himself has helped to popularize. The principal investigator will consider
progressively realistic models of alloys and contact with external containers.
Many technologically important natural phenomena involve the behavior of
different media along the interfaces or surfaces of contact between them. With
this award the principal investigator will continue his important work on
developing approximate solutions of models of phase transitions using asymptotic
methods and he will begin developing numerical schemes in order to resolve
increasingly complicated interfacial phenomena. This combined asymptotic-
numerical approach should pay big dividends toward understanding the physics of
transition layers and free boundary problems.
