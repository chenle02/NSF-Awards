This project will develop and distribute widely a resource for professional
development providers and science teachers. This is a novel concept because it
will provide a "one-stop-shop" for professional development. The online resource
is a database that brings numerous individual resources together. The user of
this website will locate exemplary lesson plans using a matrix that offers
lessons by concept and research-based best practices. The project helps fill a
void of a centralized site where teachers could go to access high-quality tools.
An existing website will be extended and adapted to provide a matrix for science
teachers to access specific lessons for the purpose of introducing best
practices and models of standards-based instruction. The project team will
expand and test an interactive, web-based tool that customizes professional
development content to district and professional development needs, and connects
best science teaching practices with science content standards and professional
development standards. The online format can be easily disseminated and
available to anyone that has access to the Internet. It could be used
extensively at universities and for classroom teachers.
