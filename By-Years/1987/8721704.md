Continuous profiles of deuterium excess in Holocene snow and ice in Greenland
and Antarctica will be examined and correlated with currently available profiles
of deuterium excess values in polar ice. These include two profiles of surface
snow, one near Crete, Greenland, and one at DYE-3, Greenland, a section of
Wisconsin ice at DYE-3, Greenland, and the Holocene last glacial maximum
transition at Dome C, Antarctica. All of these profiles show clear, systematic
changes in deuterium excess values accompanying changes in the isotope values.
This project will determine the causes of changes in the deuterium excess values
of polar snow and will examine changes in deuterium excess during the glacial to
interglacial transition in Greenland, surface snow along coastal to inland
transects in East Antarctica, seasonal cycles in East Antarctica, and modern
vapor evaporating in the North Atlantic Ocean.
