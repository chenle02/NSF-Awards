The objective of this study is to examine the mechanics and physics of cracking
in single crystal and polycrystalline freshwater/saline ice, and develop the
mechanics of fracture appropriate to interpreting these events in ice. The
influence of loading rate, temperature, loading configuration, and
microstructure are to be determined. The primary focus will be whether creep or
plastic deformation leads to crack tip blunting in ice. To provide information
on the role of the microstructure and the physics and mechanisms of fracture, an
etch pits technique will be used as well as optical microcopy and the scanning
electron microscope. The micromechanical and physical information, as well as
petrographic tensile strength, flexural strength, fracture energy, fracture
toughness, and compressive strength.//
