The investigator proposes extensions of existing asymptotic distributional
theories for M- and Z-estimations in the semiparametric models with separated
parameters to accommodate situations where the estimation criteria for the
semiparametric models are parameterized with bundled parameters, i.e. the
infinite dimensional parameter is an unknown function of the parameter of
interest. The proposal is motivated by several statistical problems including
the efficient estimation in the linear regression model with censored data under
several different censoring mechanisms, the efficient estimation in the single
index model, the partial likelihood estimation in the Cox regression model with
an unknown link function, and the weighted estimation for missing data problems
in survival analysis. The investigator also proposes to apply the general theory
for bundled parameters to all these problems, particularly for the case that the
infinite dimensional nuisance parameter is approximated by regression splines.

The proposed research is primarily motivated by PI's collaboration in biomedical
studies, where more robust statistical modeling techniques are desirable to
reduce the uncertainty of model misspecification, particularly when data are
incomplete due to limited study follow-up. The proposed research will also allow
the investigator to add more thorough statistical results to the course of
advanced survival analysis and be helpful in developing the special topic course
on semiparametric models into a regular Ph.D. level course. The proposed
research activities will motivate graduate students to become independent
researchers who are able to engage in fundamental statistical research.
