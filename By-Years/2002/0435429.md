NeTS - NR: Protocols and Algorithms for Cooperative Wireless

0435429&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike wired
networks, the information transfer in radio networks is inherently of a
broadcast nature, due to the properties of electromagnetic propagation in the
radio spectrum. Therefore, each data transmission impinges upon multiple nodes,
even if they are not the intended destination. The effects of this interference
are felt at the physical layer as well as data link, MAC, and network layers.
Cooperative communication strives to turn this liability into an asset by
treating interference as an additional source of information. The information
transmitted across one wireless link, due to the broadcast nature of radio, is
(partially and randomly) available to other nodes beside the intended
destination. This additional information, distributed throughout the network,
may be exploited in a gainful manner. In other words, cooperative communication
exploits the statistical variation of the link signal-to-noise ratios, together
with the inherent broadcast nature of radio, to yield a more efficient
communication system. This research (1) analyzes the impact of physical layer
cooperation on the higher layers and (2) develops methods and algorithms to
realize the benefit of cooperation in the data link layer, MAC layer, and the
network layer. The impact of this research includes lower node power consumption
and thus longer battery life, lower radiated power leading to smaller energy
node footprint, higher network throughput, and more flexible allocation of
network resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
