This project concerns an investigation into the use of multiple autonomous
vehicles cooperating to accomplish a set of tasks. It also includes the use of a
smart imaging system capable of analyzing video data in order to direct the
autonomous vehicles and obtain new knowledge about the environment. The program
is directed at investigating the research issues which allow the development of
such a system. A field demonstration is planned which would evaluate the program
results by utilizing the EAVE vehicles to perform in-water testing. Success in
this program will provide significant advances in understanding the problems
associated with multiple cooperating vehicles. It will also provide a new tool
for ocean science, a method of acquiring high-quality video and photographic
data for better understanding the ocean environment.
