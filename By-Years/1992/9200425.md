Berry College will conduct an interesting research project, attractive for
undergraduate students of biology and geology alike. The field of ichnology (the
study of trackways and footprints) has enjoyed a dramatic resurgence. This
research on locomotor patterns blends the study of modern and ancient reptilian
quadrupeds in an attempt to improve our understanding of trackmaking processes,
including limb kinematics, vertebrate morphology, and the effects of substrate
texture and levels of hydration on footprint form and step cycle. By
establishing an empirical database of living forms, it will give added credence
to the examination and interpretations of fossil trackways.
