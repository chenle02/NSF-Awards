Vanderbilt University has been connected to NSFNET for two years, and now has
invited five Nashville institutions to share that connection. Two are
historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that emphasize
teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year technological school.
Expected benefits of an NSFNET connection include file transfers, electronic
mail communication between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and
use of supercomputers and other research facilities. In addition, the local
institutions have access to Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to
the diversity of resources Vanderbilt can offer its students. Cross-
registration, software sharing and other benefits also are expected to result
from the proposed network.
