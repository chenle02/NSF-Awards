This project entails the development and use of methods to calculate the
properties of neutron matter, nuclear matter, and atomic nuclei, with
applications to both nuclear structure and to astrophysical systems such as
neutron stars. The Schroedinger equation is solved in imaginary time using Monte
Carlo sampling techniques to deal with the large dimensionality of these quantum
mechanical systems. Both space and spin coordinates are sampled to allow the
method to be applied to large systems of order 100 particles. Accurate two-body
potentials and empirical three-body potentials are used to describe the nuclear
forces. &lt;br/&gt;Important aspects of this work include the development of
techniques to study the pairing transition that leads to superfluidity in
neutron matter; the study of the structure of large nuclei; and eventually to be
able to treat hot nuclear matter. The project also will support and train a
graduate student in nuclear many-body theory.
