One of the strangest aspects of quantum mechanics is quantum measurement. Rather
than simply revealing information about a system, a quantum measurement causes
an unpredictable disturbance in the system's state, and it is impossible to gain
information about a quantum system without disturbing it. There are weak
measurements that cause little disturbance, but these must inevitably also
reveal very little information. A sequence of weak measurements, one after
another, produces a continuous measurement, where both information and
disturbance accumulate over time. This project concerns weak and continuous
quantum measurements, and combines them with feedback, where the accumulated
information is used to adapt the measurements while they are being done. These
methods have many applications, to quantum computers, high-precision
measurements (or metrology) and other quantum technologies. They also provide a
powerful theoretical tool for understanding quantum
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will study many aspects of weak and
continuous quantum measurements, but will focus on three areas in particular. 1)
Destructive (or lossy) weak measurements: many physical systems---such as light
---cannot be easily measured except by being absorbed. Current technology
includes only a limited set of quantum measurements of light; anything that
extends this set would be an exciting development. 2) Continuous quantum error
correction: quantum computers are highly susceptible to noise, or decoherence.
These techniques would continuously monitor a quantum computer and reverse
errors as they occur, perhaps even preventing them by the quantum Zeno effect.
3) Quantum resource theories: resource theories study properties of quantum
systems, like entanglement, coherence and free energy, that can be exploited for
useful tasks. Continuous measurement theory can quantify resources using
monotones, which diminish or increase steadily as the resource is consumed,
analogous to how entropy grows with time in the second law of thermodynamics.
Many more interesting properties and uses of weak quantum measurements are
expected to appear in the course of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
