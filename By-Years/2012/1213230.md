With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is
funding Professor Marisa C. Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pennsylvania to explore the development of methods for the
formation of C-C, C-N, and C-O bonds by facile oxidative reactions. While
dimerizations of phenol derivatives are abundant in biological systems, little
progress has been made in the development of laboratory methods for the
catalytic asymmetric formation of biaryls via oxidative dimerization. Studies to
further elucidate the mechanism of this complex catalytic cycle will be
undertaken. Higher homologs with interesting material/sensor properties, such as
chiral bisnaphthoquinones, bisanthraquinones, and bisphenazines, will be
generated using the developed methods and will be studied. The broader impacts
involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, broadening participation through the inclusion of underrepresented
populations as researchers on the project, and continuing to build a
groundbreaking program in high throughput experimentation that can be utilized
routinely in a teaching environment. This work could lead to more efficient
methods for the preparation of this class of molecules. Such chemistry will
contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as oxygen is
used as the terminal oxidizing agent. Successful development of the methodology
will have a broad impact as there is an important need for synthetic methods in
areas ranging from the pharmaceutical, chemical, materials science, and
agricultural industries to basic biological and chemical research endeavors. In
addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from
undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically
underrepresented in the sciences.
