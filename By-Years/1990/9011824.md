This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of inorganic chemistry. Dr. Nita A. Lewis of the Chemistry Department of
the University of Miami will study electron transfer in diferrocenes and
4,4'-bipyridine-bridged ruthenium complexes under high pressure conditions.
Because the intervalence charge transfer band of these species is solvent
dependent, it is expected that high pressure measurements could yield
information on the role of the solvent in electron transfer reactions. Two
graduate students will participate in the project. Dr. Lewis has recently begun
high pressure studies and this award will assist her in pursuing her goal of
establishing a laboratory for high pressure research in inorganic chemistry in
the United States.
