The objective of this research is to understand the effects of morphology on the
crystallization of silicon carbide nanowires and the performance of field effect
transistors based on the same. Nanowire transistors are of interest for use in
high speed computers among other applications. The nanowire dimensions will be
systematically varied to investigate the effect on recrystallization
temperature. Transistors will then be fabricated with these nanowires and
performance characteristics will be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this project is an increased understanding of annealing
and crystallization in nanostructures. This work expands on what is known
through a systematic exploration of the effect of diameter and length on such
thermal transitions. In addition, it will elucidate the roles of morphology and
dimensionality in controlling nanostructure crystallization, and extend our
knowledge beyond nanostructures based on elemental solids to those based on
compounds. The results of this can be applied to numerous other
nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is to enable the
incorporation of nanoelectronics into integrated circuits without requiring
significant and costly redesign of existing manufacturing lines. The combined
performance advantages of nanowire transistors vs. conventional devices and the
ability of silicon carbide to operate at high power levels and high temperatures
would be of substantial benefit to the aerospace, automotive, defense, power and
telecommunications industries. The demonstration of a method to easily enable
commercial scale implementation would have a significant impact on the
competitiveness of the semiconductor industry internationally. Students involved
in this project will gain exposure to advanced nanoelectronics fabrication
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
