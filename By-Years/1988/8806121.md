Programming languages with higher-order functions (like ML or scheme) have a
flexible abstraction mechanism, but in the implementation of these languages the
abstraction is almost always evaluated at runtime. This project examines a way
to use the same abstraction mechanism (higher-order functions) for both compile-
time and runtime abstraction This has the advantage that the programmer needs to
use only one method; more importantly, the programmer no longer needs to
constantly decide whether phrases are to be evaluated at compile-time or
runtime.
