The primary purpose of this doctoral dissertation improvement award is to
explore the relationship between dietary specia lization and the structure of
primate dentition and masticatory musculature. Understanding the mechanics of
mastication is a central issue of anthropological research for it allows a
better appreciation of the relationships of animals to their environments.
Additionally, such understanding can lead to clearer interpretations of the
fossil record of primate and human evolution; a record which often consists of
teeth. This study will test the relationships between form and function of
primate dentition by measuring bite forces at a variety of positions along the
dental arcade in a number of primate taxa. Additionally, three-dimensional
coordinate data will be collected for numerous primates in order to determine
the covariation among biomechanically important dimensions. Closely related
species which differ in dietary specialization will be tested. This will allow
the testing of hypotheses regarding the relationship of diet to anatomy.
