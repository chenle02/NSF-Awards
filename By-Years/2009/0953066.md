Collections of distributions arise naturally when analyzing large data sets.
Since it is impractical to store all but a small fraction of such data,
distributional representations are typically used to summarize the data in
compact form. For example, a document in a corpus is typically represented by a
normalized vector of frequencies of occurrence of keywords, an image is
represented by a histogram over gradient features and speech signals are
represented by spectral densities over a frequency
domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representing data sets as collections of
distributions enables analysis via powerful concepts from statistics, learning
theory and information theory. Concepts like strength of belief, information
content, and pattern likelihood are used to extract meaning and structure from
the data and are quantified using information measures like the Kullback-Leibler
distance and its parent class, the Bregman
divergences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These measures capture meaning in data in a
manner that traditional metrics cannot, by connecting abstract notions of
information loss and transfer with concrete geometric notions like distances.
However, they lack properties like symmetry and the triangle inequality that are
essential requirements for the application of traditional geometric algorithms
for data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will develop a
systematic, rigorous and global algorithmic framework for manipulating these
distances. This framework will provide the foundation for efficient and accurate
data analysis of spaces of distributions, and will lead to deeper insights into
analysis problems across a wide range of applications.
