A core group of mathematics and science content and education faculty from the
University of Delaware, Delaware State University, and Delaware Technical
Community College are collaborating with K- 12 teachers in an initial effort to
reform ten existing courses that make up parts of the pre-service teacher
preparation programs at these three institutions. Work is also planned on three
new courses for in-service teachers. In this project K-12 teachers will work
with higher education faculty, leading to the development of a K-16 community of
mathematics and science educators, dedicated to the continual improvement of its
pre-service teacher preparation programs. These reform efforts also leverage the
considerable momentum towards reform engendered by the Delaware State Systemic
Initiative project.
