The objective of this project is to develop a better understanding of the
relationships between the design features of tangible user interfaces (TUIs),
the gestures used when thinking about creative tasks, and creative problem
solving. There is an increasing interest in developing tangible user interfaces
to digital environments that has resulted in a large number of graspable
interactive devices. This project seeks correlations between tangible computing
and cognition, and more specifically, with creative cognition, and then uses
that correlation to impact the design of environments for tangible interaction.
One hallmark of creative problem solving is the ability to solve a problem by
recognizing its similarity to another already solved problem, particularly if
the problems appear dissimilar on the surface, but share an underlying
structure. The act of recognizing that two superficially different problems are
analogous requires a key creative step, which can be characterized as making a
mental leap. TUIs may facilitate a mental leap in creative problem solving by
enhancing perception and therefore cognition of spatial or structural
similarities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project,
arising from the synthesis of the results of the observation and design sessions
are: a methodology for studying children's activities while they use TUIs that
has two parts: observation and design; a reusable coding scheme for observation
data that is based on research in tangible computing, gesture and thought, and
creativity; and design principles for tangible devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The results of this project can be used
to develop motivating learning technology for children and adults that encourage
learning in non-traditional ways. The project will also have an impact on public
and professional understanding of the role of tangible computing in education
through an association with the University of Maryland HCILab activities and
their association with pubic radio. The proposed project has benefits to society
more broadly by focusing on the importance of creativity in education and
learning, which leads to a more innovative and competitive society.
