9709654 Horch The long term goal of this project is to understand how humans
perceive and control finger movements. It is known that humans judge the
position of their limbs using length information derived from stretch receptors
in the muscles which move the joints. The specific goal of this study is to
ascertain what kind of information about the position of the finger is available
from the lengths of the muscles that activate it. To do so, three questions will
be addressed. Is proprioception in the fingers degraded by the fact that the
extrinsic muscles of the hand cross multiple joints? Despite slack trade-offs,
can useful information about finger tip locations, as distinct from joint angle,
be extracted from finger muscles? Is the anatomy of the finger optimized to
stabilize the location of the finger tip with only two tendons? ***
