The E. coli genome analysis efforts are likely to be the first which will
achieve a complete sequence analysis of a free-living organism. The extensive
genetic, physiological and biochemical analysis of E. coli make this the best
defined of all organisms. It is critical to integrate these bodies of
information. This meeting will be held on September 10-14, 1992, in Madison WI,
bringing together leading researchers, in the analysis of genomes at the
genetic, evolutionary, and sequence levels, and will facilitate the coordination
of the structural and functional analysis of this organism's genome. Databases
and sequence technology and analysis will be emphasized.
