This award supports participation in the Mathematics and Computation in Music
conference (MCM) held in Atlanta, Georgia, June 21-24, 2022. The meeting
continues the tradition of biennial international conferences through the
Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music held on alternating sides of
the Atlantic. The conference brings together researchers from around the world
who combine mathematics or computation with music theory, music analysis,
composition, and performance. MCM provides a unique platform for the
communication and exchange of ideas among researchers in these areas. Conference
participants who are researchers in mathematics and computation will carry out
interactive sessions for the public at the Museum of Design Atlanta. The
conference also includes public concerts every evening, some of them with
comments, explanations, and visual accompaniment, which will exemplify and
enhance the scientific program.

Questions about variation, similarity, enumeration, and classification of
musical structures have long intrigued both musicians and mathematicians.
Mathematical models can be found for almost all levels of musical activities,
from composition to sound production by traditional instruments or by digital
means. On the other hand, mathematicians have found stimulating relations within
applications of mathematics to established musical relations, which have led to
interesting open questions in mathematics and to techniques for solving existing
ones. For example, structures such as maximally even sets, developed in the
context of mathematical music theory, have found applications in the Ising model
in physics, and musical tiling canons have contributed to advances in the
Fuglede conjecture for small dimensions. The use of artificial intelligence and
machine learning to achieve, for instance, human-like jazz improvisation shows
the close relation between mathematical music theory and the cognitive sciences.
The articles that result from the MCM conference will be published in the
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. The articles have
undergone a strict peer review process and will be presented either as talks
(12-page articles) or posters (6-page articles). There will also be plenary
talks and panel sessions specifically designed to formalize and integrate the
relatively young field of modern mathematical music theory. The research
highlighted at the meeting brings innovations not only in the mathematical and
computational sciences, with new theorems and applications of abstract theories,
the creation of computational models and software, etc., but also makes an
impact on different areas within music, such as performance, musicology, music
teaching, and music cognition.
