The focus of this research is the use of SF5-containing epoxides and acrylates
as photopolymerizable synthons for the production of durable polymer films and
coatings. The synthons, in small concentrations, will partition to interfaces
and create fluorine enriched overlayers. Targeted epoxides and acrylates will be
synthesized from SF5-iodides, olefins, acylfluorides and alcohols. The structure
of the films will be determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
infrared analysis, while film properties, including refractive index, dielectric
constant and surface energy will also be measured. With this new award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary L. Gard of the
Department of Chemistry at Portland State University. Professor Gard will focus
his work on using new and unique fluorinated photopolymerizable synthons to form
new durable polymer films and coatings. Fluorinated films and coatings possess
high dielectric strength, low refractive index and excellent environmental
stability.
