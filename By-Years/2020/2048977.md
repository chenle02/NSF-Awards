Collaborative Research: Dignity and the Movement of Displaced
Populations&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Margaret E. Peters &amp; Yang-Yang
Zhou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how civilians
facing high levels of insecurity due to conditions of armed conflict and
economic crisis make decisions whether to leave their country of origin, where
to settle if they decide to leave, and when to return home. This project focuses
on internal values, such as dignity concerns and nationalism, that may influence
this decision-making process in the context of multiple countries where crises
of population displacement are present. The findings of this project will be of
importance to U.S. national security as displacement events have become
increasingly common in the last decade and can destabilize neighboring
countries, including key U.S. allies, and pose complex challenges for
humanitarian aid policies to affected populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While
existing scholarship focuses largely on how economic and security factors shape
displacement decisions, this project theorizes that civilians seek to restore a
sense of dignity regarding their family and professional life when making such
decisions. As a result, they will compare the prospects of restoring dignity by
leaving their home and locating in a new country with the prospects of
rebuilding dignity at home. To test this argument, the project will conduct
statistical analyses of original data collected from a series of survey studies
of civilians in different countries along with behavioral games. This research
will make significant contributions to scholarly literatures on individual and
household crisis decision making in situations of displacement as well as
research on humanitarian aid and response policy spanning multiple social
science disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
