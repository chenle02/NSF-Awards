This research program deals with the performance prediction, design, and scale
up of extraction columns for reactive and non-reactive solvent extractions. To
fulfill the objectives of the research, the analysis of mechanically agitated
reactive dispersions in extraction columns will be undertaken with account being
taken of: (1) droplet rate processes of coalescence and redispersion (2)
macroscopic flow patterns of both phases (3) microscopic interphase transport
processes (4) extraction equilibrium and chemical kinetics The results of the
research will enable a more effective and reliable design of extractors to meet
the increased demands on separation power, selectivity, performance prediction,
and scale up of process equipment for important advanced technologies such as
biochemical separations, dilute waste stream treatment, recovery of
environmentally hazardous substances, nuclear fuel separations, and non-ferrous
metal production through hydrometallurgical solvent extractions.
