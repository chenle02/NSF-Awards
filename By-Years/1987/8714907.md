The textile industry is under severe pressure from foreign competition.
Industry is recognizing that research may help lead the way to alleviate some of
this pressure. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Textiles
offers the potential to provide some help. Clemson University proposes to study
the feasibility and viability of establishing such a Center. This award is to
study the organizational and policy alternatives of the industrial interests in
university research projects, and the potential to form an Industry/university
Cooperative Research Center. The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues
have the necessary expertise and industrial involvement to undertake this
project. This study has been coordinated with Dr. Tapan Mukherjee, Program
Director, Division of Critical Engineering Systems. The Program Manager
recommends that Clemson University be awarded a $25,000 planning grant for a one
(1) year study. All future awards are to be on the basis of a new proposal.
