This project addresses which processes maintain the observed Arctic surface
weather patterns, especially low level wind and sea level pressure; which
processes are key to Arctic surface climate error, and how these processes might
be improved in model simulations. The work plan describes the analyses of
observed and modeled climatologies to determine both local (the distribution of
radiation, temperature, low level cloud cover, and surface properties) and
remote (middle latitude frontal cyclone activity, planetary waves, and
topography-related issues) mechanisms that influence the distribution of Arctic
sea-level pressure and winds, with a view to establishing the surface climate
response. A sequence of models will be employed to identify which fields are the
primary contributors to existing analysis errors. The model runs are expected to
identify how these errors develop and to test model modifications. This research
is expected to benefit the climate modeling community by reducing model
uncertainties, and benefit the wider public by enhancing our knowledge of
climate change issues in the Arctic region and their related global
implications. Two graduate students will be supported by this project.
