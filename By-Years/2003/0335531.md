The Robert Noyce Scholars at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell (UML) are
teacher candidates in Project EXCEL (EXchanging Careers - Enhancing Learning), a
graduate program that addresses the need to attract well-qualified science,
mathematics, and engineering career-change individuals into the teaching
profession. Thirty science, mathematics, and engineering career-changers (ten
each year) are being recruited into the program. They receive full scholarships
to complete a Master of Education degree and Initial Licensure in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. While completing their graduate degree and
licensure, Project EXCEL scholarship recipients work full-time for two years in
partner, urban school districts under the guidance of a Triad of advisors that
includes a College of Arts and Sciences faculty member, a College of Education
faculty member, and a school-based mentor. The three cohorts of scholarship
recipients meet periodically to offer support and guidance to one another.

Project EXCEL is carrying out research into the content and pedagogical needs of
new science and mathematics teachers. They are examining the impact of the work
of these new teachers on the science and mathematics knowledge, disposition and
skills of the middle and high school students they serve. They are also
conducting a longitudinal study of the work of the scholarship recipients.
