The computer science department at the University of Texas at El Paso will
acquire a department infrastructure of computers and network equipment that will
support the group's principal research areas in high-assurance systems and high-
performance computing as well as a broad range of educational programs. Research
in high-assurance systems includes computer security topics such as network
protocols, encryption, anonymizing data sets, electronic voting and electronic
money; software engineering for large-scale systems, software tools for Web
Services; and usablility and documentation studies. Research in high-performance
computing includes performance analysis, self-organizing systems, and
computational chemistry applications. Broader impacts of this project include
supporting the department as it begins a PhD program, reaching a significant
group of minority computer science students, positioning the department to
prepare for NSA designation as a Center of Excellence in Information Assurance,
and increasing the capability of the department and its students for
experimental research.
