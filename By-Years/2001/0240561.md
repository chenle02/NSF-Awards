Proposal Number: CTS-0240561&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: P.R.V. Tassel and
G.U. Lee&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation Wayne State U.&lt;br/&gt;Title A workshop on
Nanoscale Science and Engineering: Common Challenges and Integrative
Opportunities Across Areas of Research, Programming, and
Industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
workshop is on Nanscale Science and Engineering (NSE) to explore the common
challenges faced by the researchers in this area. The goal is to foster
interaction among researchers from academia as well as industry working in
different NSE areas. The format of the workshop is panel discussion to be held
concurrently with the 2002 Annual AIChE meeting on November 3-8 in Indianapolis,
IN. In addition to the objectives outlined above, the workshop will serve to
provide an opportunity for the AIChE attendees to broaden their awareness of the
scope of NSE.&lt;br/&gt;
