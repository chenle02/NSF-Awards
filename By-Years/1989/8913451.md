The program for wider application of the d.c. superconducting quantum
interference device (d.c. SQUID) for the detection of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
at high magnetic fields and toward zero field is to be implemented. The
resonance detection of surface nuclear spins and the spectroscopy of nuclear
coupled spins in powdered solids is to be extended to various materials at
varying temperatures. A scheme for detection of surface coupled nuclear
quadrupole moments on rare earth doped single crystal surface by an optical
pumping method will be carried out.
