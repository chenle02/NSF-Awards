This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The investigator studies factors that are relevant to the
low-frequency variability of atmospheric and oceanic flows and that play a role
in climate changes. He focuses on three sources of atmospheric and oceanic
variability: the wind-driven ocean circulation, the thermohaline circulation,
and the El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO). The study involves, on the one
hand, applications of existing mathematical theory to the understanding of the
underlying problems, and, on the other hand, the further development of new
mathematical theories -- dynamic transition theory, geometric theory for
incompressible flows, and attractor bifurcation theory -- that are applied to
the physical problems. These new theories also have application to other
problems in nonlinear science and engineering. The main idea of dynamic
transition theory is to search for the full set of transition states, giving a
complete characterization of stability and transition. The set of transition
states -- physical "reality" -- is represented by a local attractor. Following
this line, dynamic transition theory is developed to identify the transition
states and to classify them both dynamically and physically. The project
involves specific collaborations with atmosphere/ocean scientists in different
institutions and includes training of graduate students.

The investigator studies some typical sources of climate variability, which,
independently and interactively, play a significant role in climate changes.
Wind-driven circulation plays a role mostly in the oceans' subannual-to-
interannual variability, the El Nino Southern Oscillations are associated with
interannual variability, and the thermohaline circulation is most important in
decadal-to-millenial variability. The investigator undertakes a careful
fundamental-level examination of these phenomena. Graduate students are involved
in the project. The studies could lead to improved predictions of and new
insights into weather, climate, and environmental phenomena of central
importance to our economy.
