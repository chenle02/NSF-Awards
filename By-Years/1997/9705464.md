9705464 Stephenson This project will make collections of plasmodial slime molds
from soil and leaf litter from island and mainland areas in Central and South
America and the Caribbean. A major question is being addressed: Are tropical
slime molds more or less diverse than temperate ones? The answer to this
question is likely to be very significant for biogeographic and biodiversity
studies of other organisms. In addition, beetles associated with the slime molds
of tropical forests will be collected, because very little is known about the
interaction between the slime molds and these beetles. The U. S. National Fungus
Collections and their database will allow provision of the results of this
project over the WWW. Specialists from Costa Rica and Mexico and their students
will be involved in the research, as will a number of U.S. undergraduates.
