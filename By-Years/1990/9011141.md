The primary purpose of this project is to determine the extent to which new
information about earthquake risks has altered the Bay Area housing market. We
are most interested in determining how much, if any, the value of unreinforced
residential properties has declined as a result of: 1) the earthquake, 2)
anticipated revisions to the region's building codes and 3) public notification
that a structure is seismically unsafe (as required in Palo Alto). A variation
of the hedonic pricing model will be used to measure the Bay Area's willingness
to pay for seismic safety. Repeat sales data obtained from the Society of Real
Estate Appraisers will be analyzed to isolate the effects of risks and
regulations on market values. The results will show: 1) the effects of soils and
structural deficiencies on property values; 2) whether the costs of improving
seismic safety can be recouped by the property owner; 3) the likelihood that
property owners would abandon or convert rental properties rather than comply
with the revised code; and 4) the extent to which policies designed to induce
voluntary compliance, such as those in place in Palo Alto, have produced the
appropriate market signals.
