This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry - a classical subject
studying the solutions to systems of polynomial equations. The current project
addresses four problems providing exciting interfaces between complex geometry
and string theory and quantum physics. The first problem aims to build a toolbox
of Hodge theoretic techniques for computing invariants of complex projective
varieties related to higher homotopy. The second explores the limits of the
classical Shafarevich uniformization conjecture in complex geometry. The third
problem proposes an explicit construction of sheaves on a gerby Calabi-Yau
manifold which is fibered by K3 surfaces, and studies its impact on the physical
notion of non-commutative deformation of fields. The fourth project probes the
relationship between the extremal transitions in degenerating families of
Calabi-Yau manifolds, the limiting behavior of integrable systems, and non-
commutative algebraic geometry.

The understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various
linearization procedures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, theoretical
and mathematical physics. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic
structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad
spectrum of applications. The work proposed will be immediately relevant to deep
questions in category theory, combinatorial group theory, the theory of
integrable systems, string theory, quantum gravity and cosmology. The project
proposes concrete interdisciplinary applications to matrix quantum mechanics,
string dualities and particle physics model building.
