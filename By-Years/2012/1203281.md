Doctoral Dissertation Research: Welfare System Transformation in Turkey

Intellectual Merit This research argues that government response to changes in
grassroots politics has been the critical force driving the shift from
employment-based to income-based policies in the Turkish welfare system over the
last four decades. There are three specific hypotheses: (i) welfare institutions
contain and mobilize grassroots groups, (ii) the center of Turkish grassroots
politics has shifted from the formal to informal proletariat, and ethnically
from Turks to Kurds, (iii) the shift from employment-based to income-based
policies is a political response to the shift in grassroots politics. The
research will create a database of grassroots political events in Turkey since
the 1970s using newspaper archives; perform regression analyses of large sample
surveys; conduct grassroots interviews; survey official documents, reports, and
parliament proceedings; and interview office-holders and welfare officials. This
study will contribute to literature on recent welfare system changes, discussing
the under-examined effect of social movements.

Broader Impacts This study will help explain a global trend in welfare policies
through detailed investigation of the Turkish case. It will increase
understanding of political and structural causes of welfare policies and examine
the informal proletariat?s ability to shape government policies. Additionally,
this research will investigate bases of popular support for the Islamic
government in Turkey and illuminate strategies which this pro-globalization
government has pursued vis-Ã -vis domestic political and social challenges.
