Several new formulations are proposed to overcome the multi- frequency and non-
uniqueness problems of the boundary element method in elastodynamics. For the
multi-frequency problem, two improved boundary element techniques are proposed
to make the analysis for an entire frequency spectrum possible and practical.
The first technique is to interpolate the "neutralized" boundary element
coefficient matrices in the frequency domain; the second technique is to
interpolate the Green function in the spatial domain. Both techniques are
suitable for vectorization and parallelization on supercomputers. For the non-
uniqueness problem, two "enhanced CHIEF" methods are proposed to ensure the
uniqueness and accuracy of the boundary element solution for an exterior wave
propagation problem. Vectorized and parallelized codes based on the proposed
formulations will also be made. Application areas include structural vibration,
elastic wave propagation and earth- structure interaction.
