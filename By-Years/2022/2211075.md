Texas A&amp;M University proposes to continue the management of the pool of
marine technicians that has been operating since 2016 for a further five-year
period. Pool members will continue to be employed&lt;br/&gt;as independent
contractors, paid at rates based on experience as determined by the NSF
Program&lt;br/&gt;Manager and UNOLS Technical Services Manager. Coverage for
liability and workmen’s’ compensation insurance will be continued through
separate contracts as is done at present and is&lt;br/&gt;similar to those used
for technicians with the IODP. Included are provisions for training
those&lt;br/&gt;pool members who will be working more than 100 days per year,
and the proposal contains&lt;br/&gt;estimates for travel to and from ships and
for the training and the annual RVTEC meeting. Liaison between TAMU, UNOLS and
chief scientists will ensure that technicians with the correct skill set will be
available for cruises as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
