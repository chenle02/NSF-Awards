9722591 McNabb This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
between Drs. Ken McNabb and Graeme Lockaby of Auburn University to work with Dr.
Jose Leonardo de Moraes Goncalves at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil on a
study of soil organic matter fluxes in Amazonian forests: natural vs.
intensively managed systems. The question of concern to these researchers is
whether intensive management activities like mechanical harvesting and site
preparation, fertilization, mechanical and chemical weed control, and the use of
single species/clones negatively impact long term site productivity. The
researchers will look at soil organic matter (SOM) fluxes as indicators of long
term sustainability and will make a comparison of soil carbon inputs, soil
carbon fractions, and the physical and chemical differences between intensively
managed plantations and immediately adjacent undisturbed natural forest. It is
their hypothesis that there will be quantitative and qualitative differences in
soil carbon fluxes between the two systems, and the researchers will identify
and quantify these differences. ***
