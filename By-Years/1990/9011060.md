This project deals with a scientifically and technically important problem in
sheet metal forming, namely the study of wrinkling in large panel forming. The
scientific content of the project is comprised of two parts: (1) understanding
the mechanical behavior of anistropic materials used in sheet metal forming and
the development of constitutive relationship for such materials, and (2) the
study of instabilities in sheet forming due to wrinkling.
