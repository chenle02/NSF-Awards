Almost 150 years ago, the foundations of geometry were rocked when it was
realized that the familiar (flat) Euclidean geometry that we all learned in high
school was not the only possible geometry to consider. In retrospect, it seems
natural to consider non-flat geometries as the Earth we live on is, of course,
round. Since their first discovery, mathematicians have studied various model
geometries with nice curvature properties, such as the round sphere, and we
continue to extract new information about these model geometries, how they are
distinct from flat Euclidean geometry, and their applications to the universe we
live in. The principal investigator will study special model geometries called
homogeneous, Einstein spaces to learn more about their basic properties and work
towards their classification.

The project's main goal is to advance the classification of non-compact,
homogeneous Einstein and Ricci soliton spaces. In addition to addressing the
question of whether or not these spaces are necessarily solvmanifolds, the PI
will work to develop a deeper understanding of the special properties of
homogeneous Ricci solitons regarding their stability under the Ricci flow and
their isometry groups. To approach these problems, the PI intends to develop
more completely the program of using Geometric Invariant Theory to study
homogeneous Einstein metrics initiated by Heber, Lauret, et al.
