9604830 Katagiri, F. Technical section The molecular mechanisms of signal
recognition and signal transduction initiation by the nucleotide binding sites
(NBS) and the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) encoded in a major class of resistance
genes found in plants will be investigated. The model to be tested as a working
hypothesis will be the ligand-receptor model. A rapid, quantitative transient
expression assay for the resistance gene function has been developed and will be
used as the assay for the biological activities of resistance and avirulence
genes. Recent findings have suggested that several of the Pseudomomas syringae
avirulence genes are sufficient for initiation of the specific resistance
response when expressed in plants, suggesting that the avirulence gene products
themselves are the specific molecular signals recognized by the resistance gene
products. The first major goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
recognition of avirulence gene products. That will include the delineation of
the polypeptide regions that determine the avirulence gene-specificity of the
resistance genes, determination of the smallest domains of the resistance genes
(avrRpt2, avrRpm1 and avrB) that are required for their function in plants and
investigation of possible physical interactions between the products of
resistance and avirulence genes using in vitro binding analysis and/or the yeast
two hybrid system. The second major goal is to investigate the mechanism of
signal transduction initiation. Mutants, including those which are mutated in
the NBS will be generated, characterized and studied. Non-technical section The
ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which plants
recognize and respond to avirulent pathogens. The knowledge to be obtained will
contribute not only to a better understanding of plant disease resistance
mechanisms but also to insight into molecular recognition and signal
transduction in general.
