ABSTRACT The investigator will complete construction of a reference grammar for
Emai, an undocumented Edoid language of southern Nigeria, Intended for use by a
wide range of scholars in linguistics and other disciplines, the grammar will be
constructed in six stages from an outline emanating from earlier periods of
field investigation. The different stages of research involve analysis of the
existing data base, prose narrative samples and handwritten field notes,
manuscript preparation on a microcomputer, and additional fieldwork. The results
are intended for a single volume incorporating a lexicon and a selection of
narratives.
