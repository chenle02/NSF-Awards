9403742 Meyn This proposal concerns development and application of new
methodologies for analysis of complex systems, most of which can be seen as
special cases of general multiclass network systems with feedback. Perhaps the
most important examples is the design of semiconductor manufacturing systems,
where one impact of the analysis would include the construction of stable and
efficient routing and scheduling policies; but the applications of understanding
the general systems is far more widespread. Specifically we propose to carry out
research into three aspects of system analysis: (i) Methods of evaluating system
stability and instability, which will include not only discrete and continuous
time representations of systems, but also fluid and diffusion approximations for
such systems; (ii) Performance measures on stable systems, and specifically
comparison of rates at which such systems achieve a stable regime; (iii)
Robustness of system design against perturbations in assumptions. The specific
types of applications envisaged include manufacturing systems, and more general
queuing systems with feedback, for which the stability and performance results
to be developed are well suited. We will also consider in detail scheduling
algorithms for such systems, and develop simulation methods for modeling and
performance validation. Overall this project can be expected to deliver new
methodologies which will unify the current work in all of (i)- (iii); and to
provide a number of significant applications to manufacturing and engineering
systems which, of themselves, will be a major importance in improving design
guidelines. ***
