Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Arkansas for the
summers of 2003-2005. Donald R. Bobbitt is the site's program director. The co-
PI of the project is David Paul. Ten different research groups will provide
research projects and mentoring for10 students for ten weeks. Students will be
recruited from an 8-state region with special efforts to attract women and
minority students. Research projects will involve a broad range of topics in
chemistry and biochemistry. The program will include professional training
activities such as instrument training, report writing, research strategies, and
a final meeting-in-miniature at which students will present short papers
describing their results. &lt;br/&gt;
