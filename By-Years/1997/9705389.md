w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705389 Andrei This experimental research project
focuses the interactions between quantized magnetic flux lines threading through
a Type II superconductor. An ordered state of interacting flux lines, as
theoretically predicted by Abrikosov, provides the conceptual basis of the
experimental work. The influences of material disorder, thermal fluctuations,
and the quantum nature of the flux line formation lead to an extremely
complicated picture in the area of parameters where the Abrikosov lattice
becomes unstable. There are questions relating to a glassy phase of the flux
array, among others, which are addressed in this experimental project. The work
on 2H-NbSe2 identified two states of the flux line lattice characterized by
dramatically different dynamics, one being disordered and have pinning
frequencies two orders of magnitude higher than the ordered lattice, and
accompanied by much higher critical currents. In this project local
magnetization measurements will be made using an array of microscopic Hall
sensors realized in the 2-D electron gas at the interface of a GaAs/GaAlAs
heterostructure. Other work includes DC and AC measurements of the shear modulus
of the flux array, and measurements of transverse currents in dynamic fluxon
states. Portions of the work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Eli Zeldov
of the Weizmann Institute. %%% This experimental research project, is focused on
the behavior of Type II superconductors in a magnetic field. In this case the
magnetic field can penetrate the superconductor, in an array of quantized flux
lines. Under ideal conditions these lines, each carrying one quantum of magnetic
flux, arrange in an ordered array or flux lattice, as predicted theoretically by
Abrikosov. This experimental project is devoted to measurement of the motions
and arrangements o f the flux lines in less than ideal conditions when the flux
lines may be in a disordered state or in a state of motion somewhat like a
liquid. The results of this research may provide information of importance to
the application of Type II superconductors including high temperature cuprate
superconductors in improved electrical and electromechanical technology. This
research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves graduate students
who will be excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government or
education. ***
