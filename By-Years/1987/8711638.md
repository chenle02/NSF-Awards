This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of photochemistry/surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The thrust
of this program is to find whether enhanced photochemistry takes place on gold
and silver electrodes which have been roughened by an oxidation/reduction cycle
as is used in the surface enhanced Raman scattering pretreatment technique. The
surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy will be used to follow concentration-time
profiles of reactants, intermediates, and products of various photochemical
processes. Since this program is closely related to photoelectrocatalysis,
photoelectrochemical energy conversions, and photobiological processes, the
proposed studies have practical as well as fundamental implications. As a result
of this research, for example, the efficiency of photogalvanic cells may be
improved.
