This research seeks to determine why some avian species live in colonies. This
long-term project is unique in that it is designed to follow thousands of
individual cliff swallows for the duration of their lifetimes. These birds nest
in colonies of many different sizes. Birds living in colonies which range in
size from very small to extremely large will be monitored for several years and
their lifespans calculated. How many offspring each individual produces during
its lifetime will be determined. Differences in lifetime output of young will be
related to the colony size each individual occupied. This will reveal what sorts
of evolutionary costs and benefits individuals can expect in different size
colonies. Many of the presumed costs and benefits of group living are believed
to be universal for all social species, including humans. This research will
used a nonhuman model species to gain an understanding of the consequences of
group living.
