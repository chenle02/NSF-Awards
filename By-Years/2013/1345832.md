This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project proposes to
develop a discrete, powered, lower-extremity orthotic walking aid to restore
function to the injured or disabled. While the majority of current similar
systems aim to ?amplify? human strength and performance beyond normal, the
proposed system will aim to restore mobility in aging, injured, or otherwise
disabled people who maintain complete kinematic but insufficient kinetic
functionality. This restored mobility will greatly enhance quality of life for
those individuals with functional limitations and the aging population; helping
to prevent falls and fractures, reducing the need for medical care, and thus
reducing medical costs, and/or decreasing rehabilitation time. This next-
generation robotic orthosis will replace walkers, wheel chairs, canes, stair
climbers, and other assistive devices with a low-profile and discrete system
that users will wear under clothing ? out of sight and out of mind. By enhancing
an individual?s ability to stand and walk there are several additional benefits,
which include preventing cardiovascular deconditioning, helping with weight
loss, and providing the mechanical stimulus required to lessen the burden of
osteoporosis. The near-term goal of the project is to address a select subset of
unilateral knee muscle weakness pathologies while creating the framework that
can be used with a broad spectrum of diseases and injuries. The ultimate goal of
this investigational team is to employ this modular technology to develop
clinical and consumer solutions on a pathology/injury specific basis to improve
or restore function. The results of this work will impact the field of powered
orthotics as well as increase the quality of life of the physically challenged
and speed up recovery of the injured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be enabled by employing
an open-source software development kit which will be developed and made
available to the research community so the core system can be rapidly adapted to
other pathologies. The discrete personal assistance orthotic walking aid will
become a platform from which researchers at other organizations can develop and
implement robotics-based orthotic solutions to pathologies above and beyond what
this project will focus on. While the majority of current systems aim to
increase human capability, the proposed system aims to restore mobility in
aging, injured, or otherwise disabled people who maintain complete but limited
functionality. The results of this work will increase the quality of life of the
disabled and speed up recovery of the injured.
