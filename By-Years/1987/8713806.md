This grant provides research and communication equipment to support new and
continuing research in geometric modeling and programmable machining. The
modeling work includes maintenance, dissemination, and development of PADL-2, a
public modelling system, studies of special algorithms for representation
conversion, and collaborative work with Duke University on VLSI geometry
engines. The machining research ranges from continuing development of fully
automatic NC program verifiers and machine-tool programming languages to shop-
floor communication and in- process gauging.
