With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will
purchase a nanoelectrospray (nano-ESI) source and supporting equipment. This
equipment, which will be placed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility at RPI, will
enhance research in a number of areas including 1) confirmation of the efficacy
of protein displacement molecules during chromatographic separations; b) de novo
protein design and design of methodologies to enhance mass spectrometric signals
from peptides; c) analysis of complex mixtures of oligosaccharides; d)
recombination protein production; and e) elucidation of protein deposition on
explanted biomaterials.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. Nano-ESI is a proven method for ionizing the
molecule of interest without fragmentation. Thus the combination of MS and nano-
ESI is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical
instrumentation techniques for larger biomolecules that would otherwise fragment
upon ionization. These studies will have a significant impact in a number of
areas, especially biochemistry.
