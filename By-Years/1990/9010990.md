This grant is for an international conference on asymptotic expansion and
perturbation theory to be held in January 1991 at San Diego, CA. The title of
the conference, Asymptotics Beyond All Orders, refers to a small but significant
class of problems in which conventional asymptotic methods provide no
information at any order of the expansion. Problems of this nature are unusual,
but not impossible: examples are known in hydrodynamics, plasma physics, crystal
growth, and quantum mechanics. Several of these problems in widely different
fields have been solved recently, using several apparently different methods.
What the different methods of solution have in common is still largely
unexplored. The purpose of this conference is to convene the principal
participants in this nascent field for an in-depth comparison of their problems
and their methods of solution.
