This conference will be held January 8, 9, 10, 1989 at the University of
Southern California. Its focus is on several areas of probaility theory,
including Markov processes, branching processes, percolation theory, interacting
particle systems, and stochastic flows. These are areas in which Professor Ted
Harris has done seminal work, and the conference will honor him for his
contributions. The invited speakers include P. Baxendale, R. Durrett, D.
Griffeath, R. Holley, H. Kunita, Y. Lejan, T. Liggett, C. Newman, P. Ney, F.
Spitzer, and S. R. S. Varadhan. The conference organizer is Professor Watkins of
the Mathematics Department of the University of Southern California. There is
some participant support available.
