This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of California
Berkeley acquire a NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) application of organic synthesis to biologial
problems including helix nucleators and macrocyclic peptidase inhibitors (2)
synthesis and exploratory chemistry of organometallic compounds and the
investigations of their reaction mechanisms (3) organic synthesis methodology
and total synthesis of natural products including zaragozic acid and
dictyoxetane (4) molecular recognition and catalysis in biological systems and
applications of these studies to the design and synthesis of new molecules with
novel biological properties, and (5) exploratory synthetic, structural and
reactivity studies on novel inorganic systems including transition metal-silicon
chemistry and metal-mediated routes to charge-transporting polymers. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology
