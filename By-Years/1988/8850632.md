The ChemSource project includes the development of an array of materials
designed to assist the pre-service and inexperienced secondary school chemistry
teacher to teach more effectively. The materials will be in two major forms,
SourceBook and SourceView. SourceBook will be the teaching database for the high
school teacher of chemistry. It will include a series of Chemistry Resources
Planning Topics at its core, surrounded by general practical methodologies and
collected practical information for the safe and effective teaching of
chemistry. SourceView will include visualizations of methods of teaching in the
context of high school chemistry classrooms with the goal of providing nearly
ideal examples of chemistry lessons. The materials in both SourceBook and
SourceView will be developed by a team of outstanding high school and college
level chemical educators from across the United States. Printing, dissemination,
and updating of the materials will be the responsibility of the American
Chemical Society.
