9410157 Mukherjee This project deals with the planning of closed paths for non
holonmic systems which are characterized by the non- integrable nature of their
differential constraints. These constraints manifest themselves in a way that
closed trajectories of the independent variables of the system result in a
change in the dependent variables. In certain nonholonomic systems, closed paths
in the space of independent variables can be so designed that the net change of
dependent variables is zero over these closed paths. Such systems are important
in a manufacturing environment for example, kinetically redundant manipulators
operating under pseudo inverse control ***
