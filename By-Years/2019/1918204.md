Network programs, such as network protocols and applications, play essential
roles on the Internet. However, their correctness is difficult to test, because
their behaviors depend on their network environments, but the space of all
possible network environments is prohibitively large. Symbolic execution, as a
powerful program-analysis technique, can systemically and efficiently explore a
large space by leveraging the equivalence classes of cases in the space.
However, a significant barrier in using symbolic execution to test network
programs is the substantial effort of instrumenting and modifying network
programs to model their symbolic network environments. This project provides a
powerful and general platform of symbolic network environments so that network
programs can be more efficiently and easily tested using symbolic execution for
various purposes, such as for finding low-probability bugs, and measuring worst-
case performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops symbolic network
environments by leveraging a well-developed and widely used network simulator,
NS-3. Specifically, this project extends NS-3 and develops a symbolic network
simulator, called SymNS-3, to symbolically test network programs in various
symbolic network environments. SymNS-3 is designed to be easy to use: The
application program interface (API) of NS-3 will be extended so that a tester
can easily and flexibly define a customized symbolic network environment by just
calling the APIs in a simulation script without the need to laboriously
instrument the NS-3 simulator. SymNS-3 is also designed to be efficient:
multiple NS-3 core components will be re-designed in order to exponentially
reduce the number of explored program execution paths while still generating the
correct simulation results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
