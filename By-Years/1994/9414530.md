9414530 Kovacevic The award is for developing a sensing technique to measure the
three-dimensional shape of weld pools in gas tungsten arc welding. Image
processing and vision algorithms will also be developed to process the acquired
image and compute the shape of the weld pool surface based on iterative
techniques, regression methods, and neural networks. Structured light from a
short-duration pulsed laser and transmitted through a grid is used to illuminate
the weld pool. The reflected light contains information about the pool shape.
Extraction of this information is the function of the image processing
algorithms. The feasibility of the method has been demonstrated, development of
techniques for real-time image extraction and pool surface computation being the
objective of the current effort. Welding processes are widely used. On-line
measurement of three-dimensional weld pool shape and its subsequent correlation
with weld quality would ensure more consistent welds in a wide variety of
applications.
