The EURESCO Conferences (modeled on the Gordon Research Conferences in the USA)
were started in 1990 by the European Science Foundation, with funding from the
European Commission. Each conference consists of a series of five day-long
scientific meetings on one and the same general topic, spread over several years
(typically one meeting every other year). These are discussion meetings at which
scientists discuss new developments in their particular scientific discipline.
Participation, by invitation upon application, is limited to about 100. About 30
per cent of the participants should be young researchers. In this proposal we
are requesting travel support for 15 young USA based scientists to participate
in the 2003 EURESCO conference.
