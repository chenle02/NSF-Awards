This award will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the
University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI. Ten undergraduate
students interested in research in field biology will be selected to participate
in the program. Students will both learn and live at the station during the
8-week summer session. The research experience will be the sole focus of their
academic activities during that period. The selected students will each work
with a faculty mentor, attend special evening workshops, attend weekly
discussion meetings, attend general seminars at the station, and develop their
own research project (from conception of the ideas through data gathering to
verbal and written presentations of the study). Students will be selected on the
basis of academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence of
interest in research. After participation in the program, each student will help
in the evaluation of his/her experiences in the program.
