This dissertation investigates how blind and partially sighted peoples'
inability to respond to visible, non-vocal gestures leads to disruptions in
interactional encounters. A consistent set of problems occur during everyday
social interaction between sighted and visually impaired/blind people.
Conversational analysis will explore how interactional repairs (e.g., recycled
turns) maintain the achievement of meaning in spite of these problems. The
research will not only analyze how these particular interactions are negotiated,
but will demonstrate the role of taken-for-granted visible gestures in
interpersonal communication among sighted people. Participant observation and
interviews with partially sighted/blind people will develop a broad description
of interactional problems. Videotaped interaction will be used to analyze the
conversational process of disruption and repair in more detail.&lt;br/&gt;
