This multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary proposal is focused on magnetic and
optical properties of semiconductors containing magnetic ions, so-called dilute
magnetic semiconductors (DMS). Both semiconductor heterostructures and bulk
crystalline material will be investigated. The program involves a unique
combination of high magnetic fields, low temperatures, advanced optical
techniques, and new materials development. The majority of the experiments will
be conducted at the National Magnet Lab. The collaboration invloves several
universities, industrial labs, both theory and experiment, as well as DMS
workers in Poland. The DMS materials display a range of scientifically
interesting and technologically important properties, including optical effects
like large Faraday rotation and transport phenomena such as the so- called giant
magnetoresistance effect. Both are of interest for possible application as
information storage technologies.
