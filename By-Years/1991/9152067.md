Emphasizing Environmental Science Studies"Instrumentation being funded through
this project consists of a versatile gas chromatography system and a
microprocessor-controlled environmental growth chamber. Biology and chemistry
majors are employing these instruments in their studies of microbial growth
under special conditions, dynamics of small-scale biotic systems, and GC
analysis of organic pollutants in natural waters. Majors proficient in GC water
analysis are working with non-majors to apply that technology in freshman-level
environmental science projects. These projects serve as key bridging elements in
a two-course sequence for non-science majors consisting of a chemistry course
followed by an environmental science course. Instrumental methods introduced in
the chemistry course enable students to perform environmental science laboratory
exercises consistent with current professional practices. Significant features
of this project include collaboration between science majors and non-majors to
address environmental concerns and the development of an environmental science
laboratory for non- majors.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from
non- federal sources.
