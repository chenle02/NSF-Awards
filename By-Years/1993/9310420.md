9310420 Roth The award is for the purchase of motorized gimbal mounts, motion
controllers, and other optical devices, to upgrade an existing four beam laser
tracking measuring machine into a more accurate, self calibrating system capable
of measuring positions and orientations of targets. The equipment will be used
in several research projects including, (1) Computer Numerical Control machine
tool calibration, (2) serial robot calibration, (3) Stewart platform
calibration, and (4) self calibration and control of laser tracking coordinate
measurement system. The research, when co pled, will make calibration of robots
and machine tools easier and less expensive to perform, and will simplify the
maintenance of the calibration system.
