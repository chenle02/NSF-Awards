Modern software engineering methods improve programmer productivity by taking an
incremental approach to software development. Software engineers rapidly develop
prototypes and then iteratively refine the prototypes into production systems.
However, today's programming systems do not support a smooth transition from
prototyping to production. On one hand, scripting languages and interactive
environments support prototyping while on the other hand conventional
programming languages and optimizing compilers support the development of
reusable and efficient production codes. Neither support both prototyping and
production, so developers use a mixture of programming systems. This practice
incurs many costs such as the impedance mismatch of inter-language data
transfers and the time to translate programs between
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to discover the
scientific principles necessary for a single programming system to effectively
support the incremental refinement of prototypes into production software. To
accomplish this research objective, classic conflicts between flexibility and
safety and between abstraction and performance need to be resolved. To achieve
both flexibility and safety, the research will investigate ways to combine
dynamic and static type checking, using an approach called gradual typing. To
achieve both abstraction and performance, the research will develop a domain-
specific compiler for linear algebra and show how show how high-level
abstractions can provide greater opportunities for compiler optimization than
conventional abstractions such as loops and scalar operations. The broader
impacts of the project arise from improvements to programmer productivity and
software quality.&lt;br/&gt;
