This project is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of interfacial processes. The thrust of this experimental program is
the testing of recently developed theoretical models which provide explication
of the fundamental molecular interactions that underlie irreversible adsorption
from solution. The adsorption of molecules from solution onto a surface is said
to be reversible when the kinetics of the adsorption and desorption processes
are comparable. In systems where irreversible adsorption is observed, the
kinetics of desorption are significantly slower than the kinetics of adsorption.
This implies that molecular-level changes take place in the adsorbed layer
subsequent to adsorption; such implication has significant fundamental and
applied importance. Infrared and photoexcited emission spectroscopy will be used
to study both the structures of irreversibly adsorbed layers and the kinetics of
their formation and dissolution. Additionally, surface ellipsometry will be
employed for fast kinetic studies that are necessary to follow the surface phase
change that converts reversible to irreversible behavior. Studies of the effects
of pressure and solution conditions and also of substrate composition on
adsorption behavior will be pursued to help to define the molecular details of
these interfacial processes. This important but largely unexplored phenomenon of
irreversible adsorption is important not only to an enhanced understanding of
fundamental molecular interactions at interfaces, but also to technologically
important areas such as tertiary oil recovery, surface lubrication and wear,
photocatalysis, and the interaction of implantable prosthetic devices with their
in vivo environments.
