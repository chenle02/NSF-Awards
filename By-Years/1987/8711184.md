This research is oriented to the development of a deliberate tracer experiment
to examine the relationship between gas exchange rate and wind speed over the
ocean. Such a relationship will greatly facilitate estimation of gas fluxes of
geochemically important gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen on a global
basis. The preliminary work will include development and testing of non-volatile
tracer which will be used in conjunction with the man-made volatile tracer,
sulfur hexaflouride (SF6), in ocean experiments. Wind tunnel tests will compare
the ratio of gas exchange coefficients of SF6, carbon dioxide, radon, methane,
and helium at different wind speeds so the exchange coefficient of SF6 obtained
in the ocean can be used to determine the fluxes of these gases. The non-
volatile / volatile tracer combination will be first applied in a lake
experiment to test sampling and analysis equipment and to ascertain the
conservative behaviour of the non-volatile tracer. The proposed research is an
important part of the implementation of the Global Ocean Flux Study, GOFS, since
gas exchange is a boundary condition for biogeochemical cycles involving gaseous
compounds.
