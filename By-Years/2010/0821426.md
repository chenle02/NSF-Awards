With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Wendy C.
Cory from the College of Charleston will acquire a high performance liquid
chromatograph with a UV/VIS Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) to perform research
in the areas of pharmaceutical and forensic science. The research projects will
be carried out by faculty members in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry and the Department of Biology along with undergraduate students
that are being mentored by these faculty members. In addition, one of the
projects will be carried out in collaboration with the Forensic Services
Laboratory of the Charleston Police Department.

An HPLC-DAD system will allow separation of mixtures of substances into
individual components to facilitate their study by analyzing the characteristic
traces provided by the interaction of such substances with visible and
ultraviolet light. These studies are of great importance in forensic and other
analytical studies. Training provided to students will prepare them for jobs in
many areas of importance to society such as analytical and organic chemistry,
biology and crime investigations.
