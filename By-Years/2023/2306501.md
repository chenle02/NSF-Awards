The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will conduct a three-day
virtual proposal writing workshop for up to 1,000 early career engineering
faculty to increase their capacity to formulate and submit competitive Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program proposals to the National Science
Foundation’s (NSF) Directorate for Engineering (ENG). This award seeks to
broaden participation by increasing competitive proposals from investigators who
are more diverse in terms of being from underrepresented groups in engineering
and institution types, particularly institutions that may not have sufficient
resources to support faculty in CAREER proposal development (e.g., institutions
in EPSCoR states, non-R1 institutions, and Minority-Serving Institutions).

Through an interactive three-day virtual workshop, this award will provide
participants with (a) foundational knowledge on the key objectives and features
of the CAREER Program; (b) an increased understanding of the proposal review and
selection process; and (c) proposal writing strategies to enable them to
formulate more competitive CAREER proposals for submission to the NSF
Directorate for Engineering. The workshop will include a mock panel review
session during which up to 300 participants will serve as reviewers on a mock
panel and review a set of CAREER proposals. ASEE is strongly positioned to
support and connect the early-career engineering faculty community to expand
their participation in the NSF CAREER Program, leveraging its reach and
influence to accelerate innovation, dissemination, and adoption of best
practices in research, instruction, and diversity and inclusion. This award will
encourage broader participation in NSF-sponsored research by helping junior
faculty from underrepresented groups and under-participating institutions to
compete more effectively for the NSF CAREER award, activating a larger portion
of the nation’s science and engineering talent.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
