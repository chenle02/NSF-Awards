The undergraduate teaching laboratory serves to expand upon the concepts taught
in the classroom and demonstrates that science is a dynamic process of learning.
In order to provide a research environment in its undergraduate biochemistry
teaching laboratory, the Department of Chemistry has developed a curriculum
based on investigative learning. The laboratory is based on a bioluminescent
enzyme known as luciferase. The major objective is to clone the luciferase gene
and ultimately purify and characterize the enzyme. Thus, the student is
confronted by a real research problem: how to isolate an enzyme with a known
function and characterize it. Not only can students learn the strategies and
techniques used in research, but they can also develop necessary critical
thinking skills. The complete development of this laboratory curriculum is
dependent upon the addition of two luminometers. The luminometer, an instrument
for detecting photons, is the instrument of choice for the measurement of
luciferase activity. Quick, reliable measurements of enzyme activity are crucial
for the purification and subsequent characterization of luciferase. The addition
of luminometers to the biochemistry laboratory can increase the quality of the
experiments presented in this course.
