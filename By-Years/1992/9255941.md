California State University, Long Beach will initiate a four-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in ocean science for 30 students entering the 9th and
10th grades. In this summer program students will experience all the sciences
through ocean-oriented laboratory and field experiences, special demonstrations,
presentations, and lectures. Planned field trip sites include Sea World and
Scripps Institute in San Diego and the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro. A
highlight of the summer program will be 3 days of ocean study activity at the
Orange County Marine Institute and sites on Catalina Island including research
snorkeling in pristine kelp beds.
