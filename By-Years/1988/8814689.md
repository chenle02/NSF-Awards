The primary objective of this project is to develop mathematical process models
for selected superplastic sheet metal pressure (blow) forming operations. The
rate-sensitive properties of superplastic metals make it imperative that the
strain-rate during forming be controlled to optimize their forming
charateristics. A controlled pressurization schedule is thus necessary for
accurate process control. The purpose of the models is to predict: (a) the
pressure-time loading cycle to maintain optimum forming conditions, i.e.,
maximum ductility and minimum cavitation, and (b) the thickness distribution in
the formed part. Constitutive equations will be developed experimentally under
both uniaxial and biaxial conditions for input to the models. Hydrostatic
pressure requirements to suppress cavitation will also be studied. A new
numerical procedure using membrane elements developed by the authors will be
investigated as well as non-linear finite element methods. The alloys tested
include selected Aluminum-Lithium alloys as well as 6A1-4V Titanium.
