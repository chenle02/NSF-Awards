The purpose of this research is to model the macroscopic events which occur when
electrical current flows through tissues or biopolymers. Primarily, this study
will describe the effects of electrical current flowing through nerve and
muscle. Numerical analysis will be used to determine the way in which electric
current flows in biological materials. These studies should be important for
properly prescribing the amount of electric current for cardiac defibrillation,
and in designing large systems of electrodes for muscle stimulation of paralyzed
muscles.
