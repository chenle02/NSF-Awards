Rust is an important new programming language that enables programmers to build
low-level systems in a way that is both fast and efficient, a combination that
has traditionally been extremely difficult. However, using Rust requires
programmers to understand the language's "ownership" mechanism, which many find
daunting. The project's novelties are to create a strong understanding of the
difficulties in learning it, create tools to improve understanding, and evaluate
that these tools work. The project's impacts are an understanding of important
programming language concepts, a collection of useful tools, and a collection of
pedagogic materials.

Concretely, the project has multiple phases. First, it examines StackOverflow
postings to determine what troubles programmers seem to have. Next, it turns
these into a concept inventory for ownership. Then, it creates visualization
tools for understanding both the dynamic and static semantics of Rust. These are
then deployed in a copy of a widely used Rust book. The project then assesses
the impact of these interventions.
