This award will fund a 5-day conference to be held during the spring of 2016 at
the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley on the topic of discrete Painlevé
equations. The main lecturer will be Professor Nalini Joshi of the University of
Sydney, Australia. The study of Painlevé equations is closely related to
integrable systems and can be useful in the modeling of applications from
atmospheric circulation to thermal properties of metals. This conference will
focus in particular on functions that are solutions of nonlinear recurrence
relations, called the discrete Painlevé equations. The search for these
equations and study of their solutions has become a major focus of research over
the past two decades. However, very little is known about their general
solutions, primarily because mathematical tools are not available. The lectures
will provide information for mathematicians and scientists who may encounter the
discrete Painlevé equations as models in the course of their research and
introduce mathematical tools for identifying and describing solutions of
nonlinear non-autonomous difference equations. The conference will bring Dr.
Joshi, a world-expert, to a Hispanic-serving Institution, introducing new
developments in the field to a diverse group of students, postdoctoral
researchers, and faculty.

The conference speakers will describe the properties of discrete Painlevé
equations and discuss tremendous new research developments in the field. The
main lectures and the supplemental lectures plan to address the following major
themes: (1) the basic theory of nonlinear difference equations; (2) the
connection between discrete integrable systems and continuous integrable
systems; (3) the connection of geometry with discrete Painlevé equations,
especially the ell-discrete Painlevé equation; (4) asymptotic analysis of
discrete Painlevé equations; and (5) obtaining special solutions through
elementary methods such as Hirota's bilinear form and Bäcklund and other
transformations. This conference is jointly supported by the Infrastructure
Program and the Analysis Program in the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences.
