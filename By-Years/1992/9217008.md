The proposal involves the acquisition of a videomicroscopy and image analysis
system for a group of neurobiolgists and cell biologists whose work focuses on
neuronal development and cell adhesion and motility. The components to be
acquired were chosen to function together in different flexible combinations to
serve the varied needs of the individual research projects. The capabilities
include: 1) low light level observation and time lapse analysis of growth and
plasticity of living cells using phase contrast, DIC or fluorescent staining, 2)
calcium mapping in live neurons and growth cones using the fura-2 fluorescence
ratio image method including representation in pseudo color images, 3)
recombining of images of objects present in more than one section (in sectioned
material) or optical plane of focus (in whole mounts) and generating single
clear images of entire 3-D structures, 4) superimposition of images of double
(or triple) fluorescent staining, obtained at different wavelengths, in order to
better compare the colocalization of immunostaining in cellular structures, 5)
contrast enhancement and subtraction of background mottle to permit DIC-video
images in real-time, 6) provisions for mass storage, retrieval and printing of
the images and the production of short time-lapse videotapes for demonstrations
and seminars.
