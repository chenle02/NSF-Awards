The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Willis Paull of the University of Missouri and Dr. Zsolt Lipositz of the
University Medical School, Pecs, Hungary is to study the central regulation of
the adrenal function by focussing on certain neurochemical transmitter-specific
systems in the forebrain and hypothalamus. These studies will analyse
connections between neurons rather than between brain structures and will employ
ultrastructural double-labelling techniques developed by the investigators which
are likely to become important research methodologies for neuroanatomy in the
future. This project in neural science fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool resources, and share
research facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Results
should contribute significantly to our understanding of the chemical nature of
interacting pre and postsynaptic neuronal elements with subsequent relevance to
interpretation of vast amounts of data generated in other fields on the adrenal
function.
