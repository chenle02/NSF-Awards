This is a preliminary research effort to determine whether powerful tools and
concepts of learning automata theory can be brought to bear on a variety of
optimization problems which arise in neural networks. In the first phase of the
proposed research a detailed study of several simple interconnected automata
will be undertaken. The primary aim of this is to determine how known results
can be extended to generalized automata and hence to neural networks. In the
second phase the emphasis will be on the use of learning automata methods of
optimization of general hierarchical systems of which the vision system
described earlier is a typical example. Computer simulations of both simple and
complex networks are contemplated during both phases of the research.
Observation of interesting simulated behavior will provide both sources of new
theoretical focus as well as clues to new results.
