This meeting addresses the growing interest in using optoelectronics for
broadband analog applications, especially cable television distribution and
microwave signal transmission. Performance of optoelectronic devices such as
lasers, modulators, and detectors determines the feasibility of most examples of
these systems. By bringing together the technical communities representing
device development, equipment manufacturing and system operation, the meeting
will provide a unique forum for exploring the future of this field and for
creating a better understanding of its needs and capabilities.
