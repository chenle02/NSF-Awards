The major objective of this program is to increase the overall number of
graduates in computer science and mathematics coming from economically
disadvantaged backgrounds. We are especially interested in increasing the
opportunities for students from the Northwest North Carolina region to pursue a
degree in computer science or mathematical sciences. In order to achieve this
goal, we are improving the student support infrastructure available for the
CSEMS scholars community, and building partnerships with regional high
technology industries. Scholars in the program participate in a variety of
activities and use support services designed to achieve program goals. Community
building is by participation in Freshmen Learning Communities, membership in
student organizations like ACM and MAA student chapters, and departmental
receptions and seminars. Academic success is bolstered through faculty mentors,
lab tutors, and the extensive university support services. Through the
Cooperative Education program, the Computer Science Industry Advisory Board, and
ASU's Career Development Center, scholars are positioned to take advantage of a
variety of employment opportunities in the high technology
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
