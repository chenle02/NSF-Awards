With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Sean Parkin
and colleagues at the University of Kentucky will purchase a hybrid
small/macromolecule X-ray diffractometer system with a SMART CCD detector. The
instrumentation will include a rotating anode dual source X-ray generator,
k-axis goniometer, focusing optics and low-temperature apparatus. The PIs will
investigate polymorphism, superstructures, absolute stereochemistry, highly
reactive/unstable compounds, charge density analysis and protein structure.
Faculty at numerous small institutions in the area will also have access at no
charge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including polymer
sciences and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
