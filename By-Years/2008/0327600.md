P.I. Terray (WHOI) Proposal #: 0327600&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:
Development of a Multifrequency, Ultrasonic, Pulse-Coherent Doppler Sonar for
Turbulence Studies&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a small, low power,
single-axis, range-gated pulse-coherent Doppler sonar module intended for
boundary layer turbulence studies. This instrument will be capable of autonomous
operation from a variety of platforms, such as buoys, moorings, and bottom
frames, but the PIs specific interest is in using it from small autonomous
underwater vehicles to estimate turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates in
bottom and surface boundary layers. The novel aspect of this work is our
proposed use of multiple acoustic frequencies to reduce the bias due to Doppler
phase noise in the spectrum of velocity, thereby enabling measurement of smaller
dissipation rates than was previously possible with this class of sensors. The
sonar developed here will be a high frequency, short range instrument, with a
spatial resolution somewhat smaller than 1 cm. This sensor will also be modular
so that coherent arrays and multistatic configurations can be constructed.
