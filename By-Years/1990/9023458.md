Advances in sub-micron lithograpy have opened the door to the study of the
physics of the "mesoscopic" size regime. This regime is characterized by
quantum-interference effects enhanced electrical conductance is extremely
sensitive to the microscopic impurity potential, hence careful conductance
measurements can be used to detect the motions of single atoms. Conductance
measurements will be used to study defects in metals and their relation to l/f
noise, and tunneling systems in metallic glasses. Our understanding in both of
these areas has been limited by our inability to observe the microscopic
samples. By measuring conductance fluctuations in submicron samples as a
function of sample size, temperature and strain, and of the applied magnetic
field, one will probe the properties of individual defects and tunneling
systems, as well as their interactions with each other and with the conduction
electrons.
