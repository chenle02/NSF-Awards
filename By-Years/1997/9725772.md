9725772 Ward This research involves the use of computer simulations of fault
system ruptures incorporating the physics of earthquake stress transfer and
constrained by excellent, but limited, bodies of geological and seismological
data. By this means, the observational catalog of earthquakes can be extended
with a deeper perspective on the distribution of earthquakes and seismicity and
their relationships to fault segmentation and geometry, static strength and pre-
stress, and friction law parameters. Products from this research should be of
value in addressing questions that are both fundamental, related to
characterization of the earthquake source, and practical, related to the
understanding of geological field data and in the quantification of earthquake
recurrence statistics. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
