This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the
general area of analytical an surface chemistry and in the subfield of
catalysis. Development of efficient, long-lived catalysts for selective
metathesis of functionalized olefins will enable preparation of both new organic
compounds and those that can not now be prepared in useful quantities by
existing methods. These are compounds which will, because of the variety of
functional groups they contain, find application as intermediates in many
applications of commercial interest. Catalytica has successfully developed
catalyst systems for metathesis of methyl oleate, an olefinic ester where the
functionality is remote from the double bound. The proposed Phase I program
endeavors to significantly extend the demonstrated scope of functionalized
olefin metathesis for a catalyst system of established practical utility. The
substrates selected for investigation are chosen to test fundamental extensions
of the catalyst system. Performance of the catalyst in the presence of other
representative functional groups, in the presence of functional groups
substituted on positions closer to the double bond, and on more highly-
substituted olefins will be determined. The products of the proposed metathesis
reactions are multi-functional intermediates suitable for application in the
production of new polymer materials, flavor and fragrance compounds,
pharmaceuticals and lubricants.
