Balachandran, Suchitra 96-18335 Dr. Balachandran will research stellar
structure and chemical evolution using infrared echelle spectroscopy on several
large telescopes. Carbon and Oxygen abundances will be measured for metal-poor
dwarf stars and giants to examine their variation with metallicity. Iron and
alpha process abundances will be determined in globular clusters in the Galactic
Bulge. Several other stellar evolution studies will be conducted, based on the
comparison of observed and predicted CNO abundances and isotopic ratios in
giants. ***
