Mapping class groups of surfaces MCG(S) and outer automorphism groups of free
groups Out(F_n) are very important in geometric group theory. Analogies between
these two classes of groups often drive research. The principal investigator,
working jointly with Michael Handel of Lehman College, will study several
problems about Out(F_n) that are motivated by analogies with MCG(S). He shall
investigate a classification of subgroups of Out(F_n) which is analogous to
Ivanov's classification of subgroups of MCG(S). He shall investigate the
geometry of complexes related to F_n, with the goal of finding analogues of the
Masur-Minsky theorems about the geometry of the curve complex of S. These two
investigations could lead to a study of the bounded cohomology of Out(F_n), in
analogy to results of Bestvina-Fujiwara about bounded cohomology of MCG(S). He
shall search for homeomorphic representatives of outer automorphisms that
generalize pseudo-Anosov surface homeomorphisms. In separate work, joint with
Jason Behrstock, Bruce Kleiner, and Yair Minsky, the principal investigator will
study quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups. He shall also study
geometric properties of mapping class groups that refine weak relative
hyperbolicity.

Group theory is the study of abstract properties of symmetry. Geometric group
theory focusses more tightly on symmetry groups of geometric objects, and it can
be used to greatly enrich our knowledge about an abstractly given group, by
realizing it as the group of symmetries of an appropriate geometric object. Two
very important classes of groups that are studied in this manner are mapping
class groups of surfaces and outer automorphism groups of free groups. In both
cases, these groups arise naturally from topological considerations that are
not, at their heart, geometric in nature: mapping class groups arise from the
topological symmetries of 2-dimensional surfaces; outer automorphism groups of
free groups arise from the homotopic symmetries of 1-dimensional graphs. The
principal investigator will pursue the study of geometric objects whose symmetry
groups are realized by mapping class groups of surfaces or by outer automorphism
groups of free groups, with applications to the structure of these groups.
