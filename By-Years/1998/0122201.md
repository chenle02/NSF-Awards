This proposal is to cover expenses associated with hosting the Digital Libraries
Initiative All Projects Meeting in June 2001. The All Projects Meetings have
been held semi-annually since the program's inception in 1994 and have been
essential to building collaborations between funded projects, establishing and
maintaining program identity and direction, and stimulating valuable personal
interactions between researchers, graduate students, and information
professionals from all sectors. The meeting agenda is structured to allow
projects to report and demonstrate research products, and discuss and assess the
relative merits and promise of new capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;
