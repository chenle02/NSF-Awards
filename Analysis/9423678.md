9423678 Lacey Bilinear operators are a source of very difficult questions in
harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. A major focus in the current project is
the bilinear Hilbert transform. In particular, the investigator will study the
difficult problem of Calderon involving the square integrability of the value of
this transform. The approach will involve a synthesis of ergodic and Fourier
transform techniques. Mathematical analysis involves the study of qualitative
and quantitative information about solutions of equations. Frequently, real
world equations can be viewed as operator equations and the analysis of
solutions involves estimates on operators both globally and locally. This
project involves estimation on the value of bilinear operators, that is,
operators associated with pairs of functions. The approach to these difficult
analytical questions will involve a synthesis of several deep branches of
analysis.
