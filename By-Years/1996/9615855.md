Abstract 9615855 Inan This project operates very low frequency (VLF) radio
receivers at Palmer Station, Antarctica for the purpose of studying ionospheric
disturbance caused by global lightning. The principal mode of operation is to
measure changes in amplitude and phase of signals received from several distant
VLF transmitters. These changes occur in the VLF signals following lightening
strokes because radio (whistler) waves from the lightening can cause the
precipitation into the upper atmosphere of very energetic electrons from the Van
Allan radiation belts, which then cause increased ionization in the ionosphere,
thus affecting the propagating VLF radio waves. Because the directions to the
VLF transmitters are known, it is possible to remotely track the path of the
thunderstorms causing the changes. The Palmer receivers are operating as a
collaboration with the British and Brazilian Antarctic Programs, both of which
operate similar receivers. This project contributes to the Global Change
initiative. ***
