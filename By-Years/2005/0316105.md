ABSTRACT: EIA 0316105, CRA, B. York, PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
support for students and faculty from minority-serving institutions to attend
and participate in "The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
Conference 2003", to be held in October 2003, in Atlanta, Georgia. Organized by
the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC), the theme of this conference is
"Building Diverse Leadership in Computing". The conference program includes
refereed papers, poster sessions and panels in addition to invited plenary talks
by some of the nation's outstanding scientists. The papers presented will be
published in a proceedings journal. In addition, a one-day doctoral consortium
is included in which Ph.D. students will present and discuss their work before a
panel of experts during which the students will receive constructive feedback as
well as career guidance. The conference is expected to be an unusual opportunity
for the participants to interact with a diverse collection of world class
researchers, be exposed to new concepts, ideas and state-of-the-art research, as
well as to gain an understanding of the history of diversity in computing and to
participate themselves in panels, posters and formal paper presentations.
