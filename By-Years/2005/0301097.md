This project has as its long-term goal the development of chemosensing molecules
that bind metal ions and signal specific metal ion binding. The specific aims of
this study are to design and synthesize peptide derived macrocyclic ligands with
an intrinsic fluorescent signal to indicate metal ion binding. The strategy is
to employ peptide based macrocycles incorporating intrinsic signalling molecules
that display a fluorescence response. The ion binding selectivities will be
comparatively studied by NMR, CD, potentiometry and fluorescence techniques.
Ground state properties of these macrocycles, in the solid state as well as in
solution, will be investigated by X-ray diffraction methods, NMR and
conformational analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the
research of Professor Maria Ngu-Schwemlein of Southern University. Professor
Ngu-Schwemlein proposes to study the interactions between metal ions and small
molecules that are modeled on proteins. With a detectable interaction between
these molecules and specific ions, applications toward ion selective sensors,
ion chromatography, and metal ion detoxification will be possible.&lt;br/&gt;
