9625420 Deligne It is almost thirty years since conjectures of Robert Langlands
changed the direction of research on automorphic forms and representation
theory. This award provides support dor a conference on the Langlands program.
The objectives of the conference are (1) to bring the ideas of Langlands before
a wide mathematical audience; (2) to describe recent developments in major areas
of the Langlands program; (3) to attempt to anticipate future directions of work
on the problems making up the Langlands' program. The Langlands program is part
of number theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in
number theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in
other diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general
philosophy that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern
approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern number theory is very technical
and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical
computer science and coding theory.
