until they can subsist on their own. Until recently, little research has been
directed towards the elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying parental
behavior. It is now known that the preoptic area is involved in the regulation
of maternal responsiveness. Destruction of this brain region prevents the
display of maternal behavior, and direct local application of hormones to this
region can stimulate maternal behavior. Although it is recognized that the
preoptic area is important, the way in which it produces its influence over the
behavior is still not known. Dr. Numan's research is directed at providing this
answer. Using neuroanatomical and neurochemical techniques, he will examine the
larger neural circuitry within which the preoptic area operates to mediate
maternal behavior. Dr. Numan will determine the areas in the brain that project
to the preoptic region, and where the preoptic area, in turn, projects to
influence maternal behavior. Moreover, he will determine the neurochemicals used
in the identified neural circuits. This basic research forms the beginning of
our understanding of the neural substrates of maternal responsiveness. Once the
biological underpinnings of normal behavior are defined, it will be possible to
identify what might go wrong in the brain during abnormal parenting. It is this
typ e of basic research that will eventually lead to uncovering of some of the
biological causes of poor mothering such as child abuse and neglect, and
disorders such as postpartum depression. ***
