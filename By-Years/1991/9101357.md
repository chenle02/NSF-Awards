Professor Ezra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study energy transfer and unimolecular decay using both
classical and quantum mechanics, ion-neutral molecule collisions by classical
trajectory methods, and electron correlation in doubly-excited states of two-
electron atoms by semiclassical methods. The goals of the project are to enhance
our understanding of these processes, to obtain insight into the relation
between intramolecular energy flow and unimolecular decay rates, and to develop
a novel approach to two-electron correlation. The examples to be studied are the
HOOH molecule, the Li positive ion with molecular nitrogen, and the helium atom.
%%% The transfer of energy within a molecule, leading up to its dissociation
into fragments, and the low-energy collisions between an ion and a neutral
molecule, resulting in deactivation of the vibrationally-excited ion, will be
studied by a combination of classical and quantum mechanics. These are two of
the most fundamental processes by which energy is transferred within and between
molecules.
