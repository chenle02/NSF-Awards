Dean The National Science Foundation will continue its long term support of the
University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research. This grant allows the
laboratory to hire a full-time dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological
samples and also provides support for student assistants. The technique of tree-
ring dating was pioneered at Arizona. because the rate of tree growth is
determined by environmental conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in
form and thickness. It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by cross
matching trees from the present to well back in the prehistoric past and then to
use this "master record" to date small wood samples collected from
archaeological and other situations. For archaeologists in the Southwestern
United States, this technique has been a boon because it allows materials to be
dated within one year. This far exceeds the accuracy of radiocarbon dating.
Because it has not been adequately supported and because many archaeologists
lack the funds to pay for its services, the Arizona laboratory has not been able
on its own to keep pace with archaeological requests for sample dating. This
project will help to remedy that situation. In particular, it will benefit young
scientists and those not associated with main line research institutions.
