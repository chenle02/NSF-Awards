The first area of research deals with the transport properties in liquid helium
near the superfluid transition. It is proposed 1) to investigate the non-linear
temperature profile when the normal and the superfluid phases coexist under a
heat current, and the dynamics of the interface. 2) to continue systematic study
of transport properties in very dilute solution of 3He in 4He. The second area
is concerned with dynamic phenomena in solid H2 and D2. They propose 1) to study
the clustering of ortho-H2 in H2 through quantum diffusion simultaneously via
NMR and thermal conductivity experiments. 2) to extend in a new high-pressure
cell the NMR measurements of ortho-H2 clustering to 1 kilobar.
