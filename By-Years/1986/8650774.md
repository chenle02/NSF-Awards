Through the purchase of four controlled-environment growth chambers, the Pomona
College Biology Department is creating a facility in which to conduct
experiments on a variety of aspects of plant growth and reproduction. These
experiments will improve the training of upper- division biology majors in
several different sub-disciplines: (1) it will permit the investigation of the
effects of temperature, light levels, day length, and humidity on many aspects
of plant metabolism, growth and development (Plant Physiology); (2) by providing
homogeneous environments for plant breeding studies, it will allow the
measurement of heritabilities of quantifiable characters, and hence the study of
the effects of natural and artificial selection on polygenic traits
(Evolutionary Biology); (3) by providing homogeneous environments, it will
facilitate experimental investigations of the effects of competition among
plants (Ecology). These experiments will train undergraduate students in
techniques valuable not only in pure research, but also in applied fields such
as agriculture, and will help to generate interest in and excitement about the
biology of plants.
