The goal of this project is to assist the Biology Department at Saint Mary's
College to strengthen undergraduate laboratory instruction in cellular and
molecular biology. The ultracentrifuge and liquid scintillation counter
purchased through the project will have a major impact upon the improvement of
laboratory work involving the preparation, use, and analysis of subcellular
organelles, viral particles, and such macromolecules as DNA, RNA, and proteins.
The ultracentrifuge has become an essential tool in laboratories doing
preparative work with DNA and RNA, or with subcellular fractions such as
ribosomes, mitochondria, and viruses. The scintillation counter is used in
conjunction with the ultracentrifuge to quantify the incorporation of
radioisotopes into these fractions. Experimental work with these two instruments
is now basic to advances in a broad range of scientific fields. It is important
that students become familiar with the use of such modern instrumentation and
thereby gain an appreciation of current research strategies in cellular and
molecular biology. As St. Mary's moves to modernize and strengthen the biology
curriculum, more emphasis is being placed on laboratory experience in cellular
and molecular biology--one of the core areas in the department. Older courses in
Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Microbiology all will benefit greatly from the
acquisition of an ultracentrifuge and liquid scintillation counter--instruments
essential for the new course in Molecular Biology and for more sophisticated
student research projects. They will allow significantly improved "hands-on"
laboratory experience for undergraduate biology majors.
