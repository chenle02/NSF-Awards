9351779 Durojaiye Laboratories in Experimental Biology, Microbiology, and
Physiology are upgraded by addition of a Controlled Environment Chamber. The
equipment allows undergraduates to learn and conduct experiments/research in a
low temperature environment. The equipment improves the entire Biology
Department's curriculum by creating an environment whereby experiments can be
performed that supplement regular lectures and computer aided instructions. The
project benefits over 1,200 students enrolled in biological courses at Morris
Brown College and other students that are involved in cross-registration in
these science courses. The techniques learned, from using this equipment,
provide a firm foundation for the under-represented minority groups seeking
advanced training in the biological sciences. ***
