The ability of a few insect species to use chemical compounds acquired from
their host plants to defend themselves against their own predators, has
fascinated biologists for over a century. Nevertheless, relatively little is
known about the biochemical mechanisms that enable only a few species to store
these compounds. Dr. Bowers will use DNA sequencing to determine the
evolutionary relationships among a group of butterflies which has species that
can store toxic compounds, iridoid glycosides, and species that cannot. This
phylogeny will then be used to examine the evolution of hostplant use patterns
in this insect group and the evolution of the biochemical mechanisms enabling
some species to store these compounds. The results of this research will provide
a phylogenetic framework in which to examine the evolution of unpalatability in
insects. Dr. Bowers will apply the techniques learned during this year to many
aspects of her future research and her training of students in evolutionary
ecology. Understanding the mechanisms that enable insects to cope with chemical
compounds they encounter in their hostplants may also inform our understanding
of how insects cope with chemical compounds, such as pesticides and herbicides,
that have more recently become a part of their environment.
