Partial funding for the purchase of a shared 500 MHz NMR spectrometer is
requested. The proposed instrument will greatly aid in the nine research
projects outlined in this proposal. These include the structure and dynamics of
bacteriophage T4 lysozyme; the structure of the "zinc finger" of bacteriophage
T4 gene 32 protein; the nature of the interactions of tetraalkylammonium
compounds with DNA; the structure of a determinant in the sorting of yeast
carboxypeptidase to the vacuole; the structure and thermodynamic properties of
an aspartic acid residue involved in proton pumping by the F1/F0 ATPase; an
investigation of the direct transfer of substrates between enzymes; the
synthesis of biologically important compounds; the mechanism of action of
coenzyme B12; and the structure and mechanism of inhibition of serine proteases
by selenoxide containing compounds.
