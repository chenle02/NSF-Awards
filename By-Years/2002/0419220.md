This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop new high strength ceramic matrix composites using low cost processing
techniques. Ceramic matrix composites represent an important class of materials
for high performance applications including armor and structural materials.
These composites are lightweight, temperature resistant, and corrosion
resistant. Reinforcing whiskers, such as silicon carbide, have been used to
increase the tensile strength and fracture toughness of ceramic composites.
Properties such as tensile strength are directly related to the mechanical and
chemical interactions between the reinforcing material and ceramic matrix. This
project will focus on a simple low cost method of controlling the interfacial
interactions between an alumina matrix and the silicon carbide whisker-
reinforcing phase of a ceramic matrix composite.

The successful demonstration of this innovation should lead to a better
understanding of ceramic matrix composite as well as the development of a low
cost method for production of ceramic matrix composites for application as high
strength, lightweight materials for structural and protective armor
applications. The market growth will be fueled by the development of low cost
methods of improving composite properties
