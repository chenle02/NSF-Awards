Department holdings in the area of light microscopy will be upgraded by
purchasing transmitted and incidence light fluorescence attachments for an
existing microscope, and acquiring video equipment to allow students to view and
record their results. Courses in which the new equipment will be used are in
light microscopy and photomicroscopy, immunology, microbiology, and electron
microscopy. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
