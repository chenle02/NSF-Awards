A multiple-instruction, multiple-data parallel computer with a hypercube
geometry, the NCUBE/10, will be acquired for the Neurosciences Institute
Biological Modeling Center. A UNIX operating system will be employed with "C" as
the language for modeling. Major research programs the will utilize the NCUBE
include: 1) synthetic neural modeling based on the theory of neuronal group
selection, 2) functional plasticity in adult cerebral cortical maps, 3)
morphoregulatory processes and pattern formation in embryological development,
4) cellular automata fluids, and 5) crystallographic analyses of molecular
recognition systems. Substantial computing resources are critical for progress
in each of these areas. The theoretical studies should make a significant
contribution to advancing critical areas of brain research that are now ripe in
view of recent advances in experimental knowledge.
