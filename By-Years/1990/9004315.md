Continent-continent collisions commonly produce high topography with rapid
uplift rates and accompanying high erosion rates, however these important
tectonic parameters are difficult to quantify. This project will utilize
fission-track technology to constrain uplift rates in the still-active
Northwestern Himalaya. Measurement of the erosion and uplift rates prevalent
during orogeny will provide constraints for metamorphic tectonic, and geodynamic
models of continent-continent collisions.
