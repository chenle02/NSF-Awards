9421906 Melosh The project will provide support for several US numerical
modelers to attend the workshop on tectonic modeling of convective and tectonic
processes in Oleron, France, June 20-26, 1993. This workshop is a unique
gathering where codes and numerical methods of solving tectonic problems are
emphasized, rather than the results of such application. In particular, the
workshop provides a forum for the benchmarking of numerical codes. The
interactions and sharing afforded by such a workshop are invaluable in the
advance- ment of the science. ***
