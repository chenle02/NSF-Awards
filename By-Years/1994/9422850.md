9422850 Chappell This project involves an extension of prior research supported
by the National Science Foundation by these investigators. The research program
involves the study of political pressures exerted on individual members of the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) the principal policymaking unit of the
Federal Reserve, and the responses of those individuals to these pressures. The
earlier project developed an econometric methodology for estimating monetary
policy reaction functions for individual FOMC members. In this investigation,
the researchers update the coding of their data set describing policy
preferences of individual FOMC members using the newly released transcripts of
post-1`976 meetings. Using the updated data, individuals' reaction function
parameters will be estimated and tests of hypotheses concerning political
influences will be undertaken. This research will help to provide a rigorous
descriptive history of monetary policymaking since 1976; it will also provide
more current evidence concerning the internal response of the Federal Reserve to
its economic and political environment. The data set created will provide a
useful resource for scholars investigating monetary policymaking in the future.
