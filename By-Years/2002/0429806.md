Statistical Techniques for Computer Performance
Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research seeks
to investigate mathematical and formal methods for evaluating new computer
system architectures. It involves adapting fundamental techniques from existing
statistical and mathematical theory to permit the use of simulation-based
evaluation in exploratory design. Specific issues to be studied deal with
workload compression using sampling, and benchmark synthesis based on workload
and parameterized models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed full-system simulation
with real-world workloads is the preferred method of performance analysis in the
microprocessor and computer system design community today, in preference to
analytic modeling or the use of synthetic benchmarks. However, the very large
simulation times taken by this methodology prohibits good design space
exploration needed for increasingly complex designs. In addition, the project
will address the training of computer architecture students in neglected areas
of statistical or analytical modeling techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
