Quantum models are playing an increasingly important role in physics and other
natural sciences. Geometric spaces that parametrize approximations of quantum
objects by matrices are therefore an important tool in the study of several
models of natural phenomena. Not surprisingly, these spaces play a crucial role
in several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Unfortunately, such
spaces are often difficult to study since they are usually not smooth enough.
Intuitively speaking, this means that they have too many edges and corners. This
project is centered on a tool that refines these spaces in a way that appears to
overcome many of these difficulties. The work is anticipated to lead to new
insights into several questions where such spaces play a role. It also unifies
several research areas by focusing on applications of this tool in different
parts of mathematics, in addition to further developing this tool as an end in
itself.

In earlier work, the investigators constructed a derived version of
representation varieties of associative algebras by extending the representation
functor to differential graded (DG) algebras and deriving it in the sense of
non-abelian homological algebra. This gives a new homology theory for algebras,
called representation homology. This project aims to give a new construction of
representation homology of associative algebras in terms of classical (abelian)
homological algebra and also extend it to other structures of topological
nature. This should lead to various applications in geometry and topology and
open the way to efficient computations. A number of precise conjectures
regarding the structure of representation homology of classical spaces will be
investigated. In addition, the investigators will attack some well-known hard
problems in representation theory (such as the strong MacDonald conjecture)
using new topological methods.
