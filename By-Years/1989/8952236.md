This funding supports the establishment of an undergraduate Computer Aided
Design (CAE) teaching laboratory facility and the integration of CAE technology
throughout the electronics curriculum and its service courses. The facility
consists of 11 HP 360C+ 2-Dimensional color workstations, 152 MB fixed disk,
cartridge tape drive, and a high resolution color graphics monitor. This
improvement enhances the quality and content of the electronics program and its
service courses for 410 students in the three technology programs and provides
entry- level professionals with extensive CAE experience. The institution is
providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
