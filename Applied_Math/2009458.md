Fluids and gases are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit a wide range of
interesting phenomena observed in laboratories, daily life, or space. Their
dynamics is governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE). The
objective of this project is to investigate long time dynamics and singularities
for solutions to PDEs arising from compressible fluid dynamics and kinetic
theory with emphasis on physically important objects in the presence of
boundaries. They have rich applications in mathematical sciences and engineering
and offer a great deal of mathematical challenges. The advances from this
project will enhance the understanding of highly nontrivial phenomena and bring
novel mathematical methods that could resolve unsolved questions. The research
project will be integrated with education and outreach activities through
student research projects, mentoring activities, course development and
recruitment.

Specifically, the following topics will be pursued: (i) stabilization mechanisms
and long time dynamics of compressible Euler and MHD flows (ii) stability of
gravitational collapses and stellar rotation for self-gravitating stars modeled
by the Euler-Poisson system (iii) a new well-posedness theory for the Vlasov-
Poisson system and stability of equilibrium galaxies (iv) boundary collisions
for the kinetic transport and Fokker-Planck equations. The goal is to find
mathematical frameworks that capture the underlying physical phenomena and to
develop mathematical theories by applied analysis and PDE methods.
