Over the past two decades the University of California at Berkeley has been
actively engaged in improving undergraduate education in science and
mathematics. As a part of these efforts, the Professional Development Program
has created the `Intensive Discussion Section` (IDS) model for mathematics.
These IDSs, which emphasize active student learning of course material at a high
level, as well as collaborative efforts and good communication skills, have
proven highly successful in advancing certain underrepresented groups through
introductory calculus courses. The IDS model has recently been adopted in
physics and chemistry for underrepresented students as well, with the same
success. A two-year pilot program is proposed to begin expanding these IDSs for
all students in lower division physics, chemistry, and mathematics, and at the
same time to improve cross- disciplinary exchange among these subjects. These
changes will require creation of new course materials and improved graduate
student instructor training. Coupled with other ongoing curriculum reform at
Berkeley, these improvements are expected to greatly improve student achievement
in these gateway courses, to improve student performance and retention in upper
division coursework, and to produce graduates well matched to the needs of
employers in science, engineering, technology, and other disciplines. This
proposal represents the first attempt to institutionalize academic reform in
lower division at a major research university. The results will be thoroughly
evaluated and disseminated widely.
