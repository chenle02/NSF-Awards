One of the goals of syntactic theory is to determine to what extent languages
have a shared, universal structure and to the extent their structures vary. For
instance, it is commonly assumed that all languages have verbs. But how,
exactly, are sentences constructed from verbs? Is there one single, uniform way
in which sentences are built up from their verbs, or are there language
particular differences in how this occurs? If there are such differences, what
does the morphology of verbs reveal about them?

To investigate these questions, Mr. Justin Nuger, under the supervision of Dr.
Sandra Chung, will conduct research on the morphology and syntax of verbs in
Palauan, an Austronesian language spoken by some 15,000 people in Palau, and
examine its implications for syntactic theory. Palauan verbs are unusually
morphologically complex. Information about tense, aspect, mood, voice, the
subject, and the object is expressed in this language through the use of
auxiliary verbs, affixes, and phonological alternations. With support from the
National Science Foundation, Nuger will investigate the extent to which the
complex morphology of Palauan verbs provides a window into the syntactic
structure of its sentences. In the course of his research, Nuger will analyze
the properties of various classes of Palauan verbs, including causatives,
applicatives, unaccusatives, unergatives, transitives, and passives.

Mr. Nuger will take two fieldtrips to Koror, Palau, to consult with native
speakers at Palau Community College, the Palau Ministry of Education, the Belau
(Palau) National Museum, and elsewhere in the community of Koror. Data will be
collected from recorded oral narratives, published texts, and interviews with
individual speakers.
