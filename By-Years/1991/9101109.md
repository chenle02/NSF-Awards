This award provides funds to the Center for Neurosciences and the Department of
Zoology at the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) to establish an REU
Site Program to help develop undergraduate interest in biological research. The
program will place emphasis on research in Neurobiology and Behavior and
primarily involve students from the UMCP and its sister-campus, the University
of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically black campus of the University
of Maryland. Student research will be conducted at UMCP. The program will place
great effort on recruiting and training minorities and women, not only from UMCP
and UMES, but also from other campuses of the University of Maryland System with
high minority enrollments. The REU program will introduce students to basic
research by giving them the opportunity to work in active and productive
research laboratories. A major objective of the program is to provide students
with a broader research/training experience than is typical with an individual
student working in a research laboratory. Taking advantage of the large number
of active research programs in neurobiology and behavior at UMCP, students will
have substantial opportunities to interact with all of the faculty in the
program in lectures, demonstrations, and field trips. Students will benefit
immensely by interacting among themselves and this will be developed through a
bi-weekly student-led seminar, facilitated by a faculty member, but run by
students.
