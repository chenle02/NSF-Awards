The project involves continued work on subfactor and planar algebra theory and a
new investigation of the relation between the Connes tensor product of bimodules
over von Neumann algebras and very strongly intertwined quantum systems. The
planar operad can be used to axiomatise a large class of hyperfinite subfactors
and we intend to exploit this new point of view to better understand existing
examples and discover new ones, as well as exploring planar algebras beyond the
positivity condition required for subfactors. We say that two quantum systems
are very strongly intertwined if there is an algebra of "common observables"
which means that certain of one system automatically yield measurement of the
other system. We would then expect the Hilbert space for the joint system to be
the Connes tensor product of the individual Hilbert space, taken over the von
Neumann algebra of common observables. We shall look for such systems and see if
this kind of intertwining has observable consequences.

The project is a continuing investigation of the mathematical structure of
quantum mechanics-the study of the universe on a very small scale. The states of
a system ("wave functions") are defined by a Hilbert space and operators on that
Hilbert Space represent measurements. A von Neumann algebra is a collection of
operators with certain physically relevant closure properties. "Factors" are von
Neumann algebras with no operators commuting with all others in the algebra. The
algebra of all observables localized in a region of space-time is a factor.
Subfactors occur in interesting ways when considering the causal geometry of
space-time. The project focuses on subfactors and a related way of combining two
quantum systems called the Connes tensor product which is capable of identifying
a von Neumann algebra of observables on one system with such an algebra on the
other. There are potential applications of these ideas to quantum computing,
especially through the approach of Michael Freedman.
