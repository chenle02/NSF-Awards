This research would examine the importance of the landscape matrix (the
"background" within which habitat patches and corridors are embedded) in
mediating avian communities by affecting local ecological processes. The focus
would be on urbanizing landscapes, where ecologists have long recognized urban-
associated changes in avian communities. Using avian communities in riparian
forests as a study system, this research aims to identify how the landscape
matrix mediates ecological mechanisms structuring avian communities, demography
of two model species, and behavioral decision rules governing habitat selection.
More fundamentally, the principal question addressed is: Are changes in bird
communities along a rural-urban gradient more strongly linked to demographic or
behavioral processes? Three years of preliminary research in riparian forests of
central Ohio indicate that amount of urban development within the landscape
matrix is closely associated with avian community structure and that rates of
nest depredation increase as the matrix becomes urbanized. For comparison, the
focus would be on two model species (Northern Cardinal and Acadian Flycatcher),
which are representative of urban adapters and urban avoiders, respectively.
Birds would be surveyed using mist nets, territories mapped, and nests would be
monitored to estimate basic demographic (e.g., clutch size, recruitment,
survival, and immigration) and behavioral (e.g., site fidelity in breeding and
non-breeding seasons, settlement patterns, arrival date) parameters. Energetic
factors that may affect demography (e.g., fat score, weight, wing cord collected
while banding birds), nestling provisioning rates, activity budgets, and
foraging behavior would also be measured.
