Abstract

Award: DMS-0505507 Principal Investigator: Bennett Chow

The project is aimed at the study geometric and analytic problems in the field
of Ricci flow and related geometric evolution equations. Motivated by
singularity analysis, it is of interest to obtain further understanding of
ancient solutions. We study the problem of obtaining a more detailed
classification in dimensions 2 and 3 using new Harnack inequalities, entropy
estimates and the method of Aleksandrov reflection which is particularly useful
in dimension 2. In particular Hamilton and Perelman entropy estimates, Li-Yau-
Hamilton type Harnack estimates, gradient estimates, space-time geometry,
l-function, linearized Ricci flow are techniques which may be generalizable and
useful to solve these problems. The existence problem for Type II singularities
is considered. The cross curvature flow should be useful in understanding the
space of metrics with negative sectional curvature on a 3-manifold. We propose
to investigate its long time behavior. The expository book projects will further
the understanding of geometric analysis and geometric evolution equations in the
greater mathematical and scientific communities.

Ricci flow is an important tool in the study of the analysis, geometry and
topology of manifolds, especially in low dimensions. It is intimately related to
other geometric evolution equations. The recent work of Perelman on Hamilton's
program for Ricci flow and its applications towards a possible solution to the
Poincare and geometrization conjectures has yielded a plethora of new ideas and
techniques which may be applicable to solve problems in Ricci flow and other
geometric evolution equations. This will increase our understanding of the
analysis and geometry of manifolds and related fields such as topology, partial
differential equations, and mathematical physics.
