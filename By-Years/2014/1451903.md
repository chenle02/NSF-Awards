Advances in neuroscience and neuroengineering require new tools. Of specific
need is the ability to interface electrical devices with the brain. The
challenge is coupling hard metal surfaces to the soft environment of the brain.
To address this problem, the investigators will pursue a novel direction, using
soft, flexible, biocompatible conducting polymers to form nanowires within
individual cells. These conducting polymer nanowires will provide a new tool for
neural probes, bionic implants, regenerative medicine, and the treatment of
neurological disorders.

This research will address two specific goals; intracellular delivery of a
foreign material into cells and electrochemical polymerization in a protein-
rich, high salt, environment.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) will be used
as a representative conducting polymer. Aim 1 will focus on delivery of the
monomer into the cell using the cell's own pinocytic machinery. Experiments will
use PC-12 model neurons. Aim 2 will electrochemically polymerize the monomer to
form a nanowire within the cell, establishing contacts between external
electrodes and the cell. Each Aim is accompanied by extensive cytotoxicity
assays to ensure the cells remain healthy during the process. In addition to the
biomedical applications enabled by a hybrid conducting polymer-cell, this
research will provide interdisciplinary training at the interface of engineering
and life sciences for a diverse group of students at the high school,
undergraduate, and graduate level.
