This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program is providing a
10-week summer experience in engineering education research to a group of STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduate students
recruited from across the nation. Each summer, eight REU students are working
closely with faculty members and their graduate students in the Department of
Engineering Education at Utah State University on four research projects that
focus on self-regulated learning in engineering education. Self-regulated
learning refers to learners' ability and skills to understand and control their
learning environment. Example projects on which REU students are working
include: 1) development of a self-regulation survey instrument for problem
solving in engineering, and 2) effect of computer simulation and animation on
students' motivation, self-regulating, and cognitive strategies in a
foundational engineering course. REU students are also attending a series of
workshops offered by faculty mentors. The workshop topics include self-
regulation learning and its role in engineering education, responsible research,
development of research questions, mixed methods research methodologies, and
educational data analysis. Assessment data is being collected to determine
whether REU students and their faculty mentors are better off because of this
Site program. The results of this Site program are being disseminated in a
variety of ways, such as conference presentations and journal publications. This
REU Site program acts as a catalyst for undergraduates to retain in STEM
careers, particularly careers in teaching and STEM education research.
