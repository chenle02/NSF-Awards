El Yunque peak (elevation 1067 m) at the eastern end of Puerto Rico is
frequently in clouds, so that cloud water and aerosols can be conveniently
sampled from a ground-based platform, avoiding the cost and complexities of
airborne sampling. The orographic nature of these clouds enables the
establishment of empirical relations between the composition of pre-cloud and
after-cloud aerosols and the composition of the cloud water, and therefore
offers a potential for a better understanding of cloud chemistry. Sampling and
chemical analyses of aerosols and cloud water at El Yunque constitute the main
component of the proposed research. At the El Yunque site, cloud water,
interstitial aerosols, and total (cloud + interstitial) aerosols will be
collected. Cloud water and water-soluble aerosols will also be analyzed for
anions and cations. Filter samples will be analyzed for trace elements, total
carbon, and black carbon.
