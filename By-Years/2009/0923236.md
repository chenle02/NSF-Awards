This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Chemistry Department at Northwestern
University will acquire a gas chromatograph time-of-flight (GC-TOF) mass
spectrometer for use in teaching and research. A variety of research projects
will be investigated including: 1) Organo-f-Element Chemistry - Integrated
Synthetic, Mechanistic, Catalytic, and Thermochemical Studies; 2) Enzyme Mimics
Based on Supramolecular Coordination Assembly; 3) Reticular Networks Forged for
Dynamic Processes; 4) Unlocking the Synthetic Potential of N-Allylhydrazones;
and, 5) Molecular Spintronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is
used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity
by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are
ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Chromatography is an isolation
technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture
into its constituent chemicals which are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer.
These are analytical techniques widely used to characterize the chemical
composition of a sample. The mass spectrometer will be used by undergraduate and
graduate research students and in undergraduate laboratory classes.
