Among the Dogon of Mali, West Africa, 20% of children die in their first year
of life and nearly 50% do not survive to age five years. A preliminary study of
the causes of this mortality toll has shown that children (N = 176) are
significantly more likely to survive if their parents and close paternal
relatives are monogamously rather than polygamously married. The goals of this
project are twofold: (1) to verify that marital status remains a predictor of
child survivorship in a larger sample of over 1000 children, age 0 to 5 years,
each of whom will be prospectively monitored for at least two years, and (2) to
test alternative explanations for the causes of the relationship between family
structure and child mortality. These explanations focus on differences in
paternal investment in children, competition among co-wives, the dilution of
resources in polygamous families, and the status of women. The results of this
study will have practical significance for the problem of child mortality in
SubSaharan Africa. They may also help inform other studies of children in
poverty.
