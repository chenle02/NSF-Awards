Abstract PROBER, D. E. AST-9618705 Funds will be used to develop
superconductive hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers for heterodyne receiver
application in the wavelength range from 1 mm to 0.1 mm (300 GHz - 3 THz). The
bolometer mixer consists of a submicron strip of superconductor biased in the
middle of its resistive transition. HEB mixers have recently shown broad IF
bandwidths ( &gt; 6 GHz) and low noise along with extremely low local oscillator
power requirements (TR = 650 K DSB and PLO = 15 nW at 530 GHz). Rapid thermal
response and hence large IF bandwidth is achieved by out-diffusion of hot
electrons. This mixer has no energy gap limitation (as for example is found in
superconductive SIS mixers) and is expected to operate up to several 10's of
THz. Device material, geometry, transition temperature, transition width, and
sheet resistance will be investigated to optimize mixer performance for
applications directly related to current and upcoming observational programs and
missions. Nb bridges deposited with improved conditions, and Al and Ti bridges
with very low transition temperatures will be tested to produce receivers with
enhanced sensitivity.
