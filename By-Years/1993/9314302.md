9314302 Balsam This study will use laboratory analyses to calibrate the
relationship between electromagnetic spectra and mineral composition of
sediments. The goal is to develop equations to estimate 10 major components from
spectra. The rationale is the rapid quantification of sediment compositions,
thus permitting an improvement over existing time consuming laboratory analyses
without sacrificing precision/accuracy. ***
