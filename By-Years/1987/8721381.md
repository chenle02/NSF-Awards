This proposal describes research designed to improve the technique of elemental
analysis done by electron microscopy at liquid helium temperatures. The
advantage to utilizing such low temperatures is a reduction in radiation damage
from the beam of the electron microscope which minimizes the resulting mass loss
from the specimen. This result is an important step in the development of
microanalytical techniques for biological specimens. In this project the rates
of radiation damage for various materials and substrates will be determined (by
the use of energy loss spectroscopy) to optimize the specimen environment.
Elemental label compounds will be tested for detectibility and position
stability at liquid helium temperatures. Finally, to make the operation of the
quantitative microscope more efficient and available to more users, the programs
for the system will be moved to a more user-friendly computer.
