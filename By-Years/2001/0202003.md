This dissertation research investigates the interrelationships among tourists,
tour guides, and the historical sites in Jerusalem. The principal focus is on
the role of tour guides who mediate the tourist experience for a variety of
groups who come to the site with different expectations. The guides also have to
manage the logistic difficulties in a city with repeated conflict. In-depth
interviews and participant observation are used to build a description of how
the tour guides manage the often competing relationships with the government,
the citizens, and the tourist groups. The results are expected to modify
conventional views of tourism that tourists simply consume the products offered
by the tourist sites; rather the tourist experience is a product of complex
mediation by tour guides and their social relations with several different
actors.
