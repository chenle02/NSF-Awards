A design environment is being developed in which computer engineering students
participate in a year long senior design sequence integrating material learned
and practiced in all previous courses and laboratories. Working in groups,
students are given the responsibility to design a computer-based device. Each
group designs both the hardware and the software in the C language, produces a
prototype, and writes the documentation. Emphasis is placed on the software to
hardware interface which includes system software and interrupt routines. The
major equipment to support this effort are an advanced program development
system, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and an EPROM programmer.
