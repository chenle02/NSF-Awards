This project, "Estimating Software Effort Completion", will develop and extend a
technology to avoid costly software project budget overruns. The technology,
Effort Completion Estimating, is based on a mathematical modeling technique
called Element Association Matrices. The fully developed technology would allow
software project budgets to be better estimated in advance and effectively
managed while in-process. It would also allow selecting which changes can be
made to software without risking system instability. The objectives of the
project are to identify critical cases for the mathematical technique, search
for quantitative methods to replace subjective assessments, identify the
theoretical or empirical statistical distribution of the modeling technique, and
test predicted results with expectations.
