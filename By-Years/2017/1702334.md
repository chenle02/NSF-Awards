This award will support computational and experimental research towards
understanding the mechanisms for synthesis of nanomaterials in low temperature
plasmas. The high chemical reactivity of low temperature plasmas (LTPs) -- a mix
of free interacting charged and neutral particles -- presents a tremendous
opportunity for producing novel materials. With the theoretical limits for
processing materials into new configurations via interactions with LTPs still
unknown, there is also a chance for experimental discovery of novel processes to
alter materials in unexpected ways. The use of LTPs in manufacturing of
nanomaterials is ubiquitous, for example, in producing integrated circuits used
in computers or in developing advanced electricity storage batteries.
Fundamental knowledge of the formation and growth of nanoparticles in low
temperature plasma is, thus, essential to the further improvement of advanced
manufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore a new
aerosol mechanism in LTPs that has not been previously considered. The mechanism
allows for the production of monodispersed nanoparticles comprised of materials
for which production methods are currently not known. In LTPs, nanoparticles can
be vaporized as a result of ion bombardment. The vaporization results in a
supersaturated vapor. The supersaturated vapor, in turn, condenses back onto
particles in the plasma or nucleates new clusters. This process of vaporization
in the plasma followed by condensation can result in a monodispersed size
distribution. In fact, such a process can transform a polydispersed aerosol into
a monodispersed aerosol with high mass yield. Strong preliminary evidence
supports the new mechanism. The goals of this project are to 1) develop a robust
computational model that incorporates the new mechanism, which will be general
and applicable to many different materials using the plasma parameters and
residence time as inputs; 2) develop methods to experimentally control the
position of the monodispersed peak; 3) identify scaling parameters that would
allow the mass throughput to be increased while maintaining a given
monodispersed size distribution; and 4) apply the mechanism to synthesize
compound semiconductor nanocrystals containing two or more elements.
