The relationships between chemistry and art provide for an exciting course that
will stimulate interest and learning among humanities, social science, and
science concentrators. Laboratory experiments illustrating the chemical
principles involved in the artist's use of materials and the analysis of those
materials will be integral to the course. Experimental design will require
careful research and development to insure appropriateness and effectiveness.
Topics for exploration in this laboratory-oriented course will illustrate the
features, trends, and regions of the Periodic Table, introduce students to
modern laboratory instrumentation, and reveal the concepts and categories that
physical scientists use to understand light and matter.
