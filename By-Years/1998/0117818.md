The difficulties of obtaining data on homicide victims means that studies have
to either rely on small and atypical samples, or study differences in aggregate
rates across geographical areas. This makes it difficult to tests theories of
individual-level risk taking that posit the importance of behaviors such as
drinking, carrying a gun, or fighting frequently for homicide victimization.
This project uses a special data set, The National Mortality Followback Survey,
based on a sample of 22,957 citizens age 15 and over who died in 1993. The
survey obtains data from the next-of-kin and friends of the decedent, and,
importantly for this project, oversamples victims of homicide. To consider
multilevel influences, the project links this survey data to neighborhood
variables. The results contribute to a test of theories of risk-taking and fill
a gap in the literature on homicide victimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
