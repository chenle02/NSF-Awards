Dr. Virginia W. Cornish has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Cornish received the doctoral degree from the University of
California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Peter G. Schultz. Dr.
Cornish will continue research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
under the sponsorship of Professor Robert T. Sauer. The postdoctoral research
examines the importance of N- and C-cap residues in stabilizing alpha-helices.
The work uses genetic selections to isolate proteins with particular residues in
the N- and C-cap positions, as well as x-ray crystallography and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the three-dimensional structure
of the proteins. Understanding is gained into how to design genetic selections
so that in addition to engineering proteins with novel catalytic properties, one
my use the selections to learn about the requirement for successful catalysis.
The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
