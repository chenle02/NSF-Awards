9722719 Ludwig This award supports the development of software for analysis and
graphical presentation of data relating to research in geochronology relying on
radioactive isotope systems. The Isoplot program, currently in use by a majority
of geochronology laboratories worldwide, will be upgraded for adaptability to
modern hardware/software platforms. The upgraded version of the Isoplot program
will be made available at no charge to any interested user. ***
