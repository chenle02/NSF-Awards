Funding from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support
acquisition of an Scanning Electron Microscope with secondary and backscattered
electron detectors, electron backscatter diffraction capability, and live-color
cathodluminescence capability for the Department of Earth Sciences at the
University of Maine. The instrument will be used to support faculty and student
research in geodynamics and crustal studies and studies of global climate
change. The instrument will be the primary research tool of an early career
researcher, but will be utilized by several faculty within the department. The
scanning electron microscope facility is unique within the state of Maine and
will thus operate as a regional facility for research collaboration with
scientists from other universities, state government agencies, such as the Maine
Geological Survey, and private industry. The facility and its personnel will
also participate in outreach activities for K-12 education and the Penobscot
Indian Nation.
