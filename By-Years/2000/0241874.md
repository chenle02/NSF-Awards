This project supports three summer conferences on political methodology. The
conferences constitute the 20th thru 22nd such meetings, which have been
sponsored by NSF and university host institutions since 1986. Each meeting
brings together approximately 100 faculty and graduate students. There are
several aims of the conferences. First, they provide a forum for state of the
art political methodology by allowing scholars to present the newest methods in
the field for discussion and debate. Second, they provide a forum where scholars
in the field can debate and agree on best practices in different areas, which
can then be disseminated to the field. Third, they enhance graduate training by
exposing them to the state of the art in a fast-moving field, rather than
leaving them believing that what they have read in older articles is the best
available technology for dealing with estimation and specification issues in
political science. Fourth, they allow junior faculty to receive state of the art
training and advice on specific research problems. Fifth, they provide mentors
ship opportunities and networks for new scholars, whether they are graduate
students or junior faculty. The conferences are regarded widely as the best
mechanisms for advancing methodology in political science.
