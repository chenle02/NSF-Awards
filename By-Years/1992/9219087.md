9219087 Malin This award supports a project to quantify physical and chemical
weathering rates in the Dry Valleys region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The
ultimate goal of this long term project is to use information about weathering
rates to help elucidate past environmental conditions in this area. The specific
work proposed here is to collect abrasion targets, which have been exposed for
10 years at 10 sites in the Dry Valleys and one site at the Allen Hills, and
collect other information about site conditions. This will result in 10 year
average weathering rates for several different standard materials as a function
of environmental conditions at each site. Weathering rates determined from this
study will be an important parameter to consider in interpretation of exposure
age dates that are used to estimate the history of ice and snow cover. ***
