Studies of state environmental policy, with few exceptions, have concentrated on
state implementation of federal mandates and have ignored state environmental
policy innovations. This research seeks to explain variations in state
environmental policy innovation. State policy innovations from 1980 to 1993 in
four environmental policy areas will be examined: hazardous waste, groundwater
protection, air pollution, and solid waste recycling. Critical theoretical
propositions derived from the literature on policy innovation and diffusion will
be systematically tested. Data drawn from a fifty state survey of state
administrative officials as well as from interviews with federal EPA officers
will be used to test the importance of policy networks and entrepreneurs,
regional determinants, and federal involvement. A content analysis of
congressional hearings on existing federal environmental laws will also inform
the analysis.
