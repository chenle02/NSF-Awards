Modern smartphones from Apple, Google, and others have remarkably complex
security needs. Applications, installed from a variety of third-party vendors,
must be separated from one other, since some might be buggy or malicious, yet
they must also communicate and share in a variety of ways, including displaying
multimedia, sharing authentication credentials, and acting as local proxies for
remote Internet sites to support payment services, advertisements, and so forth.

We design, implement, and evaluate novel smartphone mechanisms, leveraging
Google's open-source Android project. For example, we carefully control how
privileges are managed within the phone as applications collaborate. We must
defeat "confused deputy" attacks, where privileged-but-buggy applications
inadvertently allow their callers to exercise sensitive privileges, yet our
infrastructure must also enable "intentional deputies" who are trusted to
leverage dangerous privileges while offering safe interfaces.

Our work also considers the user's view of security features. Many applications
require users to frequently retype passwords, annoying users and also making
them vulnerable to spoofing attacks, because an attacker can fake a pixel-
perfect dialog. We are studying a variety of approaches to improve security and
usability, including better ways for applications to share credentials with one
another (avoiding dialog boxes), and better ways for multiple applications to
share screen real-estate (avoiding the need for singleton applications to be
granted unnecessary privileges).

All of our research output will be available under suitable open-source
licenses, helping our work to influence phone vendors and ultimately to have
impact on the huge installed base of smartphone users.
