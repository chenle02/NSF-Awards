Capital equipment funds are provided for a dilution refrigerator and
accessories. This equipment will be used on experiments which investigate the
properties of two-dimensional fluids and solids supported by a liquid helium or
solid hydrogen surface. This system, made up of simple particles with well
understood interactions and supported by a smooth substrate, is a system easily
subjected to theoretical analysis and is an ideal prototype of two-dimensional
systems. Theory suggests that information gleaned from this system should be
valuable in the understanding of phase transitions and other properties of two
dimensional systems which are more difficult to investigate. A study of this
system will also test new theoretical techniques and recent predictions. The
principal investigator is experienced and well-regarded in this field. This
equipment will enhance considerably the research supported by the Low
Temperature Physics Program.
