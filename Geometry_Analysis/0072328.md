Abstract

Award: DMS-0072328 Principal Investigator: Wenxiong Chen

Professor Wenxiong Chen will work on a series of nonlinear problems in
differential geometry. One of his main subjects is prescribing Gaussian and
scalar curvature: given a function on a Riemannian manifold, can it be realized
as the curvature of some pointwise conformal metric? This is equivalent to
solving certain semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations. He will
also work on uniformization theorems on singular surfaces and the existence of
harmonic maps between complete, noncompact manifolds, which are closely related
to the study of fourth order nonlinear elliptic equations, nonlinear elliptic
systems, and nonlinear parabolic systems.

According to Einstein, the Universe we live in is a curved space, in which
gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of space-time in the neighborhood
of a massive object and this change of shape is measured by the curvature
tensor. Chen's research is focused on understanding when a given function can
become a curvature. This is a challenging problem in Riemannian geometry and the
analysis of partial differential equations, to which many researchers have
contributed. The nonlinear partial differential equations and systems studied in
this project have various applications in physics, chemistry, and biology, such
as in fluid dynamics, combustion theory, and river pollution
