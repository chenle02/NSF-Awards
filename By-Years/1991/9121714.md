This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology in a fishing region of Tanzania. The project will investigate how
recent projects of economic development have impacted the roles and status of
women. Using ethnographic methodology of participant observation, structured
interviews and examination of archives the study will describe the nature of
women's involvement in the artesenal fishing industry and attempt to understand
the impacts of recent development projects on the status of women. The student
is well-prepared for the research by virtue of previous experiences in Africa on
fishery development projects. This research is important because it will add a
case study to the literature on the (detrimental) impact of development on
women, with special focus on means by which projects can benefit women (and the
dependent children they care for). Focusing on this issue in a fishing community
will provide information of value to development planners, to avoid the mistakes
of the past whereby development projects were keyed to the needs of men on the
assumption that the benefits would flow directly to women and children.
