9411834 Kier The brittle star sensory system is paradoxical in that it combines
high reactivity, quick movements, and occasional predatory behavior with a total
lack of a discrete sense organ. In addition brittle stars can discriminate
between polarized and unpolarized light and this perception could be based on
differential light transmission through a polarizing skeleton. This study will
provide crucial information on (1) the nature and capabilities of diffuse
sensory systems and (2) a possibly novel mechanism of polarization sensitivity.
Experiments will determine whether and how the novel optical property of the
endoskeleton of the brittle star is used by the animal. This proposal outlines
the first opportunity to study the function of a biological polarizing filter.
