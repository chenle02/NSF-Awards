Human Resources Personnel (HRPs) play an increasingly significant role in the
implementation of equal employment opportunity (EEO) law. These professionals
are important intra-organizational, quasi-legal decision makers operating under
conditions of uncertainty and risk, conflicting normative orders, and structural
constraint and contradiction. This project is one of the first sociolegal
studies to address the work of HRPs ethnographically, that is, through extended
in situ observation, in-depth interviews, and analysis of organizational
archival records of HRPs at matched pairs of firms selected for variation on two
key theoretical dimensions (size and regulatory environment). As such, it builds
a more nuanced scientific understanding of the processes of decision making in
complex and risky legal environments, adds to the constructive implementation of
employment law, to the development of effective EEO organizational policy, and
to the effective training and subsequent performance of HR personnel. The
research will be of substantial interest to lawmakers, judges, practicing
attorneys, and the HR profession itself.
