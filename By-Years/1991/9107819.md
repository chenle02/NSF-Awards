The research planned is related to the fast and accurate computation of non-
homogeneous/nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equations in the complex plane; the modular
code development on serial and parallel computers, and its applications to
solving nonlinear problems, in particular problems in compressible fluid flows.
The theory of non-homogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations developed here provides a
unified framework for extending the complex variable theory to solving large
classes of problems involving non-analytic functions. The effect of non-
homogeneous terms is shown to alter the analytic solution by an additive non-
analytic term which is a double integral. The fast and accurate method of
evaluating this integral provides a firm ground to successful application of the
theory to computing the solution at a superior computational complexity. The
robust code to be developed on these ideas will be used to solve large classes
of applied problems including (i) rising bubbles in a compressible fluid; and
(ii) cavitating compressible flows past curved obstacles. Computational Fluid
Dynamics is an area of research with implication for a wide variety of
scientific and engineering applications in atmospheric, physical and engineering
sciences.
