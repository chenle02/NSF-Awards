The disciplines of Molecular and Cellular Biology have evolved from essentially
descriptive and qualitative data analysis to rigorous quantitative
determinations of molecular structure and function. In order to stay at the
forefront of modern molecular biology, it is absolutely necessary to acquire the
ability to quickly and efficiently quantify data and images. This proposal seeks
to acquire "state-of-the-art" phosphorimaging capabilities to support ongoing
molecular biologic research projects at The Wistar Institute. Each of the
projects described herein is aimed at establishing the molecular bases of
diseases using modern molecular/cellular biology methods with ultimate goals of
improving diagnosis/prognosis and treatment of diseases, such as cancer, AIDS,
and other immune-system dysfuncitons and other viral diseases. The molecular
targets being examined in these diseases span the entire route of cellular
signal transduction: growth-factors, growth-factor receptors and other cell
surface receptors, cell adhesion molecules and cytoplasmic structural proteins,
soluble kinases and finally nuclear-localized transcription factors.. A
comprehensive analysis of these molecules requires sophisticated methods for
accurate quantitation of each of the parameters of their function. These
parameters include: 1) gene structure, and tpanscriptional activity (via
southern, northern and RNAse protection analyses) 2) Tissue distribution of gene
activity and developmental expression (via Northern blot and RT-PCR) 3. Protein
expression, post- translational modification and detection of associated
proteins (via CAT - assay, quantitative in vitro Kinase assays and in vitro
transcription. Acquisition of the Phosphorimager will allow each of these
parameters to be rigorously quantitated and contribute to each of the research
projects described here in a fundamental way.
