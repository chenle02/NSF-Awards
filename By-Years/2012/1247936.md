The Science & Health Education Partnership at the University of California at
San Francisco and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
are co-hosting the first-ever International Teacher-Scientist Partnership
Conference in February 2013. There has been an increasing focus on the role of
scientists in pre-college science education both in the United States and
abroad. With this increase in attention, more partnership initiatives are begun
each year with the goal of supporting K-12 science education. These partnerships
originate in individual laboratories, through university departments or outreach
centers, and through corporations and professional societies, and they receive
funding from a wide variety of sources, such as private foundations, the
National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, state and
federal Departments of Education, and international funding agencies.

The International Teacher-Scientist Partnership Conference, by bringing together
about 200 teachers, scientists, and partnership specialists for a 2-day meeting
prior to the AAAS 2013 Annual Meeting in Boston, is significantly advancing the
teacher-scientist partnership field. The Conference is an opportunity for
partnership specialists - the professionals who develop and facilitate the
partnership programs - from around the world to learn from one another about
program structures and evaluation; to develop a professional community and
potential collaborations; and, critically, to learn from teachers and scientists
involved in these programs. Funding is available for early career scientists
(graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and teachers to attend the
conference. With keynote speakers, moderated panels, and breakout sessions,
participants are sharing what has worked well for them when partnering teachers
and scientists while also learning from others. This meeting has the potential
to increase capacity for partnership work throughout the country and world. As
the Conference concludes, information from the meeting will be posted on many
websites, including those of MSPnet (www.mspnet.org) and AAAS (www.aaas.org).
