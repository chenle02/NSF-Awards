Two newly developed models, based on culturing experiments with planktonic
foraminifera, make it possible to: a) differentiate physiological from
environmental influences on the 13c and 18o of foraminiferal calcite and b)
extract new paleoenvironmental information about seasonal changes in water
temperature and the 13c of seawater total CO2 from fossil foraminifera. The
Euphotic Zone model uses the carbon isotope record in conjunction with 18o
signal to reconstruct seasonal temperature ranges in surface waters and at the
base of paleoceanic euphotic zones. The Quantitative Carbon isotopemodel
provides a technique for filtering out "vital effects" inthe 13C record to
reconstruct the 13C of environmental CO2. The objective of the research is to
expand the application of the EZ and QC models to new planktonic foranimiferal
species through culturing and physiological experiments with living
froaminifers. The new paleoceanographic information about surface ocean insight
into effects of transient and long-term changes in the euphotic zone on
paleoclimatic change.
