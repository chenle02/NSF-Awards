Fewer than 200 indigenous languages are still spoken today in the United States;
80% are not expected to survive through the 21st century. This extensive loss
will have an impact not only on the indigenous American societies in which these
languages were once predominant, but also on the scientific study of North
American languages and the evidence they provide regarding linguistic variation
and linguistic universals. Although current research is incomplete, evidence
suggests a possible positive link between language and cultural revitalization
and community health and social improvement. In addition to these benefits,
efforts to document threatened indigenous languages and cultures play an
important role in developing a deeper understanding of human cultural diversity
and human language. To advance these goals, the Myaamia Center at Miami
University and the Smithsonian Institution's Recovering Voices Program have
partnered to organize and run the Breath of Life Archival Institute to be held
at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., during the
summer of 2015.

The Breath of Life Archival Institute supported by this award is a two-week
workshop designed to bring together native language educators and learners from
communities across the United States to provide workshop participants, with the
help of linguistic mentors, direct access to archival documents of their native
languages. In most cases, the communities represented by these participants have
lost all or nearly all of their native speakers and must rely on documentation
to regenerate the knowledge of their languages. Through a series of
instructional presentations, participants will be trained on a variety of topics
including basic linguistics, how to read phonetic symbols, and how to work with
archival materials. With this preparation, participants will visit the archives
at the National Anthropological Archives and the Library of Congress to locate
important linguistic materials on their respective languages. At the end of the
workshop, participants will share projects they have created during the course
of the institute.
