Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0316250&lt;br/&gt;Matzger/Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Matzger and
his coworkers at the University of Michigan are examining the spontaneous self-
assembly of physisorbed monolayers for the formation of two-dimensional crystal
structures. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
this group is combining computational design, organic synthesis, and scanning
probe microscopic characterization to produce surfaces patterned at the
nanoscale. This approach is applied to the formation of polymer monolayers by
reaction of these self-assembled monolayer surfaces. These surfaces are used for
heterogenous catalysis, lubrication, and corrosion resistance
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Matzger and coworkers at the University of
Michigan are examining the structures of physisorbed monolayers. Using scanning
probe microscopy to characterize these adsorbed layers, routes to the formation
of robust polymerized monolayers are developed. These layers promise application
in many areas of tribology and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
