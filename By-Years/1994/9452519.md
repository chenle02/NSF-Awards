9452519 Stratton As part of an increased emphasis on the environment sciences at
Earlham College, funds are requested for purchase of equipment to upgrade our
teaching of environmental chemistry. The Earlham Chemistry Department already
has an established program in environment chemistry, including courses,
laboratory studies, and student research. We now wish to add capabilities for
atmospheric ozone monitoring experiments, air sampling experiments, and HPLC
measurement of anions using a conductivity detector. We also wish to add up-to-
date methods of sample preparation for water, soil and sludge samples, using
microwave digestion and solid phase extraction techniques.
