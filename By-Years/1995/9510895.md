Water, sound and electromagnetic waves are examples of wave phenomena that occur
in most physical systems. General relativity, Einstein's reformulation of
Newton's gravitational theory, predicts that accelerated masses produce
gravitational waves analogous to the way charges produce electromagnetic waves.
Effects of gravitational waves on the orbits of binary pulsars have already been
detected and observatories sensitive enough to observe the waves from distant
galaxies are now under construction. The goal of this project is to develop
methods for relating the properties of these waves to their sources so that the
details of the emission process, such as a black hole collision, can be
inferred. It utilizes a new and powerful computational approach to general
relativity based upon the light rays along which the waves travel.
