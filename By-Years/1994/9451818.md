9451818 Pani The teaching component of an environmental and earth sciences
laboratory is being developed by the Department of Geosciences at Northeast
Louisiana University. State and matching private funds are being provided for
the research and community-service components. The learning center serves as a
unique undergraduate teaching facility in which meteorological, geological and
geographical studies are integrated and co-located with the resources needed to
analyze and display information and to visualize major elements of ecosystems.
It expands a research laboratory combining a modern system for acquisition,
storage, and analysis of meteorological data with a geographical information
system. Through the learning center, exciting improvements in undergraduate
education occur as new exercises using actual situations involving both majors
and non-majors in the discovery process. This helps the students to better
understand basic scientific principles, visualize abstract concepts, and
consider new data types such as those produced by Doppler radars.
