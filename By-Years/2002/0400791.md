This award provides partial support for the purchase of three major equipment
items: a 16-capillary DNA sequencer, a real-time quantitative PCR machine, and a
digital phosphor/fluorescent imager. All three of these items will enhance an
existing multi-user core facility for molecular biology research in the
Department of Zoology at the University of Oklahoma-Norman Campus. The use of
molecular methods has become essential in nearly all areas of biology. Beyond
being central to molecular genetics, cell, and developmental biology, there has
been rapid growth in the use of molecular techniques in areas such as ecology,
systematics, evolution, and behavior. Molecular biology itself has recently been
driven by large-scale genome sequencing and proteomics projects, with emergent
new technologies and associated instruments. Studies in nearly all areas of
biology increasingly focus on analysis of DNA sequence, DNA fragment (e.g.,
single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and microsatellites), and gene expression
data, requiring access to sophisticated equipment frequently beyond the
resources of individual investigators or labs. The instrumentation will also
enhance undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate research training
opportunities at the University of Oklahoma.
