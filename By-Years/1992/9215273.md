This award provides travel support to Tasmania, Australia, for Gary A. Laursen
of the University of Alaska - Fairbanks and Steven L. Stephenson of Fairmont
State College in West Virginia. The two American investigators will be
collaborating with Dr. Rodney D. Seppelt of the Australian Government Antarctic
Division in conducting a survey of the four major groups of fungi on
subantarctic Macquarie Island located between Tasmania and the Antarctic
continent. The fungal diversity of Macquarie Island is little known. The
occurrence data to be generated through this study will allow characterization
of fungal assemblages, habitat associations, ecological relationships and
biogeographic patterns, with comparison to northern hemisphere high latitude
fungal assemblages. Collections gathered during this work, an invaluable
resource for future study, will be suitably housed at the University of Alaska
in Fairbanks and at the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania. At Fairmont
State College several students will assist in preparing and monitoring cultures
of dictyostelids and myxomycetes and in maintaining herbarium specimens.
