9412925 Kaid Concerns about ethical abuses in televised political advertising
have grown substantially as a result of developing video technology. This
project will inventory and quantify types of ethical abuses involving technology
in televised political ads. The project will emphasize content analysis methods
to inventory and quantify types of technological abuses. The project will also
use experimental methods for a preliminary testing of whether such technological
distortions affect voter judgments of political candidates. The findings of the
project will provide researchers, policy makers and political and media
professionals with a better understanding of the ways in which technology can
affect the American democratic process. A pilot project has found that sixteen
percent of sampled political spots from 1952-1992 contain ethically-suspect uses
of technology, and that such distortions occur more frequently in negative ads.
Results from this project will be disseminated in traditional ways (journal
articles and professional convention presentations). A videotape discussing the
problem of political ethics and video technology, providing samples of
misleading technological applications, will also be produced. ***
