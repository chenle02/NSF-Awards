This project will support the participation of US-based mathematicians,
particularly graduate students and recent PhDs, in the workshop Model Theory of
Valued Fields to be held at the Centre International de Rencontres Math√©matiques
in Luminy, France, from the 29th of May 2023 to the 2nd of June 2023. The aim of
this meeting is to present recent major developments in the model theory of
valued fields. The meeting will bring together researchers from the model theory
community with scientists working in other fields of mathematics which have
witnessed successful applications of model theoretic methods in valuation
theory, nonarchimedian geometry, and related topics.

The workshop will be the principal venue for dissemination of work on the model
theory of valued fields including results on globally valued fields, motivic
integration, the use of transseries in o-minimality, characterizations of valued
fields satisfying model theoretic tameness conditions, and imaginaries or
quotients in valued fields, amongst other topics. Direct interactions occasioned
by this meeting are expected to result in new collaborations. The conference
website is at https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2761.html
