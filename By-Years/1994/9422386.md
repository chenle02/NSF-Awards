9422386 Arnold This project explores how 25 local newspapers covered 25 members
of the House of Representatives between January 1, 1993, and November 8, 1994.
The project involves searching all editions of the chosen newspapers for any
articles, editorials, columns, or letters that mention the selected
representatives, coding the 7,500 to 8,000 items for their content, analyzing
the coded data with quantitative methods, and analyzing all individual items
with qualitative methods. The project is designed to determine whether local
newspapers report the kinds of information that citizens would need to hold
representatives accountable for their actions in office. The basic assumption is
that unbiased and readily\y available information enhances the prospects for
accountability, while incomplete or biased information serves to thwart it. The
study will explore the regularity with which local newspapers report roll-call
votes, the amount of information newspapers provide about the issues under
consideration and why representatives voted as they did, the extent to which
newspapers cover representatives' other activities, including introducing bills,
holding hearings, and building coalitions, and the types of policy issues that
attract journalists' attention. The research will also investigate whether
newspapers recount representatives' policy-related activities during subsequent
electoral campaigns. ***
