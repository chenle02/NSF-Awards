9361254 Armstrong The object of the proposed effort is to show the feasibility
of providing RF energy control using a semiconductor switch. It is postulated
that such a switch can be made by fabricating an array of high speed diodes on a
semiconductor substrate which is placed so as to control the flow of RF energy.
The proposed switch would be usable at a frequency of 140 GHz, switch at under
15 ns and handle peak and average powers of 100 W and 30 W respectively. The
results of a successful program will enhance many times the sensitivity and
resolution of pulsed resonance instruments. ***
