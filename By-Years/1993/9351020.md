9351020 Davis A number of very basic pieces of equipment are being used to
support two applied hydrogeology courses in the Department of Earth Sciences
&amp; Physics. The new field laboratory courses, Environmental Site Assessment
and Field Methods in Hydrogeology, are creating a link between the theory and
problem solving techniques learned in hydrogeology lecture and discussion
courses. These field experiences are showing the interrelationship of water
quality and quantity, and the interconnection of surface water and ground water
systems, and represent a significant enhancement of the undergraduate program in
Earth Sciences. The new courses are making use of a spectrophotometer for use in
colorimetric analysis, a digital titrator, a digital pH meter, a
conductivity/total dissolved solids meter, a down-hole probe, and two water-
level measuring devices. ***
