While much progress has been made over the last several years in understanding
tornado genesis and dissipation, the exact factors that control the formation
and demise of tornadoes is not known. Recent research using mobile Doppler
radars has revealed much about the structure of tornadoes and tornadic
thunderstorms. Many formation/dissipation theories, however, require an
understanding of detailed thermal structure in and near the tornado and Doppler
radars are not well suited to provide this information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, radiometric imaging equipment will be
used to map the temperature field at cloud base in severe convective storms and
in tornado condensation funnels. The project will be conducted in conjunction
with another NSF-funded project (ATM-0241037), in which one of the main
objectives is to use mobile Doppler radars to study tornado formation and
tornadoes in convective storms. It is anticipated that the temperature field at
cloud base near the storms' main updraft region may contain clues as to whether
or not tornado formation may ensue. This project represents the first attempt to
sense remotely, thermodynamic information at cloud base in severe convective
storms, using a ground-based mobile platform. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the
project is successful, future field experiments could lead to an increased
understanding of tornado genesis and an increase in skill in tornado
forecasting. The latter could lead to a decrease in deaths and injuries from
tornadoes.
