A seminar will take place to examine the particular aspects of the structural
system, and the design and construction of the tallest building in the world
outside the U.S. now under construction. The uniqueness of this structure is
that it is being built to sustain live loads of more than twice those required
in the U.S. and with wind loads requirements more than twice those of Chicago,
which are four times larger than the earthquake forces considered in Los
Angeles. In addition, its architectural form presents particular engineering
problems because the site of the building, Hong Kong, is often subjected to
severe natural hazards. The building is being instrumented and the process of
data gathering and analysis also will be discussed.
