Objective: The proposed project is to the 8th International Workshop on Bulk
Nitride Semiconductors to be held in Bavaria, Germany, Sept.30 - Oct.5, 2013.
The requested support of $10,000 is will be used to provide travel and
accommodation support or in the form of registration fees for up to 10
participants in the conference.

Intellectual Merit: This Workshop will bring together researchers focused on
developing growth technologies and applying these technologies to grow bulk
nitride materials and device structures for electronic, optoelectronic and
photonic applications. Leading experts will present recent accomplishments in
the field of bulk nitride growth, properties and their application in
electronics and optoelectronics. The specific goal of the workshop is to
identify critical challenges remaining in these fields and to facilitate
establishing international collaborations to jointly work on their solutions.
This meeting offers a unique opportunity for the community to share the exciting
state-of-the-art technological developments, stimulate new ideas, learn new
challenges and directions, and explore/promote new collaborations.

Broader Impact: The meeting aims to bring together international researchers
from academia, government and industry to present and assess the current state-
of-the-art of growth of bulk nitride materials and device structures for
electronic, optoelectronic and photonic applications. The meeting will help to
advance the field through sharing of results, methods, inspiring of new ideas,
and initiation of new collaborations. Participation of women scientists and
young researchers in engineering will be fostered based on NSF funds to
partially cover travel expenses and registration fees.
