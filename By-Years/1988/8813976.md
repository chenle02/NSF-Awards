Stability describes the tendency of a dynamical system to return to its desired
performance after being disturbed by external forces. For systems with
controllable input channels stabilizability indicates that inputs can be chosen
in such a way that a (possibly unstable) system becomes stable. For systems with
linear dynamics the basic questions of stability and stabilizability are
settled, while for nonlinear systems a variety of sufficient criteria is known,
without a general theory emerging. This project is to study the precise
exponential growth behavior of control systems, based on the theory of Lyapunov
exponents, geometric control theory and infinite time optional (periodic)
control. The results will enable one to - characterize stabilizable and
destabilizable systems, - determine a measure for the stability or instability
margin of a system, - compute exact stabilizability diagrams depending on the
system parameters, - pinpoint the design parameters that are crucial for
stabilizability of a system, - design stabilizing controllers. Bilinear systems
will be analyzed as prototypes of general nonlinear systems, concentrating on
developing a general theory for necessary and sufficient conditions along with
numerical procedures necessary to compute exact exponential stability and
stabilizability diagrams.
