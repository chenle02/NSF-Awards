The general subject of the research supported by this grant over the past five
years has been the basic physics of magnetic field line reconnection. This is an
important yet unsolved problem in magnetospheric physics, solar physics and
astrophysics. The approach has been to attack the problem from the most
accessible side, i.e., laboratory experiments. In the process of understanding
reconnection several related phenomena have been investigated. These include
waves and instabilities and beam-plasma interactions. Major new results have
been obtained including magnetic field topologies, plasma properties, particle
acceleration, anomalous resistivity, plasma turbulence and disruptive
instabilities. Novel diagnostics and state-of-the-art digital data processing
have been developed. In this renewal grant the same equipment with some
additions will be used in new ventures. Specifically, the topics of electric
currents in various solar terrestrial simulations will be studied; e.g.,
plasmoids, magnetic flux ropes, moving plasmas and beams. All of these are
relevant to the solar-terrestrial environment where electric currents control
the energetics of magnetospheric dynamics.
