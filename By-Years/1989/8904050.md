The new IRIS/PASSCAL instrumentation program supported by NSF has made
available a new crustal exploration technique using data sets which combine
vertical-incidence and wide-angle seismic reflections. No satisfactory
processing schemes exist for this type of data which involve denser receiver
deployments with coarsely spaced shots. This will likely become the standard
crustal exploration geometry. This research will develop computer techniques to
directly process seismic shot gathers, rather than working with the Common Depth
Point (CDP) approach. The data processing capabilities developed here will be
valuable to industrial exploration efforts and are part of the essential tools
needed to take advantage of the new crustal imaging techniques that will be used
by numerous scientific investigations.
