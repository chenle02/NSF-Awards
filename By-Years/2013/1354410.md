Project Overview

The project examines the Israeli National Water Carrier, the largest water
project in Israel, and how its creation and evolution reflect several aspects of
national identity including state building, state power structures, and Israeli-
Palestinian relations. The goal is to demonstrate through archival research that
the National Water Carrier served to foster the Israeli state with a strong
centralized government through techno-scientific development.

Intellectual Merit

The topic is well situated within STS and stands to make a significant
contribution to studies about water management from the perspective of techno-
science and actor-network theory. The topic is timely and relevant to the
ongoing conflicts over natural resources, state identity, and development; there
are no prior studies of the National Water Carrier from this perspective, and
water is increasingly scarce in the region.

Broader Impacts

The results of this research will be relevant for a diverse audience including
historians, STS scholars, area studies specialists, political geographers, and
others. They could also have an impact on relevant Israeli and Palestinian
audiences.
