This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it
addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea.
Humankind's exploration of the gravitational-wave universe began with the
National Science Foundation's Advanced LIGO observation of the collision of two
black holes in 2015. This breakthrough started a revolution in astrophysics that
is still ongoing and that is directly driven by the detector's sensitivity. This
project tackles the most limiting noise in terrestrial gravitational-detectors:
quantum noise, thermal noise, and the numerous actuator-related noise couplings
at low frequency. Its goals are to enable Advanced LIGO to overcome the current
quantum and thermal noise limitations, and to collaborate with the LIGO
Laboratory to address the diverse noise sources at low frequencies, enabling
gravitational-wave detectors to continue to unravel the mysteries of the
universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award is funding i) Developing
and deploying of novel phase front sensors for characterizing and controlling
the optical wave front in gravitational-wave interferometers with a high arm
cavity laser power, ii) Support for commissioning high power operations and
improved sensitivity for Advanced LIGO A+ in preparation for the O4 and O5
observation runs, and iii) Research and design work for integrating new
crystalline optical coatings (AlGaAs), test mass actuators and wave front
control elements into post-O5 Advanced LIGO and Cosmic
Explorer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
