A workshop on Analysis and Simulation of Multiscale Nonlinear Systems is planned
for the week June 25-29, 2007 at Oregon State University. A total of 70
participants, a mix of junior scientists and established researchers, will
include mathematicians, geoscientists, engineers and computational scientists.
The intent is to advance the state of subsurface modeling at the meso and macro
scales, while providing rigorous justification of the proposed techniques. A co-
equal focus is on discussion of such topics as atomistic-to-continuum modeling,
numerical upscaling, stochastic and probabilistic methods, and developments in
continuum mechanics and materials science, which are relevant to the central
theme but have broader applicability. Workshop presentations and posters will be
stored in digital form at the OSU library and made generally available.
Publication of proceedings is planned.
