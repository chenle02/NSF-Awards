0406743&lt;br/&gt;Lacovara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will
provide support for a planning visit by Dr. Kenneth Lacovara, Drexel University,
to work with Dr. Ruben Martinez of the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia to
to assess the quality and significance of a recent dinosaur discovery and to
plan logistics for collaborative paleontological and geological research in the
area. The Pis have the unique opportunity to sample and collect Late Cretaceous
dinosaurs in an area of the world where they are poorly known and which
represents a biogeographically new and different set of fossils, thus,
increasing our understanding of their evolution and
distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the importance of studying
this site and these fossils, this project will involve training of U.S. graduate
and undergraduate students, strengthening the abilities of these young
researchers to conduct both basic and applied research.&lt;br/&gt;
