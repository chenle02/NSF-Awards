The objective of the project is to test how well a state-of-the-art global MHD
code does in simulating a suite of five generic space weather conditions. The
five conditions are thoughtfully chosen such that the simulations will also
provide useful insights into the physics behind the conditions. While global MHD
is the only realistic large-scale modeling tool, its theoretical limitations are
well known, and such tests are needed to estimate the practical predictive
capability of such codes at present.
