This grant supports student registration for select students participating in
the student support and mentoring program at The Nineteenth International
Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence
and Operations Research (CPAIOR) that will be held in Los Angeles, California,
June 20-23, 2022. This is the premier, highly-interdisciplinary, international
conference that brings together researchers from three distinct communities to
exchange ideas. The student mentoring program is oriented on research and career
development for students who are active within these
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central activities of this conference
include a master class to teach skills, opportunities for students to present
and discuss their work with their peers, and interaction with an identified
group of senior researchers for advice on Ph.D. research. In addition, students
will have access to invited talks and paper presentations. The student selection
process emphasizes support to students who most need it, including those who
lack other means of support. This raises the potential to bring in participants
who might not have attended this conference due to lack of habit or resources.
This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have
less developed AI programs. This event provides students with invaluable
exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their
research and enables them to explore their career
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
