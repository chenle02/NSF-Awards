AST-9731484 Bania Dr. Bania and Dr. Rood are collaborating to determine the
abundance of the one of those light elements, an isotope of helium, 3He. The
study of the origin and evolution of the elements is one of the cornerstones of
modern astrophysics. The Big Bang theory predicts that significant amounts of
the light elements (2H, 3He, 4He 7Li) are produced in the first few thousand
seconds of the Universe. The relative abundances of these elements depends upon
details of the initial conditions in the theory. In addition, over time, nuclear
fusion reactions in stars will change the relative amounts of these elements.
Observations of how these elements vary with space and time provide a crucial
probe to the evolution of stars and galaxies since the first few thousand
seconds. The PI and Co-PI have shown that it is feasible to detect and measure
these weak 3He+ emission lines, and from those measurements to derive accurate
3He abundances. The PI's are making a systematic study of 3He through the Milky
Way. This project extends that work by observing a larger sample of planetary
nebulae (where reprocessing of stellar material is occurring), improving the
accuracy of the current abundances, observing new H II regions (where there has
been new star formation), obtaining improved spectra for selected H II regions,
refining the models that predict how much 3He can be present, and searching for
3He+ emission from extragalactic sources. The 3He+ emission line at 3.5 cm is
observed at a wavelength of 3.5 cm. The project uses the NRAO 140 ft, the NRAO
VLA, the MP1fR 100 m, Arecibo and (when operational) the 3.5 cm receiver at
Green Bank. ***
