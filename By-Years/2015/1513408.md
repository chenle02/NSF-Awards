Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to both an
increase in the size of genetic data available and identification of important
genetic variants responsible for a variety of diseases. Prediction for these
genetic diseases has also become of paramount importance. However, prediction
for big data such as GWAS is not trivial. A key obstacle in big data prediction
is identifying (perhaps a small number of) variable sets that lead to good
prediction when variable dimensionality can be extremely large. The project
explores why a common approach towards prediction can often fail to deliver
strong prediction rates. A novel, interaction-based and prediction-oriented
approach to extracting hidden information contained in big data will be
investigated. To improve prediction, a new criterion to guide the selection of
variable sets will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prioritizing predictivity,
not significance, requires using the correct estimates of prediction rates and
developing predictivity-based criteria to evaluate variable sets. The project
offers a novel theoretical framework by characterizing what makes for highly
predictive variable sets, and providing fundamental work towards a new criterion
to identify these sets. In the framework of this research project, variable sets
have theoretical (true) levels of predictivity, which can be estimated with
appropriately designed sample-based measures. This framework is the first that
seeks to develop estimators specific to a criterion of predictivity.
Additionally, methods that encompass both marginal and joint effects will be
investigated, and a candidate measure of predictivity will be studied. Four real
data examples are analyzed to illustrate how final predictors found via the new
approach compare to other approaches in the current literature.
