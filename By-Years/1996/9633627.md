Hydrothermal Fluxes Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a major
effect on the chemistry of the oceans. The composition of the water that exists
from hot springs (hydrothermal vents) can tell us what processes occur in the
ocean crust to form the water. Key features of the vent water, including the pH,
the abundance of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, and temperature, can tell what
types of minerals form in the ocean crust, and whether biologic activity is
activity is occurring there. Presently, however, pH, H2 and H2S can not be
measured because we have no sensors capable of making the measurements at the
high temperatures and pressures of the sea floor. These investigators have a
prototype instrument and plan to develop, test, and deploy it to make these
important measurements.
