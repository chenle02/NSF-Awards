The Broome-Delaware-Tioga Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) and
the Roberson/Kopernik Observatory, in partnership with fourteen school
districts, industry, and private groups, have established the BOCES/Kopernick
Regional Science Center. The Solar Cycle 22 project will take advantage of the
peak of the sunspot cycle to give forty-eight elementary and middle school
teachers first-hand experience in studying solar activity. The project is
designed to assist teachers in incorporating scientific investigation into the
classroom. Because of the high interest among local teachers and among teachers
outside the area for the similar institute in 1988, this project will expand
those activities to include: residential opportunities for teachers; the active
involvement of the State University of New York, at Binghamton; the recruitment
of more under represented groups from outside the local area; and the
development of a training guide to help other observatories develop similar
teacher training programs. The cost sharing for the project will be 145% of the
NSF portion.
