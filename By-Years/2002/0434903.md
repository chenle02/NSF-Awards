This proposal seeks funds for a workshop on development of a database for
metamorphic petrology (MetPetDB). The workshop is to be held on May 20, 2004
during the spring, 2004 AGU meeting in Montreal. The purpose of the workshop is
to develop a working plan for the development of MetPetDB, to discuss the
numerous issues that surround such an effort (see text), to define the desired
functionality of such a database, to describe the types of tools that will need
to be developed in conjunction with database construction, and to design a plan
to ensure integration and compatibility with similar efforts in other branches
of the geosciences, as well as with broadly focused efforts such as GEON.
Outcomes of the workshop will include a report of workshop findings, a detailed
description of database requirements and toolkit functionality, a plan for
dissemination of results, a plan for the construction of a website to serve as a
portal for MetPetDB activities, and a schedule for future database development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of a metamorphic petrology database (and
other similar databases in the geosciences) cannot be overemphasized. When fully
operative, these are likely to change the way science is conducted by individual
researchers, will greatly facilitate collaborative research efforts, will
enhance research efficiency, will enhance cost effectiveness of sponsored
research, will enhance student research collaborative efforts, and will ensure
the longevity and global accessibility of geological data. This, and other
related efforts, will serve the entire global geological community, will enhance
educational experiences of undergraduate and graduate students, and will provide
a means of public access to sponsored research results.&lt;br/&gt;
