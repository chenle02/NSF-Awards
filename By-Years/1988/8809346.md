This Research Opportunity for Women/Career Advancement Award will allow the
principal investigator to develop research experience in remote sensing
techniques and in their applications to the study of snow, ice, and permafrost.
The effort will be directed primarily at the analysis of synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) imagery, and toward the data handling and processing protocols
related to the planned SAR Facility at the University of Alaska. The components
of the SAR Facility will begin to come on-line within the next two to three
years, and will allow the investigating of a wide range of geophysical phenomena
including sea ice, ocean waves and fronts, sediment and pollutant dispersion,
and glacier dynamics.
