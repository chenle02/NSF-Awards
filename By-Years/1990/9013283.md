The extraordinary events now unfolding in Eastern Europe offer a unique
opportunity to investigate how the tensions between socialism and utopian
ideology on the one hand and the rule of law and protection of individual rights
on the other hand will be resolved in the context of current legal reforms in
East and West Germany. With German reunification, the East German legal
institutions, lawyers, and citizens will have to adjust to a legal system
fundamentally different from the one they have known for the last forty years.
This small award will provide travel and subsistence support for the
investigator to gather data in East and West Germany in order to examine what
influence socialist concepts and thought patterns exert over the East German
legal reform process. The data collection will focus on two specific legal
contexts: the judicial review of administrative decisionmaking and the
allocation of visitation rights to non-custodial parents upon divorce. Data will
be collected from court observations, court records, interviews, and analysis of
the literature. This support will allow the investigator to take advantage of
history in the making in the unification of East and West Germany. The results
of this effort will provide valuable information for further analyses of East
German legal reform efforts and will be informative in other countries which are
struggling with the contradiction between the desire for social cohesion and the
respect for individual rights and autonomy.
