The research of this Presidential Young Investigator has two goals. The first
goal is to create software techniques to estimate automatically manufacturing
costs based on a part description stored in a computer-aided design (CAD) system
as a solid model. Manufacturing costs are a function of the machining process,
and, in turn, the machining process is a function of the features of a part. The
proposed cost estimator consists of two modules: a feature recognizer and a
feature interpreter. The recognizer acts on a solid model boundary
representation to extract form features. The interpreter uses the features in
selecting manufacturing processes and determining processing costs. In addition
to the clear benefit of being able to estimate costs during the design process,
the estimator will help determine a useful set of form features for
manufacturing in general. The second goal is to develop a feature language that
can be used to describe features in terms of geometric and topological
primitives such as faces, edges, vertices, and vertex-edge loops. The use of
feature in CAD is in its infancy, primarily because no complete taxonomy has
been developed. The taxonomy depends on the capability to sort features based
upon certain characteristics. A feature language with a well-formed grammar
would allow unambiguous definitions to be written for various classes of
features. Candidate language constructs include syntactic pattern grammars and
graph grammars. The results of this research will yield a compendium of features
together with an organized and mathematical way to define and store them. This
advances will aid those involved in both feature recognition and feature-based
design.
