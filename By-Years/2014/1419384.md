This award provides support for several international activities directed by the
International Council for Science that are closely aligned with the strategic
goals of the US Global Change Research Program (USCCSP) and with several NSF
programs on Global Change Research. This award will help support US leadership
in international science activities and to enable collaborations that are
mutually beneficial for US science and international partners in areas of global
strategic importance. These activities will principally focus on two global
environmental research activities Future Earth and Integrated Research on
Disaster Risk. Future Earth is a ten year research program to provide the
knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global
environmental change and for supporting transformation towards global
sustainability in the coming decades. It has developed out of the current ICSU-
sponsored Global EnvironmentalChange (GEC) programs following a series of
reviews and foresight exercises. Integrated Research on Disaster Risk is a ten-
year global undertaking that seeks to address the challenges caused by natural
hazard events, mitigate their impacts, and improve related policy-making
mechanisms.
