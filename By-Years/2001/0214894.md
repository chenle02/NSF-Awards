This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project intends to fabricate,
and test a condensation nucleus counter (CNC) of the turbulent-mixing type, with
a detection limit below 2 nm particle diameter, and able to measure the size
distribution of aerosol nanoparticles. A novelty of this apparatus is that its
super-saturation level can be adjusted quickly and accurately along a wide
range. This ability, along with the dependence between critical super-saturation
and embryo diameter, will make it possible to measure in real time the size
distribution of the nanometric fraction of the aerosol. It will be shown that
the design of this CNC effectively delays the onset of homogeneous nucleation;
uncharged particles smaller than 3 nm in diameter are readily activated; a
detection limit below 2 nm for uncharged particles can be achieved by using the
appropriate condensing vapor; and charged nanoparticles of arbitrary small size
are detected. Note that this demonstrated detection limit is substantially
smaller than that of the best CNC commercially available (TSI model 3025A, 3 nm
detection limit). Three tasks have been identified to materialize the goals of
this proposal: design and fabrication of a CNC prototype; experimental
demonstration of the performance of the CNC; and execution of fundamental
research on heterogeneous nucleation.&lt;br/&gt; The overall work will
eventually lead to the commercialization of an improved CNC. The main fields of
application include: bio-aerosol detection, air quality testing, environmental
studies, particle emission testing, and materials, pharmaceutical and basic
aerosol research. This turbulent-mixing CNC will enable the analysis of
macromolecules via liquid chromatography with a very significant gain of
sensitivity with respect to more common schemes. This analytical application has
considerable commercial potential.&lt;br/&gt;
