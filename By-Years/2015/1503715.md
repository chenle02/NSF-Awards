The theme of the 2015 Radiation and Climate GRC is Towards Understanding the
Interactions between Radiation, Clouds, Aerosol, Precipitation and Climate. The
GRC will be held July 26-31, 2015 and will be preceded by the third Graduate
Research Seminar on July 25-26, 2015. Together, these meetings will focus upon
outstanding issues in aerosol, cloud, precipitation and radiation interactions
from cloud to planetary scales. The GRC is novel in that it explicitly focuses
on providing ample opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers
and other early career scientists to interact with more senior researchers
throughout each day of the conference.
