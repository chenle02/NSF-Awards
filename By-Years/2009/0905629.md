This project examines how the political participation and academic performance
of African American students was influenced by racial attitudes and stereotypes
during the 2008 presidential election. If a particular group is stereotyped as
unlikely to participate in politics and unlikely to succeed academically,
members of that group may internalize this stereotype and under-perform on
relevant tasks. According to the psychological theory of stereotype threat this
is not due to a conscious decision to behave stereotype-consistent, but based on
being cognitively distracted from the task by the internalized stereotype.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study investigates two types of implicit racial
attitudes that may render individuals more or less susceptible to stereotype
threat. African-American students will participate in an experiment that
involves completing an online survey regarding their participation in the 2008
election, their support for Barack Obama vs. John McCain, and their opinions on
a number of race related policies (affirmative action, government aid to Blacks,
and slavery reparations). To elicit stereotype threat, the survey is
administered under two experimental conditions, a high stereotype threat
condition in which an all-White research team gives instructions to African
American participants, and a low-stereotype threat condition in which an all-
Black research team gives the instructions. Implicit racial attitudes are also
measured using reaction time tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have
broader impacts by generating a better understanding of how racial attitudes and
stereotypes affect members of the African American community. The findings will
be disseminated to local communities with the goal of raising awareness and
understanding of the consequences of racial stereotypes. Additionally, this
project will involve graduate and undergraduate student research assistants from
a historically black university. These students will receive specialized
training that will enrich their academic experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
