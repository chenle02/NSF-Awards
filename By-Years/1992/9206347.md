This grant supports the development of a new method to measure the thermal
conductivities of poly-crystalline samples at elevated using a dual-laser
technique. This technique will be applied to actual lower crustal and upper
mantle rocks in the form of xenolith samples. Costs for the development of new
experimental techniques will be kept to a minimum by performing the proposed
research at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, where the resources and
expertise of an Industrial Laser Research Unit, and a Lithospheric Modeling Unit
with numerous well-characterized xenolith samples will be available to the
project at no direct cost. At the successful completion of the project, the new
technology gained will be technology gained will be transferred to the US.
where, additional funding, it will become the basis on an ongoing undergraduate
research effort to characterize thermal properties of lithospheric materials.
