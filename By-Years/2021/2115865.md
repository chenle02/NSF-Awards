Asynchronous programming is in demand today because responsiveness
is&lt;br/&gt;important on all modern devices: desktop, mobile, or web.
Asynchronous&lt;br/&gt;programming is especially important in mobile and
wearable apps, which&lt;br/&gt;are expected by 2016 to reach 300 billion
downloads annually. One&lt;br/&gt;contemporary development task is refactoring
long-running, blocking&lt;br/&gt;synchronous code (e.g., accessing the web,
database, or file system)&lt;br/&gt;into non-blocking asynchronous code. While
major programming languages&lt;br/&gt;make asynchrony possible, they do not make
it easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to significantly enrich
educational resources and&lt;br/&gt;programmers? toolset for adding,
modernizing, tuning, and suggesting&lt;br/&gt;asynchrony. The PI plans to pursue
research activities in four areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Mining and recommending
refactorings; (2) Automated refactorings for&lt;br/&gt;adding asynchrony into
mobile apps, for modernizing legacy asynchronous&lt;br/&gt;code, and for
converting between async variants; (3) Detecting and&lt;br/&gt;fixing async
errors; (4) Extending async refactorings to other domains,&lt;br/&gt;with the
intent of discovering theories and reusable principles.&lt;br/&gt;This project
has the potential to revolutionize how mobile app&lt;br/&gt;programmers use
asynchrony, to educate them about successful usage of&lt;br/&gt;asynchrony, and
to significantly reduce the cost and increase the&lt;br/&gt;quality of their
code.
