This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University to acquire an
upgrade of the console of an existing 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) The
structure-function relationship of tumor suppressors, (2) Perforin-mediated
cytolysis, (3) Chemistry and biochemistry of Vitamin A and its metabolites, (4)
Reactions via ion-paired transition states, (5) Structure/property relationships
in inorganic oxide glasses, (6) NMR conformational studies of glycosidase
inhibitors, and (7) Compact domains in proteins. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will be useful in areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and biology.
