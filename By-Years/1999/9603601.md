proposed to administer a travel grant program that will enable qualified North
American scientists to attend the 33rd International Congress of Physiological
Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 30-July 5, 1997. The travel awards will
provide women and minority scientists with an opportunity to participate in the
Congress. It is also anticipated that there will be an exchange of information,
ideas and opportunities as well as the ground for the development of
collaborative interactions between the scientists from the various countries.
