Architectural Support for Effective User-Level Data Transport Abstract

The objective of this project is to enable microprocessors to better utilize
recent performance advances in I/O and networking. It seeks to enable next-
generation I/O and networking services on general-purpose microprocessors by the
addition of a subsystem consisting of multiple clusters of simple processors,
and appropriate interconnects, to handle network and I/O traffic without making
the central processor unit (CPU) core, or its operating system, an artificial
bottleneck. The research activities will prototype, demonstrate and evaluate our
proposed system though a combination hardware prototypes, software simulation
and application development.

The research directly addresses a critical problem common to all modern
information technology systems: while commodity CPU and network performance have
each independently seen dramatic performance improvements over the last decade,
their combined use results in an inefficient system. In other workloads, modem
CPUs achieve their promise on traditional computing workloads, and modern
networking systems do the same for traditional communications tasks, but a
combined system is unable to support emerging services (such as large-scale
storage systems, content scanning systems and on-demand media) at the
performance levels expected for such otherwise high-performance systems. The
central problem lies in the hardware and software interfaces between the CPU and
the network. Our proposed research aims to re-organize the CPU to better support
high-performance networks and I/O and enable a proliferation of advanced network
and I/O services on general-purpose commodity systems.
