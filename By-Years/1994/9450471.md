SSC-9450471 Clemson University Clemson, SC Green, Herman; Weatherford, David;
Leudeman, John; and Klatt, Elaine The SEEKERS project will substantially
increase the participation of minorities in science, engineering, and
mathematics (SEM) careers by increasing the number of minority students entering
college preparation curricula and enrollment in high-level mathematics and
science courses. Targeted are 7th and 8th grade children from 10 counties in
South Carolina who will enroll in a four-week residential summer science camp
followed by intensive academic year reinforcement activities. The first week of
camp will be held at Long Leadership 4-H Center; the second and third at Cooper
Leadership 4-H Center; and the final week on the campus of Clemson University.
Students will be involved in camp activities 10 hours each day for 20 days. The
disciplinary focus of SEEKERS is mathematics as applied to a variety of sciences
and technical areas with curricula tailored to South Carolina students. Follow-
up activities will be SEEKERS clubs; initiated during summer camps and
implemented in the home communities of all camp participants. SEEKERS will
impact 300 children and their families each of the three years of funding.
