The overall goal of the Morgan State University IT-Catalyst proposal is to
create an equitable and satisfying work environment for all faculty,
particularly women in the STEM disciplines. The specific aims are designed to
use both quantitative and qualitative data to inform the examination of policies
and practices affecting retention and professional advancement. Several specific
key elements related to the project include, but are not limited to: a job
satisfaction survey and evidence-based and data-driven approaches to gender
equity at Morgan State University (MSU). Overall, this project is expected to
provide Morgan with strategic plans for increasing the number of
underrepresented, women faculty in the STEM fields while also providing robust
dissemination of project results that allow the institution to serve as a model
for other HBCUs and minority serving institutions nationwide.
