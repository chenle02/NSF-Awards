This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal aims
to produce new metal phosphorous chalcogenides displaying nonlinear optical
activity, and to integrate education objectives with the research by bringing to
the curiculum topics such as solid state chemistry and nonlinear optics not
normally covered in the traditional undergraduate chemistry degree program.

Among the materials to be synthesized and characterized are new films of
nonlinear optical materials based on the chemistry of metal
hexathiohypophosphates. These materials are relevant to applications areas that
include optical data storage and optical communications technologies. The
educational benefits include a better understanding at the undergraduate level
of scientific and technological issues facing society.
