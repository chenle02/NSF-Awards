This award supports the participation of scientists at the workshop
"Gravitational Wave Bursts: Astrophysics, Data Analysis and Numerical
Relativity" to be held in Chichen-Itza, Mexico in December 2009. Gravitational
wave bursts are short signals with the potential of unveiling the broadest range
of sources of gravitational radiation such as stellar core collapse, gamma-ray
bursts engines, cosmic strings, compact object mergers. Gravitational wave
bursts are challenging sources to study because their physics and gravitational
wave emission mechanisms are not fully understood so that it is not now possible
to model them in detail and thus to interpret observations. This
interdisciplinary workshop brings together investigators in astrophysics,
gravitational wave data analysis and numerical relativity with the goal of
making gravitational wave burst observations become a genuine a tool of
astronomical discovery. Results from this meeting could have an impact on the
science from the enhanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory
data run set to begin in July 2009.
