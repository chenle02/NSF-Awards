The goal of this work is to explore, at the single molecule level, three
different types of DNA/protein interactions: 1) Binding interactions between
proteins and DNA with a particular emphasis on the role of one-dimensional
diffusion, 2) Generation of loops in DNA by protein complexes that bind at two
or more nonadjacent sites, 3) Protein interactions which disrupt base stacking
by pulling a base out of the stacking configuration with neighboring bases. Each
of these processes will be explored at both the level of population
distributions (relative populations of different geometries or conformations of
the DNA/protein complex at equilibrium) and in terms of dynamics (times required
for interconversion between conformations or geometries, again primarily at
equilibrium). Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is well suited for such
measurements. The primary emphasis will be placed on three DNA/Protein systems.
These are the interaction of intercalating dyes with DNA as a model system for
protein/DNA interaction and the study of various DNA binding domains with DNA
with an emphasis on searching for binding sites and protein/DNA interactions
which result in DNA looping. Some work will be performed on a final and
ambitious project, monitoring the action of DNA polymerase at the single
molecule level. This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Reha-Krantz at
the University of Alberta, who will provide some of the DNA templates and
constructs required for the experiments. The project will be closely connected
to an existing IGERT program at the university, and undergraduate students will
be heavily involved in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
jointly funded by the Physics and Chemistry Divisions in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
