The hormone ethylene regulates a number of processes in higher plants including
fruit ripening, tissue aging, shedding of fruits and leaves, wound responses,
and growth. This research is a continuation of previous efforts by this lab to
investigate the mechanisms by which the Arabidopsis ETR family of ethylene
receptors sense ethylene and trigger responses in the plant cells. Toward this
end several important new tools have been or are being developed, including: 1)
mutant plants that are deficient in each of the 5 receptor proteins; 2) a system
for producing receptor proteins in yeast cells for biochemical analysis; and 3)
a high resolution method for assessing rapid changes in seedling growth in
response to ethylene. Using these basic systems, the mechanisms by which
ethylene is perceived by the ETR receptors and how this binding is transmitted
through the receptor protein to downstream effector proteins is being
investigated. Effort is also being devoted to sorting out the specific roles
that the different isoforms of the receptor play in the transduction of the
ethylene signal.

This research will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which
ethylene works and allow us to develop new, less toxic ways to prevent crop
spoilage and control ripening processes.
