Proposal Number: ECS-9713297 Principal Investigator: Jorge Rocca Title: Basic
issues of the dynamics and radiation of capillary discharge plasmas In this
research, a combined theoretical and experimental program to elucidate the
fundamental aspects of the dynamics of capillary discharge plasmas will be
performed.. An increased understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the
remarkable uniformity of capillary discharge plasmas and their scaling laws
could potentially revolutionize the was in which hot dense plasmas are
generated. Capillary discharges can lead to breakthroughs in many important
areas including the development of table-top soft X-ray lasers, the development
of incoherent extreme ultraviolet source for nanolithography and the channeling
of high intensity laser pulses for compact accelerators and for the generation
of very strong magnetic fields.
