Sequential Monte Carlo methods provide a versatile and powerful tool for
solving complex statistical inference problems. The objective of this proposal
is to develop sequential Monte Carlo techniques in three important areas:
conditional inference on multiway tables, likelihood inference in population
genetics, and adaptive control of nonlinear stochastic systems. A common theme
in these applications is computational complexity. The investigator develops
efficient proposal distributions and resampling techniques to improve current
methods in these three applications. New theories arising from these
applications shed light on several fundamental issues related to the
implementation of sequential Monte Carlo methods, in particular, the
decomposition of a high dimensional problem into small components so that each
component is easy to handle and the sequential nature of the problem can be
utilized, and the choice of the proposal distribution so that it is easy to
sample and close enough to the true underlying distribution.

The investigator develops innovative sequential Monte Carlo techniques in three
important areas. The first area is conditional inference on multiway contingency
tables. Such tables arise very often from social and medical sciences, including
large survey data and grouped case-control data with several risk factors. The
second area is likelihood-based inference in population genetics, which is
motivated by the interest in inferring key biological characteristics of the
major pathogenic serotypes of Cryptococcus neoformans, an agent of serious
respiratory disease in humans. The third area is on-line identification and
adaptive control of nonlinear stochastic systems. The investigator improves the
current methods used in these three applications and develops a systematic
theory that provides insight into general strategies for applying sequential
Monte Carlo methods. New theories arising from these applications are of
interest across a broad range of areas in statistics, science and beyond. The
proposed research has significant impact on education through involvement of
Ph.D. students directly in the proposed research and incorporation of results
into undergraduate and graduate courses.
