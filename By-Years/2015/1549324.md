Title: Student Travel Support for 43rd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2016

This award supports student travel to the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL). The conference takes place in St.
Petersburg, Florida, USA, in January 2016. POPL is a forum for the discussion of
leading work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems.
The conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring
contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of
programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader
significance and importance includes supporting travel for women and
underrepresented minorities, thereby fostering a diverse pool of next generation
researchers in this important research area. In particular, students have the
opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel
techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.
