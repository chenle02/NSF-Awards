The PIs will build an array (or cage) of thermistors/thermoscouples for
measuring temperatures of hydrothermal vents over long periods of time. They
will use a modular design so that rebuilding and refurbishing of the
thermocouples may be done quickly. The Pis will test two such packages using
ALVIN in 1994 Summer Development of such a package is of great interest to the
hydrothermal subcommunity of RIDGE scientists.
