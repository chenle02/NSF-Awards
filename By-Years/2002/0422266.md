The objective of the project is to explore the feasibility of developing a
country's capability to survey higher qualified people, including recipients of
doctorate level degrees. The primary purpose of the research is to establish an
internationally coordinated survey of the careers of higher qualified people,
building on the existing work currently conducted. An important element of this
work is to measure the mobility of higher qualified people within a country but
especially across borders. The interest in cross-border movement underscores the
need for this survey to be internationally comparable.
