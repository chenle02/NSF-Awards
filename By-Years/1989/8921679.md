The program in Physical Computation and Complex Systems (PCCS) at the
California Institute of Technology will purchase a Titan III super-graphics
computer which will be dedicated to support research in computational science
and engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects
carried out under the PCCS research program including: portable parallel
software tools, visualization in neural network algorithms, cellular automata,
N-body simulation algorithms, and computationally intensive image and power
spectrum analysis techniques on concurrent computers.
