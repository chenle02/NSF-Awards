Professors Ornstein, Katznelson, and Adams will investigate a variety of
matters in ergodic theory. Problems in combinatorics and combinatorial number
theory will be attacked using ergodic methods. The stability under perturbation
of basic ergodic- theoretical properties of some specific classical dynamical
systems is another focus of effort. The investigators will also consider smooth
conjugacy of differentiable dynamical systems and its relevance to twist maps.
Other topics include Hausdorff dimensions of orbit closures, combinatorial
structures associated with equivalence relations, and the ergodic theory of
foliations. Ergodic theory is concerned with what happens in the long run when a
transformation of a space is iterated many times. (The space in question need
not be anything particularly elaborate; something like a line segment will do.)
Via the transformation, one can think of the group Z of integers acting on the
space, or of time passing in discrete steps. Continuous time, similarly, is
modeled by an action of the group R of real numbers, called a flow. This
situation is also of interest in ergodic theory. A good example is a geodesic
flow on a surface, where points on the surface are imagined as moving at
constant speed along paths of shortest distance. A principal goal of research in
ergodic theory is to classify the various sorts of long-run behavior that are
possible in a given situation. Typically, there will be not too many, and all of
them will be realizable within an appropriate standard model. Fitting ergodic-
theoretical phenomena into such models is part of the work of this project.
Ergodic theory has recently come to play an important role in the study of
complicated combinatorial structures. The principal investigators hope to
continue to make contributions in this area as well.
