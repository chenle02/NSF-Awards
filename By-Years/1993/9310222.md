9310222 Hochheimer This project employs unique high pressure and Brillouin light
scattering techniques to investigate lattice dynamics, elastic behavior and
phase transitions in materials exhibiting incommensurate phases. The materials
being investigated include selenates and halides and have been chosen as model
systems which should provide tests of recent theories of incommensurate phase
transitions. The research will provide a better understanding of the coupling of
acoustic phonons to excitations in the incommensurate phase, and will provide
additional information about the role of anharmonic lattice potentials in the
phase behavior. The research will provide fundamental information about solid
state phase transitions which are important in many practical materials such as
ferroelectric solids. %%% This is a fundamental study of the effect of pressure
on the arrangement of atoms in solids that can show an unusual long range
(larger that the crystal unit cell) modulation of the atomic positions in the
solids. The reasons for phase transitions and changes in the atomic positions of
the atoms in the materials under study are not well understood. They are
important and underlie phase behavior in other solids, such as ferroelectric
materials of technological importance. The changes in atomic positions will be
investigated with both x-ray and optical spectroscopy techniques. ***
