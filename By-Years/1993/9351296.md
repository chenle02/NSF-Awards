The development of an Undergraduate Aerospace Flight Systems Laboratory is
proposed. Except for a personal computer for input/output functions, this
laboratory will consist of a FRASCA International Undergraduate Flight
Simulation System. This laboratory will provide hands-on studies of subjects in
aircraft flight mechanics (performance, stability and control), simple stability
augmentation systems (e.g., yaw damper), the dynamics of a complex aerospace
system, and control systems. Because of the wide range of courses to which this
facility is applicable, it will be integrated into the full ME undergraduate
curriculum; from the first- or second- year course to the senior capstone design
course. One of the most unique and intriguing uses of the facility will be the
investigation of the flying qualities of project aircraft designed in the AAE
senior design course.It should be noted that this simulator is very different
from simulators used for pilot training. It is focused on being able to simulate
a wide range of aircraft for the purpose of generating and collecting
engineering "flight-test" data. With this capability, it becomes an engineering
tool rather than a training facility. To assure that the facility is used so
that maximum educational benefits are achieved, a Simulator Advisory Committee
has been formed (with its members from the flight simulation profession) to
participate in the development of the educational program.
