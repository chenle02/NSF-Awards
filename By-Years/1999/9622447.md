9622876 Goodearl This award supports the research of Professor K. Goodearl to
work in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising
from the theory of Quantum Groups. In particular, Professor Goodearl will
continue to investigate analogies between Quantum Groups and enveloping algebras
of solvable Lie algebras concentrating on the non-root-of-unity case. This is
research in the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra
can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has
direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of non-
commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in Quantum Mechanics and
this proposal continues to explore areas that connect directly with modern
quantum field theory. ??
