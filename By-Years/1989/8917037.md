Drs. Pitter and Finnegan will investigate the effects of included inorganic,
ionizable salts on the morphology of ice crystals growing in a supercooled
liquid water cloud. The hypothesis to be tested is that the freezing potential,
previously studied for bulk freezing of aqueous solutions, is applicable to
vapor growth of ice crystals, and that the electrostatic forces that result from
the freezing potential interact with the ice surface tension to determine how
the ice crystals grow. The ice crystals are nucleated in a cloud chamber and
grow in free-fall, collecting inorganic salt chemicals by the same mechanisms
that are operable in atmospheric clouds. The work is also of potential
importance to crystal growth science in general. Since ice crystal morphological
detail is an intrinsic and important factor in ice crystal growth rate and hence
the time for crystal development prior to the onset of aggregation and/or
riming, this research has significance in the understanding of the formation of
precipitation in clouds with a mixture of ice and water.
