This Workshop on Strings is a follow-on to last year's Maryland workshop on
this subject. The focus here is on the topic of superstrings. Several questions
require clarification. These include apparently finite theories of quantum
gravity, whose consistency requires that the force of gravity be unified with
other forces. There is also still lacking a "geometrical" principle for strings.
A perturbative understanding of strings does not suffice for questions of
compactification and instanton-like effects. The workshop brings together
physicists and mathematicians concerned with these questions, it also provides
an opportunity for young physicists to become familiar with string theory, which
is an extremely technically demanding field.
