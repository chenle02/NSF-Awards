This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a REU
site at the University of South Florida. The site will recruit undergraduates
from across the nation to participate in research topics related to ubiquitous
sensing, which includes current topics such as fixed and mobile sensing
networks, location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric
sensing applications. Ubiquitous sensing is an area of current interest that is
well-suited to undergraduate research productivity. The students will interact
with faculty mentors and their research groups to solve large community problems
in areas such as health care, transportation systems, and biometrics, in a
simple, fast, and cost-effective manner. This site should help develop a group
of computing professionals who can develop the systems of the future that impact
society and enhance our quality of life. The REU experience provides students
with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in
areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our
citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed REU site offers state-of-the art
facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of
problems related to ubiquitous sensing. Students will learn how to use current
tools and techniques to solve those problems that have direct impact on people.
The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from
groups traditionally under-represented in computer science including Hispanic
students from a group of institutions in Puerto Rico and Florida as well as
African-American students from their partner institutions. The students will
participate in research and professional development activities all designed to
achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer
science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-
represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into
graduate programs.
