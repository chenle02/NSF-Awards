This project focuses on generalized linear dynamical systems over commutative
rings. A realization theory of neutral systems (systems where delays appear in
the derivative of the state as well as in the state and/or input-output) is
being developed in the context of generalized systems over rings. The concept of
an 'absolutely irreducible' realization has been introduced. This concept
guarantees that an absolutely irreducible realization of a generic bounded-
input-bounded-output stable transfer function is internally stable. In addition,
a constructive procedure has been given for computing such realizations.
