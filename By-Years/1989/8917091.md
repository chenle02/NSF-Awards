The objective of this research is to investigate lateral heterogeneity in the
Earth's mantle and is a continuation of work begun three years ago. In
combination with previous results, the research will produce a three-dimensional
map of shear velocity heterogeneity over length scales of about 500 km beneath
North and South America, the East Pacific, the North Atlantic, North Africa and
the Asian continent. The approach is to collect all available tangential
component seismic recordings with sources and receivers in the study area. These
records will be modeled using synthetic seismograms to determine the ray paths
and travel times corresponding to observed arrivals. Tomographic techniques then
produce the three-dimensional shear wave map. This work has important
application to mantle models of convection and resulting stresses in the
lithosphere. It is therefore important to the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
