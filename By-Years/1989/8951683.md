The effective training of undergraduates demands hands-on access to modern
chromatography equipment. Exposure to both liquid and gas chromatography
techniques as well as stop flow sampling form the basis of this project.
Students in physical chemistry, analytical chemistry and biochemistry will
benefit from the instrumentation. This Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green University to acquire chromatographic
equipment that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
