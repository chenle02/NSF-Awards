This grant research involves the application of a variety of statistical
analysis tools and dynamical insight to investigate climate variability on time
scales ranging from weeks to decades. The analysis will be primarily based on
observational data, including model assimilated datasets such as the NCEP and
ECMWF Reanalyses. Of particular interest are the principal patterns or 'modes'
of variability that account for disproportionately large fractions of the
variance of the pressure field, the forced pattern in the year-to-year
variability observed in association with the ENSO cycle, and fluctuations in the
zonally symmetric (or annular) component of the atmospheric general circulation.
The major goals of the research are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) to formulate a more concise
and dynamically based classification of these leading modes of
variability;&lt;br/&gt;(2) to better understand the nonlinear interactions by
which the circulation anomalies associated with one mode influence the structure
of other modes;&lt;br/&gt;(3) to document the widespread impacts of these modes
upon surface weather, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, aerosols, ocean
color, and land vegetation; &lt;br/&gt;(4) to elucidate their role in producing
the pronounced high latitude warming and other climatic trends that have been
observed during the past few decades;&lt;br/&gt;(5) more generally, to determine
whether the climate trends of the past few decades are large enough to account
for the large environmental changes that have been observed over Alaska and
other polar and sub-polar regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
directly support the training of graduate students and indirectly contribute to
the mentoring of postdoctoral research associates. Project deliverables include
an on-line atlas of basic general circulation statistics and a monograph on the
atmospheric general circulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important
because of its educational impacts and also because it provides scientific
information relevant to weather and climate prediction.
