This is a proposal for a multi-faceted STS study by an interdisciplinary
research team to explore the conservation mission of zoos and aquariums focusing
on the evolution of the shifting responsibilities of these institutions to
animals and to conservation. The team will engage in an ambitious and integrated
program of research, conferences, public events, and the development of teaching
materials focused on the complex, contested, and changing roles of zoos and
aquaria in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dual emphasis on engaging
the scientific/professional community and the general public, which not only
enables the integration of diverse viewpoints, but also serves as a mechanism
for increasing public awareness of the goals, tactics, and challenges of zoo
conservation. With regards to the public component, the researchers plan to have
a broad impact in two distinct ways; the events will take place in different
geographic regions (Arizona, New York), and there will be a virtual public
exhibit that will be accessible worldwide.
