The interaction of various geometric objects in an environment has generally
been of interest to design and manufacturing engineers. These interactions can
take a variety of forms. The form of object interaction of interest for the
proposed research is that of dynamic collision or impact. The stimulus for such
research is automated assembly and manufacturing. With an increased focus on
transforming manufacturing and assembly tasks into automated or semi-automated
tasks, additional facilities are necessitated to aid in task simulations. While
tools exist for some types of simulations, they are deficient for the simulation
of impacts. Mainly such deficiencies are in the area of the kinematic simulation
algorithms. It is the rectification and extension of such kinematic algorithms
that is the nucleus of the proposed research. The simulation of impacts will be
accomplished in a four phases: implementation of a dynamic collision detection
processor; integration of solid modeling data into a kinematics program;
integration of the dynamic collision detection process into a kinematics
program; and development of techniques to guide the kinematics procedures
through the impact.
