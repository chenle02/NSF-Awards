The principal investigator intends to combine probabilistic and analytic
methods, related to the theory of partial differential equations, to study
several stochastic control problems, which arise from portfolio management
models with /or without transaction fees. These include investment-consumption
models, trading and forecasting models, recursive utility function models et
cetera. Such problems have already attracted considerable attention by both
financial economists and mathematicians. The principal investigator plans to
spend extensive periods of time visiting several institutions to interact with
economists and mathematicians. She also plans to attend several meetings related
to her work.
