This project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is a
continuation of studies on the design and development of fundamentally new
reactions and reagents for organic synthesis. The project will investigate the
synthesis and use of 2- arenesulfonoxy carbonyl compounds as synthetic
intermediates for the selective and controlled preparation of a variety of
carbonyl derivatives. This effort is based on the observation that these
materials are distinctly different in their reactivity than functionally similar
2-halo carbonyl compounds. Four specific objectives of the project are: (1) to
prepare 2-arenesulfonoxy derivatives of esters and amides, (2) to utilize the
acidity of the 2-position to elaborate simple 2-arenesulfonoxy carbonyls into
more complex ones, (3) to examine the alpha-substitution of these compounds as a
facile route to substituted carbonyl compounds, and (4) to the apply methods of
synthesis of 2- arenesulfonoxy carbonyl compounds as a new method for the
generation and trapping of oxonium and iminium ions.
