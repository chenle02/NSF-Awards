The two main areas of plasma chemistry are low pressure (cold) and high
pressure (thermal) plasma chemistry. The application of cold plasma chemistry
technologies was responsible for the recent revolution in micro-electronics. The
use of thermal plasmas offers the possibility to develop new materials with
unique properties or to process existing materials in a better and/or more
efficient manner. A large number of opportunities exist for the possible
development of thermal plasma technologies on an industrial scale. Recent
examples are diamond thin films and high temperature super-conductors. Major
research efforts are underway in many countries, including the United States,
Canada, Japan, Europe, and the U.S.S.R. The Tenth Gordon Conference on Plasma
Chemistry in Tilton, New Hampshire (August 15-19, 1988), will bring together
about 135 of the world's leading scientists in the area of plasma chemistry to
discuss recent progress in this area. These meetings are of major importance for
continued progress in the understanding of the fundamental concepts as well as
the possible future applications of plasma chemistry. This meeting will have
attendees from universities, industry, and government to accelerate the
technology transitions of plasma chemistry.
