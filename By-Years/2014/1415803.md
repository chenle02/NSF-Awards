The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that the deposition techniques used to
deposit the lattice matching materials are scalable in wafer area to 200mm and
300mm wafer processing and are already found in today's CMOS foundries. Both
factors, using large area deposition process and leveraging fully depreciated
CMOS fabs, lead to significant reduction in overall packaged device cost. In
this fashion, these lattice matching materials on Si will result in a new
industry standard wafer from a US company supplying globally 200mm and 300mm
wafers to light emitting diode and power semiconductor industries.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on
converting the surface of large area silicon wafers into a bulk-like quality
Gallium Nitride (GaN). The wafer technology will be used by light emitting diode
and power semiconductor manufacturers to grow the brightest and most efficient
GaN based devices. The novel technology under this Phase I project is based on
depositing a patent pending purely metallic alloy that both grades the lattice
constant from Si to GaN and counter balances residual thermal mismatch to
maintain a flat wafer. By removing both thermal and lattice mismatch, growth of
low defect density GaN is promoted on large area wafers leading to bulk GaN
quality material efficiencies.
