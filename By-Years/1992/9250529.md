This proposal requests matching funds for the purchase of NeXT computers and
software to establish a Mathematica-Based Calculus laboratory for use beginning
Fall 1992. The successful completion of this project will provide the following
to other institutions: (1) A model for full implementation of a Calculus
laboratory program. (2) A successful model for intradepartmental "bootstrap"
dissemination of Calculus Reform. (3) A collection of laboratory modules that
can be used with any Calculus textbook, and in any Mathematica-Based Calculus
laboratory. (4) Improvements to Mathemtica for use in Calculus laboratories,
including increased flexibility of syntax and a much improved plotting command.
