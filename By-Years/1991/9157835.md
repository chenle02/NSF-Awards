The objective is to develop theoretical and practical tools and techniques for
transforming geometric control theory into practical nonlinear control design
methodology. Currently, most nonlinear control techniques require some type of
regularity conditions such as complete integrability of a set of system vector
fields. Unfortunately, many important systems fail to satisfy these conditions.
The proposed approach is to find an approximate model for the given system that
satisfies the desired conditions. Other areas of emphasis include research in
nonlinear system modeling, robustness and performance, and the construction of
illustrative examples.
