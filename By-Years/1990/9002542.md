The primary purpose of this U.S.-Czechoslavak workshop is to bring leading
polymer researchers together from both countries to examine fundamental topics
pertaining to biomaterials. Specifically, discussions will feature several
important polymer systems and include topics relating to synthetic methods,
structural and morphological analysis (surface and bulk), and property
measurement methods and results. The intended multidisciplinary interaction
should stimulate follow-on basic research projects on polymeric materials with
long-term potential for use in areas such as hydrogels and biodegradable
polymers. This cooperative workshop in polymers research fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
