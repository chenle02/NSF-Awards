Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a technique used by
chemists to study the properties of molecules having an electronic configuration
containing unpaired electrons. In this manner, the structures of a wide variety
of interesting intermediates can be understood. In the Department of Chemistry
at Dartmouth College, research will be enhanced by the acquisition of a state-
of-the-art EPR spectrometer and the types of systems that will be studied
include: 1) EPR-detectable oxidation states of Ni enzymes 2) Paramagnetic
organotitanium complexes involved in catalytic and synthetic chemistry 3)
Paramagnetic species generated upon reduction of Cr (VI) by thiols and enzymes
4) Radical anions derived from negatively-substituted annulenes and related
compounds
