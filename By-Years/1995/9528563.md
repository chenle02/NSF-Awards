95-28563 Saar, Steven Dr. Saar plans to address the analysis and interpretation
of stellar magnetic observations through three parallel efforts. The first is a
detailed analysis of existing data from over 200 GKM dwarf stars, determining
the magnetic field strengths and filling factors (or upper limits). The second
is to make new infrared observations of field strengths and filling factors for
M dwarf and active subgiant stars. The third is to study flux tube emergence in
a variety of stellar atmospheres and compare the solutions with the surface
distribution and magnitude of magnetic fields found in the first two parts of
this project. ***
