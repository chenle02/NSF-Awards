This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
synthesis of new electrocatalysts from metallomacrocycles by the catalyzed
pyrolysis of the complexes in mesoporous materials. It is anticipated that the
approach will give rise to novel nanoparticulate carbon supported metals, which
will be initially implemented in the advanced anode electrocatalysis of direct
methanol oxidation fuel cells (DMFC) and in cathode electrochemistry as oxygen
reduction catalysts. Thermal decomposition of these compounds is expected to
result in atomic or small cluster metal active sites supported by and bound to
nitrogeneous nanotube materials. Work proposed will consist of synthesizing the
subject electrocatalysts followed by their electrochemical performance
evaluation under representative proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell
conditions for oxygen electroreduction and direct methanol oxidation.

Potential customers for these technology include automotive companies. In
additon, application to stationary power sources is also possible. Consequently,
electric power utilities would find interest in the proposed technology as well
as power for commercial and industrial installations.
