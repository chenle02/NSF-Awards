The University of Rhode Island has operated the R/V ENDEAVOR as a general
purpose oceanographic research vessel since 1976. During this time the vessel
has operated as an effective platform for a wide variety of NSF-sponsored
research projects. In 1993 the ENDEAVOR will not operate. The ship will undergo
a mid-life refit during his time. It is estimated that the refit itself will
take about 6 months in a shipyard. The remainder of the year, before and after
the shipyard period, will be used to maintain and upgrade the ship and science
systems on the vessel. Documentation of system and computerized maintenance
planning will be important aspects of the mid-life. The overhaul, upgrade and
mid-life planned for the vessel will result in a more capable, cost effective
and efficient ship for supporting the oceanographic research needs of the
National Science Foundation for the remainder of the ENDEAVOR's operating life.
