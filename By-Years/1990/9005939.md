This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support four research projects in the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of New Mexico. The names of the
investigators and the titles of their projects follow: Edward Bedrick, Outlier
Tests for Logistic Regression, A Conditional Approach; Ronald Christensen,
Influence Diagnostics in Linear Models for Spatial Data; Wolfgang Bein and
Pramod Pathak, Integration of Surveys; and William Zimmer, An Essentially Non-
parametric Bayes Empirical Bayes Procedure.
