Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-TH) is a neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system of a variety of species of animals from the simplest organism to
the complex human central nervous system. Serotonin is thought to function in
normal regulation of a variety of behaviors, including, mood, sleep, temperature
and appetite regulation and sexual function. When serotonergic transmission is
impaired or altered, a variety of mental disorders is believed to result. These
disorders include affective illness, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, eating and
sleep disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Clearly, the
roles serotonin plays in the normal and abnormal functioning of the human brain
and how pharmacological agents may be used to regulate it are of major
importance for a better understanding of nervous system function. Recently, a
number of new pharmacological agents have become available which are selective
for various aspects of serotonergic transmission, including the serotonin uptake
system and several subtypes of serotonin receptors. It is important that
clinicians and basic scientists meet in order to evaluate how these new agents
may be used, both as pharmacological tools in research and as treatment of
mental illness in clinics.
