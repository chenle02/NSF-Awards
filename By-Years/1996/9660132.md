*** 9660132 Bayless This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses the critical need for long-life neutron generators for use in
nondestructive evaluation and in situ testing. A new type of solid-target,
sealed neutron generator, the Distributed Neutron Generator (DNG), is the focus
of this research. It will be designed to meet requirements for high neutron
output (up to 103 n/s at 14 MeV), low power consumption (<1 kW), small size, low
cost, and long lifetime (>3,000 hours), and can be operated dc or pulsed. No
existing neutron generator offers this combination of desirable characteristics.
The overall objective of the project (Phases I and II) is to demonstrate the
feasibility of the DNG concept. The objectives of Phase I are to: (1) construct
a proof-of-principle generator for operation at 125 kV; (2) to experimentally
demonstrate that a uniform, high energy ion beam can be generated; and (3) to
develop the conceptual design for a Phase II laboratory prototype DNG system. A
large company, which is interested in future commercialization of DNG
technology, will participate in Phase I. If successful, the project will develop
a new type of neutron generator with highly advanced capabilities. Discussions
with potential users indicate that the market for this generator will be large.
Its applications include: (1) ore analysis; (2) airport luggage inspection; (3)
detection of landmines, explosives, chemical warfare agents and small quantities
of nuclear material; (4) industrial process control; and (5) instruments for
treaty verification. ***
