9400523 Monbouquette This project is to develop enzyme-based sensors through the
approach of immobilizing the enzyme on an electrode surface. The objectives of
the research are: (1) to engineer a membrane mimetic surface on gold electrodes
for optimal electroenzymatic activity; and (2) to extend this technology to
commercially available membrane-bound dehydrogenases of industrial importance.
This could lead to the development of sensors for creatinine and fructose. ***
