This grant is a renewal of Professor Crooks' fundamental investigation of
molecular recognition phenomena observed in organized chemical systems. The
project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will involve
experimental and theoretical studies of thin films of organosulfur compounds
chemisorbed on gold surfaces, i. e., so-called self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).
The investigations will center on the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding
interactions between probe molecules and the adsorbed monolayers. The goal of
the research is to develop molecular recognition strategies which can be used
for chemical sensors. %%% Professor Crooks and his colleagues will investigate
the chemistry of self-assembled monolayers of organosulfur compounds adsorbed on
gold surfaces. The research results will be used for the development of new
chemical sensors based on molecular recognition phenomena, new electronic
materials and innovative lithographic techniques.
