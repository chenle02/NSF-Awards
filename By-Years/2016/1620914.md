This project proposes an assessment study that focuses on improving existing
measures of teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT). The research
team will update existing measures, adding new items and aligning the instrument
to new standards in school mathematics. In addition, the team will update the
delivery system for the assessment to Qualtrics, a more flexible online
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will build an updated measure of
teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT). Project researchers will
conduct item writing camps, develop new items, cognitively pilot and revise
items, and factor analyze items. The researchers will also determine item
constructs and calibrate items (and constructs) through an innovative
application of Item Response Theory (IRT) employing a variant of the standard
2-parameter IRT model. Finally, the team will oversee the transition of the
Teacher Knowledge Assessment System to the Qualtrics data collection environment
to allow for more flexible item specification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on
fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development
efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed
projects.
