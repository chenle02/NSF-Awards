This project is to continue and to extend a successful research effort leading
to the development of a PC version of the computer program COMBAT, a powerful
FORTRAN program for seismic dynamic response analysis of buildings. The
following additional capabilities will be introduced: (1) K-bracings and tilted
columns and floor diagrams, (2) "tool-box of structural elements/components, (3)
animation graphics capabilities, (4) accurate wall elements, (5) flat shell
element to represent floor systems, (6) modification of the time-matching
mechanism for handling nonlinearities, and (7) material and geometric
nonlinearities. This project involves a collaboration with the Chinese Building
Academy as part of the US-PRC protocol program. The study will transform the
program COMBAT into a full- flegged computer aid design (CAD) environment on
PC's.
