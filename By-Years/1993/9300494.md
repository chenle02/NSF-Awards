9300494 Bertsekas Many operations in design, production planning, and resource
management encounter optimization problems, that is, mathematical problems of
choosing optimally several factors that affect a productivity index. These are
problems of considerable computational difficulty that have been extensively
investigated in the last three decades. This research will focus on several such
problems that arise often in practice and have a large scale structure, such as
a network or a dynamic system structure. Methodological improvements for the
solution of these problems will have significant practical impact. The research
will aim at the understanding of the performance of existing network
optimization, linear programming, and nonlinear programming algorithms, and will
develop algorithms with improved performance for both a serial and a parallel
computing environment.
