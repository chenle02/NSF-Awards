In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Francis D'Souza of the University of North
Texas, Denton will conduct multidisciplinary research on light energy harvesting
supramolecular assemblies of carbon nanostructures. This research is focused on
three main topics: (1) construction and study of broad band capturing, charge
stabilizing 'antenna-reaction center' models, (2) band gap dependent
photoinduced charge stabilization in donor-acceptor hybrids comprised of
diameter sorted carbon nanotubes, and (3) development of supramolecular donor-
acceptor nanohybrids of graphene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
involve training undergraduate and graduate students, disseminating research
results through publications and presentations at national conferences, and
enhancing research infrastructure through establishing national and
international collaborations. The project will advance our fundamental knowledge
on utilization of all-carbon based nanomaterials such as fullerene, nanotubes
and graphene for photochemical applications and could have significant impacts
in the fields of supramolecular chemistry, nanomaterials, nanotechnology and
solar energy harvesting devices.
