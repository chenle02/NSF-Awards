The research objective of this award is to develop an optimization-based design
methodology that accounts for the dynamic nature of complex systems. The
methodology will have a modeling capability to conceptually integrate object
decomposition (by physical subsystems) with aspect decomposition (by
disciplines) into a network of nodes at which local optimizations are performed
subject to the performance targets from the other nodes. The overall network
optimization will be coordinated to accomplish a desired compromise between the
performance of the design and the performance of the subsystems and disciplines.
The dual-decomposition approach will make the methodology comprehensive and
responsive to changing design conditions while an agent-based implementation
will guarantee computational flexibility. The methodology will incorporate human
decision-making in the process and will be the basis for a tool implemented on a
layout design problem.

If successful, designers will be able to make decisions for complex systems
(such as vehicles or airplanes), while accounting for failures and opportunities
resulting from the consideration of the entire spectrum of changing conditions.
The outcomes of this research will be disseminated through various channels
including graduate student training in engineering and mathematical sciences,
interdisciplinary seminars, professional meetings, publications, open source
software, and Internet websites. The methodology will be presented to the Army
(TACOM), other federal institutions (Air Force, DOE, NASA, Navy), and original
equipment manufacturer companies (BMW, Ford, GM, Boeing). Graduate students will
be involved in parts of the proposed research while results of this work will be
included in graduate-level courses. The proposed work will provide opportunities
to train students who can enter the workforce with advanced mathematical skills
and an understanding of how to apply these to complex engineering problems.
Special efforts will be undertaken to reach out to students from local-area
schools that have a significant proportion of underrepresented populations.
