Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has
been instrumental in serving as a catalyst to improve the education of under-
represented groups, particularly in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM). As an agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective
strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers
that impede underrepresented groups from receiving a high quality education.
This project supports internship placements for students at the National Science
Foundation as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy;
develop the potential of future STEM leaders; promote STEM participation,
including students from low-income communities; and encourage advanced studies
in STEM disciplines. This human capacity building endeavor will help train a
diverse, engaged, and globally competitive STEM workforce prepared to meet
future challenges through discovery and innovation.
