9705750 Granato Measurements of the shear modulus near the glass temperature are
made to determine the temperature dependence of the shear modulus and the
viscosity in the glassy and supercooled liquid state of bulk amorphous
materials. Interstitial concentrations derived from these measurements are used
to predict changes in low temperature properties with the help of the
interstitialcy theory of simple liquids and glasses. A favorable comparison of
predictions with measurements of the Boson peak heights should lead to
unification of the two large areas of research on glasses at low temperatures
and near the glass temperature. Also, this should establish the Interstitialcy
Theory as a basis for the understanding of the properties of glasses and
supercooled liquids, providing a scientific foundation not otherwise existing
for the growing technologies based on amorphous materials. %%% Knowledge
obtained from this research is important to the understanding of material
properties in superconductors, amorphous materials and glasses. ***
