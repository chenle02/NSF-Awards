American boys and girls; (d) a regional science summer camp for 9th-12th grade
American Indians; (e) a mentoring activity between American Indian college
students and high school students; (f) a college visiting scientist program to
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation; (g) science learning kits for use in
reservation schools. Measurable Objectives to determine project effectiveness
include: o Attitudes toward science (pre- and post-tests). o Interest survey of
parents, teachers, students. o Data on course selection of participants compared
to non-participants. o Subject-matter knowledge of participants (pre- and post-
tests); comparison with non-participants. o Follow-up interviews with school
