This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support travel to Brazil for
Rainer Bleck of the University of Miami, along with a graduate student, in
collaboration with Edmo Campos of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
project aims to study, in a numerical framework, dynamic and thermodynamic
processes governing oceanic circulation in the tropical Atlantic. The model to
be used is the thermodynamically active version of the Isopycnic Coordinate
model developed at Miami by Bleck and others. The model's main advantage in this
context will be to eliminate inadvertent, numerically induced vertical heat
diffusion. The researchers also plan to conduct a comprehensive study of the
oceanic response to atmospheric thermodynamic forcing. They will also focus on
the main interannual and decadal variability signal, commonly called the
"Atlantic SST dipole." The U.S. side will benefit from access to equatorial
phenomena of water mass exchanges, which will add significantly to the U.S.
models of circulation in the North Atlantic. The Brazilian side will gain an
enhanced capability in ocean modeling, which will position the country to
contribute to future research on global climate change.
