The 45th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be held at
the University of Texas at Tyler from Thursday March 17 through Saturday March
19, 2011. The conference will offer special sessions in Continuum Theory,
Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Set-theoretic
Topology, as well as six plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks covering the
breadth of the special sessions. The conference is organized by the special
session organizing committees, the conference steering committee, and the
principal investigator on the grant. The grant provides funds to support travel
for graduate students and young researchers, in addition to the invited
speakers. The series of conferences is one of the longest running in
mathematics. In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona
State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and
continuum theory. In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and
scope. It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-
theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of
dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology. Over the
years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by
women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while
expanding to cover a broader section of topology. Many of the most famous
results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference.
