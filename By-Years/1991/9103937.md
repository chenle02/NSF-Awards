This project will focus on problems of multiple instance combinatorial
optimization, particularly two types of multiple instance network flow and cut
problems, and combinatorial problems that are solved by such multiple instance
computations. Many non-trivial combinatorial problems are solved by solving a
sequence of network flow or minimum cut problems, where each successive problem
instance differs from its predecessor in a highly structured way. The similarity
of the problem instances allows the sequence to be solved much more efficiently
than by solving each instance independently. This project will concentrate on
multiple instance network flow and minimum cut problems that are generated
either by changing the choice of source and sink nodes, or by systematically
changing edge capacities. An important approach to these problems is to
understand the structure of the set of solutions to the space of all problem
instances that might be encountered in the sequence, and to use this structural
understanding to efficiently represent, in some compact implicit form, the set
of solutions to all potential instances. Then once a particular instance is
specified, it can be expanded and retrieved from the representation faster than
by solving the instance from scratch. Hence a large part of the project is
directed towards developing such structural understanding and compact
representations.
