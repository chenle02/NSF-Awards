This research studies the theory and implementation of knowledge representation
and reasoning on a massively parallel "connectionist" computer system. The focus
is on specific tasks: inheritance of properties by objects in a subclass from
properties of the superclass, pattern recognition, and pattern completion. The
goal is to employ the advantages of massively parallel systems - tolerating
noise and ambiguity and operating rapidly, e.g. for real-time applications. The
importance of this research is that massively parallel systems - employing tens
of thousands of computing elements - may provide significant new computing power
to artificial intelligence and other applications. However, detailed theory and
practical design methods for these systems must first be developed.
