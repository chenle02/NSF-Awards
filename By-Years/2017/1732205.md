This travel grant provides supports for 15 US-based students to attend the 29th
Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) to be held in Heidelberg,
Germany, on July 24-28th 2017. CAV, one of the premier conference in formal
verification, is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of
computer-aided formal analysis and synthesis methods for hardware and software
systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete
applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the
algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. Conferences
like CAV are a near-unique opportunity for graduate students to attend technical
presentations, interact with the leading researchers in the field, and receive
valuable feedback on their research.
