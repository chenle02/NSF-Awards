This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I study is aimed toward
development of an efficient procedure for predicting growth of ternary III-V
semiconductor materials grown by Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE).
These techniques are now used extensively in the semiconductor industry to model
growth of materials on substrates by chemical vapor deposition. The success of
such modeling depends largely on the complexity of the gas phase and surface
reaction mechanisms used to predict the growth process. While multi-step finite-
rate reaction mechanisms involving approximately ten to twenty species are
adequate for modeling growth of binary alloys, accurate modeling of ternary
alloy growth necessitates many more reactions and species. This renders the
calculations for such scenarios extremely expensive and prohibitive.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology can improve a wide variety of electronic
and opto-electronic are devices. Optimization and characterization of their
growth is crucial to the success of the opto-electronic and semiconductor
industry. While commercial these codes have been used with great success for
modeling growth of pure and binary semiconductor materials, their success has
been limited (if not non-existent) for ternary materials due to the lack of
knowledge of the chemistry and the extreme computational efforts required o
perform such calculations.
