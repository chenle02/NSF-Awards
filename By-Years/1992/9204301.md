Ball will study geometric properties of metric spaces, in particular the Lp-
spaces, which describe the rate at which random walks in these spaces can
wander. He has shown that these properties are intimately connected with
questions about factoring and extending Lipschitz maps. The aim is to develop a
non-linear theory which parallels the powerful theory of type and cotype in
linear spaces. Such a theory can be expected to have numerous applications to
the analysis of the various types of metric spaces which arise in all areas of
mathematics. Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that attempts to
generalize to infinitely many dimensions the structure of 3-dimensional
Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the distance function in a Banach
space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the
"parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result, the "geometry"
of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the research in this area
concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
