This project focuses on nationwide improvement of student learning in
undergraduate biochemistry courses through design, implementation and evaluation
of classroom activities and materials which target threshold concepts, by a
group of over 50 faculty experts from diverse backgrounds. Threshold concepts
are concepts that, when mastered, represent a transformed and integrative
understanding of a discipline, without which the learner cannot progress. The
project goals follow a cycle that uses assessment data and community input in a
feedback loop to improve student learning. Materials will be disseminated
through a project web site and at regional and national conferences.
