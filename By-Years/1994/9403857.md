9403857 Rosenberg The scope of research entails the study of heat flow
techniques relative to Laplace type operators on Riemannian manifolds. Some
elements of stochastic differential geometry and brownian motion will also be
pursued along with the geometry of the zeta function. Part of the scope involves
projects with undergraduates. The research has potential applications to
stochastic processes and mathematical physics. ***
