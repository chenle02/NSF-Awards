This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the camp
facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of Greenland as part of
the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order to investigate how atmospheric
trace elements are deposited on the ice and what kind of changes they undergo as
they are being incorporated into the ice. An understanding of such processes is
necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data that can be
recovered from ice cores. While significant progress has been made recently in
extracting and analyzing ice cores, progress in understanding the air to snow
transfer process for reactive chemical species has lagged behind. The goal of
this project is to provide a detailed understanding of the atmospheric transport
processes that influence the precipitation chemistry over the Greenland ice
sheet. The examination of variations in air-snow-ice chemistry measurements
during the time for which reliable global meteorological archives are available
will allow the extrapolation of the ice core chemistry-atmospheric transport
link backward in time to periods for which meteorological information does not
exist. Knowledge of long-range atmospheric transport is basic to the air- snow
transfer process. The recovered ice cores contain impurities and components
whose sources are distant, and which were carried by the atmospheric circulation
to the interior of Greenland. Variations in the physical and chemical
composition of the ice along the core reflects to a large extent variations in
atmospheric circulation patterns. As part of this project a long-term
atmospheric trajectory climatology will be prepared as well as an examination of
the seasonal and interannual variability of observed transport patterns.
