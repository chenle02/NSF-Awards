*** 9760987 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the
construction of a low voltage SEM which uses a magnetic dipole lens as the
objective lens. The theoretical performance of this design is far superior to
any lens in current use. The lens consists of a permanently magnetized sphere.
New materials are now available which make it feasible to use spheres of only a
few mm in diameter and yet achieve a resolution superior to anything
commercially available. Using this concept, we are in a position to fabricate
SEMs which are lower in cost and higher in performance than any other
instruments. The completed microscope will be used at research and development
facilities for the imaging of biological specimens at high resolution. The
microscope will also be extremely valuable for semiconductor chip inspection.
