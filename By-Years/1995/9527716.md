9527716 MICHOD This project studies the transition in evolution from cells to
organisms for the purpose of understanding the emergence of organisms as a new
unit of selection. The issues considered are applicable to all major transitions
in evolution, such as from individual genes to gene networks, from gene networks
to bacteria-like cells, from bacteria-like cells to eukaryotic cells with
organelles, from cells to multicellular organisms, and from solitary organisms
to societies. All transitions in the units of selection share two common themes:
(i) the emergence of cooperation among the lower level units in the functioning
of the new higher level unit, and (ii) regulation of conflict among the lower
level units. These issues are represented in explicit genetical models of
mutation and selection within and between organisms for the purpose of
understanding certain general, but by no means universal, features of organisms:
the presence of a sequestered germ line, maternal control of cell fate during
early development, and the passage of the reproductive cycle through a single
cell state-the zygote. The research is applicable to the conflict among cells
that arises within organisms in the development of cancers.
