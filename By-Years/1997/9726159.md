The PI continues his study of Polar Summer Mesospheric Echoes with a new twist:
exploring the aeronomy. Using data acquired by the MST radar at the Early Polar
Cap Observatory, a post-doc: (1) looks for interrelationships between spectral
widths and signal-to-noise, and the phase of any present oscillations, (2)
compares the scattering properties with the meteor diffusion times to locate a
Schmidt Number effect in the latter (if it exists), and (3) uses the wave
dispersion relationship to discover the high frequency limit to which meteor
temperatures can be pushed by comparing them to wind perturbations measured with
the radar. Further, the PI remains committed to exploring Canadian
instrumentation's data as a marker for global change (as manifested in the
mesosphere).
