To obtain useful predictions beyond a few days requires that both cloudiness
and radiation processes be accurately represented in a numerical weather
prediction model. Since it is not possible to represent all physical processes
on all scales explicitly, it is necessary to use physically based sub-grid scale
parameterizations. The goal of this project is to evaluate the current cloud
generation and radiation schemes used in the National Meteorological Center
(NMC)'s operational global model and to evaluate the sensitivity of forecasts to
those schemes. Based on the analyses, the PI will suggest improvements to the
schemes. The results of this study should be relevant for climate as well as
weather models. This project is part of a joint program in numerical weather
prediction sponsored by NSF and NOAA's NMC. The principal investigator and his
colleagues will work closely with NMC staff during the research.
