Due to the pervasiveness of the Internet and wireless networking, mobile devices
are increasingly being interconnected through the system described as the
Internet-of-Things (IoT). Coupled with advancements in integrated sensor
technologies, IoT has generated a new wave of opportunities for cooperation and
collaboration between devices, machines and humans to create smart systems.
Motivated by the wide array of opportunities in the IoT space, this Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will target developing smart and
autonomous IoT systems. The REU site exposes students to emerging areas of
computer science and engineering and provides them with the opportunities for
hands-on research training and experience in emerging smart technologies. This
research experience, along with the proposed student development activities,
encourages students to continue on to further their education. The program
particularly recruits students from campuses and community colleges in rural and
low-income communities across Georgia, as these students often are first-
generation college attendees and/or have limited opportunities to work with the
latest technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the REU site is to
encourage competitive research in early stages of undergraduate students' career
and motivate them to pursue higher education to conduct highly skilled research
and development in future. The site supports 10 participants for an 8-week
period in the summer of each REU year. The participants work in teams on
specific projects mentored by the REU siteâ€™s organizing group that consists of
five faculty mentors, two mentors from industry and four graduate student
mentors. Each of these projects will use a variety of hardware, ranging from
sensors to mobile devices to drones, and will provide an experience and
opportunity to the students in developing their skills to design end-to-end IoT
systems. The specific intellectual merits of the program are derived from
diverse projects in IoT and autonomous systems. In addition to the technical
development, students get training on personal and professional development such
as advise on pursuing graduate studies, primer on ethics and professionalism in
research, and exercise in writing and presenting technical
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
