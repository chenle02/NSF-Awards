The funding is requested to hold a workshop to discuss how best to put in place
a mechanism to ensure the best planning, allocation, management and scientific
support for the shared resources required for the Cosmology and Astrophysics
experiments at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, i.e., experiments
within the Dark Sector. Examples where coordination among the many current and
planned projects include, liquid helium supply and allocation, power allocation
and future needs, Dark Sector model machine shop supply, maintenance and
operation, Dark Sector mechanical and electronics support, a voice for science
IT and future data transmission, science cargo needs, coordination of science
population constraints, synergy of winter-over talent, etc. Discussion and
presentations at the workshop will focus on: (1) conveying the shared resources
requirements and logistical needs of the current and possible future Cosmology
and Astrophysics projects at the South Pole, and (2) possible operational models
to coordinate the needed support. The goal of the workshop is to develop and
agree upon a model for a scientifically motivated organization to coordinate and
support the shared resources for the Dark Sector at the South Pole. The
Intellectual Merit of the proposed activity is the developing an understanding
of, and communicating, the enormous potential of the South Pole for Cosmological
and Astrophysical research. The Broader Impacts resulting from the proposed
activity will be increased scientific productivity of the South Pole Station
through more efficient use of shared resources and through communicating and
understanding the logistical needs required to conduct the best science in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;
