9707285 Hemminger This project will explore the fundamental kinetics and
mechanisms of the reactions of solid sodium chloride and hydrated salts, such as
calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, with gases such as nitric acid,
dinitrogen pentoxide, and chlorine nitrate, using surface science techniques
including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Other
surface spectroscopic techniques, such as high resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy and laser-induced desorption mass spectrometry, will also be used
as warranted during the project. The reactions to be studied are believed to
contribute to the formation of hydrochloric acid, nitryl chloride, and molecular
chlorine, respectively. The latter two are of particular importance since their
photolysis produces chlorine atoms which may compete with hydroxyl radicals in
initiating the oxidation of organics in the troposphere. Particular emphasis
will be placed on studies to elucidate the importance of water on the rates of
these reactions and on morphological changes in the surface structure as the
reactions occur.
