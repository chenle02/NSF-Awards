The objective of this Workshop is to promote intra- and inter- national
interaction between the academic, governmental, and industrial segments of the
U.S. and Brazilian geotechnical communities. It is expected that this
interaction will lead to the definition of common grounds concerning outstanding
geotechnical problems and of probable research avenues toward their solution.
For obvious geological reasons it is expected that a particular type of
structured soils- residual soils- will be major (but not necessarily exclusive)
common ground of the Workshop.
