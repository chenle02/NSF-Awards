Plants vary greatly in their responses to cold temperatures. At one extreme are
plants from tropical and subtropical regions such as soybean and rice, which
suffer injury when exposed to chilling temperatures between 0 and 12 degrees
Celcius. In sharp contrast, plants from temperate regions are not only chilling
tolerant, but many, such as Arabidopsis and wheat, can survive freezing after
exposure to low nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as "cold
acclimation." &lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to understand the
"genomic" basis of cold tolerance. The specific focus will be to develop a more
detailed understanding of how plants respond to low temperature in terms of
altering gene expression. This emphasis is motivated by the recent demonstration
in Arabidopsis that cold acclimation involves the action of cold-regulated genes
including the CBF regulon, a group of genes that imparts freezing tolerance and
is coordinately regulated by the CBF transcriptional activators. &lt;br/&gt;This
project will comprise three related lines of investigation. In the first, a low
temperature "wiring diagram" will be constructed that includes a definition of
low temperature regulatory circuits and the gene regulons that they control. The
second line of investigation will be to determine the similarities and
differences of low temperature-regulated genes in plants that differ in freezing
tolerance. The third line of investigation will be to determine whether the
Arabidopsis CBF cold-response pathway is highly conserved in other plants and
whether differences in plant cold tolerance can be traced to differences in CBF
cold-response pathways. Comparative and functional genomics approaches will be
used to address these issues including gene expression profiling using DNA
microarrays. &lt;br/&gt;In sum, these lines of investigation will provide a
deeper understanding of the "genomic mechanisms" that plants have evolved to
cope with low temperature and have the potential to provide "genetic tools" to
improve the cold tolerance of plants, traits of considerable agronomic and
economic importance. In as much as the CBF regulon not only imparts freezing
tolerance, but dehydration tolerance as well, the results of this project also
have the potential to provide genetic tools to improve the drought and salinity
tolerance of agriculturally important
plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microarray data
