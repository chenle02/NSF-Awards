This project continues work on important issues in the field of monetary
economics and business cycle theory. The project consists of four parts: 1)
research on how well simple regularities or laws captured by the quantity theory
of money can account for movements in prices, exchange rates and interest rates;
2) development of a theory for explaining the large observed differences between
movements in asset prices and movements in their associated fundamentals; 3)
estimating the fraction of output variability that can be attributed to monetary
as opposed to real disturbances; and 4) estimating the social cost of
preventable economic instability. Previous work by the investigator demonstrated
that there was a remarkably stable, simple relationship between an economy's
money supply, its long run inflation rate and the average level of nominal
interest rates. Yet so many other forces impinge on prices and interest rates in
the short run that agreement on these long run average relationships imply
virtually nothing about immediate questions of macroeconomic policy. This
project builds on this past work by extending the study of long run regularities
to include exchange rates and by studying the "residuals," the movements in
prices, interest rates and exchange rates that are unexplained by the economy's
money supply. This work should provide important new insights into the role
played by money in the macro-economy. The investigator relates the observation
that interest rates are much more variable in the short run than predicted by
the long term relationship between money and interest rates to a growing body of
evidence that stock market prices are more variable than predicted by movements
in their fundamentals. Why are financial markets so volatile? This project
develops a new theory of "liquidity constrained" trading in financial markets
that could explain these puzzles and also provides a framework for systematic
study of such important events as the stock market crash in October, 1987.
