When a person is faced with a cognitive task that takes effort, neurons in a
brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex are activated. At present we
don't know whether neuronal activation in this region is related to nonspecific
effects of arousal, the increased effort involved in making a decision, or
processes related to divided attention. With this NSF small grant for
exploratory research, Dr. Olson will study the responses of single neurons in
the anterior cingulate during the performance of tasks that activate this region
in the human. The animals will be trained on three different tasks in order to
distinguish between increases in activity that are due to arousal, decision
making, or split attention. This project represents the first attempt to study
the activity of this area in behaving animals. The results should advance our
understanding of the cognitive circuits underlying selective attention and
decision making. They will be relevant for models of decision processes in
humans, robotics and artificial intelligence as well as neuroscience.***//
