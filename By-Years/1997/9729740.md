The goal of this dissertation project is to develop a better understanding of
the origins of technical and mathematical expertise in Elizabethan England by
examining various engineering projects of the era, the individuals who
contributed their knowledge and skill to them, and the patrons who selected and
supported these individuals. Toward that end, the researcher will examine
archived manuscripts of the Elizabethan State Papers as well as some collections
of personal papers, including those of both patrons and clients. These materials
will support chapters focused on navigation, mining, and cartography.
