This project is summarizing and synthesizing publications in education and
engineering journals about peer assessment and student collaborative learning
processes in undergraduate engineering courses. The project is stimulated by the
requirements of ABET (The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology)
that undergraduate engineers engage in cooperative learning experiences and
practice reviewing each other's work. Drawing on published research on the
influence of peer assessment methods, this project is blending the perspectives
of educational psychology, educational measurement, learning design, and
engineering education into a review and synthesis of that literature. The
practice of peer assessment in engineering classrooms is formative rather than
summative assessment, and thus has the potential to improve the learning process
of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
