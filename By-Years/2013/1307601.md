The objective of this research is to integrate surface acoustic wave with
nanophotonic devices on piezoelectric aluminum nitride thin films. The approach
is to employ the latest nanofabrication techniques to fabricate surface acoustic
wave devices with corresponding acoustic wavelengths comparable to the
wavelength of co-propagating optical wave, both are guided and confined in a
thin AlN layer. The proposed integrated surface acousto-optical device systems
will lead to many novel applications for optical communications and RF/microwave
photonics. Ultrafast switching and modulation of nanophotonic cavities and
optical isolation based on non-reciprocal mode conversion will be demonstrated.
Coherent acoustic phonon generation through stimulated Brillouin Scattering will
also be explored. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although acousto-optics has a
long history, the state-of-the-art development of nanofabrication technology can
bring the field to an unprecedented new regime of extremely strong light-sound
interaction at the nanoscale. The proposed integration of surface acoustic wave
devices with nanophotonic devices will lead to miniaturized acousto-optical
devices that can be incorporated in integrated photonic systems, tunable optical
isolation on a chip, and coherent surface acoustic phonon
generation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will impact the industry and
the scientific community by providing a new class of integrated photonic devices
for optical communication and sensing technologies. The education and outreach
activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in science
and engineering. A series of experimental demonstrations of optical science will
be performed during the summer camp programs to inspire and educate K-12
students and at the Science Museum of Minnesota.
