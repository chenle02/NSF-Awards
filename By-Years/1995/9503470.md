Since the discovery in 1953 of the double helix by Watson and Crick, a great
deal of effort has gone into the determination of RNA, DNA, and protein
sequences. Today, over 150 million letters of DNA sequence have been determined
in segments averaging 1000 in length from a large variety of organisms. This
impetus is typified by the human genome project which has received a great deal
of press and discussion. This information explosion is stimulating a natural
symbiosis between molecular biology and computer science. New computational
methods are required to obtain, organize, compare and interpret the vast amounts
of macromolecular sequence information now being collected. Efforts in this
direction are being made in many parts of the world; there is a continuing need
for a comprehensive international conference to bring together leading
researchers who use a variety of disparate approaches and techniques. The
Dagstuhl seminar on molecular bioinformatics is designed to address this
continuing need. The first Dagstuhl Seminar on molecular bioinformatics was
held. The second seminar will be held July 10-14, 1995.
