This 3-year project, "Curriculum Resources for Earth Science Teachers" (CREST),
is designed to provide 192 elementary and secondary teachers with resources and
field and laboratory experiences to meet the need for improved earth science
instruction in Maine's public schools. The project would: (1) increase knowledge
of science applications by having teachers work with earth scientists in a
summer intern program; (2) prepare curriculum materials, including field trip
guidebook, classroom activity and source books, videotaped programs, and
rock/mineral reference collections; and (3) facilitate teacher communication and
learning through conferences, newsletters, electronic bulletin boards, and
interactive TV broadcasts. Each year 10 teachers will be selected to participate
as summer interns, spending 6 weeks working on a research project with a
professional earth scientist. These earth science teachers will directly benefit
from the multi- disciplinary research network that exists among the MGS and
other State and Federal agencies, and Maine colleges and universities. Many of
the curriculum materials prepared through CREST will be applicable and
transferable to earth science programs in the schools of other states. The cost-
sharing is more than 27% of the amount requested from National Science
Foundation.
