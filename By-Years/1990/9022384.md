Several key results were obtained in the Phase I study of an efficient acousto-
optic resonator for GHz laser mode locking. The results indicate that lithium
niobate is one of the best resonator materials. We believe that fabrication
techniques can limit resonator gain at the higher frequencies. This study also
verified the closed loop electronic driver approach which worked well for lamp
pumped lasers with cavity frequency below 200 MHz. The diode pumped laser mode
locking pulse width produced varied from 8 to 13 picoseconds and appeared to be
more stable when the cavity is shortened. Phase II of the study will continue
the work begun in Phase I. We have improved our fabrication techniques and will
construct a higher gain resonator. The electronic driver concept will also be
implemented at the higher frequency. Through joint activities with laser
companies, we will determine the most stable cavity length of mode locked diode
pumped lasers. At the conclusion of this study, working mode locked systems that
can provide stable pulses less than 10 picoseconds wide will be completed for
diode pumped lasers and for tunable solid state lasers.
