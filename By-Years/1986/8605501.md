The Fluid Dynamics and Diffusion Laboratory (FDDL) at the Department of Civil
Engineering, Colorado State University, is a world recognized center of
excellence in wind engineering research. Many contributions to the fundamental
understanding of fluid mechanics and wind engineering have been made at these
facilities, but the instrumentation purchased during the l960's and early l970's
is now coming to the end of its useful life. The updating of this
instrumentation is a priority.
