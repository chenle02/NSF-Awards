Small (&lt;3um) eukaryotic cells are known to be a substantial component of the
photosynthetic biomass in the ocean and coastal waters. Because of their small
size, cells cannot generally be identified by standard microscopic procedures.
Thus, the development and application of new techniques is being pursued.
Specifically, the development of immunofluorescent assays for the accesory
pigments and surface proteins of small size class phytoplankton (ultraplankton).
Such markers will then be used to characterize the taxonomic composition of the
small cell flora in the ocean. Although the phytoplankton in this size class are
very active biologically, they are difficult to identify and work with. The
problem will be approached with advanced biotechnological methods, which
reflects the desire of the oceanographic community to expand the available
techniques for dealing with difficult biological problems.
