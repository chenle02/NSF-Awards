In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program of the
NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Peter Vikesland of Virginia Tech is examining
the role of particle properties on the dissolution kinetics of metallic
nanoparticles. Metal nanoparticles are being developed for incorporation in a
wide variety of consumer and industrial products, yet many questions remain
about their longevity in diverse environments. Results from this integrated
research and education effort will be disseminated in scientific publications
and via presentations at relevant conferences. In addition, the results will
inform outreach activities organized by Professor Vikesland, the Virginia Tech
Sustainable Nanotechnology (VTSuN) Program, and the NSF-EPA Center for the
Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEINT). Professor Vikesland,
VTSuN, and CEINT will engage K-12 and other members of the general population
using hands-on activities and inform these audiences about the societal
implications (both positive and negative) of nanotechnology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Vikesland will utilize a highly sensitive atomic
force microscope to examine how surface coatings, nanoparticle size, and metal
identity affect metal nanoparticle dissolution rates. Arrays of surface adhered
nanoparticles of variable consistency will be produced via nanosphere
lithography and their dissolution will be probed over time. This approach
enables investigation of dissolution kinetics in the absence of aggregation
using realistic nanoparticle concentrations - severe limitations of many
alternative methodologies. Findings from this study will aid efforts to engineer
environmentally benign nanomaterials and to predict their environmental impacts.
