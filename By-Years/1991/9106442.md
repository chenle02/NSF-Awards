The 1991 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute, a summer school for advanced
graduate students of theoretical elementary particle physics, will be held in
June, 1991 at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The Institute will focus on
various aspects of the standard model of the elementary particles and their
interactions. Physics that may lie beyond the standard model will also be
discussed. The school will be an improtant part of the advanced training of its
attendees.
