This award will enable Dr. Marcus N. Myers of the University of Utah to visit
Australia for three weeks. Dr. Myers will continue his collaboration with Dr.
Ron Beckett of the Chisholm Institute of Technology in Melbourne in the area of
field-flow fractionation (FFF) instrumentation, and its application to
environmental and industrial problems. FFF, a means of characterizing and
separating macromolecules and other small particles, was originally developed by
Dr. Myers and colleagues at the University of Utah. The methods developed have
been applied to environmental problems by Dr. Beckett and colleagues in
Australia, and the two groups have collaborated productively for five years.
This award would permit continuation of this collaboration for another year.
