This is a theoretical study of the dynamic processes shaping mantle flow
beneath mid-ocean spreading centers. three dimensional numerical models of flow
beneath a spreading center will be constructed to try to explain observed bulls-
eye gravity anomalies along slow-spreading ridges and their absence along
intermediate and fast spreading ridges. The models will include the irreversible
effects of melting on shaping the density structure and will explore the effects
of spatial, temperature, and composition dependent rheology.
