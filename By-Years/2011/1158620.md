The Hidden Light of Antarctica is a photographic project that will explore the
visual effects of ultraviolet and infrared light waves on the landscape of
Antarctica. Since ultraviolet and infrared light waves are outside the visible
spectrum, these photographs will reveal ?hidden? light. The artist will
collaborate with an atmospheric chemist who is developing a long-term record of
boundary-layer ozone flux through the investigation of bromine compounds in the
Ross Island region. She will compare her photographs taken daily with the data
results collected by the scientist and her team to determine if the daily ozone
fluctuation can be perceived visually. Combined, these diverse approaches to the
exploration of ozone depletion, global warming, and climate change will bring
fresh perspectives and expanded insights to these subjects. The resulting images
will have their own aesthetic qualities with a direct connection to science that
will make them unique. This project will result in a series of photographs, a
monograph, and an installation.
