Acoustic waves have had widespread applications in fields as diverse as medicine
and nondestructive evaluation of materials. Availability of extremely short
pulses would be an attractive improvement for these uses. Standard
microelectronics fabrication techniques of deposition photolithograph and
etching may permit construction of acoustic sources on a planar structure. The
laboratories available at Case Western Reserve University permit experimental
construction of such structures. This research is both theoretical and
experimental, with modeling and calculations predicting performance of the
experimental planar piezoelectric transducers and arrays of such transducers. If
successful, this research can provide design rules for creation of acoustic
arrays of value for high resolution metrology.
