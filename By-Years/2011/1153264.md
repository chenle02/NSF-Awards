The investigators will build a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and install it
near the southern crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) initially at
the Mercedes Observatory (for a ~ 3-6 month campaign observation) and later at
El Leoncito Observatory, where additional ionospheric instrumentation already
exists. Neutral winds and temperatures are key parameters needed to understand
upper atmosphere processes. Most of our knowledge of neutral parameters in the
upper atmosphere comes from observations obtained by FPIs. The measurement of
winds and temperatures at ~250-300 km and at ~95 km will be combined with other
parameters obtained with co-located optical and ionosonde instrumentation. The
main objective of the study is to improve understanding of ion-neutral coupling
processes in the region. Different experiments will be carried out, e.g., the
latitudinal comparison of neutral winds using other FPIs, the comparison of
zonal winds and zonal plasma drifts (inferred from the motion of airglow
depletions), and the study of high latitude midnight temperature maximum (MTM)
effects. The study will also contribute to research on the dynamics and
electrodynamics of the upper atmosphere. The effort includes the organization of
a mini-workshop on multi-instrument studies of the upper atmosphere to foster
the collaboration between U.S. and Argentine researchers.
