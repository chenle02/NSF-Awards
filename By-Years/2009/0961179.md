Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramapo
College of New Jersey is a public undergraduate institution devoted to liberal
arts and science education and training. Funds provided by this award will
permit the renovation of the Biology Research Suite, a shared research
laboratory for faculty-directed student research projects. The renovations
include reconfiguration of the space to have an open design for student research
allowing for improved faculty-faculty and faculty-student collaborations. In
addition, the renovations include individual faculty research rooms, and common-
use spaces including: cold room, tissue culture rooms, imaging room, and
microbiology prep room. The renovated facility will provide the opportunity for
undergraduates to conduct experiments involving protein purification, cloning,
microbial gene expression and tissue culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving the
research training facility will deepen the College's offerings in biology and
biochemistry and continue to provide opportunities for women, minorities and
physically disabled students to gain employment and win spots in graduate and
professional schools. The new Biology Research Suite will increase collaboration
between senior and junior faculty. Strengthening and increasing the interaction
between undergraduates and faculty will widen student experience and better
prepare them for careers in graduate school and/or public and corporate research
laboratories. Producing graduates with skill sets that are current with
sophisticated contemporary research and who understand the social system of
science will increase the nation's science enterprise wherever they practice
their profession. This experience will result in students who are prepared to
move seamlessly into research environments in industry or graduate schools
because they have experience with the technology and methods that are in common
use in these settings.
