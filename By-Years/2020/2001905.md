Sarah Wellons is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Northwestern
University. She will perform large-scale computer simulations to study the
lifecycle and properties of massive distant galaxies in the early Universe and
to understand how they differ from nearby galaxies. Results from this study will
allow astronomers to accurately interpret observations of early galaxies. Along
with this research, Wellons will develop an astronomy course for incarcerated
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wellons will employ a combination of large-volume
and as zoom-in simulations to investigate key aspects of massive galaxies at
high redshifts (&gt; 2). The simulations will explore mechanisms that quench
star formation, connect physical processes at large and small size scales, and
govern the kinematic evolution of massive galaxies through cosmic time. This
work will provide theoretical context for puzzling observations of massive
quiescent galaxies at high redshifts, as well as set expectations for future
observations of increasingly distant galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
