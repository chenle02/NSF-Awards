The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology for the prevention of snow accumulation that can be
adapted to various autonomous and modern vehicles to enable their safe operation
in all weather conditions. This technology can contribute to reducing roadway
fatalities and create additional jobs and economic opportunities in
transportation industry. Enhancement in power generation efficiency of
photovoltaic modules during winter using the proposed passive technology (i.e.,
the snowphobic coating) may contribute to reduction in the use of nonrenewable
sources of energy, potentially addressing climate change.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
passive technology to enable an understanding of the interaction of snow (which
is a mixture of ice, air, and water) with solid surfaces during snow removal
processes. The proposed research may advance the snow-removal surface coatings
beyond currently available superhydrophobic and icephobic coatings which only
deal with interactions of the surface with a single phase of water (i.e., only
water or ice). The proposed coating will utilize fundamental understandings
related to the composition of snow and its interaction with surfaces to provide
durable coatings desirable for facilitating of snow removal under various
environmental conditions. Finally, production and application of the proposed
coatings are scalable, advancing the manufacture of low cost polymeric
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
