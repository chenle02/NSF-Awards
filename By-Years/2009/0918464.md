Although fusion of sperm and egg to form a new organism was first observed
microscopically over 160 years ago, the proteins on the surface of the sperm and
egg that facilitate this process are still largely unknown. Over the last
decade, the small (~1mm) nematode worm C. elegans has been used to discover
seven sperm proteins and six egg proteins that are required for fertilization to
take place. The focus of this proposal is SPE-42, a protein that, when mutated,
results in complete sterility of the affected worms. Preliminary data, including
computer models, suggest that SPE-42 is expressed on the sperm surface, meaning
that SPE-42 is potentially available to interact with proteins present on the
egg surface. The experiments to be carried out will test this hypothesis by
asking (1) where in sperm is SPE-42 located and (2) which parts of the protein
are important for its function. A combination of molecular genetic techniques
and computer modeling of the SPE-42 protein structure will be used to complete
the proposed work. In addition, a collection of new fertilization-defective
mutants will be evaluated to find other proteins that are involved in sperm -
egg interactions during fertilization. The knowledge gained from these
experiments will impact both the fields of infertility treatment and non-
hormonal contraceptive development. Americans spend nearly $1.4 billion per year
on infertility treatment, and most of the bill is not covered by medical
insurance. Because proteins similar to SPE-42 are found in nearly all multi-
cellular organisms including humans, what we learn about how SPE-42 works will
inform our understanding of animal fertilization in general. This project will
provide hands-on training to at least two graduate students and several
undergraduates.
