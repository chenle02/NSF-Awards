With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Walter Fast from University of Texas at Austin, and Dr.
Dali Liu from Loyola University Chicago, to study enzymes capable of degrading
N-acyl-homoserine lactones used in the quorum-sensing (QS) pathways of many
Gram-negative bacteria. Two enzymes, one that uses a metal ion mediated
mechanism (AiiA) and a second that uses covalent catalysis (PvdQ), will be
investigated to determine how they recognize and process various QS signals.
These enzymes will also be used to probe the QS and quorum-quenching in mixed
microbial cultures. The results of this research will increase the precision of
biochemical tools useful in quorum sensing research, will provide catalysts for
potential anti-biofouling and anti-infective applications in agri-and aqua-
culture, and will advance the understanding of social interactions between
diverse bacterial species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although bacteria are considered
single-celled life, they display coordinated behaviors that are closely linked
to how many individual bacteria are present in a given place. This type of group
behavior is called "quorum-sensing" because some behaviors do not manifest until
a quorum of bacteria is present. The goal of the proposal is to study proteins
that can interfere with cell-to-cell signaling. This work will generate new
catalysts with potential applications as industrial biofouling agents and as
anti-infective agents in agri- and aqua-culture. The research will provide an
environment for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in
specialized techniques used in the study of protein structure and function. The
project will also be integrated into an outreach program designed to increase
the interest and participation in science of K-12
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Systems and
Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB)
Division of the Biological Sciences (BIO) Directorate.
