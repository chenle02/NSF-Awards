Numerical and asymptotic techniques will be used to investigate transonic flow
about aircraft wings and flows with distributed vorticity. Specific transonic
problems to be analyzed are design of optimum critical axisymmetric bodies,
flows about lifting, not-so-slender transonic wings and the transonic area rule,
and wind tunnel flows. Some use will be made of the transonic small disturbance
formulation. The investigations of the vortical flow problem will involve
development and clarification of theories integrating nonlinear and viscous
effects. Both the transonic and vortical flow problems require interaction
between numerical and asymptotic treatments in order to deal with complex
nonlinearities. Present day commercial aircraft cruise in the transonic regime.
In this regime drag (the force opposing forward motion) rises rapidly hence
there is interest in understanding transonic flows and in the design of reduced
drag wings. The study of flows with distributed vorticity (a certain
distribution of whirl-like motion in the environment of interest) is both of a
fundamental nature in fluid mechanics, but also of considerable interest in
specific applications. One example of such an application is the prediction of
aerodynamic losses and heat loads in turbo-machinery. The investigators will use
modern methods of applied mathematics to deal with the complexities of the
problems in the areas of research proposed.
