This research program is directed towards improved understanding of first-order
phase transformations based on examination of the martensitic phase
transformation. The program employs both theoretical and experimental approaches
to address two broad areas: (a) the distributed-activation kinetics of
heterogeneous nucleation; and (b) competing transformation mechanisms in
nonlinear nonlocal solids. General features of distributed- activation
heterogeneous kinetics are examined in nucleation kinetic experiments employing
acoustic emission and sterological measurements in both thermoelastic and
nonthermoelastic martensitic systems, defining potency distributions of initial
and autocatalytic defects. principles are extended to bainitic transformations
and solidification. Competing mechanisms of structural transformation are
examined by combined theory and experiment in model systems describable by
nonlinear nonlocal continuum models predicting interfacial energies. Experiments
test predicted behavior of a new transformation mechanism, quasimartensitic
strain modulation, which competes with nucleation and growth under conditions
near a lattice instability. %%% This analytical and experimental work is
directed to martensitic transformations found in steels, for instance, but is
applicable to other phase transformations in metals and ceramics.
