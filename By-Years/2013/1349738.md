Places of worship are among the most prevalent and visible institutions in
communities across the United States. This visibility, though, means that
churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other religious congregations are
often targets for street crime and ethnic- or even religiously-motivated hate
crime. Indeed, it is easy to find hundreds of news reports each year about a
religious congregation being victimized by vandalism, theft, arson, or some
other crime. Yet, the victimization of religious congregations has received
little attention by social scientists. Our research will contribute to the
testing and extension of theories of crime and its relationship to community
contexts, as well as theories of ethnic conflict and religious
persecution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will gather nationally
representative survey data on the prevalence, pattern, and predictors of
victimization of religious congregations along with in-depth interview data with
congregational leaders and their experiences with crime. We will compare and
contrast the factors that predict street crime victimization with those that
predict religiously-motivated hate crime victimization. These data will not only
allow social scientists to test theories of crime, ethnic conflict, and
religious persecution, but they will also provide the foundation for law
enforcement, community, and congregational leaders to prevent and respond to the
victimization of places of worship.
