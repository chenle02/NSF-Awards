Recent developments in the use of nonlinear optical processes for generation and
detection of broadband THz pulses have created significant interest in the use
of THz spectroscopy for a variety of civilian and military applications. The
award from the Approaches to Combat Terrorism program (ACT) will be used to
design, fabricate, and characterize novel waveguide-based emitters and detectors
that allow for broadband operation over extended interaction lengths. This
extended interaction is expected to allow for small form factor, low power
ultrafast fiber lasers to replace current tabletop systems. The goal of the
proposed research is to explore the use these waveguide devices to build a
compact, portable, and robust THz time-domain spectroscopy system. The proposed
devices employ a single mode dielectric waveguide embedded within a single mode
THz waveguide. In addition to the training of students, the broader impact of
this work is based on the development of fundamentally new technology. By
creating the components necessary to make THz spectroscopic systems more readily
available, we believe that this technology will be beneficial not only to the
Intelligence Community, but also to a broader range of scientific communities.
