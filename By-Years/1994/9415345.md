9415345 Brandt ABSTRACT RAPID PROTOTYPING IN MANUFACTURING EDUCATION The
Milwaukee School of Engineering, teaming with the Northeast Wisconsin Technical
College and the Rapid Prototyping Consortium (RPC) involving Snap-On, Harley-
Davidson, IBM, Outboard Marine Research, Kohler, Master Lock, and Lost Form
Technologies, will develop twelve rapid prototyping teaching modules to be
folded in the School's curricula based partly on the research into rapid
prototyping sponsored by the Consortium and the experience of its member firms.
Building on the ongoing relationship through RPC and good faculty and
facilities, the project is focused on sterolithography which is of interest to
the firms in an area of innovative and important technology. The program is open
to undergraduate, graduate and community college students. ***
