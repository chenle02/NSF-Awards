There are two thrusts to this research. First, fundamental studies to
characterize the intrinsic kinetics and adsorption parameters of two key
pharmaceutical, insulin and urokinase, in ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction,
and affinity chromatography systems will be made. Measurements of the
equilibrium isotherms and kinetic constants of the pure compounds will be made
and the effects of pH and salt level on the affinities and kinetic constants
will be investigated. An existing dynamic column simulation model will be
extended to accommodate gradient systems. The model will be validated with pure
component experimental data and then will be used to study how impurities and
products compete for sorbent sites. As a second and supporting thrust the
complex interplay between biomolecules and sorbent functional groups resulting
from steric effects, hydration, as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions will be studied. This research should provide a complete
description of the configurations of a complex during binding, allow
quantitative assessment of various intermolecular forces, and predict the
reactive affinities for different molecules. In this way, the understanding of
how molecular structure affects sorbent selectivity will be advanced. The
research will also have a significant impact on the synthesis and identification
of more selective sorbents for biochemical separations.
