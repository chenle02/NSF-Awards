This project will support instrumentation in the Applied Mathematical Sciences
Department of an open-admissions college. A classroom will be equipped with
twenty-five networked IBM-PC (or IBM compatible) microcomputers and a large
scale projection screen for demonstration purposes. The equipment will be used
in two junior level statistics courses which are required of business majors.
Students will encounter daily assigned classroom problems dealing with decision-
making situations which require statistical analysis and interpretation of
computer output. Solutions will be worked out on computers (two students per
machine), as in a lab. Mathematically-shy business students will have a greater
appreciation of statistical concepts and their applications to real world
problems, more experience in dealing with the popular IBM-PC machinery and
increased interest in pursuing optional senior level math courses in the area of
the decision sciences. Business students, who represent fifty-eight percent of
UH-Downtown's 1986 graduating class, will receive enhanced training in
quantitative methods. Ultimately, other faculty will be encouraged to use this
instructional lab for courses in computer science, numerical methods and
calculus.
