This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2013. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Christopher J. Friedline is "Barking up the Right Trees:
the Influence of Forest Fire on the Genetic Architecture of Pine Populations in
the Southeastern United States." The host institution for the fellowship is the
Virginia Commonwealth University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrew J.
Eckert.

The main goal of this project is to investigate the underlying genetic
architecture associated with bark thickness as a fire-adapted phenotype in four,
economically-important, closely-related, species of pines with a range along the
eastern and southeastern United States. Using next-generation, genotype-by-
sequencing approaches, the study will determine the degree to which the genetic
architecture for this complex trait is shared across natural ranges and multiple
evolutionary time scales, and how the variability observed can inform breeding
plans to minimize the negative financial impact that bark mass has on the forest
industry. This research will 1) provide new genomic resources for non-model
species; 2) augment existing plant genomic resources; 3) address fundamental
principles in evolutionary biology; and 4) serve to inform and improve breeding
programs and land management initiatives.

Training objectives include evolutionary genetics, high-throughput functional
genomics, and next-generation sequencing. Broader impacts of this project
include the development of a new course to train both graduate and advanced
undergraduate students in the computational and analytical skills necessary to
address micro- and macro-evolutionary questions using large data sets, such as
those generated by next-generation sequencing technologies. This course will be
open to students from the Biology, Bioinformatics, and Life Sciences departments
at VCU. The fellow will bring to bear his skills in computational biology and
molecular evolution and newly apply them to plant genomics. All data and
computer code will be made available to the scientific community via public FTP
and project web sites as well as through long-term public repositories such as
GenBank, Dryad, and TreeGenes.
