9410844 Hagelberg A high resolution study of linear and non-linear interactions
within the Equatorial Pacific carbonate system over the past 4 m.y., using GRAPE
as a CaC03 proxy. Record of this proxy from ODP Leg 138 and its detailed oxygen-
isotopic data will be used to learn more about the dynamics of the carbonate
system.
