This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The adequate numerical treatment of free boundary problems
exhibiting disparate scales is a formidable mathematical and computational
challenge where the geometry plays a crucial role. Modern algorithms should be
able to optimize and balance the computational effort to capture small scales
without over-resolving the others producing in particular efficient interface
geometry description. Adaptive procedures in this context are thus critical but
yet suffering from their lake of mathematical understanding. The present
research proposes to design, test and analyze space-time adaptive algorithms
suited for free boundary problems. Particular instances in biophysics (such as
biomembranes and cardiovascular system) and material sciences (such as crystal
surfaces relaxation, injection molding viscoelastic flow, and micro-devices
design) are addressed. All have in common the intriguing coupling between
interfaces and some quantities of interest governed by partial differential
equations.

Deformable domains are ubiquitous in several areas of research but are still a
serious computational challenge. This project proposes robust and efficient
algorithms particularly tuned for such problems leading to realistic predictions
and deeper understanding. The outcome will benefit many different research
areas. In fact, the applications discussed are of interest in strategic topics
such as human cells morphology, communication technology, nanotechnology, and
high performance computing. This project is collaborative and interdisciplinary
involving a number of scientists in the US and abroad. A substantial effort is
devoted to education.
