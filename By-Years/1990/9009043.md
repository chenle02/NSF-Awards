The purpose of this research is to comprehensively examine and critically assess
Friedrich von Hayek's contribution to methodology in economics. Hayek is a Nobel
Prize winner and a leader of the Austrian Economics movement. He has written
extensively about social science methodology, but no comprehensive analysis or
assessment of his contribution exists. Of particular interest are the origins of
Hayek's views, how he justified them, and the internal consistency of his
methodological approach. The relationship between Hayek's ideas on methodology
and those of a number of other twentieth century economists and philosophers
will also be examined. The positions of Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper, and
Milton Friedman will receive extended attention. The primary method of research
will be a through review of the written work of Hayek and of related authors.
Nearly five hundred pages of transcripts from interviews of Hayek held during
the late 1970's will also be analyzed. This research will be of value to
scholars interested in the methodology of economics and in the history of
economic doctrine, and more broadly to the philosophers and historians of
science.
