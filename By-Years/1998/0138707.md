0138707 Boolchand

This three-year award for US-France collaboration in materials research involves
researchers and students at the University of Cincinnati and at the University
Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris VI) and the High-T Laboratory in Orleans of the
French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). Punit Boolchand in the US
and Richard Kerner in France lead this team of theorists and experimentalists.
The research addresses structural studies of oxide glasses. The objective is to
develop models to predict thermal and structural properties. Alkali silicate
glasses will be prepared; their thermal and spectroscopic properties compared
and contrasted; and constraint and stochastic agglomeration theories applied to
the experimental results. The US investigators bring to this collaboration
expertise in synthesis of glasses and spectroscopy and constraint theory. This
is complemented by French theoretical expertise in modeling glass structure and
access to high temperature glass preparation facilities in Orleans. This award
represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF will
cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate
students. CNRS will support visits by French researchers and graduate students
to the United States. The research will advance understanding of the thermal and
structural properties of oxide glasses and their commercial applications as
silica fibers for optical communications and for silicon microelectronic device
fabrication. The project will advance doctoral thesis research of US and French
graduate students, who will actively participate in the synthesis,
characterization of oxide glasses, and analysis of experimental results.
