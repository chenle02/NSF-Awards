Abstract

Award: DMS-9974395 Principal Investigator: Andrew Solow

As part of the activities in 1999 marking the end of Raoul Bott's formal
teaching career at Harvard and the 35th anniversary of the statement and proof
of the Atiyah-Bott, or Woods Hole theorem, a meeting will be held October 8-10,
1999 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Shimura's original conjecture
was an extension of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for holomorphic maps and
projective varieties, announced during the 1964 Summer Institute in Algebraic
Geometry at Woods Hole. Bott and Atiyah realized that there should be a general
formula for maps preserving any elliptic operator, or indeed any elliptic
complex, and the theorem took shape. Their result and the index theorem underpin
the modern relationship between geometry, arithmetic, and physics. Raoul Bott
will give an exposition of approaches for proving the theorem and
generalizations that motivate current research. Other lectures will cover the
development of pseudodifferential operators in index theory, which made possible
a bridge between analysis and the geometry of the problem. Examples will include
non-classical ones, like the Heisenberg algebra of pseudodifferential operators
on a contact manifold. Atiyah-Singer formulas are obtained for certain Fredholm
operators, and also for a class of Fourier integral operators defined by
homogeneous symplectic automorphisms of a cotangent bundle. Other lectures will
explain the use of an elementary Morse theory to derive natural Morse functions
on moduli spaces, connections of the Atiyah-Bott theorem with physics, and the
application of Lefschetz formula methods to the Harish-Chandra theory of group
representations.

Before this century there was no sharp line between physics and mathematics. The
divergence between the two fields accelerated, and by the 1950's there was
little in common, though physicists had become increasingly adept at using what
mathematics was necessary for their theories. Since the 1970's there has been an
extraordinary convergence of mathematics and physics in the basic theories of
space and matter. The Atiyah-Bott fixed point theorem, or Woods Hole theorem, is
a landmark mathematical result from the 1960's. This theorem has led to a great
number of applications to problems in mathematics, and is an active field of
research. To consider the present work and the future possibilities suggested by
the Atiyah-Bott theorem, a meeting is planned for the fall of 1999, in
celebration of this work and the career of Raoul Bott. The implications of this
research on the problems common to both physics and mathematics will be
explored.
