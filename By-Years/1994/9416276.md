9416276 Uang This project addresses seismic performance of instrumented steel
moment-resisting frames. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused widespread damage
of beam-to-column moment connections in more than fifty buildings. This
earthquake shook not only steel framed buildings but also confidence that the
seismic design profession has long held for this type of premier system.
Although design, detailing, and welding issues of steel moment connections
remain to be investigated experimentally, to improve seismic design of this type
of framing system it is also important to re examine current seismic provisions.
The main objective of this research project is to investigate factors that
contribute to damage of this type of frames at the structural system level. Many
steel moment-resisting frames in the Los Angeles area have been instrumented by
the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG). Because of the high level
of ground shaking, the recorded response from this earthquake represents the
most valuable data of actual building performance up to date. Three instrumented
buildings (two office and one hospital buildings, ranging from 5 to 19 stories
high) are selected for intensive study. Time history correlation and nonlinear
dynamic analysis re conducted to evaluate actual deformation demand (story
drifts, member and panel zone rotational demands). The relationship between the
response modification factor and the structural redundancy, which has not been
addressed in current seismic codes, is also addressed. The results of this
research project will provide information on realistic deformation demand on
moment connections. This information is essential for providing guidelines for
future testing of steel moment connections. The research results on structural
redundancy will further provide a basis for developing a next-generation seismic
code. This is a Northridge earthquake project. ***
