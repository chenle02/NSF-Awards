The objective of this research is to complete a unified control analysis and
design methodology, encompassing both 1-d (one independent variable, usually
time) and n-d (n independent variables) systems, for reduced order controllers
that achieve robust performance for linear, uncertain plant models. In order to
derive synthesis methods for n-d systems which are not overly conservative, we
will also develop improved analysis techniques (verifying stability, computing
norms, etc.) for n-d systems. This approach is significant, because it will tie
together many different areas of current control research with a unified theory.
It will lead to algorithms that will increase the role that a control engineer
can have in initial system configuration, since the cost/benefit tradeoffs in
component quality and in component modelling can be analyzed apriori. The entire
methodology is based on linear fractional transformations of matrices and a
mathematical framework to study them called the structured singular value. The
structured singular value is a mathematical tool useful in analyzing matrix
perturbation problems.
