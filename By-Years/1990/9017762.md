The principal investigator will study the origin of alkaline ring-dike
complexes, and in particular the relationship between coexisting silica-
undersaturated and silica-saturated syenites. Attention will be focused on the
Red hill complex in New Hampshire, specifically on the mineral apatite, which as
one of the first phases to crystallize most likely preserves information about
the early history of these rocks. The relationship between rare earth element
compositions of apatite in mafic enclaves to those in host syenites will be used
as the primary investigative technique. The research will determine whether this
approach is a useful one in establishing consanguinity between the enclaves and
the host rocks, and may provide an important tool in investigating the very
early stages of liquid descent in such rocks.
