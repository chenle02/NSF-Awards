9309946 Sniderman This investigation has two fundamental objectives. The first
is to explore how individuals take advantage of information they may pick up in
the course of an ordinary day to modify or change their opinions. By focusing on
different forms of information, for example, the source of a policy proposal or
the specific terms in which the proposal is put, the investigators aim to
develop an account of the dynamics as well as the statics of political beliefs.
The second objective is to demonstrate the economies of multiple investigators
using a common research vehicle. By having investigators share the same survey,
and by taking advantage of experimental design and computer-assisted
interviewing, twelve studies, conducted by seventeen investigators at thirteen
different universities, can be carried for approximately the cost of one
conventional, national survey. This project should substantially enhance our
understanding of information acquisition and research investigation techniques
that promote reliability, validity and economies of scale. ***
