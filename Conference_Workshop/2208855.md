Algebraic Topology: Methods, Computation, and Science (ATMCS) is a biennial
conference on algebraic topology and its applications. The tenth ATMCS meeting
will be hosted by Oxford University, the week of June 20?24, 2022. The program
includes invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. As many as 350
participants from around the world are expected at the conference. This project
will support the travel of US-based participants to the meeting.

The areas represented at the meeting will include multivariate persistent
homology, directed topology, stochastic topology, inverse problems, algorithms
and software development, topological data analysis (TDA) in machine learning,
network data analysis, and applications of TDA. By supporting the cross
pollination of ideas, the conference will directly impact research in the United
States. Participant support costs will be prioritized for early-career
researchers. A conference website is available at https://atmcs.web.ox.ac.uk/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
