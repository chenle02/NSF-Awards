This is an award to provide support for research on oxidation processes for
water and wastewater treatment. The investigator's plan emphasizes the
application of advanced oxidation processes including those that generate ozone
for the treatment of industrial wastes. He plans to collaborate in conduct of
his research with appropriate industries that he expects will assist in defining
research needs and implement the application of its results. This award is in
accord with conditions contained in NSF 91-112, Young Investigator Awards FY
1992 Program Guidelines for Submission of Nominations. Results of this research
may be applied to engineering design of processes as components of systems for
treatment of wastes utilizing oxidation processes that involve reactions with
ozone and the hydroxyl radical in aqueous-phase water and wastewater treatment
processes.
