Neuropeptides are small signaling molecules that control the development,
physiology, and behavior of animals. This proposal uses genetic approaches in
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how neuropeptides regulate
ecdysis, the behavior used by insects to shed their old exoskeleton (cuticle) at
the end of each molt Ecdysis is controlled by a series of interacting
neuropeptides. The stereotyped nature of the behavior, coupled with its complex
regulation, has made it a premier system for understanding how neuropeptides
cause concerted and developmentally appropriate changes in behavior and
physiology. Our previous work has established that the neuropeptide Crustacean
Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP) plays an important role in regulating Drosophila
ecdysis, consistent with findings from the moth. It also revealed that the
actions of CCAP are more complex than predicted. This proposal will uses the
genetic tools available in Drosophila to understand the bases for CCAP's actions
by determining the expression of the CCAP receptor (CCAP-R), and analyzing the
role of the different CCAP-R-expressing cells in the control of ecdysis. This
work will further our understanding of how neuropeptides control animal behavior
and development. It will also specifically advance the understanding of the
control of ecdysis behavior, a behavior that is essential for the survival of
all insects. Thus, information gained from this research may lead to the
development of useful agents of insect control. The research proposed here
offers a unique opportunity to receive an unusually broad training in Drosophila
biology, including neuroendocrinology, genetics, and behavior. In addition, the
results of this research will be used in lecture and practical courses offered
by the PI.
