9409266 Jacobson The objective of this research is to introduce a new set of
tools for building and analyzing simulation models of complex systems. Issues
considered include model verification and validation, stopping conditions,
variance reduction techniques, sensitivity analysis, and experimental design.
The theory of computational complexity is used to provide a unified framework to
classify and study the issues. A new heuristic algorithm will also be developed
to address these issues. Six decision problems fundamental to simulation
modeling and analysis are identified and may be proven to be non-deterministic
polynomial complete. Special cases of the decision problems that are solvable in
polynomial time are studied. New heuristics for these problems are developed
based on tree search, dynamic programming, and simulated annealing. The
heuristics developed in this research have the potential to provide
quantitative, automated approaches to address fundamental decision elements in
discrete event simulation. The developed tools when attached to simulation
languages can help practitioners build more precise, better quality models, and
perform analysis with a higher degree of assurance and confidence. The outcome
of this research has the potential to advance the domain of systems that can be
modeled and analyzed using discrete event simulation.
