This award provides funding to support travel awards for junior investigators,
including underrepresented minorities, to attend the Sun Valley Workshop:
Musculoskeletal Biology in Sun Valley, Idaho, on August 2-5, 2015. The overall
objective of the Workshop is to improve understanding across the many
disciplines that study skeletal biology and the prevention/treatment of skeletal
disease including the biological response of bone to mechanical loading. Another
goal is to develop the interdisciplinary collaborations which are especially
important for younger scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015 the overall theme
of the Workshop is "New Mechanisms for Old Problems", honoring the long-term and
founding chairman WSS Jee and the concepts initiated at Sun Valley Workshops.
The award will have a major impact on the participation of young investigators
and trainees at the Workshop ensure. The support also will help establish as
permanent the Career Development seminar. The goal is for this professional
development opportunity to become a signature component of the workshop.
