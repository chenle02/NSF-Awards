The X-pinch x-ray source driven by a pulsed power generator may be capable of
exposing a resist on a complete 4 cm by 4 cm wafer in a single submicrosecond
pulse. This source consists of a 2 fine aluminum (Al) wires stretched between
the output electrodes of the power source so as to touch at a single point in
the form of an X. Typically 500 J of 1.6 keV (7.8 A) Al K-shell radiation was
obtained from a < 0.5 mm region at the point of contact of the two wires when a
4 ns, 500 kA current pulse was passed through them. Experiments will be carried
out to determine the resolution and correct exposure conditions for this source
on a resist, to minimize the power pulse required for a few hundred Joule yield,
to try magnesium and carbon in order to obtain a longer wavelength source, and
to improve the pulse-to-pulse reproducibility.
