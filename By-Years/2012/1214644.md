This grant funds the research activities of Professors Mina Aganagic, Raphael
Bousso, Petr Horava, and Yasunori Nomura at the University of California,
Berkeley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves theoretical research at
the crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string
theory, with applications ranging from physics beyond the Standard Model to the
multiverse approach in cosmology, the interface of string theory and condensed-
matter physics, the nature of space and time in quantum gravity, and
mathematical implications of topological strings. Professor Aganagic will
investigate applications of string theory in gauge theories and mathematics;
Professor Bousso will examine the challenges encountered when extracting
predictions from the string multiverse, in particular the measure problem of
eternal inflation; Professor Horava will continue to study quantum gravity with
anisotropic scaling and its connections to string theory, particle
phenomenology, the AdS/CFT correspondence, mathematics of the Ricci flow, and
lattice gravity; and Professor Nomura will consider various issues in
theoretical particle physics and cosmology relevant to experiments coming in the
next decades --- in particular the LHC --- with emphasis on supersymmetry
breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the
conceptual understanding of the multiverse and its implications for TeV-scale
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have
considerable broader impacts. These include the training of students and
postdocs who will be involved in this research; dissemination of research
results to the general public; involvement in QuarkNet; and participation in
lecture series and summer schools that reach under-privileged communities.
