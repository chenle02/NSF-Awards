This proposal will study Earth's magnetosheath and its interaction with the
magnetosphere by (1) analysis of all the magnetosheath data collected by the
IMP-8 plasma instrument over the past 20 years, using a revised analysis routine
optimized for magnetosheath data to produce a data set of the magnetosheath
plasma density, velocity, and temperature; (2) production of synoptic maps of
plasma parameters in the magnetosheath for various upstream solar conditions;
(3) use of these maps to attempt to delineate the boundary of the plasma mantle
for different solar wind conditions; and (4) comparison of the magnetosheath
data with model results. Data will be analyzed to look for variations in the
magnetosheath configuration due to differing upstream magnetic field and plasma
conditions. The results will be compared with the best models available, and
will test theoretical understanding of magnetosheath processes and identify
regions which deviate from the model expectations.***
