Dr. Robert G. Griffin is supported by a grant which is cofunded by the Physical
Chemistry, Biophysics, and Solid State Chemistry Programs to hold a symposium
entitled "High Resolution NMR in Solids." The conference will be held at MIT in
January, 1989 in honor of Professor John S. Waugh's 60th birthday. The NSF
contribution to this symposium will provide travel funds for some of the invited
speakers, and travel stipends for students to attend the conference.
