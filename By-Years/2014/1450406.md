This award will support student travel to the sixth Midwest Verification Day
(MVD), to be held at the University of Missouri-Columbia in October 2014. MVD is
an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research
network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S.
based students, with a special focus on PhD. students at an advanced stage in
their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader
impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important
research area. An event like MVD is a helpful stepping stone on the way to
successful engagement with the broader international research community.
