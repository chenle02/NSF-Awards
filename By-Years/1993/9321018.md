Current advances in computer and information technologies suggest a growing
opportunity to combine automated systems and other management arrangements such
as self-managed groups and teams. This project explores the possibilities of
constructing an automated computerized group decision support system (GDSS) to
help groups manage their decision-making processes more effectively. Ideally
such a system would provide guidance for a group, diagnose problems and
opportunities and have response and intervention capabilities. Current theory
and research provide a body of rules and findings, but no integrative framework
or model to underpin such an effort. This study develops a formal representation
of group decision-making processes. Using this representation, the project
identifies cues which discriminate between effective and ineffective decision-
making processes for different types of decision tasks. The study also addresses
the impacts of GDSS guidance and response on group decision making and its
comparative advantages to facilitation or other "human" forms of guidance. Data
to develop and test the model come from laboratory experiments and a large set
of recorded team meetings from two organizations. An obvious extension of this
effort is a prototype GDSS; however, the more immediate contribution of the
project is basic knowledge about group decision making using an inclusive theory
of group processes which emphasizes key content and process variables and their
interrelations.
