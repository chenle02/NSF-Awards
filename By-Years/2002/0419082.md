This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
model relating the light attenuation and scattering data to the basis weight as
well as optical diagnostics for in-process measurement of web uniformity.
Nonwoven polymer fiber webs are used as a primary component in a variety of
products including, composite materials, medical textiles, civil engineering
fabrics, filters, hygiene products, cosmetics accessories, etc. More than forty
automotive parts employ fiber webs. The overall market of these products is
estimated to be $100B. Maintaining the uniformity of webs is the quality issue
of foremost importance in the manufacturing of nonwoven polymer fiber webs.
Recent advancements in the understanding of ensemble scattering by fiber webs
are enabling the development of optical diagnostics for the basis-weight
uniformity measurements.

The broader impact from this technology will be enhancing the efficiency and
productivity of a significant manufacturing sector. From an academic point of
view, this project will seek to identify the bulk parameters of a complex system
using ensemble measurements and empirical modeling. Dissemination of the results
of this work would provide scientists clues to handling the response of other
similar complex systems, like multiphase suspensions and emulsions encountered
in chemical processing.
