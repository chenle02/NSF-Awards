The mathematical area of dynamical systems studies the long-term evolution of
physical or mathematical systems. The evolution often has chaotic nature (i.e.,
sensitive dependence on initial conditions), and fractal sets often come up when
studying systems with chaotic behavior. An important fractal set is the
Mandelbrot set, which has played a major role in dynamical systems and is one of
the most recognizable fractal sets in mathematics. Among central themes of this
project is understanding certain self-similarity aspects of the Mandelbrot set.
The Mandelbrot set encodes how a quadratic polynomial depends on a parameter. It
is a test object for several fundamental problems in dynamics, in particular on
how exactly chaos arises, even in simple systems. The proposed activity also
covers topics involving higher degree rational maps (i.e., ratios of
polynomials). The projects will involve multiple collaborations with early-
career researchers, and the training of graduate students. One of the goals of
the principal investigator is to promote broader interactions between experts in
different branches of mathematics.

The principal investigator will continue developing the near-neutral
renormalization theory responsible for the self-similarity features of the
Mandelbrot set near its main cardioid. Renormalization (interplay between
different scales) appears in many branches of mathematics and physics; the exact
dictionary is yet to be formalized. In the case of quadratic polynomials,
central conjectures are essentially equivalent to establishing rigorous theories
of the associated renormalizations (for example, proving hyperbolicity of the
renormalization operators). The principal investigator will also study the
geometric and topological properties of parameter spaces of higher degree
rational maps. A concrete theme is understanding the boundaries of hyperbolic
components using near-neutral renormalization. The PI will continue designing
the algebraic and algorithmic theories of self-branched coverings of a two-
sphere, such as maps obtained from post-critically finite rational maps by
forgetting the complex structure. The last topic is closely related to the
theories of mapping class groups and self-similar groups.
