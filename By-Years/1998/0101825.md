The investigators will study electric field and conductance variability in the
high latitude ionosphere. The study will be conducted using the Assimilative
Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) model for a large number of
intervals for which a variety of ground-based and space-based measurements are
available. The study addresses three scientific questions: (1) What are the
spatial and temporal scales of structures in the electric field in the
ionosphere? (2) What are the spatial and temporal scales of structures in the
ionospheric conductance? (3) How do the structured electric field and
conductance affect the global Joule heating? The variability of electric fields
and conductances from the AMIE model will be summarized as a function of
magnetic latitude, magnetic local time, and geomagnetic activity. The analysis
will provide guidance on the amount of variability being omitted in models that
have coarser spatial and temporal scales. It also provides guidance on the
geophysical processes that need to be understood before physics-based models can
completely capture the variability and its effects. The ultimate objective is a
better understanding of the coupling between the thermosphere, ionosphere, and
magnetosphere during geomagnetically disturbed conditions.
