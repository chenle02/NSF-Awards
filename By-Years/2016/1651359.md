Abstract

Public health experts are concerned that Zika virus may soon be spread by
mosquitoes in the continental United States. The goal of this project is to
understand if patches that contain small nozzles (known as "microneedles") can
detect infection by Zika virus. This technology may allow healthcare providers
to improve management and treatment of patients who present with Zika-like
symptoms.

This project involves creating electrodes that can detect components of the Zika
virus. These electrodes will be combined with microneedles to create
inexpensive, painless, and portable patches. The program will examine the
functionality of the microneedle-containing patches with Zika component-
containing blood and skin.
