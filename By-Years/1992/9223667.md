Dr. Cittadino is continuing his investigation into the formative period in the
development of ecology as a science, i.e. the period between World Wars I & II.
He is undertaking this study from an international perspective and with every
effort to interrelate intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes.
The research involves examining primary and secondary source material and
visiting selected archival sites. The interwar period witnessed the intellectual
and institutional maturation of ecology, the emergence of methodologies and
concepts usually associated with the postwar period, the emergence of
identifiable schools, and the initial encounters between this new science and a
variety of social and ideological views and practices. This study represents a
substantial contribution to the historical understanding of ecological science
and offers a unique perspective of a multi- dimensional study carried out from
an international point of view.
