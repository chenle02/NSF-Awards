&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing us with an amazingly accurate and beautiful
model for studying gravitational physics on both the astrophysical and the
cosmological scale, Einstein?s gravitational field theory is a rich source of
mathematically interesting questions. A number of the questions we are most
interested in pertain to solutions of the Einstein constraint equations. These
equations restrict the choice of initial data one can make for an evolving
gravitational system. We are interested in parametrizing the set of solutions of
the constraints (i.e., finding the degrees of freedom), developing algorithms
for constructing solutions, and studying the behavior of solutions of the
constraints. We hope to apply the technique of ?gluing? to implement the
Einstein constraints. The idea of gluing is that, given a pair of solutions of
the constraints, one attempts to connect the two solutions smoothly via a bridge
joining a point in each of them. We have applied the gluing technique to the
Einstein constraints, and have used it to construct multi-black hole initial
data sets, to add wormholes to given solutions, to construct initial data for
black holes in cosmological solutions, and to show that any given closed
manifold (minus a point) admits an asymptotically flat solution of the
constraints. Our work in gluing so far has assumed that the given solutions have
a region of constant mean curvature, and are vacuum solutions. We are working to
remove these assumptions, which should open up a much wider range of
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
