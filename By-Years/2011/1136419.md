This Type 1 Noyce project aims to produce 39 certified Noyce Scholars teaching
in high-needs high schools by the end of the grant period, each of them having
graduated as a mathematics or science major in a specific scientific discipline.
The project benefits from the institution's prior experience with a Noyce
Teaching Fellows Planning Grant (0934604) and a collaborative project with Cal
State University, Chico (0733758). Other partner organizations include the
Sacramento Unified school district, the Los Rios Community College District and
The Parent Teacher Home Visit Project, a non-profit organization devoted to
helping teachers appreciate the cultural and linguistic background of their
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Unusual features include
early field experiences for the Scholars through a summer biotechnology workshop
for high school students, scheduled home visits with mentor teachers to expand
the Scholars' knowledge of their students' cultural and linguistic heritage, and
a year-long highly structured induction period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: In addition to the project's contribution to the teaching needs of high-
needs school districts this project includes an extensive research project. It
follows the Noyce Scholars' development as teachers with the aim of informing
future teacher preparation efforts throughout the California State System.
