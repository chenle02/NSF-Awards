Collaborative Research: Characterizing the Late
Veneer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207107; EAR-0207183&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs:
Walker and Becker; Horan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this
study is to more precisely and accurately characterize the concentrations, in
particular the relative abundances, of the highly siderophile elements (Au, Re,
Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd; elements with very high affinities for iron) in the bulk
silicate earth. The concentrations of these elements were likely set via
continued accretion of the earth (0.1 to 0.5% of planetary mass) subsequent to
the segregation of the metallic core. Questions we hope to answer are: 1) what
is the dominant signature of this suite of elements in the bulk silicate earth,
and can this signature be tied to precursor materials that experienced
particular nebular or other early solar system processes? 2) does the upper
mantle of the Earth exhibit heterogeneities in the relative abundances of these
elements that cannot be attributed to indigenous processes? and 3) did the
composition of the late accreted material change with time? To accomplish these
goals, we will analyze materials from the terrestrial mantle and melt rocks and
breccias from the surface of the Moon for Os isotope compositions and highly
siderophile element abundances.&lt;br/&gt;
