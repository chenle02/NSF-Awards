A Varian Gemini-200 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer is allowing more
emphasis on the use of carbon NMR in the sophomore organic laboratory,
introducing NMR kinetic experiments into the physical chemistry lab, and
expanding the educational impact of the instrumental analysis and spectroscopy
courses. In addition the undergraduate student research is being significantly
improved. The American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training has
emphasized the importance of introducing the students to modern instrumentation
and the challenge of research as early as possible in their studies in order to
attract students to chemistry and to better prepare them for a career in the
chemical sciences. The superconducting NMR is adding a new dimension to and
injecting excitement into the program. The grantee is matching the award from
non-Federal sources.
