This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Laren Tolbert, Georgia Institute of Technology. The work focuses
on fundamental aspects of the acid-base properties of organic molecules. Acid-
base relationships and their understanding are at the core of all reaction
chemistry, controlling the most fundamental of interactions between molecules.
Certain organic molecules are predicted to be extremely strong acids when placed
in the excited state, yet exhibit no measurable indication of that acidity
through rapid proton transfer. The principles governing this sluggish behavior
will be studied in detail. Molecules which exhibit kinetic as well as
thermodynamic acidity will also be studied. Techniques to be utilized include
semiempirical molecular orbital calculations, steady-state and time resolved
emission and absorption measurements, photoproduct analysis, and synthetic
methods development. Possible applications include better substrates for "pH
jump" experiments and useful photoinitators for cationic polymerizations.
