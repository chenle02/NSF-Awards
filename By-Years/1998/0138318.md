AST-0138318&lt;br/&gt;Walker, Chris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced technology in
the areas of mixers, device fabrication, micro machining, digital signal
processing, and telescope design and engineering will be innovatively integrated
to create the first integrated submillimeter heterodyne arrays. These arrays
will utilize the latest Nb and Nb-AU diffusion cooled hot electron bolometers
(HEB) in an efficient micromachined waveguide mount. These arrays will be used
first at the 10-meter Heinrich Hertz Telescope (HHT) operated by the University
of Arizona. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will take place at the University of
Arizona's Steward Observatory where post doctoral and graduate and undergraduate
students will participate. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
