The Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) International Conference on
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ACM-BCB) is aimed at providing a
common environment to bridge important interdisciplinary research areas in
computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, bioinformatics, and
biomedicine and an interactive forum which brings together superb researchers,
practitioners, and students from around the world to promote scientific
understanding and findings in computational bioscience. The meeting provides an
opportunity for researchers from very different disciplines to form new
collaborations and research programs. The proposed ?Women in Bioinformatics?
initiative at ACM-BCB 2011 promotes broad participation from underrepresented
groups in this important event and help develop the 21st century workforce in
the computer science, biological science, biomedical science and other
interdisciplinary areas.
