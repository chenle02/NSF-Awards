9314366 Madsen This project will investigate theoretically and experimentally
the effect of a rippled seafloor upon bottom current velocity and direction,
using a flume with triangular bars to simulate sediment ripples. The PI argues
that "since currents are primarily responsible for transport of sediments and
(of) biota suspended by agitation of waves, quantitative understanding of the
characteristics of near bottom flows is essential for prediction of near bottom
transport processes in inner shelf waters." ***
