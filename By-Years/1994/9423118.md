Questions concerning population origins and affinities associated with the
colonization of the Pacific have long held the fascination of anthropologists,
archaeologists, and linguists: the colonization of the Pacific has been
described as one of the great adventures and accomplishments of humans. Despite
this intense interest in the story behind the settlement of the Pacific, many
questions remain open concerning the source, number, and timing of migrations to
various parts of the Pacific. This project will employ the latest molecular
techniques to follow the genetic trail of ancient migrations out into the
Pacific from Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The group has had great success in
discerning the movements and origins of Polynesians and their precursers, and
more will follow with this intensive laboratory study.
