Two projects in observational cosmology will be carried out. One project is the
continuing exploration of the large-scale structure of the universe, as
delineated by the distribution of galaxies. A large redshift survey in the north
and south galactic polar caps will be used to explore volumes approximately 500
megaparsecs across. Of particular interest will be the structures in which
galaxies occur, the properties of large voids in space, and the largest scale on
which the universe is inhomogeneous. Attention will be given to the question of
whether galaxies are, indeed, reliable tracers of the mass distribution in the
universe. The second project is the study of the evolution of stellar
populations in galaxies during the last half of the age of the universe. An
attempt will be made to establish whether the evolution which has been shown to
occur in the members of compact clusters of galaxies is characteristic of all
galaxies, or is instead, the result of some process internal to the clusters.
The properties of galaxies in several different environments will be used to
test for an environmental dependence of evolution. The properties of nearby
spherical (SO) galaxies will be examined to ascertain if they represent the end-
point of the observed evolution of galaxies.
