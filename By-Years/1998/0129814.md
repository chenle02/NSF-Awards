01-29814&lt;br/&gt;Edwards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed project is a Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) which will take advantage of a cruise of
the Australian icebreaker RSV Aurora Australis in October 2001 to investigate
the concentration of biologically active iron in the sea ice and its snow cover.
Sea ice acts as a natural depository for wind-borne dust, but there is currently
no reliable information on the magnitude of this source of iron for the
production of phytoplankton in the upper layers of the Southern Ocean. Simple
flux calculations suggest that this may be the dominant source, and up to three
times as large as all other sources combined. The objective of this research is
to evaluate both the concentration and bioavailability of iron in the seasonal
sea ice of the Southern Ocean south of Australia. Sample data, when combined
with other sea ice observations and sea ice drift models will greatly enhance
our knowledge of antarctic iron biogeochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
