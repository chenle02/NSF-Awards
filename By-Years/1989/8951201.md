The Physics Department will introduce computers and modern microprocessor based
instruments for physics laboratories. These instruments include mechanics,
interferometer and electrostatics systems along with computers and software.
This instrumentation will affect thirteen experiments in six subject areas of
both calculus and non-calculus based physics courses. In addition, two sites
will be equipped as centers for computer-assisted laboratories. These centers
are geographically located to serve the majority of physics students. The
College will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
