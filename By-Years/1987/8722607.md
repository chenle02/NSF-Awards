This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Mark Rood, University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Hans Christen Hansson, Lund Institute of
Technology, Sweden. The primary objective for this proposed research project is
to develop an instrument that can be used to measure simultaneously the
hygroscopic, chemical, and thermal characteristics of aerosol particles under
in-situ conditions and with a short time response. Information about the aerosol
particles hygroscopicity, composition, and thermal volatility will be obtained
by this instrument as a function of particle size. Professors Rood and Hansson
will utilize their individual expertise to develop components of the instrument
and then they will integrate the individual components to assemble a complete
aerosol sampling system. No instrument exists that can simultaneously study the
hygroscopic and thermal properties of an aerosol as a function of particle size.
Such instrument can be used to perform atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric
physics, and air pollution control technology related experiments.
