This project will address fundamental questions about how cells respond to and
manage newly misfolded and aggregating proteins. Proteins are folded into
specific shapes that confer function; however, through aging or stress, proteins
can undergo misfolding and can aggregate. This change in shape due to misfolding
and aggregation can alter the function of the protein. The goal of this project
is to understand how the cell initially responds and manages these newly formed
aggregates. This project will have broader impacts by providing training
opportunities for non-traditional groups in STEM, specifically by integrating
underrepresented minorities and first-generation students in transformational
research experiences. Additionally, the PI will continue to provide accessible
research experiences to students at a rural institution, many of whom are first
generation, through an inquiry-based laboratory course focused on protein
aggregation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify the cellular
mechanisms that move and sequester newly formed protein aggregates in both space
and time using a powerful suite of tools that pair microscopy, genetics, and
biochemistry. Experiments will determine how cytoskeletal networks contribute to
the trafficking of different types of aggregates within the cell, and how
aggregates are sequestered over time. Taken together, this project will provide
a mechanistic understanding at the molecular level of how the cell manages newly
formed aggregates and reveal conserved pathways that ensure a proper response in
the presence of stress or age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
