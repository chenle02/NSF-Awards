0104112&lt;br/&gt;Petrova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses some
problems in transport equations, Godunov &lt;br/&gt;type central schemes for
hyperbolic conservation laws, classical and &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear approximation.
The common thread that runs through the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research is the use
of techniques from approximation theory, &lt;br/&gt;harmonic and functional
analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet &lt;br/&gt;decompositions, maximal
functions, interpolation and K-functionals) to &lt;br/&gt;prove analytic results
in other areas of applied mathematics and to use &lt;br/&gt;these techniques to
develop numerical methods. Particular emphases will &lt;br/&gt;be placed on
several issues: development of a satisfactory theory for linear
&lt;br/&gt;transport equations in several space dimensions which arise when
&lt;br/&gt;linearizing the nonlinear problem, development of Godunov type
central &lt;br/&gt;schemes for solving multidimensional systems of conservation
laws, and &lt;br/&gt;application of these schemes to various problems and
models. Extensions &lt;br/&gt;of averaging lemmas to go from microscopic to
macroscopic formulations &lt;br/&gt;will also be of primary concern. A portion
of this project will address &lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions in nonlinear
approximation and multivariate &lt;br/&gt;cubature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
areas under discussion (nonlinear approximation, analytical properties
&lt;br/&gt;of solutions to transport equations and development of effective
numerical &lt;br/&gt;methods for their computation) are of significant practical
interest. The &lt;br/&gt;applications include image processing, statistical
estimation, fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics, geophysics, meteorology, astrophysics,
multi-component &lt;br/&gt;flows, ground water flow, semiconductors, and
reactive flows.&lt;br/&gt;
