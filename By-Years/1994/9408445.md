9408445 Abello The problem of supporting interprocessor communication in
massively parallel computers raises two competing issues. To avoid bottlenecks
in memory access, it may be necessary to perform hashing; i.e., to randomize the
mapping of memory addresses to their physical locations. On the other hand, it
is usually more efficient to access long contiguous blocks of memory than a
random set of individual memory locations, and therefore it is desirable to
preserve the physical locality of memory addresses. The study of the tradeoffs
between these issues has only recently been initiated. However, several
mathematical techniques have emerged as possible approaches for the extension of
this research. This research plans to exploit these techniques to develop a
robust theory of locality and randomness with applications to the complexity
theory of parallel computation. ***
