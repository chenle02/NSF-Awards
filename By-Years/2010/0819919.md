The proposed work will support the research of the Center for High-Performance
Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) by using its tools for mapping algorithms onto
reconfigurable hardware. The algorithms to be tested are the preprocessing and
feature extraction portion of automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms. The
objective of the proposed work is study the computational complexities
associated with hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms when applied to ATR. The
proposed research will allow investigation of application areas that are not
supported by the current CHREC industry members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will provide access to cutting edge tools for mapping signal
processing algorithms onto reconfigurable hardware. This set of skills is
becoming more prevalent in the telecommunication and defense industries. The
proposed research will be performed at a Historically Black College/University
(HBCU), and will utilize undergraduates who are underrepresented in the STEM
fields and give them with exposure to research activities. &lt;br/&gt;
