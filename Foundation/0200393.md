These research projects address problems in the model theory of differential
fields and the model theory of the field of real numbers with exponentiation.
The model theory of differential fields is a fascinating area requiring a
sophisticated mixture of ideas from stability theory, differential algebra and
algebraic geometry. The work of Buium and Hrushovski has shown that these ideas
have important consequences in Diophantine geometry. In particular, the
principal investigator will study the model theoretic behavior of solution sets
of families of algebraic differential equations. This line of research on the
model theory of the field of real numbers with exponentiation is expected to
concentrate on the relationship between global solutions to differential
equations at infinity and formal solutions in the field of logarithmic-
exponential series.

Model theory is a branch of logic that explores mathematical structures such as
the real numbers together with their arithmetic operations and ordering
relation, analyzing the degree to which the basic rules or axioms for a
collection of objects and their operations determine the shape of that
collection. The methods and results of model theory are cast in terms of
definable sets and functions, where a construction is definable exactly when it
can be expressed by first-order logical formulas in the language of the
structure. Model theoretic methods for the field of real numbers with
exponentiation have been remarkably successful in proving new results on the
geometry of exponential varieties and sets defined from them. This work has
already found applications in asymptotic analysis, control theory, microlocal
analysis, and neural networks. The model theory of differential fields has had
significant applications in number theory.
