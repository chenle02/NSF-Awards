This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a carbon isotope ratio analyzer based on Off-Axis Integrated Cavity
Output Spectroscopy to measure the ratio of the isotopic abundances of 13C to
12C in exhaled breath. The compact analyzer will serve as a medical diagnostic
instrument and will operate in a point-of-care setting. The instrument combines
robust telecommunications-grade diode lasers with Off-Axis ICOS, an innovative
technology that provides extremely long optical paths (several kilometers
typical) for ultrahigh sensitivity. The instrument will be inexpensive, portable
and easy to use and report measurements of 13CO2/12CO2 with sufficient
sensitivity and precision to replace mass spectrometry in 13C-labeled breath
tests for diagnosis of several diseases. Prior Phase I work has successfully
demonstrated a laboratory instrument with a precision of 0.24 per mil (0.024%)
in less than 6 minutes. In Phase II, a prototype instrument capable of
autonomous operation, will be developed and tested in on-going clinical trials.

The commercial impact of the project will be significant, as the proposed
instrument will aid in quick diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases at the
doctor's office, thereby enhancing rates of patients' compliance with treatment
regimens.
