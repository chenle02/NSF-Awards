This proposal will investigate the possibility of devising a novel separation
process for separating two materials (in a solution) from each other. The
possibility of such separation depends on the diffusion properties of the two
components in a special thermodynamic state known as metastable region. Funds
are requested for measuring and studying these diffusion properties and for
conducting exploratory theoretical and experimental studies on the possibility
of separating the components. Separation problems such as the one chosen here
for study are very common and are frequently encountered in a wide variety of
practical situations including recovery of high-value metals from solution,
distillation, purification of biological products, and removal of toxic metal
ions from liquids. Devising novel separation techniques to deal with such
situations will have a significant impact on the efficiency and, possibly, the
economics of processing operations.
