This project explores a general theory of membership growth and political
position-taking by interest groups. The theoretical model represents the
interaction of many individuals and interest groups in a large political
landscape. The driving force in the model is the extent to which interest group
entrepreneurs adapt to and interact with prospective members. The central
research questions concern the evolution of an interest group system in which
several groups may form and compete for members while attempting to accumulate
resources with which to influence political outcomes. The groups compete with
one another by altering their policy positions, the magnitude of their
recruiting efforts and other attributes of the group. The model looks for
patterns of stability while manipulating many of these parameters. The research
uses a combination of formal models and computational modeling. A computer
package called SWARM, developed at the Santa Fe Institute is used to conduct the
simulations. These simulations are used to generate hypotheses about group
positions and membership and how these affect when individuals will join and
stay in interest groups.
