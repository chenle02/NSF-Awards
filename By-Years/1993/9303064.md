This grant is for a conference held yearly at the Aspen Center since 1985. This
grant speaks to the one week, in January, when the subject will be "Particle
Physics from Supercolliders to the Planck Scale". Encompassed within that broad
range will be sessions on high energy physics at present and future colliders,
and recent formal developments in superstring theory and related fields. The
participants will be exposed to topics certain to expand beyond their usual set
of professional activities. This grant's goal is to "cross-fertilize" the formal
and phenomenological communities.
