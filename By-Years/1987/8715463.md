Very little data exists on the static and dynamic behavior of cable-stayed
bridges. This project, in conjunction with the Virginia Department of
Transportation will instrument a cable- stayed bridge to observe the dynamic
characteristics of the bridge during construction and, subsequently, in a
completed condition. The data will be very useful to bridge design engineers.
