Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, Conceptests and
Screencasts are being developed in support of six fundamental courses in
chemical engineering: material and energy balances, fluids, heat transfer, mass
transfer and separations, chemical engineering thermodynamics, and chemical
reaction engineering. Conceptests are multiple-choice questions that are used in
class with student-operated clickers, for interactive learning through
discussion with peers and instructor feedback. Similar to problems on concept
inventories, Conceptests typically cover fundamental topics that are often
misunderstood by students. In addition to their use as in-class exercises,
Conceptests can be used for online quizzes covering assigned reading that
students complete prior to class or they can be used for homework or exams in
the course. Screencasts are short screen captures of material with narration by
an instructor such as mathematical solutions to problems, mini-lectures,
training on using new software, or discussion of strategies for solving
Conceptests. Screencasts are available online and provide students with
additional instructional support when they need it and not just at defined class
times or office hours. The results from this project are being rigorously
assessed through formative and summative measures to determine their impact on
student learning. The Conceptests and Screencasts are available over the
Internet and project results are being broadly disseminated through a variety of
venues.
