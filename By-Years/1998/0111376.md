The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
University of California San Diego. With the award, Professor William Trogler
will study different methods such as photochemistry, chemical reduction,
electro-polymerization and thermal polymerization to prepare new layered
polymeric materials based on carbon diselenides, which will be free from
elemental selenium. Doped thin films prepared from poly (carbonselenide)s will
be studied for electrochemical, electronic conductivity and chemical redox
properties. Complexation of cadmium with poly (carbondiselenide) at the surface
would produce cadmium selenide nanoparticles and quantum dots with unique
optical and electronic properties for potential applications in devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New polymeric materials based on carbon selenides and
cadmium selenide quantum dots with electronic and photonic properties will be
prepared. Synthetic methods to prepare poly (carbondiselenide)s free from
elemental selenium and physical methods to characterize these materials would
provide basic science knowledge for the future development of new electronic and
photonic materials. Doped thin and flexible films of carbon diselenides would
have unique electronic and photonic properties for applications in devices. The
research, in addition, will provide training to graduate students in electronic
and photonic materials. &lt;br/&gt;
