Visual pigments provide the molecular machinery to capture the energy of light
for detection by photoreceptors of the eye. Differently structured proteins in
the different pigments confer best sensitivity to different wavelengths of
light, and so to different colors. We know a great deal about color vision in
primates, but whales and dolphins also are reported to use color vision and we
know very little about their visual adaptations to a predominantly blue
underwater world. This project uses molecular biology techniques to explore the
visual pigment proteins, called opsins, that are used in dolphin vision.
Determining the genetic sequence for these opsins will provide useful data for
comparisons with terrestrial mammals and with deep-sea fishes, to see what ways
visual pigments may have evolved adaptively to capture the predominant spectral
energies in the marine environment. Results from this work will be important not
only to visual science, but to better understanding of cetacean biology, the
diversity of marine organisms, and evolutionary biology.
