This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will study
a.c. thin-film electroluminescent (ACTFEL) devices to gain a clearer
understanding of the theory of electronic device operation. In addition, this
new knowledge about light generation mechanisms will lead to the improved design
and performance of flat electroluminescent display panels. Two ACTFEL areas will
be examined by this study: the investigation of the mechanism in blue emitting
ACTFEL devices and an analysis of the hysteretic effect in yellow emitting
ACTFEL devices. This comprehensive study of charge transport and luminescent
devices will significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly
minority institution. The principal investigator is a competent scientist with
several technically sound publications in luninescence field research. Faculty
and students working on this project will strengthen their research skills and
knowledge in electroluminescent display technology.
