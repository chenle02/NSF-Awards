9351879 Ghosh The departments of biological sciences, chemistry, geology and
physics in the College of Science at Marshall University, a predominantly
undergraduate institution, plan to expand students' laboratory experiences with
modern scientific instruments in instructional laboratory work and supervised
independent research. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer, with graphite
furnace and mercury/hydride accessories, along with appropriate lamps, will be
used by students in experiments where quantitative determination of elemental
concentrations at extremely low levels is needed. This instrument will benefit
students in new and existing courses, will allow new opportunities for
undergraduate research, and in terms of cost to benefit ratio, will be the most
valuable instrument in the College of Science. ***
