The design and geometric processing of free form curves and surfaces can be
greatly facilitated by gaining an understanding of their visual appearance. For
example, the concepts of convex and spiral shapes link the visual appearance of
a curve to its synthesis and processing and thus can be used to develop
effective techniques to improve the use of curves in a computer environment. The
project develops further definitions to categorize free form surfaces based on
shape properties and develops these into useful techniques for the design and
processing of surfaces. These techniques will have a common mathematical basis
and this will help to merge the design and engineering of parts.
