A laboratory is being established for measurement and process control combining
four disciplines--electronic, water/wastewater, pulp and paper technology, and
physics. The laboratory is equipped with self-contained workstations designed
for hands-on applications of the measurement, control and troubleshooting of
pressure, flow, level, temperature, heat exchangers, and analytic process loops.
Experiments involve mechanical, physical, chemical, electronic, pneumatic,
measurement, mathematical, spatial relations, and abstract reasoning
disciplines.
