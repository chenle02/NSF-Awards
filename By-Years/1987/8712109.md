Most color maps are produced with little consideration of the color
deficiencies that exist among map users. Professor Olson will design maps using
display colors that are suitable for people with a red-green color deficiency
and test their efficacy with both color- deficient and normal viewers. Her
research will yield insights into the design of maps and other visual displays
for color-deficient and normal maps users, and will advance theories of map
perception and use.
