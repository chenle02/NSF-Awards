Malony 9457530 This NYI proposal lies at the heart of the HPC software crisis:
the performance evaluation and optimization of software developed for high-
performance, parallel computer systems. The central theme of the research is
that the challenge of maximizing the productivity of HPC software developers can
be best addressed by an aggressive integration of sophisticated tools for
program and performance analysis into an HPC programming environment. There are
four research focus areas that will be actively pursued with this grant:
parallel performance visualization; performance prediction and extrapolation;
knowledge-based automation of performance diagnosis and tuning; and language-
based parallel program analysis environments. The plan for each area is to
establish the fundamental principles and techniques, build prototypes tools for
evaluation, integrate the tools into program development systems, and test the
benefits of the research in real HPC application environments.
