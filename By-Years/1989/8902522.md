This project studies important open problems in each of several domains of
theoretical computer science: circuit complexity, simulating randomness,
parallel computation, computational and combinatorial geometry, and
computational number theory. These problems are related in that they can be
attacked using similar mathematical methods. For each topic, progress is
expected either by generating more efficient algorithms for the tasks in
question, or by providing lower bounds that highlight features of the underlying
structure.
