This research program considers the generation of a tsunami (a long wavelength
ocean wave) by an earthquake along the Aleutian chain, the propagation of the
tsunami across the Gulf of Alaska, and the runup on to the coastline. The
solution is effected through a comprehensive computer model. The project
involves a collaboration between the University of Alaska's Institute of Marine
Science, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans' Institute of Ocean
Sciences, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's
Tsunami Warning Center at Palmer, Alaska. Emphasis is given to the final stages
of tsunami propagation, namely the runup on the shoreline, and the backwash.
Special consideration is given to the hydrodynamical, mathematical, and
numerical difficulties connected with the discontinuity between the wet and dry
domains, nonlinearity, friction of the propagating wave with the ocean bottom,
and computational instability. The aim is to develop a robust two- dimensional
runup model which can be used to predict reliably the extent of runup along
Alaskan and Canadian shores. This basic information is particularly valuable for
tsunami warning and prediction, and is critical for the populated areas around
Valdez, Seward, and Homer.
