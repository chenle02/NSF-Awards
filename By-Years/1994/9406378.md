9406378 Meyer This research is to analyze a unique 30-Gbyte, 70-site seismic
data set as a result of 1991 and 1992 deployments, supported elsewhere, of
portable digital-recording three-component long- and short-period seismographs
in coherent arrays in central Russia. These arrays covered representative parts
of the Siberian craton, the Baikal uplift, the Baikal Rift, and the mountains
and steppes south of the lake extending into Mongolia. This will be a
coordinated joint analysis between the Institute of the Earth's Crust, Irkutsk,
and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Questions to be answered are is the
Baikal Rift today a passive or an active tectonic feature, and perhaps, what was
it at its inception? The results will be compared with other Cenozoic
seismically-active rifts, for example Kenya and Rio Grande, being studied today,
using the same tools and methods. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
