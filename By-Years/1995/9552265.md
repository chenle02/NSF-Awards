This project provides improvement of a semiconductor manufacturing laboratory
that provides industry-specific microelectronics education for undergraduates.
To this end, the Electronics Technology Department is obtaining three pieces of
semiconductor wafer testing equipment and a vacuum leak detector. While geared
in the main toward Electronics Technology students and Core Electronics
students, the laboratory affords new capabilities for crossover electives and
in-depth projects for students in advanced courses in Manufacturing Technology,
Automation, Robotics, Telecommunications, Computer Maintenance, Drafting and
Design, Information Processing, and Industrial Management. With high technology
used to teach high technology, the semiconductor manufacturing lab emulates
current trends in industry and provides the students with the higher skill
levels required for success in this increasingly complex field. The new
equipment is programmable, process-critical equipment that allows students to
make wafer tests and measurements usually exclusively limited to small numbers
of engineering students at 4-year degree schools. They produce, from the first
wafer cleaning to the final electrical test, in real time in a controlled M 4.5
(Class 1000) environment, integrated circuits that differ from those produced in
commercial fabs only in their geometries.
