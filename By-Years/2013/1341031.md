The project team, composed of campus administration, computer scientists and
domain scientists, is working to bring 100 Gbps networking, an improved Science
DMZ, and improved network research and development capabilities to the UNL
campus. This serves projects at the Holland Computing Center (HCC), which
provides centrally managed computational research resources and expert personnel
for the support of hundreds of computational scientists across the state of
Nebraska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal team is upgrading UNL's network
capacity to 100 Gbps to Internet2 from the Great Plains Network in Kansas City
to HCC's Lincoln data center. This provides greatly enhanced access to HCC's
existing high performance computing as well as over a petabyte of high-energy
physics data for U.S. CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
driver for increased network bandwidth is the "Any Data, Anytime, Anywhere"
project, led at UNL, which enables unorganized data analysis to individual U.S.
CMS physicists through remote data access. Additional areas of work benefiting
from the improvement include: Brain Imaging and Analysis, Next Generation
Sequencing, Traffic Engineering, the Open Science Grid and MobilityFirst Future
Internet architecture. The project aligns well with other local network
research; for example, allowing greater WAN bandwidth to be dedicated to
projects such as Lark, a prior CC-NIE award focusing on integrating the network
and computing layers. This also funds hardware improvements to the local Science
DMZ for monitoring (perfSonar-PS) and security (Bro IDS).
