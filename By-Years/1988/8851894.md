The acquisition of state-of-the-art instrumentation for under- graduate
laboratories in Cell Biology is correcting this department's deficiencies in
areas of functional biology. The acquisition of a dismembrator, a centrifuge and
a refrigerated circulator allow for the isolation of cellular organelles; the
electrophoresis unit and spectrophotometer -- the characterization of organic
compounds; the clean bench, shaker, incubator and chromatography refrigerator --
the isolation and maintenance of cell cultures. The new equipment and
instrumentation are making it possible to place needed emphasis on modern
biotechnology and functional biology. Improved laboratories in Cell Biology are
increasing student success in these courses and enhancing their readiness for
professional pursuits. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with
more- than-equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
