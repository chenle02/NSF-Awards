This project is directed at the development of robust trust region methods for
the solution of constrained nonlinear optimization problems. Problems of
particular concern include a robust global convergence theory, the
characterization of algorithms that identify the optimal active constraints in a
finite number of iterations, second order correction methods and a mathematical
theory for parallel techniques of computation.
