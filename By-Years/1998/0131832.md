This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Malcolm H. Chisholm at the Ohio State University
to investigate two aspects of the dinuclear chemistry of molybdenum and
tungsten: 1) The activation of multiple bonds in nitriles, alkynes and
dinitrogen in their reactions with compounds having M-M multiple bonds, and 2)
The preparation and characterization of linked dimers of dimers, cyclotetramers
and mesogens containing M-M multiple bonds. Particular emphasis is given to
establishing the kinetic and thermodynamic factors that control the metathesis
reactions in which multiple bonds are exchanged between dinuclear complexes and
those in nitriles, alkynes and dinitrogen. In the second project specific
attention is given to dinuclear compounds with bridging carboxylate linkers.
Single electron oxidized and reduced species will be prepared and examined by
epr spectroscopy to evaluate the electron delocalization. The thermotropic
mesophases of the dinuclear complexes doped with paramagnetic complexes will be
studied by magnetic resonance in order to establish the alignment of the
columnar phase and he localization or delocalization of the paramagnetic site.

Complexes with two metal atoms will be investigated for their reactivity with
small molecules with multiple bonds and for their ability to form novel
supramolecules and materials.
