0327760 Lu

This three-year US-UK cooperative research project in computer programming
involves Lunjin Lu and his students at Oakland University and Andy King of the
University of Kent in Canterbury, United Kingdom. NSF financial support will
cover the costs of annual visits by the US investigator and his students to the
United Kingdom to implement the joint research. The investigators propose to
develop a new framework for logic program analysis. The research focuses on (1)
designing, implementing and evaluating backward logic program analyses and (2)
developing program analyses that provide useful information in program debugging
and compilation. The US principal investigator and his British colleague have
worked together previously on backward analyses for logic programs. In
continuing their efforts, they propose to demonstrate the framework's
applicability to new programming environments.

The US investigator brings to the collaboration expertise in the fields of logic
programming and semantic-based program manipulation. This is complemented by Dr.
King's expertise in theoretical computer science, in particular programming
language research. Their findings will help improve software development
environments for logic programming.
