Soil aggregation (the arrangement of pore spaces and solid matter in soil) is a
critically important process in natural and managed ecosystems, affecting a wide
range of soil and ecosystem functions and biota. Management practices and
erosion threaten soil structure on a national and global scale. Fungi, and in
particular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), are of great significance in soil
aggregation. However, there is little known about of the basic biological
characteristics of AMF in relation to soil aggregation. This research tests
several fundamental biological (physiological and architectural) characteristics
of AMF for their relationship with soil aggregation. It is hypothesized that
there fungal traits correlate with soil aggregation across a number of fungal
species. The research also places soil aggregation in the context of other
functions carried out by these symbiotic fungi, and investigates how different
species of fungi can interact in maintaining stable soil aggregates. An aspect
of the educational component of this research is participation of graduate
students and PI in the Montana Teachers Investigate Ecology program, a
partnership with Western Montana High School teachers.
