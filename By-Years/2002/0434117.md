As sensors become more active and produce increasing amounts of data, real-time
processing and exploitation of this data on the sensor platforms themselves
becomes more important. Such on-board processing supports autonomy, helps reduce
bandwidth requirements, and provides a means for in-theater processing,
coordination and exploitation. The research goal is to develop an Adaptive On-
Board Data Processing (AODP) system for planning and executing processing
operations in a secure, distributed real-time environment. Research will focus
on the development of autonomous internetworking capabilities to support
situational awareness of processes, as well as the development of user-friendly,
robust processing and exploitation tools. Such work will lead directly to an
agent based approach for on-board tasking, analysis, exploitation, dissemination
and communications interoperability among sensors, an approach that is in
keeping with true self awareness, self organization and autonomous behavior. The
proposed research is expected result in significant advancements in the design
and application of flexible but robust sensor networks. Key work will be in the
representation of the processes running within this network and how human users
can define and interact with them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
