The objective of this research is to develop visualization-based decision
support tools that can be used effectively in collaborative design environments
to make multiobjective decisions under uncertainty and to enable rapid trade-off
decisions in the context of rapid virtual prototyping. Methods to model and
visually represent the uncertainty involved with multidimensional and
multiobjective design problems will be developed. Because many collaborative
design problems are driven by limited resources, tools for effective rapid
virtual prototyping will be developed. Quantitative and qualitative models of
coupling relationships on component and system level objectives will be
developed in order to better asses tradeoffs between resources such as time,
money, and quality. Data mining techniques will be used to efficiently condense
and filter relevant decision making information. Lastly, these techniques and
tools will be implemented in web-based decision steering tools to allow
collaborating designers to visualize design spaces, products, and tradeoff
information simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of
this research will include a foundation for the use of scientific visualization
to make tradeoff decisions in collaborative product design environments.
Further, the benefits will also include establishing the efficacy of using
visualization-based tools to support various forms of decision making
(multiattribute, with limited resources, collaborative, or under uncertainty).
This foundation and subsequent tools have the potential to impact not only the
engineering sector, but any scientific field where decision making is of
paramount importance.
