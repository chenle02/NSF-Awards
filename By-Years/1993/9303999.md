The proposed investigation includes research into Ricci-flat manifolds with
Euclidean volume growth, heat equation methods with adiabatic limit techniques
for investigating spectral properties of differential operators. Tian will
continue research into extremal Kahler metrics and their moduli. There are
intended connections with gauge theory and general relativity.
