A major goal of the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric
Regions) programs is an understanding of global ionospheric-thermospheric
coupling. The equatorial region is of major interest in the overall
understanding of the global picture. This project proposes to carry out
extensive coordinated observations centered around the ALTAIR, an incoherent
scatter radar located in the Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall island. The experiments
would include an HF/UHF frequency- agile radar on Kosrae, East Coroline Island
and an optical facility (Fabry-Perot interferometer and all-sky low light level
image) on Wake Island. The science studies will center around observations of
electron drift in the equatorial electrojet, and the vertical F-layer motion.
Much of the first year observational data base will be acquired during an
extensive NASA rocket campaign scheduled for the summer of 1990.//
