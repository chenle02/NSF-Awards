Evidence from psychology and anthropology, together with advances in
evolutionary theory, suggest an array of testable hypotheses about cross-
cultural variations and similarities in standards of physical attractiveness.
This project will study criteria and consequences of physical attractiveness in
the United States, among Ache Indians in Paraguay, and among urban and rural
people in Brazil. The project will test several current hypotheses about
physical attractiveness: (1) There are universal criteria of physical
attractiveness related to age; (2) the features considered attractive in a
population are those closest to the mean for that population, and (3) selection
may act to increase physical variability within populations via assortative
mating and between populations via preference for exaggerated features. The
results of this research will help understand how standards of physical
attractiveness develop and the implications of this development for current
human variation.
