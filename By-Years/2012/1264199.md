This project aims to document and describe the grammar, lexicon, dialectal
variations, and a variety of performance and speech genres of Belizean Mopan, a
Mayan language spoken in the Toledo district of Southern Belize. Despite
increases in Mopan populations, Mopan is a severely endangered language because
younger community members are no longer speaking the language. The data are to
be documented and analyzed to allow for: evaluation of Belizean Mopan's
relationship with its Yukatekan sister languages; data sets for Proto-Yukatekan
reconstruction; analysis of culturally specific linguistic functions, such as
the role of sound symbolism in discourse; the comparison of the effects of
English contact on Belizean Mopan with Spanish contact on Guatemalan Mopan; and
the creation of cultural and intellectual resources for future generations. This
study will contribute to a better understanding of Belizean Maya and to
strengthening the ethnic identity of its speakers and call more public attention
to and appreciation of the modern Belizean Mayan people, culture and language.
This project will also contribute to the scientific training of a promising
scholar.
