NSF Workshop on Database Research in the Era of Information Infrastructure The
objective of this planning workshop is to discuss issues of current concern
regarding database research. Participants are selected from a broad range of
database interests and viewpoints, including both industrial and academic
research. Additional participants are chosen to represent important related
areas, such as the artificial intelligence, information-infrastructure, and
computer architecture communities. Issues of concern include the role of
databases in the information infrastructure, the relationship of research to
industrial database requirements, and the likely impact of new research
directions. Following the workshop a report of conclusions will be written and
widely disseminated, including on-line world-wide access. ***
