Is there a fundamental set of rules by which we can design and analyze portable
algorithms for locality and/or efficiency? This project continues work towards a
model of parallel computation that captures locality for wide classes of
parallel computers. Theoretical tools are developed that can be applied to gain
a better understanding of the following: (1) Parallel Algorithms --- how to
design and analyze architecture independent generic algorithms capable of
exploiting abstract-locality for wide classes of parallel models; (2) Calculus
of Architectures --- how to develop a calculus that, given such a generic
algorithm, identifies necessary and/or sufficient characteristics of the
parallel models for which the problem can be solved with prescribed levels of
abstract-locality and/or efficiency; (3) Parallel-Performance Limitations ---
how to discover those levels of abstract-locality, speedup, and efficiency which
cannot be, or are highly unlikely to be, achieved by any such parallel
algorithms for a given problem. These tools are tested by applying them to
design and analyze portable algorithms, and to prove parallelism limitations,
for fundamental combinatorial problems.
