Iben 9417156 Stellar modeling calculations will be performed on a variety of
phases in the lifetimes of certain classes of stars. These are well-observed
cases which have not yet been modeled nor explained satisfactorily. They include
low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, stars with 9 to 11 solar masses, white
dwarfs in the late stages of stellar evolution, symbiotic variable stars,
cataclysmic variable stars, and mass transfer in close white dwarf-helium star
binaries. ***
