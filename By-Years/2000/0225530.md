Objective-Oriented Mobile Heterogeneous Sensor Networks
for&lt;br/&gt;Coordinated Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on
a comprehensive study of large, mobile ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable networks
for coordinated control, using coordinated&lt;br/&gt;autonomous flight as a
guiding example problem. State estimation&lt;br/&gt;provides a link between
control and communications which admits&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous sensors, that is
the combining of dissimilar or&lt;br/&gt;different accuracy data using concepts
which underpin data&lt;br/&gt;fusion. Management of complexity and preservation
of design principles&lt;br/&gt;are keys to the development of workable, tunable,
mission-oriented&lt;br/&gt;systems with many
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this collaborative
research proposal hinges&lt;br/&gt;on the drawing together of cognate and
disparate elements from&lt;br/&gt;coordinated control, dynamic state estimation,
ad hoc network&lt;br/&gt;management, resource assignment, and fault tolerance.
Its aim is to&lt;br/&gt;provide a formalism in which the methods of sensor
networking may be&lt;br/&gt;integrated as part of a systematic design process
focused on achieving&lt;br/&gt;a specific control objective. This provides a
framework for the&lt;br/&gt;development of methodologies for embedding a sensor
network in a&lt;br/&gt;context of control performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this research is that it ties together tools
and&lt;br/&gt;techniques from distinct areas using concepts of
information&lt;br/&gt;quality. The team is multi-disciplinary across a gamut of
Systems&lt;br/&gt;Engineering and the problem area impacts a range of
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems in the individual areas of specialization. This
linkage&lt;br/&gt;across communications, control, networking and estimation is
a&lt;br/&gt;perceived bottleneck of current design techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
