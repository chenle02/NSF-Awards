Work will be continued on the trapping of antiprotons. Using the LEAR facility
of CERN, antiprotons are decelerated and cooled, then trapped in a Penning trap.
Long confinement time and near freedom from perturbations in the trap will be
exploited to make precision measurements of the ratio of the proton and
antiproton masses, providing one of the highest precision tests of CPT
invariance. An intense source of cold antiprotons will be developed. It is
suggested that it may be possible to make usable amounts of antihydrogen by
allowing cold trapped plasmas of positrons and antiprotons to recombine.
