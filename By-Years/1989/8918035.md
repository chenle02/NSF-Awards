A major controversy presently exists over whether extended continental
lithosphere, associated with extensional basins and passive continental margins,
possesses mechanical strength (or flexural rigidity). This work will: (1)
provide a critical examination of the assumptions and methods used in previous
studies that concluded that extended lithosphere has negligible strength, (2)
investigate the sensitivity of gravity anomalies to variations of flexural
rigidity as a function of time since extension, and (3) determine the mechanical
strength of the Exmouth plateau margin of northwest Australia.
