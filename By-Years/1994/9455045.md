Wireless information networks are taking an expanding role in the world's
telecommunication infrastructure and interest in wireless communications is
growing faster than ever. It is important for schools of electrical engineering
and computer engineering to prepare their students for careers in this important
discipline. This project offers a short course suitable for electrical
engineering undergraduate faculty interested in developing a wireless
Communication Systems Laboratory at their home institution. Twelve faculty will
be instructed through a series of lectures, discussion, experimental work, and
one computer simulation in various topics essential to developing a wireless
communications laboratory and sample projects. This project builds upon a
laboratory developed via an Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement grant.
