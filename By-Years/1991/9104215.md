This is a project to develop a morphological genetic map of embryo lethal
mutations of Arabidopsis thaliana. There are a large number of genes involved in
embryo development and the objective of this project is to map 100 mutants that
have been accumulated in Dr. Meinke's laboratory. The value of having a genetic
map will increase as an increasing number of laboratories are working with
embryonic lethal mutants. This work will provide a valuable resource of mutant
genes with known map locations, and the resultant map will provide a guide to
assign each new mutation to complementation groups. In addition, the work
contributes to the world-wide effort of developing a high density genetic and
physical map of Arabidopsis.
