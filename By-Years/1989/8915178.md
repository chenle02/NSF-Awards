This project is a collaboration between a chemical engineer and a physiologist,
to develop new chemical systems to encourage nerve regeneration. This involves
fundamental research in determining what substances cause nerve growth, and in
building synthetic polymer substrates capable of supplying such substances when
implanted into the human body. Similar basic research will focus on the problem
of fusing cell membranes, so as to reconnect nerve systems. If this work is
successful, it would have major medical benefits; furthermore, it might possibly
be a step towards future work more relevant to the central nervous system, a
topic which is difficult to work with but could involve very large long-term
benefits to humanity.
