This engineering education research project seeks to understand how students'
emotions play key roles in both learning engineering and their development of a
professional identity. There is increasing evidence that emotion impacts
learning, yet these connections are not yet well understood. By examining
connections between emotions and learning, this project will inform the design
of engineering degree programs which can connect scientific, technical, and
social knowledge for the students and will design future solutions to societal
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arise from how the research on emotion and learning can be used by
educators to create better learning environments for engineering students. The
project will also help students to better connect knowledge and adopt effective
learning strategies. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for
addressing societal challenges through engineering.
