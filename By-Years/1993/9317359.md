9317359 Quarmby The goal of this proposal is to analyze the signaling pathways
in Chlamydomonas, a unicellular, biflagellate alga. Chlamydomonas exhibits three
behaviors that all involve increases in Ca++: these are phototaxis, mating and
flagellar excision. The ultimate objective is to understand the mechanisms by
which different stress stimuli are transduced to flagellar excision, while other
stimuli, such as light, result in the change of swimming behavior and not in
flagellar excision, even though all these pathways appear to involve Ca++ in
signaling. The proposal has two objectives. The first is to isolate and
characterize excision mutants of C. reinhardtii to test the hypothesis that low
pH activates a signaling pathway that is different from the signaling pathways
activated by the chemical inducers of flagellar excision. The hypothesis for
such a dual pathway is supported by physiological and pharmacological data, but
a genetic analysis will verify the existence of independent signaling pathways
leading to a common response. Mutants will be generated by insertion of
exogenous DNA and selected for signaling defects. Heterocaryon analysis will be
used to study the relationship of selected mutants. The second objective is to
use Ca++ flux and electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that activation of a
Ca++ channel is a key event in low pH induced flagellar excision. Dr. Quarmby
has strong circumstantial evidence that influx of Ca++ that is stimulated by
decreasing pH is necessary for acid-induced flagellar excision. %%% The research
objectives chosen by the PI provide a powerful experimental system to study how
different signals elicit the same response, and how the different signals that
use Ca++ elicit distinctly different physiological responses. Because it is
presently thought that the fundamental mechanisms of such signaling pathways
have been conserved throughout evolution, results of these studies will be
instrumental in our understa nding of how intracellular communication takes
place in living organisms. ***
