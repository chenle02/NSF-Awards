Northeastern Illinois University will conduct a two-year program for twenty-
four secondary teachers in the Chicago Public School system. The project has a
special minority focus that includes participants working with thirty gifted and
at-risk ninth grade Chicago students using a clinical format at the well known
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora. Mathematics subject areas
for enhancement will include combinatorics with applications in probability,
mathematical modeling, and geometry with three-dimensional modeling. The
pedagogical component features pattern recognition, problem solving, and the use
of technology. The in-service component will be led by three Presidential
Awardees; Northeastern Illinois University, the Illinois Mathematics and Science
Academy, and the Chicago Public Schools have contributed an amount equal to 20%
of the National Science Foundation request.
