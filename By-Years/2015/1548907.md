Understanding the outcomes associated with R&amp;D funding requires accurate
linking of funding with the papers produced by the funded work. This proposal
develops a methodology to accurately link grants with topics, an important
challenge for the development of a rigorous, quantitative understanding and
analysis of science policy. The research will provide methods to accurately and
consistently identify coherent research areas and systematically link those
topic areas to research funding and research output, such as scientific
publications, using text and other features. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability
to accurately link grants and topics in a consistent way would be an important
advance in the usefulness of STAR METRICS data. In addition to developing a
methodology, this project also establishes the accuracy of existing NIH grant-
to-article linkage data, and develop grant-to-article linkage data for non-NIH
grants -- data which are not readily available. More accurate grant-article and
grant-topic linkages will facilitate other research and be important to the STAR
METRICS platform.
