93-53657 Durig Rural Minority Teacher Research Program The South Carolina EPSCoR
Program proposes to implement a Minority Teacher Research Program through the
NSF/EPSCoR Experimental Systematic Initiative Program. Sixteen high school
teachers selected from rural, minority schools will be selected to participate
in EPSCoR-related research projects for six weeks during the summer at the
University of South Carolina and Clemson University. Activities include team or
individual research projects, weekly seminars, development of instructional
materials and experiments to take back to the classroom, and oral presentation
of their research results at a mini-symposium. The research projects offered
through the Rural Minority Teacher Research Program will be directly related to
the research projects of the ninety-seven NSF/EPSCoR Research Cluster faculty.
Systemic and potential long term impacts include the transfer of new knowledge
to the classroom; the potential for recertification or graduate degree credit;
access to curriculum materials and other resources and information provided by
the universities; and the interface to the funded South Carolina AMP Program and
the (pending) South Carolina Statewide Systemic Initiative. A plan for
monitoring and assessing the Program is described. Dissemination will occur via
a mini-symposium, AP press releases, and the South Carolina EPSCoR Newsletter
distributed to South Carolina's twelve public colleges and universities, twenty-
one private and professional colleges, sixteen technical colleges, school
district offices, selected elementary and secondary schools, and the South
Carolina Department of Education.
