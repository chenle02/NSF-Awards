The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics of Northwestern
University will purchase workstations which will be dedicated to support
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects concerning the dynamics of nonlinear partial differential
equations and applications, including in particular: . Advection by a dipolar
vortex couple in the presence of small diffusion. . The numerical computation of
pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers. . The influence of noise and
quenched disorder on the growth of spatial structures.
