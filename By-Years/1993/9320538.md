9320538 Barbari This proposal is on research to study structure-function
relationships for gel impregnated porous membranes. A polymer gel is covalently
fixed inside the pores of a thin ultrafiltration membrane to form a composite
membrane. Membrane synthesis conditions will be related to flux and selectivity
for diffusion of two proteins. Also, a method to improve selectivity by
chemically modifying one surface of the composite will be investigated. ***
