Dr. Kemp has a pioneering program in construction of small molecule models that
permit better understanding of the chemistry and structure of peptides and
proteins. This project, which is in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program, should lead to better understanding of biological interactions at the
molecular level which could lead to very important industrial consequences.
Current theories of protein folding postulate that regions in the amino acid
sequence that have a high probability of assuming specific secondary structures
act as nucleation sites for further folding. Moreover, many interactions of
receptors with peptide hormones or proteins with posttranslational modifying
enzymes appear to involve beta-turns at the site of recognition. In this work,
analogs of amino acids are to be synthesized which are more rigid than the
natural amino acids and which stabilize the several types of turns, pleated
sheets and alpha-helices when attached to peptide chains. The emphasis is on
demonstrating that the turn, sheet, and helix templates that have been prepared
actually assume the proposed structures when attached to simple peptides. A
variety of tests for conformations of these simple hybrids are proposed to
establish this latter point. Second generation templates that can be used to
test further hypotheses will be synthesized and studied. In subsequent studies
the proven templates for secondary structure are to be incorporated
semisynthetically into proteins at key folding regions. In a related effort,
analogs of some of the peptide hormones are to be prepared, using the turn-
templates as structural elements. With these studies, the object is to enhance
the binding at the receptor site as well as to protect the hormone analog from
proteolysis. The long-range objectives of this study are thus the construction
of hybrid peptides and proteins with properties that are not realizable with the
natural amino acids.
