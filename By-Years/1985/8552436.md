This research is concerned with statistically based computer-aided design and
manufacturing of VLSI processes and circuits. Due to the complexity of VLSI
circuits, the design cycle must contain a design verification feedback loop. In
a fully automated design system (e.g., silicon compilers), several verification
tools (e.g. design rule checking, logic simulation) may be unnecessary because
the system produces correct designs. However, there exists a need for IC
performance evaluation prior to IC manufacturing. Circuit simulation is the most
powerful and widely used technique for performance verification. The accuracy of
such a verification depends strongly on the accuracy of the device model
parameters used in the simulation. These model parameters can be determined by a
process simulator which contains physical models of the IC fabrication process
steps and semiconductor devices. The objective of the research is to develop
efficient techniques for process/device simulation and apply them to a number of
design tasks such as nominal design, worst-case design and statistical design.
