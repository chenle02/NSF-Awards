The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable next-generation engineered optics
employed in augmented and virtual reality (AVR) devices. Engineered optics
manufacturers currently deposit polymeric thin films and imprint and cure them
with transparent molds and UV light. Such polymeric films often have high costs
and sub-optimal optical performance. Novel high-index materials are required for
device miniaturization and increased field of view. This project will provide
AVR manufacturers with cost effective methods to fabricate high refractive index
transparent photonic devices that would otherwise be impossible or cost
prohibitive to manufacture by methods currently
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will expand the knowledge base of high-index, UV-curable
precursors that can be used for engineered optics. UV-curable polymeric-
nanoparticle composite materials represent the current state-of-the-art to
produce optical waveguide components for augmented and virtual reality (AVR)
applications. These coatings often suffer from low-optical transmission,
increased haze values, high coefficients of thermal expansion, and low-indices
of refraction. This project develops UV-curable, inorganic films that exceeds
the standards of currently used materials. This research project will focus on
elucidating correlations between precursor formulation and film processing to
control film thickness, refractive index, and optical transmission. The proposed
research objectives will reproducibly demonstrate materials with controlled
optical performance that that meets or exceeds the current state-of-the-art and
establish a pathway for manufacturers to achieve device
miniaturization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
