Foreman's work is in two directions: ergodic theory and combinatorial set
theory. In ergodic theory he seeks to characterise the complexity of various
classes of ergodic measure preserving transformations, using the tools of
descriptive set theory. In combinatorial set theory he is continuing a program
of applying reflection principles and Shelah's PCF theory to study classical
problems in infinite combinatorics.

Foreman investigates the phenomenon of apparent randomness in physical systems
that are deterministic in nature. A system can be deterministic in the sense
that the behavior of any particular individual (particle) in that system is
completely determined (perhaps by some differential equations), but on a macro
level, any measurement made shows random behavior. Many systems in nature have
this kind of paradoxical properties. Foreman's other line of research considers
difficult combinatorial problems asked by people such as Erdos in the 1960's
that remain major questions in the 21st century.
