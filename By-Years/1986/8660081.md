This is a Phase I SBIR award to develop an inexpensive pose sensor to act as
part of a robot control system. The sensor is part of a calibration system that
improves the accuracy of the robots trajectory at its end position and
orientation (pose). The object of this research is to enable robots to be
programmed off-line, in a CAD/CAM system.
