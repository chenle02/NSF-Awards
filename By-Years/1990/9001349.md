The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss the recent
findings and current thinking in various areas of science. Although
participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established
scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these
areas and postdoctoral fellows. They are held in small, isolated New England
towns away from other distractions and conducive to the exchange of ideas. These
conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in
research and also indicating the future trends which are likely to be most
productive.
