This award will enable Dr. Huseyin Abut, San Diego State University, to
collaborate with Dr. Oguz Manas, Aegean University, Izmir, Turkey. They will
study applications of vector and matrix quantization to image coding, image
classification, image enhancement, and recognition problems in digital signal
processing. They will also establish a signal processing graduate course and a
laboratory in Izmir. The researchers' goals are to extend linear prediction
theory to include low-rate image coding and image classification problems. They
will reformulate autoregressive analysis and windowing techniques to cover
multidimensional signals. They propose to use information from the
multidimensional signal studies to do image coding below 0.5 bits per pixel, and
to apply vector and matrix linear prediction concepts to image classification
and segmentation problems on which there has been relatively little research.
The tools of digital signal processing developed in this research have
applications in studying speech, seismic activity, imaging and machine vision,
and in designing aids for the handicapped. This award will help the researchers
continue their collaboration on image classification and recognition using
vector linear prediction coefficients.
