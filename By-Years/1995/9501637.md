9501637 Fujimoto This award provides support for infrastructure at Georgia
Institute of Technology in the form of three distributed laboratories where
individuals at geographically distinct locations can interact with each other
on-line using powerful, distributed computational tools, to solve shared
problems. The infrastructure will include a multi-granular compute server and
ATM switch, a video server with high-performance multi-media workstations, and
network equipment. The research topics to be explored include interactive
steering, distributed simulations, collaborative systems; large-scale community,
ATM and wireless networks.
