In this project of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometalic Chemistry
Program, Michael T. Pope of Georgetown University will investigate the chemistry
of polyoxometalate species. This research is directed towards developing and
controlling the reactivity of metal oxygen cluster anions in polar and nonpolar
solvents. Such polyanions are viewed as models of metal oxides and offer
possibilities for deeper understanding of the heterogeneous catalytic activity
of oxides. Surfaces of large polyoxotungstate(VI) and molybdate(VI) anions
containing 12 - 40 metal atoms will be activated by the introduction of lower-
valent metal cations and by reduction in certain cases to yield metal-metal
bonded cluster domains. These species will be investigated with regard to their
atom- and electron-transfer reactivities. %%% Potentially catalytic compounds
containing metal ions and oxygen atoms will be developed. These compounds are of
interest because they are wholly inorganic, and thus should be quite robust
under catalytic conditions. Moreover, because of their large size and variable
composition, these compounds provide a wealth of fascinating information about
how metal ions "communicate" in close proximity.
