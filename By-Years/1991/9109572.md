A promising model to study the neural mechanisms of motor plasticity is
conditioned response learning which is a simple form of associative learning.
The eye-blink reflex has been widely adopted for physiologic studies of the
mechanisms of conditioned response learning. Recently, a significant advancement
in the study of the conditioned eye-blink has been made. Using the in vitro
brainstem-cerebellum preparation from the turtle, the neural correlates of the
conditioned eye-blink response can be generated entirely in vitro. Thus the
cellular mechanisms underlying this type of motor learning will be more
accessible for study than has previously been achieved using whole animal
preparations. As an initial step in studying the mechanisms of acquisition and
execution of learned motor responses in vitro, the goals of Dr. Joyce Keifer
are: 1) to examine sites of convergence of conditioned and unconditioned
afferent inputs using activity-dependent dye uptake and extracellular
recordings; and 2) to assess which of these sites of convergence are essential
to the generation of the conditioned response using reversible lesions. These
highly exploratory studies will provide a significant advance in our
understanding of the cellular bases of synaptic integration underlying motor
control learning, which is of global relevance to processes fundamental to
behaviorally adaptive motor control.
