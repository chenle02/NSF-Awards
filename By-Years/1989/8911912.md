Recent studies in the areas of protein trafficking, growth factors, and tumor
growth have suggestd an important link between lysosomal enzyme secretion and
cell growth. As a long term approach toward understanding this link, this
laboratory has been examining lysosomal protein trafficking and function in
mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Previous studies have shown that synthesis and secretion
of lysosomal, mannose 6-phosphate-containing proteins are regulated in these
cells under various conditions of cell growth. These proteins include "MEP", the
major excreted protein of transformed fibroblast cell lines, and proliferin, the
major serum-induced protein secreted by untransformed fibroblasts. On the basis
of their patterns of regulation, it appears likely that extracellular forms of
these proteins play important roles in the process of normal cell growth. These
proteins may participate directly in the growth process by acting as autocrine
or paracrine growth factors, or indirectly through modification of cell surface
receptors or components of the extracellular matrix. The proposed studies will
involve characterization of the synthesis and trafficking of proliferin, and
examination of the function of MEP and proliferin as growth regulators or
modifiers of the extracellular matrix. Functional studies will involve the use
of antisense RNAs and other inhibitors to inactivate MEP and proliferin in
growing cells. The results of these studies should increase our understanding of
how and why lysosomal trafficking is regulated during cellular growth, and, in
turn, how lysosomal proteins released from cells may be involved in cell growth
regulation.
