A geometric transition structures, "Moth Eye" for use as optical absorbing
surfaces will be developed and tested. These surfaces are used inside optical
instruments to reduce scattered light. A more effective surface will be obtained
by giving emphasis to finishes that can be practically manufactured and which
utilize fabrication techniques that give rugged and durable surfaces. These
finishes will applied to curved interior surfaces using a sputter-etching
cathode method utilizing three different classes of material: a low index
dielectric, a semiconductor, and a pure metal.
