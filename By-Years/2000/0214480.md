This Small Business Innovation Research Project proposes to use silicon
microfabrication techniques to produce new silicon spotting pins that will be
used for the preparation of microarrays. Microarray technology has rapidly
spread into many diverse areas of biological research. The preparation of a
large portion of these arrays is accomplished by direct contact printing using
high precision metal spotting pins, which are individually machined at costs up
to $400 each. Using straightforward silicon microfabrication techniques,this
company has prepared prototype silicon spotting pins, holders and transfer
devices for the preparation of microarrays whose performance characteristics are
expected to far exceed those of current state-of-the-art devices. Advantages of
silicon spotting pins over machined metal components include 10-100 fold higher
dimensional tolerances, less than 1% of the weight (lighter pressure gives more
uniform spots), tip hardness, the ability to chemically modify the SiO2 surface
of the pins to control wetting and liquid uptake/release, higher pin density in
array (higher spot density in microarray), more precise volumetric uptake into
pin, lower surface friction (ease of sliding movement in holder), resistance of
tip to bending damage and the ability to fabricate complex features not
obtainable by traditional machine shop fabrication. Since the parts will be mass
produced, it is estimated that a hundred to a thousand fold reduction in cost
per pin would result.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of DNA microarrays.
