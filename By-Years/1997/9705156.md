DMS 9705156 INFERENCE AND COMPUTATION IN MULTI-LEVEL MODELS Carl Morris and
David van Dyk Harvard University Summary Hierarchical and multi-level methods in
statistics (Bayesian and otherwise) have become ever more prevalent in modern
statistical practice, as better computational tools and computational advances
make these powerful methods more tractable. This research will extend the theory
and computation for hierarchical models in general, and especially for versions
of them that seem promising for practical applications, as suggested partly from
the investigators' experience with them for medical quality assurance, meta-
analysis, image processing, traffic engineering, and for other situations. The
investigators will study and develop procedures for fast fitting of exponential
family models, of generalized linear models, and of multivariate models. They
will work on making inferences and on foundations. They will study and evaluate
diagnostic methods needed to assess the modeling assumptions made for the
(second level) distributions that govern the individual parameters. Operating
characteristics and risk functions are to be calculated. Mindful of the
computational burden of these methods, the investigators will seek good
mathematical approximations and the efficient implementation of these more
precise, computationally intensive methods. While multi-level models are still
new, they are the focus of much research because their applications and
potential applications abound in scientific, engineering, commercial, medical,
and governmental contexts. Applications of hierarchical models have been and are
being made to image processing, agriculture, genetics, health services, and to
many other areas. For example, the Principal Investigator's past research has
included using and adapting multi-level statistical models to extract more
accurate information from satellite imagery data by having the t wo levels
represent separately the measurement error distributions and the uncertainty
about the ground truth. The investigator also has used these models to assess
more accurately, from non-experimental traffic data, whether specified highway
safety improvements actually reduce accidents. Two-level models are needed
because direct treatment-control comparisons made without them tend to be biased
when safety improvements have been made mainly at high hazard locations. Concern
for these and other applications of multi-level models motivate this research,
which is aimed at advancing their proper use and at optimizing their
computational efficiency.
