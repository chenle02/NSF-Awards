This grant provides equipment to be used in conjunction with a high-speed, large
memory computer system which will be dedicated to ongoing projects of active
research in image processing, visual information processing, pattern
recognition, and electrical communications. The system will provide essential
computing capabilities to these research activities which are not presently
available from any computer facilities within the University. It will also form
a network to substantially enhance three existing, fully operational research
laboratories in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Rutgers University.
This will allow for research efforts of significant substance not at all
feasible with available equipment. The enhanced system will accommodate the
central processing unit's intensive computational demands we well as accommodate
the large mass storage requirements.
