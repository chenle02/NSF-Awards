The proposed study is part of an ongoing research program on factors that
restrict life histories of marine organisms. Among benthic marine animals,
alternative modes of reproduction are planktonic dispersed embryos versus
protected benthic embryos. Therefore, the presence or absence of benthic
embryonic development commonly has consequences for dispersal, recruitment, and
mating, with further consequences for the distribution, abundance, and genetics
of animals in benthic populations. Benthic egg masses and brood masses vary
greatly in form; patterns of variation may convey important information about
environmental requirements, but the causes and consequences of this variation
are not yet established. Brooding and other forms of protection for benthic
development may be limited by embryonic requirements for transfer of oxygen from
the surrounding water or the removal from the embryo of diffusible substances to
the water. This research will test: (1) dependence of development on supply of
oxygen and (2) models of exchange by diffusion or by interstitial flow.
Indications of restrictions on development in benthic egg masses and the
consequences of these constraints will be examined by comparative and
experimental approaches that use representatives of several major groups of
benthic marine animals.
