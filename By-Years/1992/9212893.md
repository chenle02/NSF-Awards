Arveson will investigate several areas of non-commutative analysis involving
von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, quantized index theory, and the role of
the non-commutative spheres of Bratteli, Elliott, Evans and Kishimoto in
numerical quantum mechanics. The research will involve the index theory and
classification theory of semigroups of endomorphisms of factors, the structure
of the C*-algebras associated to such semigroups, and the properties of
C*-algebras associated with the discretized canonical commutation relations. The
general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of
algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
