This award will enable Dr. Jerry D. Johnson from the University of Wyoming to
collaborate with Dr. Barry G. Rolfe at the Australian National University,
Canberra, Australia. They will investigate what properties enable the symbiotic
bacteria Rhizobium to colonize a broad range of plant hosts including soybean
and the non-legume Parasponia. Experiments will be conducted to determine the
structure and organization of the individual genetic units responsible for
induction of nodule formation on the roots of the host plants. The study of
genetic functions involved in Rhizobia- host plant specificity is important for
fundamental understanding of bacterial-plant interactions with broad
implications for plant health and productivity. Dr. Johnson is currently working
on the Frankia group of bacteria, which together with Rhizobium, accounts for
most of the bacteria-plant symbiotic relationships capable of reducing molecular
nitrogen. Dr. Rolfe's lab is well-suited for sophisticated studies in molecular
genetics and has done extensive work with Rhizobium.
