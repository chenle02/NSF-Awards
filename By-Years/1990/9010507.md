The principal investigator with his collaborator S. Kwapien will study new
methods for comparison of sums of independent random variables, martingale
difference sequences, subordinated sequences, and other dominated sequences. The
techniques that will be employed exploit the concepts of tangency, decoupling
and hypercontractivity. These methods are applied to study of continuous time
stochastic processes and single and multiple stochastic integrals.
