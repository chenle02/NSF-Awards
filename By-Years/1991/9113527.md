The principal investigator together with graduate students will work on several
statistical problems in genetics and molecular biology. Many of the questions
concern the different kinds of maps of the human and other genomes. A number of
these maps require statistical methods for their compilations; others have
errors and biases which are best quantified and dealt with in statistical terms.
A further class of questions to be addressed concern the use of molecular data
in systematics and in evolutionary theory more generally. Again statistical
models and methods play an important role, both in helping elucidate
phylogenetic relationships, and in expressing the strength of support data lends
to competing theories. Many of the techniques required for dealing with these
questions have aspects which have not featured prominently in Statistics
hitherto.
