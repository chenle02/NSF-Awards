Over the last three years, our NSF funded program let to a number of significant
results in the areas of short wavelength laser spectroscopy, laser materials,
and laser plasma interaction. For the first time we used inner shell
photoionization of molecules to generate new, excimer like molecular states. It
was demonstrated that the laser produced plasma excitation technique can also be
used to promote new chemical reactions to form molecular ions. These results
will have decisive impact on future schemes of molecular short wavelength
lasers, plasma chemistry, the spectroscopy of inner shell excited molecules, and
even the understanding of dense molecular clouds in the neighborhood of quasars.
Another highlight of our program was the investigation of high intensity
phenomena in laser- materials interaction and the production of sub-100 nm lines
polymers by direct ultraviolet laser ablation. The proposed program for the next
three years focuses on three new ideas. The time is now ripe to undertake
experiments towards photoionization pumped ionic excimer lasers. In this project
we will bring together the progress on photoionization pumping of atomic short
wavelength lasers pioneered by one of the investigators. The second project will
focus on investigating the possibility for new UV and VUV excimer like solid
state lasers. The objective is to combine the efficiency and tunability if
excimers with the compactness and relative simplicity of solid state lasers.
Finally, we will explore a new idea to produce gain in dissociating molecules in
a proposal we call the disomer (or disoplex) laser scheme. Such amplifiers would
be universal for all dissociating molecular states and would have unsurpassed
bandwidth for the amplification of pulses in the 10 fs range.
