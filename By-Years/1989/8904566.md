The objective of this proposal is to provide travel costs for three speakers to
participate in a symposium on Fertilization to be held as a part of the 5th
International Congress of Invertebrate Reproduction in Nagoya, Japan, July
23-28, 1989. The speakers in this session will describe current work on
echinoderms, echiuroids and ascidians covering frontier research on biochemistry
of egg envelope formation, molecular basis of sperm-egg binding, receptors for
egg activation, transduction of ionic signals into metabolic responses and the
enzymology of sperm passage through the egg coat. %%% This Congress is unique in
looking at reproduction in the invertebrate phyla and brings together
researchers from around the world. The opportunity provided will lead to
important dissemination of information and to further research insights about
fertilization in particular and development in general in important invertebrate
model systems.
