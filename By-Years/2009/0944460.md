This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
product that enables automated access to any relational database via the web - a
web-browser for non-technical users; XML/JSON/CSV for more technical users who
wish to use the data in their own applications. The system will first
intergotate and determine a database's contents and allow the owner to select
access levels. Researchers can then interact with the data or share references
to data sets with a URL. The key innovation is a systematic scheme for
automatically mapping any relational database into a set of URLs. Successful
completion of this project will liberate valuable data trapped in research
systems for collaboration and analysis.

While tools exist for web-enabling specific databases, most are designed for
database administrators or developers. The Prometheus Internet Database Server
will target non-technical users who need to focus on research instead of
technical problems. Unlike existing solutions that are designed for specific
products, Prometheus' system will be based on open source technology for use
with data sources of unknown type and quality. As a result, researchers and the
general public can utilize the Internet to access and disseminate disparate data
that is currently stored in multiple databases - a task that cannot readily be
accomplished by currently-available products.
