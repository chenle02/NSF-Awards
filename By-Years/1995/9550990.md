This addresses curricular needs by designing experiments to use computer-
controlled spectrophotometric instrumentation in the undergraduate laboratory at
all levels, for both majors and nonmajors. This enables students to receive the
desired exposure to these methods through hands-on use. Two different types of
spectrometer are being used. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) instruments are
being used heavily in organic chemistry and to a lesser extent in analytical
chemistry courses. The second type is a modernized emission spectrophotometer
based on an existing spectrophotofluorimeter. This is being used for emission
measurements in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum. This
spectrometer also serves as a detector in a Raman spectroscopy experiment. The
fluorescence spectrometer is being used mostly in general, physical, and
analytical chemistry laboratories. Both types of spectrometer allow ready
spectral subtraction and database searching and bring the advantages of signal
averaging and easy manipulation of spectra. The fluorescence data system also
allows the determination of kinetic parameters from time-varying data Both types
of instrument are being integrated into the laboratory courses serving chemistry
and chemical engineering majors at all levels from general chemistry to senior
research.
