This oceanographic instrumentation acquisition project will allow the
construction of new transducer arrays and purchase of electronic spares for the
University of Hawaii's SEAMARC II side-scan sonar system. The new
instrumentation will augment that already in a pool of shared use equipment that
is made available to users of the institution's research vessel. The SEAMARC II
is an acoustic seafloor survey system that simultaneously produces both high
quality sonar images of the sea bed and bathymetric contour charts along a swath
of the seafloor. An acoustic array is towed behind a research vessel at speeds
up to 10 knots while on board computers produce near-real time displays of
seafloor morphology. Such data is on interest to geologists and geophysicists
studying plate tectonics, mid-ocean ridges, continental margins and other
research topics sponsored by the NSF. Cost-sharing is being provided by the
University of Hawaii.
