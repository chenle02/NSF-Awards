This REU Site award to Georgia Southern University (GSU), located in Statesboro,
Georgia, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the
summers of 2023-2025. Housed at GSU's Department of Biology, the unifying theme
involves the impacts of global climate change stressors on organisms and
ecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The goal is to engage undergraduates
in research and professional development activities that promote an
understanding of the unique biological resources occurring in this geographic
region as well as their sustainable use and management. Students will
participate in hands-on research guided by faculty mentors, as well as in
professional development workshops targeting general and conceptual knowledge in
the ecology of the coastal plain, scientific communication skills (oral and
written), techniques for locating and evaluating primary literature, and ethical
practices in science. Student recruitment is targeted at 1st and 2nd year
(freshman and sophomore) students attending institutions where research
opportunities may be more limited, such as at 2-year colleges and primarily
undergraduate institutions. Students will be required to register in the NSF
ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their
career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will conduct research on how
stressors impact organisms and ecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain while
learning field and laboratory skills that are broadly relevant to ecosystem-
level scientific investigations. Many will present the results of their work at
scientific conferences. The goal is to foster an environment for learning and
professional development that leads to opportunities in graduate studies and
careers in science. Assessment of the program will be done through the online
SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to
determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic
email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
