The American Chemical Society (ACS) requests funds to support a two-year Young
Scholars program involving twenty-five secondary school students each year at
the following institutions, chosen for their accessibility to high-ability,
minority students: Drury College, Northern Arizona University, Montana College
of Mineral Science and Technology, the University of Texas at El Paso, and
Florida International University. Five students will attend the program at each
university each summer; therefore a total of fifty students will be involved
over the two-year period. The program will consist of an eight-week summer
chemical research experience for the students, providing a comprehensive
experience in scientific research that also includes instruction in scientific
methods and an exploration of scientific ethics. Research chemists will serve as
role models for the students, encouraging them to pursue careers in chemistry or
related sciences. Follow-up programs will involve students and preceptors
traveling to an ACS Regional Meeting or the annual meeting of the Society for
the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science and presenting their
work during a poster session, as well as monthly meetings of the students and
preceptors, either on Saturdays or after school.
