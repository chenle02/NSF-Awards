The proposed work will develop a three-dimensional model of the scoliotic spine.
The curvature and length will be determined from radiographs, and the material
properties will be initially obtained from published literature. The model will
then be used to predict the correction expected by a given surgical procedure
employing a certain number of fixation sites (where the spine is attached to a
rigid rod to correct the scoliosis). The simulation results will then be
compared with data obtained from post operative radiographs. The project will
lead to the development of a theoretically oriented biomedical engineer with
excellent ties to the clinical world; and if successful, it may also result in
the reduction of the number of fixation sites used for the operative procedure.
