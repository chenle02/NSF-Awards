The principal investigators will study interatomic potentials as applied to the
computer modelling of silicate materials. The potentials that are developed will
be tested with molecular dynamics simulations of the elastic properties of high-
pressure phases. They also will be applied to the high-pressure melting of
silicate minerals, the shock wave behavior of minerals and melts, and the
evaporation of silicates and oxides in relation to the accretion of early solar
nebula.
