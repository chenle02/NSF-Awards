The spatial pattern of pollen dispersal in insect-pollinated plants affects
both plant reproductive success and the rate at which novel or introduced genes
will spread through plant populations. Currently however, there is a lack of
ability to combine information about pollinator movement and pollen deposition
to make quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal. The proposed research
will develop quantitative tools for predicting gene flow in plants using partial
differential equation (P.D.E.) models of pollinator movement and pollen
deposition. Field experiments designed to measure the effect of plant spatial
arrangement on pollinator movement behavior will be conducted using the mustard
Brassica campestris and its three major insect pollinators. The results of these
experiments will then be used to build P.D.E. models of insect movement.
Additional experiments will utilize a marker gene to measure the rate of pollen
deposition as pollinators visit a sequence of mustard plants. Finally,
information about insect movement and pollen deposition will be integrated to
generate expected pollen deposition patterns for a variety of plant
arrangements. The expected patterns will be compared to the observed dispersal
of a marker gene in field experiments conducted by Drs. Peter Kareiva and Robin
Manasse at the University of Washington. The results of this study will be
important in understanding the spatial structure of genetic neighborhoods and
the effect of plant density dispersion on plant reproductive success, and in
predicting and controlling the spread of introduced genes.
