This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student
studying gender relations in Sweden. Although Swedish society has outstanding
laws on the books dealing with gender egalitarianism in the workplace, Swedish
society remains strikingly segregated by gender in fact. The student will
interview female students, professionals at the beginnings of their careers, and
mature professionals about life- history experiences that influenced them to
choose their professions. The student will also interview parents, friends,
spouses, teachers, and other relevant individuals to try to understand the
reasons why women choose their occupations. This research is important because
government policies often mandate egalitarian social outcomes that are not
achieved in practice. Understanding the non-governmental causes of gender
segregation in a society that has the most advanced laws known in the
industrialized world can help planners devise programs to attain the goal of
equal opportunity.
