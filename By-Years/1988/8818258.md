Base isolation, under certain conditions is an attractive strategy for
mitigation of the efforts of earthquakes. At this time, worldwide interest in
the concept is at a very high level. This research project directs its efforts
toward developing quantitative data for use in a design methodology for
selection of base isolation systems for use in structures. The research uses
previously developed quantitative research results as a fundamental data base.
The results of the research will be applied to typical structures in order that
the design methodology of system selection system and structure response and
system construction considerations can be established for use in the final
design process.
