This award supports Professor Slawomir Kwasik and a graduate student of Tulane
University to collaborate in mathematics research with Professor Bjorn Jahren
and others of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Oslo, Norway.
They will study the relationship between algebraic K-theory and pseudo-isotopy
of manifolds, and they will apply new methods employing Waldhausen's A-theory to
study various geometric questions concerning the topology of manifolds. They
will also use gauge theoretic techniques to gain a new insight into the pseudo-
isotopies of low-dimensional manifolds. The research is strengthened by the
experience of Dr. Kwasik in the more geometric aspects of pseudo-isotopy theory
but relies primarily on the expertise and new approach developed by Professor
Jahren. Recently introduced mathematical techniques have provided powerful tools
to perform specific algebraic calculations. This has led to a surge of interest
in research in the above areas. Significant progress has already been made in
the algebraic aspects of these theories, but work is just beginning in the
geometrical side. Indeed the strongest centers pursuing this research are in
Northern Europe, and the proposed collaboration with a Norwegian group will
provide access to the latest research developments for Dr. Kwasik and his
student. Another attractive feature is the involvement of two well regarded
Polish mathematicians who have made contributions to the same area of
mathematics. They plan to synchronize visits to Norway with Dr. Kwasik. This
will provide to US investigators insights and links to Eastern European workers
in this field.
