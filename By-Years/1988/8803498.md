The research concerns the following general problem. For cuspidal
representations of the general linear group over number fields and arbitrary
complex numbers, the principal investigator will consider the problem of
determining whether or not the L- function of the representation tensored with
Hecke characters of the number field of finite order evaluated at the complex
number can vanish. Questions related to this one and applications to other
problems in number theory will also be considered. The Principal Investigator is
working in the general area of the so-called Langland's program, a program which
relates two different looking types of functions with the goal of obtaining deep
number theoretic consequences.
