Auditory performance in tigers, the biggest of the big cats, has not been
documented in the scientific literature, although claims of extraordinary
hearing attributes are legendary in anecdote. The purpose of this project is to
examine the hearing and vocal capabilities of the tiger to lay the foundation
for the development of acoustical tools for use in conservation. Is the tiger an
auditory specialist, an animal that has evolved special hearing attributes that
give it an advantage in the wild, or is it a generalist fitting predictably into
its auditory niche? A non-invasive set of tools including sound elicited brain
potentials will be used to evaluate hearing. Sound measurements in the
infrasonic range (frequencies lower than those available to humans) will be used
to determine if tigers are able to produce calls containing energy in this
range. The working hypothesis is that tigers specialize in low frequency hearing
to communicate over large distances. This project will set the stage for the
development of 1) studies designed to more thoroughly understand the role of
hearing and vocalization in the diverse communities inhabited by tigers, 2)
acoustic census protocols designed to more effectively account for free-ranging
tiger populations, and 3) acoustic tools designed to deter tigers from
encroaching on human habitats, thereby reducing poaching. The tiger is regarded
as a flagship species representing the critical need for the conservation of
wide-ranging ecosystems including the coniferous, mixed-deciduous forests of
southeastern Russia and the thick tropical rainforest of Sumatra. When combined
with a comprehensive outreach and educational program designed to impact the
public and students at all levels, this project will call attention to the
plight of the tiger. Consequently, a major educational goal is to use the high
profile nature of the tiger to leverage the conservation of ecosystems inhabited
by these seriously threatened big cats.
