Thomas H. Heaton&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0208494&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
examining the effects of fault opacity (the tendency of reflected phases to be
trapped in the hanging wall of the fault) on radiated energy by constructing
models of P and SH body waves from shallow thrust fault earthquakes at
teleseismic distances. Three-dimensional finite-element models are used to
calculate rupture history assuming a variety of friction models. These slip
histories are used to calculate the teleseismic body waves that results from the
different friction models. Systematic differences are determined between these
dynamic models and traditional dislocation models that are commonly used for
determining seismic moments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal is to quantify
how teleseismic P and SH body waves from dipping faults are affected by near-
source interactions between the seismic waves and a dynamically slipping fault.
It has been common practice to estimate seismic moments by modeling these
teleseismic waveforms using double-couple source representations. In these
models, the medium is modeled as an elastic continuum with displacement jumps
caused by distributions of double-couple body forces. While these models satisfy
all boundary conditions within a continuous medium, they are not necessarily
compatible with the frictional stress boundary conditions on the slipping fault
(a discontinuous medium). In particular, shear waves that reflect off of the
Earth's surface are generally allowed to propagate back through the slipping
fault without reflection; this is sometimes referred to as a transparent fault.
There is a long-standing question about whether or not systematic errors in
determining earthquake sizes have been introduced by using transparent fault
models. This study should provide quantitative estimates of the importance of
this effect.
