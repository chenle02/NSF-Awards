This special project is supporting the transition of NSDL's core community and
technical services from a centrally provided model to one that is more
distributed in nature. Activities during this transitional period are designed
to ensure the stability of the key technical and social infrastructure required
to develop, maintain and operate NSDL, and to ensure its successful
dissemination and adoption in a variety of educational settings. Such
connection, coordination, and interoperability functions bring together
disparate systems, practices, and disciplinary worlds of NSDL stakeholders into
a larger, cohesive operational library, resulting in software, collections,
processes, partnerships, policies, and standards. Appropriate documentation is
being created and archived; and efforts are being undertaken to preserve
existing partnerships, associated resources, community wisdom, and networks
built over time so that they can be strengthened during NSDL's next phase of
activity.
