This research project is to develop efficient dynamic mesh-adaptation strategies
for the numerical simulation of evolutionary problems arising from physical
science. Mesh adaptation is an indispensable tool for use in mesh-based
numerical simulation in science and engineering. Its basic idea is to put more
mesh nodes in regions of large solution variation than those where the solution
is smooth. In this way, fewer mesh nodes are required to reach a specified level
of accuracy and thus significant economies are gained. Dynamic mesh adaptation
is a type of mesh adaptation which moves mesh nodes around to follow the dynamic
features of the physical problem. Its continuous nature in time makes a dynamic
mesh-adaptation method the natural choice of method for use in the numerical
solution of evolutionary problems.

The proposed research focuses on improving the efficiency of dynamic mesh
adaptation. Topics of study include the investigation of time integration of
partial differential equations on moving meshes, the development of the Schwarz
waveform moving-mesh method, and the development of simple and efficient solvers
for mesh equations. All studies will be targeted on evolutionary partial
differential equations arising from liquid-crystal models and phase-change
problems. These problems have many important industrial applications and have
attracted considerable interest among scientists. Successful completion of this
project will provide a powerful tool for studying the formation of solution
singularities and the propagation of moving interfaces arising from these
problems. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research project.
Students' training will benefit from large-scale computations as well as
theoretical studies.
