9730683 Ginsburg Columbia University plans to design, develop, evaluate, and
disseminate mathematics program, "Investigating the Big Ideas" for 4 to 5-year
old children. At the core will be a two-year sequence of explorations and
learning activities aimed at extending and elaborating on pre-schoolers'
informal mathematical interests and abilities, and developing their
understanding of core mathematical concepts in an enjoyable and exciting way.
Although the materials will be designed for all children, this project will
ensure that they are effective with low-income children in nursery school, day
care, Head Start, and kindergarten settings. The project will also develop
guides for teachers, caregivers, and parents. These ancillary materials will
include videotaped demonstrations. The materials will be produced over a four-
year period, with an eye towards large-scale dissemination.
