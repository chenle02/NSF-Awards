The aim of this proposal is to organize a conference on logic, with a focus on
descriptive set theory, and its applications. The planned lectures represent the
highest quality work being done in the field. By bringing together major
contributors, the conference will help develop new avenues of cooperation and
will help familiarize researchers with recent work on applications of
descriptive set theory. In connection with the conference, the 60th birthday of
Alexander S. Kechris will be celebrated. Professor Kechris has been among the
most important contributors to the field in the last 35 years.

The project aims to help mathematicians learn to use tools coming from logic in
their work and also to familiarize logicians with problems and ideas originating
in other fields which may resonate with methods developed within logic. The
young researchers whose participation in the meeting will be supported by this
project will benefit by directly interacting with the best mathematicians in the
field. Attendance in the conference will be a valuable component in their
graduate and postgraduate education.
