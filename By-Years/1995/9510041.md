9510041 Hagelberg This project will test the hypothesis that there are nonlinear
linkages between tropical solar insolation and high- latitude glaciation
resulting in climate variations on the 10,000- year time scale. Two time periods
will be examined with the same solar forcing, but different levels of
glaciation, in order to compare effects of these two boundary conditions. The
study may provide a crucial insight into the controls on global climate change.
