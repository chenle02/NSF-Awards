The Center for American Archaeology will initiate a six-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Archeology for 30 students entering grades 11 and 12.
Participants will be introduced to all aspects of archeological research, with
special emphasis being given to the role geomorphology, botany, zoology,
bioanthropology and other such disciplines play in understanding past societies.
Field and experimental activities will be part of the ongoing program conducted
by the CAA's Education Program. Students will spend three weeks excavating at
the 6000-year-old Quasar site. In the laboratory, participants will work with
respected professional scientists collecting and analyzing cultural, biological
and geological data for independent research projects that can contribute to the
overall research goals of the Center for American Archaeology.
