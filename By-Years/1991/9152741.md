The aim of this project is to significantly enhance the ability to teach about
respiration and metabolism in a diversity of biology courses. The acquisition of
a Micro-Oxymax computer- interfaced respirometer provides the sensitivity for
measuring changes in CO2 as well as oxygen and allows animals to be monitored
for extended periods of time without stress. By interfacing with the university
computing systems the collected data is available to students in a variety of
courses for additional analysis. The project has an impact on students in
several courses, allowing them to take direct, accurate measurements of key
metabolic processes, to investigate the influence of various environmental
factors on their magnitude, and to develop "doable" experimental ideas of their
own.
