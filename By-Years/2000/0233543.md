CMS-0233543 Philip Liu, Cornell U. "International Travel Grant: First
International Symposium on Submarine Mass Movements and Their Consequences"

This action is to support a US delegation to the First International Symposium
on Submarine Mass Movements and Their Consequences. This symposium will be held
as part of the 2003 EGS-AGU- EUG joint meeting in Nice, France, from 7-11 April
2003. The objective of this symposium is to advance our knowledge of:
Potentially stable or unstable continental slopes - important to the health and
safety of offshore and coastal regions; The possible presence of gas hydrates
and free gas zones - so as to improve environmental protection during offshore
activities such as cable, pipeline laying and drilling operations; Forces and
release mechanisms of slope failures on margins, and of endangered areas - for a
major contribution to sustainable development; Establish, describe and develop
tools for evaluating the consequences of submarine mass movements to the sea
floor, man-made structures or coastal communities; Links between the submarine
mass movements and the generation of tsunamis. Predictive tools and risk
assessment of continental slope activity for the next 100 - 1000 years.

A US delegation of six (6) researchers will participate in the symposium. Every
effort will be made to invite junior researchers of the U.S. tsunami community
as the members of the delegation.
