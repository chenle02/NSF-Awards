This award supports a study of carbon isotopic compositions of benthic
foraminifera from Eocene to Oligocene sediments from Ocean Drilling Program
sites 689 and 690 on the Maud Rise of the Southern Ocean. The analysis of paired
species (epifaunal-infaunal) will be used to establish a record of
paleoproductivity and will be corroborated with organic carbon, biogenic silica,
total benthic foraminiferal number and total sediment accumulation rates. The
paleoproductivity data from these high-latitude sequences will be compared with
existing planktonic foraminiferal isotope data to determine how productivity
changes are related to the evolution of Southern Ocean paleoclimate conditions.
This information will be useful for evaluating the role of productivity changes
on climatic conditions over long periods of geologic time.
