This project is concerned with the study of some interrelated questions of
local cohomology, etale cohomology and the number of defining equations of
algebraic varieties. Some progress has been made on these problems recently, but
much remains to be done. It is still unknown whether every non-singular
subvariety of affine space is a set-theoretic complete intersection. The
structure of local cohomology modules remains a mystery. The relationship
between the cohomological dimension and the etale cohomological dimension is
still unclear. Some technical questions about local etale cohomology remain
open. The principal investigator will study these questions using methods that
have been successful in the past as well as developing some new methods.
Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects arising from the sets
of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest and
currently one of the most active branches of mathematics. It has widespread
applications in mathematics, computer science and physics.
