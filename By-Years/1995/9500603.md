This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming in the
purchase of a Rapid Scanning Stopped-Flow spectrometer. This new instrumentation
will enhance the research in a number of areas including the following:
Mechanisms for the Decomposition of Peroxynitrite; Activation of Carbonyls by
Lewis Acids; The Reactions of Di- and Trisulfides with Dimethyldioxirane; Metal-
Alkyl Protonolysis Kinetics Studies; and Stopped-Flow Studies of Luminescence
Sensors Based on Complexes Containing MLCT Excited States. A Stopped-Flow
spectrometer is used to follow the kinetics of fast reactions in which the
reagents cannot be previously mixed. The Stopped-Flow method uses a small
solution volume in a static reactor connected to a rapid-mixing device. The
mixed solutions passed into the reactor is stopped when a steady state is
reached, and the reactant concentration is monitored spectrophometrically. The
Stopped-Flow method is used in fast reactions, such as enzyme- catalyzed
reactions.
