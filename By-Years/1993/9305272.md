9305272 Bralower In this collaborative, interdisciplinary study, PIs will
investigate biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy and stable
isotope stratigraphy of a middle Cretaceous marine sequence in northeastern
Mexico, representing a time of rapid global change. Issues to be addressed
include: 1) presence of correlative oceanic anoxic events, 2) appropriateness of
an oxygen- minimum-zone model for this sequence, 3) potential correlation of
organic-rich sedimentation with sea-level fluctuations, 4) relationship of
organic-carbon burial events to record of carbon isotopes, 5) significance of a
brief magnetic reversal during this time, 6) are orbital periodicities recorded
in this sequence?, 7) how does the expression of cyclicity change along the
basin margin?, 8) timing of evolution of planktonic forams during this time, and
9) how do nannoplankton and planktonic forams respond to events around this time
period? Potential drilling sites for Apticore/Albicore will be evaluated. ***
