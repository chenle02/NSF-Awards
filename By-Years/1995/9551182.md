A central goal of the Geography Department is to provide all students with
skills in collecting, analyzing, and presenting data. Despite some success in
achieving this goal, students receive little training in geographic information
systems (GIS). This concern is shared with the Geology and Biology Departments,
who also recognize the growing importance of GIS in their disciplines. Our
objective is to provide a wide cross-section of undergraduate students with
interdisciplinary exposure to GIS such that they can use this technology after
leaving the university and can engage in independent research that involves GIS.
The plan to meet this objective has three components and involves efforts by the
Geography, Geology, and Biology Departments. First, a cross-listed course is
being developed specifically addressing the theoretical and applied issues of
GIS. This course forms the core of GIS education. Second, independent student
research that uses GIS is being encouraged. Such projects include community-
based outreach work with the Madison County, NY, Planning Agency and
environmental studies at the university. Third, existing courses are being
modified to include lectures and exercises involving GIS.
