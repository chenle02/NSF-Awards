9421704 Sarrafzadeh This award supports the continuing series of Midwest Theory
Days. For the past few years researchers in theoretically oriented fields of
computer science have met two times a year in the Midwest United States. At the
meetings, attendance have ranged from 60 to 80, representing 15 institutions.
These meetings bring Midwest researchers together to discuss latest results in
theoretical aspects of computer science and in the transfer of rigorous
methodologies to applied fields. Students (mostly graduate) at all Midwest
institutions benefit from Midwest Theory Day by getting exposed to advances in
theoretical studies. Approximately 30 to 40 graduate students attend each
meeting. ***
