Cheryl Anne Frye, Ph.D., proposal number 0316083, Progestins' non-genomic
actions in the VTA

Steroid hormones, such as estradiol and progesterone, the primary female sex
steroids, are traditionally understood to mediate behavior through actions in
the brain at specific steroid receptors that are located inside of cells.
Progesterone's mechanisms to mediate mating behavior occur in part, independent
of these classic actions at intracellular progestin receptors in an area of the
brain, called the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), which is important for
motivation and reinforcement. The central goal of the present research is to
elucidate non-traditional actions of steroids that mediate behavior. The primary
approaches used are behavioral and biochemical. First, putative substrates for
progestins' actions are manipulated in the VTA and effects on mating behavior
are examined. Those manipulations that produce consistent changes in
progesterone-facilitated mating behavior are considered substrates for
progesterone's mechanisms. Second, these substrates and progesterone's effects
on them are measured biochemically in tissues from the VTA. The present studies
will test whether progesterone has actions in the VTA via membrane GABAA and/or
dopamine receptors. If GABAA and/or dopamine receptors are mechanisms for
progesterone in the VTA, then blocking these receptors in the VTA will attenuate
progesterone-facilitated mating behavior. Further, differences in GABAA and/or
dopamine receptors in the VTA would be expected in rodents with or without
progesterone. Notably, GABAA and dopamine receptors have been implicated in
other affective and motivated behaviors, which may also be involved in
reproduction and mating. This research will help to reveal non-traditional
mechanisms by which steroid hormones, such as progesterone, work in the brain
and to affect behavior. Every aspect of these studies will include undergraduate
students several of which who will co-author publications.
