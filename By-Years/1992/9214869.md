Research in intermediate energy nuclear physics will be carried out at IUCF,
LAMPF, BNL, and NIKHEF, focussing on nuclear structure and determination of the
effective nucleon- nucleon interaction. Polarization transfer reactions will be
used to explore the tensor, central, and spin-orbits components of the
interaction. Measurements with different probes, together with a careful choice
of nuclear states, such as the stretch states transitions with maximal angular
momentum transfer, will be used to obtain a much refined view of the different
components. Information on shell model occupation numbers, shapes of radial
orbitals, core polarization, meson exchange currents, and relativistic effects
will also be obtained from this work. Multi-nucleon knockout experiments on the
structure of few body systems will be carried out at BNL using linearly
polarized gamma rays. Planning of experiments for electron scattering extensions
of this latter work will be carried out.
