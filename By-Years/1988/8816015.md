The dynamics of shelfbreak fronts will be examined through a series of numerical
experiments. Relatively simple situations will be first used to isolate the
basic dynamics of the fronts. Then more complexity will be added to the
idealized numerical models. Three problems will be addressed: 1. "tracer" vs.
"density" fronts 2. wind stress influence on frontal position 3. interaction of
offshore eddy with shelfbreak front.
