Doctoral Dissertation Student: Kristie Macrakis; Dissertation topic: "Research
between science and politics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society in the Third Reich."
Science does not exist in a void. It affects and is affected by the society in
which it is embedded. Having said this, however, does not necessarily imply that
scientific institutions must automatically follow society's lead. There are
important examples in this century of scientific institutions which have
resisted political and social pressures. Several scientific institutes in the
Soviet Union, for example, provided shelter for geneticists and their research
during the period of Lysenkoism when orthodox genetics was officially condemned.
During the horrors of the Nazi Third Reich, scientific institutions also
resisted official pressure. The purpose of Ms. Mackrakis' research is to examine
the impact of Nazi policies on science and its organization at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Society while seeking out the factors that allowed an oasis of high
quality science to continue. Important here is the changing nature of the
developments at the KWG; thus the development went through three phases: 1)
1933-36: While Max Planck was still president of the Society he could preserve
some of the Society's autonomy; 2) 1937- 39: The appointment of an industrialist
as president with the concomitant encroachment of more politics into the
Society's affairs; and 3) 1939-45: the war years. Ms. Macrakis will use the
travel funds from this grant to examine files which will help to determine what
happened to the Society in the last, war period. This research will serve to
provide much needed new information concerning the interaction of science in
society during a period of extreme upheaval. She has already published on her
topic. Her dissertation promises to be a significant contribution to this
important area of study.
