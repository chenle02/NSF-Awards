Multicomponent seismic reflection, magnetotelluric, structural, and
petrological studies of Basin-and-Range crust will be performed to study
problems of fluids in the crust including magma at the Moho, crustal inflow
beneath uplifted core complexes, underplating, mid-crustal detachment zones,
anisotropy, and nature of lower crust. Structural plunge of the Ruby Mountains
core complex, producing greater than 10 km difference in level of exposure,
offers a particularly good setting to study these problems. The combination of
S-waves as well as P-waves together with conductivity in the deep crust provides
a good opportunity to constrain various possibilities suggested for Basin-and-
Range crust, especially because seismic and MT results complement each other in
explaining conductive zones. Data acquisition involving about 1550 seismic
channels is designed to optimize S-wave data for maximum resolution, and the
question of resolution in seismic and MT interpretation is a major consideration
in developing conclusions. Models obtained from geophysical interpretation will
be integrated with petrology and structure.
