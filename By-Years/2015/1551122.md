This grant will provide travel funds for undergraduates to attend the biennial
meeting of the International Congress on Infant Studies in 2016, 2018, and 2020.
Undergraduates who are presenting work at the conference and/or who are from
underrepresented groups (including ethnic/racial minorities and first generation
college students) will receive a subsidy to attend the meeting and will
participate in professional socialization activities during the meeting.
Promotion of undergraduate research experiences will help to cultivate the next
generation of infancy researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds will offset
travel expenses for undergraduate attendees per meeting. Efforts to disseminate
information about this opportunity will focus on developing a diverse applicant
pool. In addition to learning about new research in infancy science,
undergraduate attendees will be mentored at the meeting to ensure that they make
the most of their conference experience. Supported students will participate in
networking opportunities to learn about graduate school and post-college
employment in research venues.
