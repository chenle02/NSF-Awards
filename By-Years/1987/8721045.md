A fundamental understanding of the deformation behavior and failure modes of
sediments and porous rocks is important in understanding the distribution of
seismicity in a number of geological settings. This is particularly true of the
deepest, arcward ends of accretionary wedges, the aseismic masses of accreted
sediments beneath the landward slopes of many convergent plate boundaries. This
problem is particularly important in accretionary wedges because of their
aseismicity, and because of the importance of understanding the nature of the
'seismic front', which marks the trenchward limit of plate-boundary thrust
earthquakes at or near the back of the wedge. Although the lower, thermally
controlled, boundary of the thrusting seismogenic zone is reasonably well
understood, the shallow limit has not been properly explained. Because of the
very small dip of the plate boundary at such shallow depths, this leads to a
great deal of uncertainty about the total width of the seismogenic zone, upon
which the maximum possible earthquake size depends very strongly.
