The University of Hawaii has established a partnership with the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Telecommunications
Circuits and Systems at Arizona State University known as "Connection One". The
Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications will provide the capabilities,
expertise, and research facilities for doing the research. The vision for the
next generation wireless communications technology calls for fully integrated,
low cost, expanded broadband and high data rate applications/services, seamless
hands-off between heterogeneous networks, full mobility with minimum latency.
These constraints make it exceedingly difficult to design affordable wireless
systems. Confronting these technology challenges will require breakthroughs and
innovative multidisciplinary research contributions across the multi-layer
wireless communication network system.
