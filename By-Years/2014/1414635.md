The need to implement cost-effective, preventative measures to slow or reverse
the deterioration of civil infrastructure is becoming increasingly important.
However, while this need is recognized, it is challenging to efficiently
implement infrastructure maintenance plans due to uncertainties inherent to the
process. Traditionally, variations in engineering properties are accounted for
by overdesigning, which is an inefficient use of money and resources. Use of
reliability analysis has allowed for better understanding of how much overdesign
is needed, but still results in inefficient designs. The next step in designing
for uncertainty is to develop a method for finding a balance between cost and
safety. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Hongwei
Huang at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, where a multi-million dollar
research project on subway tunnel maintenance is being performed. Information
gathered from this research project will be used to validate a tunnel
maintenance decision-making model.

The issue of cost-effectively preventing infrastructure deterioration is a
problem of rapidly growing importance with a global impact. The uncertainties
associated with the infrastructure maintenance process pose considerable
challenges to the planning of maintenance programs for underground urban
transportation systems. To characterize these uncertainties, reliability models
have been widely studied for maintenance optimization, but accurate information
is necessary for these reliability-based methods to be effective. Noise in the
model inputs quickly cause suggested maintenance schemes to become inefficient
and costly. Through implementation of a robust optimal maintenance decision
method that considers design parameters (easy to control) and noise factors
(hard to control) separately, the effect of noise factors can be minimized. This
research will allow the validation of such a model, leading to enhanced
decision-making capacity during maintenance planning. This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
