The Auxin 2016 meeting will be held October 20-25, 2016 in Haitang Bay, Sanya,
China. The plant hormone auxin is an essential regulator of almost every aspect
of plant growth and development. The auxin field is an active and rapidly
developing area in plant biology and is increasingly relying on high level
integration of diverse approaches with computational models and bioinformatics.
Coupled with recent advances in synthetic biology there has been a resurgence of
interest in broadening our understanding of auxin biology. The objective of this
conference is to bring together a broad array of experts to enhance the
international dialogue on critical issues relating to auxin biology. This
conference will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific
and/or educational activities by bringing together a leading group of
International and US researchers. Participation in this meeting provides a
significant training experience for young career scientists who represent the
future of science in the US. In addition, this meeting will provide the
foundation for international collaborations between researchers in the US and
elsewhere. The Auxin 2016 meeting will include oral presentations by invited
speakers and from those selected from submitted abstracts, poster sessions, and
lightning talks by junior investigators. The requested funds will be used to
off-set registration costs for up to 30 US early career scientists and to
provide funds for one junior faculty member who is an invited presenter. The
organizers will prioritize support for underrepresented groups and women with
NSF funds.
