Our objective is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a video-based problem
solving series that generates excitement about mathematics and science among
middle school students (grades 5,6,7) and that helps them develop powerful
skills of mathematical problem formulation and problem solving. The series will
consist of (1) six problem solving videos that cover the key mathematical
concepts and activities recommended for middle school mathematics in the NCTM
curriculum standards (1989); (2) ancillary materials in the form of print,
Hypermedia and computer tools that help students carry their mathematical
thinking to other parts of the curriculum such as science and social studies;
(3) teaching videos plus text materials for teachers. The series will be based
on a theoretically and empirically motivated set of design principles that help
teachers engage in the types of classroom activities that are recommended in the
NCTM curriculum standards. Several of these design principles are unique to our
proposed series and appear to be extremely important for enhancing motivation
among students and developing powerful skills of complex problem formulation and
problem solving. We have already produced two problem solving videos that serve
as pilots for the series (one is included with this application) and are
currently producing a teaching video plus ancillary materials to accompany the
pilots. We are asking the NSF for help in producing the four additional problem
solving videos (plus ancillary materials) plus the two additional teaching
videos. We discuss the anticipated impact of our series, our previous track
record and our plans for quality control, cost-sharing and dissemination.
