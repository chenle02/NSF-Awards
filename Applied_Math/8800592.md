This project is concerned with integrable dynamical systems and their
connections with various branches of physics and mathematics. The techniques
include the use of the calculus of variations, pseudodifferential operators and
algebraic Hamiltonian formalism. This work is related to problems in turblence,
magnetohydrodynamics, quantum mechanics and wave propagation.
