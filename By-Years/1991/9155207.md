This proposal is a cooperative effort between the Educational Service District
(USGS) to develop a science teacher education program that incorporates
components of a successful prior NSF program that addressed Mt. St. Helens. The
project, over a span of three years, plans to provide instructional strategies
to 120 teachers of grades five through nine using a peer coaching and trainer-of
trainers model. Teams will study the related physical and life sciences of the
Columbia River Gorge, the Columbia River, the Willamette Valley, and the Pacific
Ocean.
