Partial support is requested for the 46th Annual Symposium of the Society for
Developmental Biology to be held at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,
from June 22-24, 1987. The title of the symposium is: Self-Assembling
Architecture. The Annual Meeting of the Society is an important meeting in
Developmental Biology, bringing together invited speakers from a number of the
major laboratories in this country and abroad. The speakers are selected on the
basis of the high quality of their current research and its relevance to the
topic of the symposium. In addition, the organizers have made an effort to
include a variety of experimental approaches to developmental problems.
