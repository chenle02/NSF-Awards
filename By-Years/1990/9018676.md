The PI will carry out a research program of measuring sound velocities and,
hence, elastic properties of minerals and high- pressure silicate phases by
Brillouin light scattering experiments on samples compressed to high pressures
in diamond anvil cells. These experiments will yield the pressure derivatives of
elastic properties, and will allow the properties of mineral assemblages to be
calculated for actual conditions within the Earth with much greater confidence.
Although initial experiments will be made on phases that ate thought to dominate
the upper mantle, this technique can and will be applied to metallic and
amorphous materials as well. This research will require a concentrated effort to
refine the experimental techniques involved with high pressure Brillouin
scattering, so that rapid and accurate measurements of pressure derivatives can
be made.
