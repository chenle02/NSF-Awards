The investigator and co-investigator organize a conference on the topic "The
Interface between Atomistic and Continuum Theories" under the auspices of the
Society for Natural Philosophy. The conference themes address mathematical
issues that arise in the development of continuum-level governing equations
(balance laws and constitutive equations) for materials based on atomistic
considerations. The focuses are on the relationships between the relevant
physical principles used at atomic and continuum levels, as well as consistency
of the resulting theories. Basic understanding of the characteristics of the
theories across different length scales is essential for developing analytical
and computational models that are capable of describing a broad range of
material behaviors. The speakers invited to participate in the conference are
leading researchers in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering. These
speakers present their current research on analysis, modeling, and simulations
for various material systems. The conferences of Society for Natural Philosophy
have a history of being cross-disciplinary endeavors. The works presented at
these conferences have embraced a broad spectrum of research topics, with common
emphasis on the application of rigorous mathematical analysis to the study of
physical systems.

The conference contributes directly to building a solid theoretical foundation
for rapidly developing technological areas such as nanotechnology, novel
materials, and large-scale material simulations. As many nations are heavily
investing in these technological areas, the most significant and lasting
developments can only result from progress at fundamental levels. The theme of
the conference reflects the current trend of using advanced mathematical tools
to address critical problems arising in the modeling of material behavior across
widely varying length and time scales. The conference promotes the participation
of junior researchers and students, and exposes them to a novel, important, and
rapidly expanding area of science and technology.
