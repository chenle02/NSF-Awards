A current industry trend aimed at addressing platform performance/power
requirements is to create heterogeneous manycore systems, comprised of general
purpose and specialized cores designed to accelerate certain application or
system functions. A second trend, designed to make it easier to map a wide
variety of functions and components to manycore platforms, is platform-level
support for system virtualization. This research innovates, implements, and
evaluates new virtualization technologies for heterogeneous manycore
architectures composed of commodity general-purpose and accelerator cores. The
goal is to realize an efficient execution environment for composing and
executing a range of computationally and data-intensive
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system abstractions innovated include (i)
the HVM (heterogeneous virtual machine) platform abstraction for dynamic
composition of resources (e.g., cores, accelerators, memory, I/O) (ii) new
methods for managing heterogeneous manycore resources, including power, and
(iii) specialized execution environments for optimizing accelerator
interactions. These components are implicitly integrated through an execution
model wherein the same abstractions and mechanisms are used to dynamically
manage diverse accelerator platforms, thereby realizing our vision of freely
shared and customized platform resources provided to
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
