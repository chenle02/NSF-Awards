The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Joe Hightower of Rice University and Dr. L. Guczi of the Hungarian Institute
of Isotopes, Budapest, is to pursue catalyst characterization in
alkyne/alkadiene selective hydrogenation. To do this the researchers will study
the effects of dispersion, support additives and alloying on three fundamental
surface reactions proceeding over palladium. Joint efforts should yield detailed
measurements useful in determining the most important catalyst parameters that
influence catalyst selectivity. Such reliable information about the basic
chemical nature of active site and reaction pathways could lead to eventual
development of more selective and longer lasting catalysts. This project in
catalytic kinetics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
