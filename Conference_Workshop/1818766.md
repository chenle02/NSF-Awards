The conference "Combinatorics and Beyond" is to be held at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor on the dates November 8-11, 2018. The aim of the meeting is
to gather both leading experts and younger researchers in some of the most
rapidly developing parts of combinatorics, including in particular Schubert
calculus, total positivity, and cluster algebras.

The main aim of the conference is to strengthen interaction between researchers
and introduce students to this field of study. The organizers place particular
attention on attracting junior participants, as well as participants from
underrepresented groups. It is expected that the conference to aid the
dissemination of new results in these areas and lead to fruitful interactions
and new directions. The website for the conference is
