This proposal is a request for funds to help support the 1988 Northeast
Regional Conference on Developmental Biology. The Conference will be held at the
Maine Biological laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, November 17-20, 1988.
The goal of the Conference is to bring together animal and plant developmental
biologist from the Northeast to present their work in formal sessions and
informal discussions. A special effort is being made to bring together
investigators at all career stages: graduate students to established
investigators. The Conference will include four platform sessions, a poster
session, a special address in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Marine
Biological Laboratory, and a keynote address. %%% These regional meeting provide
an opportunity for graduate students, post doctoral fellows and senior
researchers to meet and exchange information in s small manageable group. The
meetings therefore provide a valuable training function for the junior members.
