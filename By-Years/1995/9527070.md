Kettler OPP 9527070 Abstract This award supports organic geochemical
characterization of Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary rocks that are expected to
be recovered during the Cape Roberts Project (CRP). The CRP proposes to core
four 500 m holes from a fast ice drilling platform in the Ross Sea in 1995 and
1996. The core recovered will be described, curated, and sampled for scientific
research. The CRP has the potential to answer significant questions regarding
the history of the West Antarctic rift system, the development of continental
ice sheets in Antarctica during the Cretaceous and Paleogene, and the response
of biota to climatic deterioration and the development of seaways. Organic
geochemical measurements are relevant to these issues and so are included in the
initial core characterization studies. The work supported here includes
measurement of whole-rock carbonate carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and
total sulfur, analysis of the elemental composition of kerogen in selected
samples, and gas chromatographic analysis of the solvent-soluble organic matter
in selected samples. These data will be collected in the Crary Science and
Engineering Center (CSEC) at McMurdo Station and will be reported as part of the
initial core characterization study of the CRP.
