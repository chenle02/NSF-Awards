Much of current pedagogy in computer science instruction is static and
interactive. Books use illustrations, charts, and diagrams - nondynamic, still
shots. Overheads used in class suffer from the same problem. Good discussions in
the classroom are appropriately interactive for at least some students but labor
with the limitations of language. Films or videos, on the other hand, are
dynamic but not usually interactive. In part inspired by ideas generated by
Project Kaleidoscope in Washington, DC, the goal of this project is the
development of a laboratory for graphical/interactive computer science
instruction and support materials for the classroom. Utilizing special authoring
software, courseware willl be developed for the laboratory for use in courses in
problem solving, algorithms, data structures, theory of computation, computer
organization, and others.
