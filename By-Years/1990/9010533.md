This research investigates complexity theory from the point of view of boolean
circuits with an emphasis on the area of lower bounds. Boolean circuits are
natural models of parallel computation. The depth of circuits corresponds to
parallel time while the size of circuits corresponds to the number of
processors. Viewed from complexity theory, the size of boolean circuits
corresponds to time in Turing machines. Thus questions such as P=NP? or NC=P?
will be solved, perhaps, only after a better understanding of how to prove lower
bounds to the complexity of boolean functions is obtained. This is the main
objective of this project.
