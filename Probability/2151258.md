The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2022 (SSP) will be held at Lehigh University
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on March 16-19, 2022. These seminars have been held
annually since 1981, with the exception of 2021. They have become a crucially
important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, bringing
together a diverse group of accomplished researchers, early-career
investigators, and graduate students in probability theory and stochastic
processes. The primary goals of SSP 2022 are to provide a platform for the
dissemination of the most significant recent progress in the field and to enable
participants to discuss their work with others. The five main speakers at SSP
2022 were chosen for their prominence as researchers in stochastic processes and
for the collective breadth of their research areas. SSP 2022 will also
incorporate activities intended especially for new researchers; these will
include two 90-minute tutorial lectures, a poster session with accompanying
mini-talks, an open problem session, and a panel discussion on topics of
particular interest to early-career researchers. This conference will be an
excellent opportunity for students and early-career researchers to learn the
latest developments in probability and related topics, and to interact with
leading researchers.

Stochastic processes are fundamental to understanding the way randomness occurs
in the real world and are used to model a wide variety of physical, biological,
ecological, and financial phenomena. This meeting of SSP will address topics
including statistical physics, especially problems related to random matrix
theory, combinatorics and integrable systems; the structural and dynamical
properties of networks and algorithmic game theory, including applications to
computer science; stochastic partial differential equations, large-scale
interacting systems, and random interface models; and stochastic processes
motivated by population genetics, such as branching Brownian motion and the
spatial Lambda Fleming-Viot process. Financial support to attend the conference
will be preferentially given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and other
under-represented or marginalized groups, as well as to early-career faculty who
may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. More information will be
disseminated, and kept, at the conference webpage:
