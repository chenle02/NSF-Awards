0117767 Swift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will complete the data assembly,
verification, adjustments, examination by data quality experts, documentation,
availability and archive of hydrographic and tracers data collected by the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). As the WOCE
program winds down at the end of 2002, the WHP Office will complete the clean-up
of the repeat Hydrography data set, prepare the WHP contents for the final WOCE
CD-ROM (version 3) and will transition the activities of the office to optimally
the anticipated needs of the Climate Variability and predictability (CLIVAR)
program as it ramps up its re-survey activities. The WHP office enables
discovery and understanding by making the high-quality WOCE data set freely
available together with the appropriate documentation and tools that also
facilitates teaching. This activity not only supports the WOCE community but
also enables research and teaching more broadly across many areas of physical
oceanography, the application of oceanographic knowledge to climate issues and
its application in biological issues. It enables research and teaching across
the full spectrum of US institutions and also
internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
