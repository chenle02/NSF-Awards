Numerical analysis has been very successful in the development and analysis of
schemes to approximate the solution of classical models in the pure and applied
sciences. However, in recent times, new classes of models have emerged which
challenge the current understanding and techniques of numerical analysis. New
approximation techniques are required or the analysis of the classical ones call
for new ideas, as standard arguments do not work. This is particularly the case
for problems which exhibit nonlocal features in time (memory effects), nonsmooth
evolution problems, nonlocality features in space (long range interactions), or
a combination of any of these features. Another important class of problems that
require special attention are those where the data of the problem is nonsmooth,
which includes singular forcing or constitutive laws. Finally, as a last example
there are strongly nonlinear problems where there is a barrier in how smooth the
solution can be, regardless of the smoothness of the problem data.

The purpose of this research project is the analysis of approximation techniques
for a representative sample of the problems mentioned above. The implementation
of many of the numerical techniques that we will discuss in many cases is
standard, but their analysis requires a fine interplay between the regularity of
the solution (in nonstandard spaces), the structure of the problem and that of
the scheme. As an outcome of this work, new numerical techniques will be
developed and the existing ones will be strengthened by solid mathematical
analysis of their approximation properties. The models which will be under our
study describe a wide range of phenomena, and mathematically solid numerical
methods for them will be developed. Thus, the proposed ideas will enhance
modeling and prediction capabilities. For instance, the study of discretization
techniques for nonlocal operators is in its infancy. Even in the linear case,
the nonlocality greatly complicates the analysis and efficient implementation of
solution schemes.
