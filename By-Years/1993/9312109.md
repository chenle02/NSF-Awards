This award will provide funding to defray a portion of the costs for a workshop
on the future applications of improved measurements of absolute gravity. The
recent development of a transportable instrument which can measure gravitational
acceleration with a working accuracy of one microgal has opened up the
possibility of new capabilities in research areas such as global change (sea
level changes), neotectonics, volcanism, and geodynamics. This workshop, to be
held in Boulder, Colorado on March 22-23 will bring together 20-40 active
workers in these research areas from university and federal agency laboratories
to discuss the scientific implications of the new instrumentation and the most
efficient means to make such instrumentation available to the U.S. geophysical
research community.
