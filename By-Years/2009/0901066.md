develop an integrated framework for rate-constrained adaptive quantization
techniques with application to distributed inference in wireless sensor
networks. The approach allows sensor nodes to sequentially transmit their
quantized data and each individual node can adaptively change its local
quantizer based on prior transmissions from other nodes. Specific goals include
development of linear and nonlinear adaptive quantization schemes and
distributed inference methods, such as distributed estimators and detectors,
distributed consensus algorithms with quantized message passing, and distributed
random field estimation methods, by exploiting adaptive quantization, graphical
models and distributed optimization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
respect to intellectual merit, the project addresses a fundamental challenge of
quantization for distributed inference in a sensor network environment, where
the optimum quantizer generally cannot be implemented due to its dependence on
unknown parameters associated with the random event being monitored by the
sensor network. Unlike conventional methods using fixed, data-independent and
often heuristically selected quantizers, this research takes a data-driven
approach where, through sensor cooperation and adaptive learning, the local
quantizers are sequentially updated so as to converge to an optimum
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the project has
the potential of solving several important distributed inference problems with
bandwidth and power constraints, thereby advancing the research and development
of wireless sensor networks that are expected to have significant economic and
social impact. The project has an integrated research and education program
aimed at the training of a diverse population of students, including those from
underrepresented groups.
