This award supports the attendance and tuition of graduate students and faculty
from under-represented groups and minority-serving institutions at the Summer
Policy Colloquium organized by the American Meteorological Society (AMS). The
Colloquium brings together 40-50 members of the atmospheric and related science
communities to Washington, D.C. once each year for a ten-day immersion in
science policy. Participants include high-level science and policy officials
from both the executive branch and legislative branches of the US government,
media, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and private industry. Colloquium
members complete pre-assigned readings, develop science policy case studies, and
engage in exercises including role-playing, discussion, and debate.

The AMS Summer Policy Colloquium serves an important role and an unfulfilled
niche in the atmospheric sciences (and other sciences as well) by providing the
means for a fresh and evolving dialog between the culture of scientists and
policy makers. It provides a unique window into the needs of the end-users of
scientific data to help shape society.
