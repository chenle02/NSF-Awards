Choices under Uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When people make decisions under
uncertainty, they often choose without knowing the full consequences of their
actions. Decisions under uncertainty are a basic feature of life and of the
human experience. The PIs seek to understand how such decisions are made in the
context of financial markets. Understanding financial decisions will shed light
on how individuals make choices under uncertainty and aid our understanding of
financial markets and models. This can help us uncover, for example, the causes
of financial crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research carries out a
set of novel experiments on decisions under uncertainty in financial settings.
The most fundamental theory of decisions under uncertainty is subjective
expected utility (SEU). Its use is ubiquitous is economics, and other social
sciences. The PIs propose a new experimental and empirical approach to testing
SEU and its generalizations: state dependent expected utility (SDU), and maxmin
expected utility (MEU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research seeks to
elucidate the applicability and scope of the most important theories of choice
under uncertainty in a financial market environment. Such environments have
been, and continue to be, the focus of academic research in economics, and the
general interest of the public. It is crucial to further our understanding of
financial market that we understand the applicability of the most commonly-used
theories of individual choice in such markets. The new approach contains two key
innovations: 1) it provides non-parametric revealed preference tests, allowing
for a test of the theory that does not rest on particular parametric
assumptions; and 2) it assumes an environment of financial decision making under
uncertainty.
