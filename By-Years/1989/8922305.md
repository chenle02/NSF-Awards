The study of ultrathin film amorphous and microcrystalline semiconductors will
be utilized to obtain basic information on the physical properties and structure
of systems extending to submonolayer coverages. A combination of Raman
scattering enhancement methods, ultraviolet photoemission measurements of
changes in the density-of-states with island size, and additional discrete
wavelength ellipsometry measurements for studying film growth all will be
performed in situ. Emphasis will be placed on the use of high nucleation density
disordered carbon substrates used previously in studies of crystalline
transition metals. Raman scattering methods will also be utilized to study
clusters isolated in weakly interacting substrates. The basic goal of these
studies is to obtain information on finite size effects and modified surface
bonding on the vibrational, electronic and optical properties of semiconducting
cluster systems.
