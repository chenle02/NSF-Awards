The focus of this research is the development of synthetic routes for the
preparation of macrocycles. Methods to form [9] and [10]paracyclophanes and
approaches to macrocyclization and macrolactamization will be pursued. For
macrolactamization, the reaction of amino groups with thioesters in the presence
of silver salts will be used and an approach utilizing an azide as latent
funcionality will be investigated. The total syntheses of hymenocardine,
pondaplin and roquefortine C will be carried out to highlight the strategic
approach.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Madeleine M. Joullie of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Joullie will focus her
work on developing strategies for the synthesis of unusual classes of natural
products including macrocycles of plant origin and alkaloids exhibiting unusual
structural features. The low yields of these compounds obtained from plants or
other natural sources make the development of practical synthetic methods
important. The biological properties of the target molecules are of interest to
the pharmaceutical industry. The research also provides an excellent setting for
the training of graduate and post-doctoral students.
