9732601 Murphy, Robin Core, Karen Colorado School of Mines REU: Multiple
Autonomous Robots for Search and Rescue Applications This Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports eight students per year in
programs carried out during the summers, for two years. The students will work
on projects involving coordination and control of multiple heterogeneous robots
for urban search and rescue applications. Activities include development of
technical skills, development of interdisciplinary problem solving skills, and
on professional and personal development. The project targets women and minority
students at bot CSM and at traditional minority institutions. The participants
work both individually and in groups. The results will include construction and
programming of eight small robots operating under central control and then
modification and programming of two existing robots for the rapid deployment of
a small inspection robot by the larger robot at the scene of a disaster, and
subsequent intelligent control and observation by the larger robot.
