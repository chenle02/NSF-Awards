The University of Missouri-Columbia requested support from NSF to connect the
Ozarks Technical Community College, Lebanon campus to the Internet through the
Missouri Research and Education Network. This is a small campus with an
enrollment of approximately 55 students, two full time and twelve part time
faculty. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project
for two years.
