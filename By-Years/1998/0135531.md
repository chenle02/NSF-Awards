A series of small workshops will bring together researchers in the separately
developing fields of virtual communities and geo-local community informatics.
Objectives include the integration of the conceptual approaches that have been
developed in those two areas, systemization of the theoretical and technical
advances in these areas, development of a common research agenda, collaborations
in research and field projects, and emergence of a new field of Virtual
Community Informatics. There is the potential for broad benefit as many
community projects have been developed without knowledge of advanced theory or
resources for new technology, while many academic projects remain testbeds or
are short-lived experiments. To insure that a community can grow and thrive,
researchers from many disciplines will be included, as well as graduate students
and practitioners from many parts of the world.
