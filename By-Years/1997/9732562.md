This research is being done in conjunction with IIS-9731990, which is being
performed by Michael Pazzani in the Information and Computer Science Department
at the University of California, Irvine. The research is concerned with
intelligent decision aids that can be developed by data mining techniques.
Experience has determined that such systems can learn accurate models, but that
experts in areas where those models are used in decision aids are often
reluctant to trust them because they do not, for instance, use the same tests
intermediate conclusions or abstractions that the experts have grown to trust.
Or they do not use certain factors at all that experts feel to be relevant.
Experts also want models that are stable under small changes in the data being
analyzed. Psychologists have discovered factors that simplify the learning,
understanding, and communication of category and process information by humans.
This research seeks to explore these psychological principles in light of the
output of existing KDD algorithms and then go on to develop and evaluate new KDD
algorithms that will provide output that is easy for people to learn , use, and
communicate to others. With the results of this research, it should be possible
to make such decision aids more "human centered", so that they will be used more
often and more effectively in practice.
