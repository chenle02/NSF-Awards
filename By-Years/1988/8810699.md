Cosmology came of age as a science during the 20th century because of the
structuring of cosmological observation and theory around the Big Bang model of
an expanding, evolving universe. Yet even though Big Bang Cosmology was
undeniably scientific, it was scientific in a special way: Theory was always
much richer than its empirical base. Hence, finding theoretical problems which
interacted crucially with the limited data set was a difficult and delicate
problem. In many instances, cosmologists found themselves forced to rely upon
very general metaphysical principles, principles such as "The Uniformity of
Nature," "Causality," and "Simplicity," as decision criteria in the selection
among competing problem solutions. Indeed, it can be argued that it was
precisely these sorts of principles which opened the way for today's
inflationary cosmologies. Big Bang cosmology offers a rich source for historians
and philosophers of science interested in the dynamical interplay between
empirical, theoretical and philosophical forces during the birth and development
of a major scientific research programme. Professors Gale and Urani hope to
examine under this study the dynamical interplay of these forces.
