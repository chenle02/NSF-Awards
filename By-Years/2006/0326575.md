ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0326574&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0326575&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Records of oceanic Ge:Si preserved in diatoms show
temporal variations that reflect changes in the marine Si cycle through time.
The variations may be influenced by changes in the ratio of weathering to
hydrothermal inputs, changes in the relative rates of Ge removal in opal versus
non-opal phases or by changes in the internal cycling of Si in the ocean and the
fractionation of Ge:Si by diatoms. For this reason, a scientist from Oregon
State University and the University of Southern California will investigate the
utility of germanium isotopes as a geochemical tracer. To attain this goal, the
PIs plan to analyze samples from rivers, geothermal fluids, sediment pore waters
and diatoms to assess whether there is Ge isotope fractionation during low-
temperature weathering, in high-temperature geothermal systems, during
diagenesis and during diatom uptake, respectively. It is anticipated that
results from this study will show that Ge isotopes can be used to distinguish
the relative rates of weathering and hydrothermal fluid flow.
