The proposal seeks financial support for a Nanoscale Science and Engineering
(NSE) grantees conference to be held at the Westin Hotel, in Arlington, VA, on
December 9 and 10, 2014. Nano technology has grown over the years and
diversified into a multitude of spin-off technologies. The yearly grantees
conference helps evaluate the recent progress made in this discipline, and
discuss current challenges, while bridging together this diverse research
community. The conference is planned as a two-day meeting, and the agenda
includes keynote speakers, poster presentations and roundtable panel
discussions. This will promote dissemination of recent research results to the
community, and enable discussions on the impact of the technology on society.
The meeting enables networking between researchers and facilitate future
collaborations. Specific focused areas include quantum effects, self-assembly,
nanophotonics and nanobiology. Additionally the discussions will include
potential technology transfer to the commercial sector.
