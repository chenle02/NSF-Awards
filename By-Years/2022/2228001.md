Cybersecurity defense operations (cyber-ops) are in dire need of effective and
expedited learning programs for practicing professionals to infuse data
analytics (i.e., data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning)
into their day-to-day tasks. To combat the evolving threat landscape, effective
cyber-ops often involve a team of cybersecurity analysts and engineers with
complementary expertise. The analysts need effective, usable, and potentially
customized data analytics, which are developed by or in collaboration with the
engineers. Currently, in-service training for cybersecurity analysts and
engineers who need to use data analytics for cyber-ops are limited. No existing
program addresses the need to develop the collaborative mindsets and practices
that are necessary to work effectively together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to develop an innovative dual-track learning program for working
cybersecurity analysts and engineers that leverages role-playing within a
simulated organization and involves tasks that are specific to each group as
well as tasks where they need to work together as a team. This innovative design
will help promote collaboration while also enhancing learning of specific data
analytic knowledge and skills needed by each type of professional in a realistic
work environment. The program features a combination of remote learning modules
and tasks, team coach sessions, and team-based incident response exercises.
Progressively deeper learning about data analytics will occur as the scale and
complexity of the cyber-op tasks assigned to the participants, as members of a
simulated organization, are gradually increased. The program was designed in
collaboration with education researchers. The design is informed by education
theories and principles, including Identity Theory, Project-based Design,
Understanding by Design, and Universal Design for Learning. The programâ€™s design
will also build on prior successful experiences with entry-level cybersecurity
bootcamps employing simulations, cybersecurity competitions, and teaching and
deployment of research advances for cyber-ops. The program will be refined
through three iterations following a Design-based Research approach, and its
effects evaluated by an external evaluation team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
