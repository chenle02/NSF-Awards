This research will address a number of different topics in the design and
implementation of algorithms. The common theme of the research is application of
advanced algorithmic techniques techniques to practical problems. Four specific
problem areas are under investigation: (1) N-body Simulation: This is a
collaborative project with the UW Department of Astronomy studying N-body
simulation. The basic objective is to improve the algorithms and data structures
used for massive simulations. The scale of simulations raise quite a few
interesting computational geometry problems. (2) Constraint Satisfaction: One
method of developing graphical user interfaces is to use a system of constraints
to specify the behavior of the interface. Algorithms will be developed to solve
the types of constraint systems which arise in this domain. There will be
particular emphasis on constraint hierarchies, and on the efficiency of
solutions. (3) The Traveling Tourist Problem: The problem is to visit a set of
cities in minimum time where travel is restricted to a periodic timetable. In
other words, it is the traveling salesman Problem restricted to public
transportation. Heuristic and exact algorithms for this problem will be
developed and implemented. (4) Model Checking Software Specification: A
technique from hardware verification will be applied to a major problem in
software engineering. In the last several years, symbolic model checking has
become a very important tool for hardware verification. This project is to
investigate whether model checking can also be applied successfully to evaluate
software specifications. The specification of TCAS, a collision avoidance system
used in commercial aircraft will be a major case study for the project.
