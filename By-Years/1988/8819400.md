In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Jordan will study the electronic structure of
neutral and charged atomic clusters to determine lifetimes and energies of their
ions. A stabilization/analytic continuation method will be applied to determine
the energies and lifetimes of several classes of cluster ions. Systems
considered will include negative ions of alkali halide, carbon dioxide, nitrous
oxide, dioxygen, hydrogen cyanide, and acetonitrile clusters. Studies will also
be made of polymagnesium positive ion clusters and polyaluminum negative ion
clusters, including those which are unstable toward electron ejection.
