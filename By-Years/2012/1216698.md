This project aims to further our understanding of the combinatorial structure of
the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It builds on a recent result that reduces
asymmetric TSP to finding "thin trees'' in graphs and uses techniques in graph
sparsification and metric embedding to develop new algorithms. It also includes
the study of a new approximation algorithm for the symmetric TSP proposed by the
project's Principal Investigator (PI) which is conjectured to break the 3/2
barrier due to Christofides. The project also advances the rounding-by-sampling
method developed by the PI and co-authors, and extends it to design new
algorithms for various online and stochastic problems. The proposed problems
have applications in network design, online advertising, and power management in
electrical networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on TSP has broad
applications in logistics, planning, and vehicle routing. The other optimization
problems studied in the project have applications ranging from online
advertising to transmission and storage of alternative sources of energy. The
project also includes a strong education and outreach component including the
design of new courses on approximation algorithms and lectures on the subject
for a broader audience.
