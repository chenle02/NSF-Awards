The goal of this project is to interest twenty 11th and 12th grade high school
students in pursuing laboratory science careers. Students will be placed in
research laboratories during the summer under the direction of research
scientists in the Colleges of Biological Sciences, Mathematical and Physical
Sciences and Medicine at Ohio State University. In this ten-week program
students will have the opportunity for hands-on laboratory experience, will
attend lectures on scientific ethics, will be counselled on career opportunities
in the sciences and their own skills on the laboratory sciences, They will also
be given opportunities to explain to others what they have learned and what they
may have added to scientific knowledge. Parents and high school teachers will be
invited to participate with the students in the program. It is expected that
students' research experiences and their interactions with faculty, graduate
students and other researchers will increase their interest and enthusiasm for
science.
