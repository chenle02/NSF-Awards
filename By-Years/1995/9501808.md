Abstract OPP-9501808 This program would provide an organized opportunity for
undergraduates in a relatively isolated geographical area to gain research
experience in environmental chemistry and biochemistry. We have proposed a
diversified approach centering around environmental and biotechnical
applications of chemistry and biology in which students work with committed
faculty. This research focus, spotlighting chemical and biochemical components
of environmental and ecological studies specific to high latitudes, is
appropriate for undergraduates. Core disciplines in chemistry and biochemistry
are well represented with projects. Research projects include environmental
chemistry, molecular evolution, bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology of
marine organisms, and atmospheric chemistry. The program will recruit
undergraduate students who are majoring in chemical or biological science, and
encourages women and minorities such as native Alaskans who are attending the
University of Alaska to apply. We wish to continue our cross- cultural approach
in which Alaskan students exchange scientific and social perspectives with
students from the lower 48. A summer seminar series by both local faculty and
visitors is included in our program to increase the exposure of the students to
a wide range of chemistry and biochemistry. Ethics and honor in science
discussions are also held weekly and outside speakers will be invited. Evening
workshops on graduate school admission and selection, as well as discussions of
career opportunities will be held. We also will develop an improved follow-
through and tracking of students to monitor what careers the students pursued.
