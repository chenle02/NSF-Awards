The project examines the impact of new technologies of information,
communication, and computerization on the home life and home-based work life of
American families. It is a follow-up study to a 1984-1986 study performed by the
same researchers, and an investigation of new areas that have resulted from the
recent emergence of new technologies. The project is unique because of the
longitudinal opportunity to compare current circumstance with past situations.
The project will (1) develop and test a theoretical model that gives the best
understanding of household adoption and use of new computing technologies and
their diffusion into various aspects of home life; (2) assess the extent to
which these new technologies have become available to American homes, the nature
of their use, and the types of adopters and users; (3) study the impact of these
technologies on family life; (4) uncover what have been the significant changes
in uses and impacts that have occurred in the last 10 years; and (5) uncover
what are the perceptions of and possibilities for social changes wrought by new
computing technologies in the home. The study will be based on a national sample
of 600 households with computers and 400 households without.
