Conjugation is an efficient means for transfer of genetic information among
diverse bacterial species and leads to the dissemination of a variety of traits,
including antibiotic resistance determinants and catabolic pathways. Conjugation
relies on a donor cell engaging a recipient cell to form a mating pair,
assembling an apparatus in the cell envelope through which DNA can be
transferred, and processing DNA to produce the transferred substrate. In a
broader context, the process of conjugation is related to a mechanism that
pathogens use to export virulence determinants into eukaryotic cells. This
project focuses on the characterization of the DNA transfer stage of bacterial
conjugation for the F plasmid of Escherichia coli, using both genetic and
biochemical approaches. Experiments will explore the nature of the apparatus
that mediates the passage of the transferred DNA molecule through the membrane
and how this apparatus contacts the DNA processing machinery. The studies will
define important domains for different transfer (Tra) proteins involved in these
processes (specifically, TraI, TraD, and TraM) and test interactions between
those proteins. A collection of TraD and TraI mutants will enable analysis of
relevant protein structure and protein-protein interactions. Comparisons of the
behaviors of wildtype and mutant proteins will test for the importance of
observed interactions to the conjugation process.
