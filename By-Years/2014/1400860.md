The dynamics of the tropical Indian Ocean represent a major wildcard in the
projections of many large-scale aspects of the climate system. In principle, the
strength of the South Asian monsoon, the inter-ocean linkages of interannual-
centennial variability throughout the tropics, and the expression of greenhouse
gas induced warming of the upper ocean must all be influenced by, or mediated
through the tropical thermocline. Despite its importance, there are a number of
first order questions about the dynamics and variability in this system that
remain unanswered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this work is to
collect and analyze sediment cores from an under-sampled region with the
eventual goal of resolving the mid- to upper tropical Indian Ocean dynamics over
ice age cycles. The project takes advantage of a student training expedition
that will focus primarily on geophysical mapping of the Sunda Arc, but also
allow ample time for surveying and gravity coring of nearby areas. Follow-on
work will include laboratory-based analysis of the those sediment cores to
establish&lt;br/&gt;stratigraphic context and to test the potential of new
methods (e.g., individual foraminiferal analysis) for addressing the overall
objectives of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impact of
this project lies in the exceptional opportunity for heuristic student training
in oceanographic sample and data collection. Students will experience the
sediment coring process from start to finish--from the strategic design of the
cruise plan, through the shipboard execution of gravity coring, and ultimately
to the scientific applications. The outcomes of the coring and surveys will also
provide the basis for larger basin-wide initiatives to study long-timescale
tropical climate change.
