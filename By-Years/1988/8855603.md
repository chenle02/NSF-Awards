The Project Jason Museum Network, comprising a group of some 10 science museums
throughout the United States and represented in this proposal by the Franklin
Institute, requests partial support of a major experiment in the use of
electronic field trips organized by Dr. Robert Ballard and associates at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Over a two week period in May 1989, a series
of satellite television transmissions will provide more than 150,000 students at
some dozen museums with live, two way interactive TV coverage of a significant
underwater archaeological expedition in the central Mediterranean Sea carried
out by Dr. Ballard's group. The research expedition will be widely publicized,
with public interest and attention similar to that obtained during his
explorations of the Titanic. A variety of archaelological, oceanographic, and
technological programs will be provided to museums through a Project Jason
Satellite Network established for the purpose; participating schools, teachers
and school children will already be familiar with the project and its methods
through curriculum materials developed by NSTA with support from NSF's
Instructional Materials Development program. An extensive evaluation program
will accompany the first year's effort, and the Network plans to continue
providing material from Project Jason for several additional years. In addition,
other forms of distance learning will be investigated and developed using the
infrastructure developed for Project Jason. Overall, more than a million
individuals will view programs provided by the network in live presentations or
later videotapes. Direct cost sharing by the Network Members is more than $3
million, with similar amounts contributed by Dr. Ballard's group at Woods Hole.
