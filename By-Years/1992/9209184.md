This research project focuses on parallel computation. Its aim is to advance the
basic understanding of parallel computers. The primary goals are to develop new
techniques to solve problems efficiently in parallel, to produce new parallel
approximation algorithms, to determine why some problems do not parallelize
well, and to address the parallel complexity of some fundamental open problems.
Problems from three general areas: algebra, geometry, and graph theory will be
studied.
