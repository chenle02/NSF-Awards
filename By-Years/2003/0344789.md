Title: The Behavioral Genetics and Evolution of Cricket Song&lt;br/&gt;P.I.:
Kerry L. Shaw Co-P.I.: Patrick D. Danley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The behavioral
traits that contribute to reproductive behavior often change rapidly and may
spur the creation of new species. Understanding how changes in reproductive
behavior, and the potential differentiation of species, is critically dependent
on knowing which genes contribute to behavioral variation and how these genes
act to produce these behaviors in the developing organism. The genetic basis of
cricket song, a model behavior involved in the reproductive behavior of
crickets, will be studied in the Hawaiian genus Laupala. Species of Laupala are
ideal for studying the connection between genes and behavior because (1)
neurobiologists have long studied cricket song, (2) the function of cricket song
has been intensively studied, (3) closely related species possess different male
songs, which suggests that cricket song has played a role in the creation of new
species, and (4) the way in which cricket songs have changed are valuable for
testing evolutionary hypotheses. In the proposed research, the genetic basis of
naturally occurring variation in pulse rate of the male calling song will be
studied in closely related species. Genetic tools will be developed to identify
genes influencing male song and to correlate the activity of these genes with
differences in male calling song across multiple species. The hypothesis that
will be tested is that genes underlying the development of singing behavior in
crickets are the same genes that underlie natural behavioral variation.
