9451911 Fennessey The chemistry component of the environmental studies program
has a heavy emphasis on instrumental methods, primarily for water chemistry.
This emphasis includes an extended sequence in infra-red spectroscopy which
begins in General Chemistry. This area of study is being served by a FT-IR
allowing instructional program to extend to significant environmental
applications in a) air chemistry ( with a long path gas cell ), b) water
chemistry ( using a Circle cell and other ATR devices ), and c) eluate
identification with GLC, HPLC and TLC. The instrument is also being used by the
Biology Department for respiration studies of small mammals.
