have profound effects on physiology and behavior later in life, which may alter
the ability of individuals to grow, compete for resources and reproduce, or may
predispose them to disease. The effects of stress during early development are
likely to be mediated by elevated levels of stress hormones (glucocorticoids)
that serve to 'program' gene expression in the brain and other organs, leading
to stable, long term changes in physiological function. This research is
investigating the roles that glucocorticoids play in shaping the development of
the neuroendocrine stress axis, which plays a key role in controlling behavior
and physiology. For this work the investigators are using tadpoles and juveniles
of the frog Xenopus tropicalis. The research is multidisciplinary, relying on
immunohistochemical, endocrine, and behavioral approaches, and state-of-the-art
molecular genetic and genome-wide analyses. This research will provide basic
knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which early life
stress alters later life physiology and behavior in vertebrates. This work is
also important for understanding the impacts of environmental degradation on the
health of amphibian populations. Environmental insults during the tadpole stage
can lead to lasting effects that could impact adult fecundity and survival, and
thus contribute to population declines and extinctions. Understanding this
potential, and the mechanisms involved is essential to devising effective
conservation strategies. This grant supports the training of a postdoctoral
scientist, a woman Ph.D. graduate student, and provides opportunities for
undergraduate honors students to participate in research that will encourage the
pursuit of careers in science.
