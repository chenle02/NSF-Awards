This research is aimed at the development of a speaker- independent phonetic
classification system for continuous speech which retains the statistical and
automatic-training capabilities of implicit representational strategies, while
accommodating explicit and intuitive descriptions of recognition vocabularies.
The classifier is being implemented within a recognition framework with three
main components: a finite-state pronunciation network whose branches correspond
to linguistically well-defined units; a set of generalized acoustic pattern
matchers; and a segment-based dynamic programming search. A primary feature of
this framework is its ability to incorporate acoustic-phonetic features computed
over variable-duration, segment-sized units of the speech signal, in addition to
the general fixed-rate acoustic measures typically employed in traditional
pattern-matching systems.
