9622258 Wickert Webs are flat continuous strips of thin materials like paper,
cloth, plastic, sheet metal, or magnetic tape, that are transported during
manufacture or use at high speed and under tension. While the material that
comprises the web may vary, high speeds and precise control are common goals for
web handling systems. This project will investigate two technical problems that
limit the performance of web transport systems. First is air entrapment that
occurs when winding a web onto a spool. The second performance limiting problem
is mechanical wrinkling caused by misalignment of the guides in a web transport
system. The experimental part of the research uses a non-contact laser
interferometer system to measure web vibration at high speeds, transient
vibrations during spooling, and the unstable response of the web at the onset of
wrinkling. Complementing this experimental work will be development of a dynamic
model of the web that will include coupling between the elastic deformation and
pressure cause by entrapped air, and the non-uniform in plane stresses caused by
guide misalignment. Increased fundamental understanding of web transport
dynamics is one of the contributions of this research. In addition, these
results will lead to solutions to the air entrapment and wrinkling problem,
increasing the stability and performance of web handling systems.
