This applicant proposes to study the role of the zinc ions in the reaction
mechanism of alkaline phosphatase. Specifically, he plans to substitute 113-Cd
2+ for the zinc ions which will allow more detailed study using Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance spectrometry. The work is planned to take place in the laboratory of
Professor Joseph Coleman at Yale University.
