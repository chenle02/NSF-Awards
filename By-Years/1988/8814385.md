This award will support collaborative research between Prof. H. James Simpson of
Columbia University, and Dr. Graham B. Allison of the Adelaide Laboratory of the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research. The investigators will employ
stable isotope analysis of river water and agricultural drainage to investigate
how much water is lost by transpiration, and how much by evaporation, from the
irrigation network in Australia's Murray River system. The project combines the
expertise of the investigators, who are both experts in water composition
analysis using radioactive techniques. While this research could lead, in the
short term, to the improvement of the water and salinity budgets of Australia's
important Murray River agriculture zone, it should also demonstrate the general
potential of stable isotope methods in management of large irrigation networks.
