The project is to develop a dynamic experimental facility for testing of semi-
active control devices and their use for response control of structures
subjected to earthquake induced ground motions. The electro-magnetic high force
actuator, data acquisition systems, digital signal processing board systems and
dynamic response transducers will be used to prepare a shaking platform to test
structures provided with electro-rheological and magneto-rheological semi-active
devices. This laboratory facility will be used to test semi-active device
designs, smart sensor systems and parametric structural control systems.
