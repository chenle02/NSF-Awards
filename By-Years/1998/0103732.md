0103732&lt;br/&gt;Wubah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the James Madison
University (JMU) UMEB is to recruit, mentor and train minority students to
become productive scientists through "hands-on" research experiences. The
program will be built on existing partnerships with Blue Ridge Community College
(BRCC) and Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC). Students recruited from
the participating institutions will progress from performing experiments
proposed by a JMU faculty mentor to designing their own workable experiments to
solve specific environmental problems in the Shenandoah
Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Students and two community college faculty members
will be assigned to a laboratory during the residential summer program. In
addition, faculty and participants will take part in seminars presented by
scientists, weekly group research meetings, journal clubs, workshops in
scientific writing, career development and graduate school admission process and
field trips to selected sites. The summer program will end with a research
symposium, where students will present their research in oral and poster
formats. During the academic year, students in the Harrisonburg area will
continue their research and seminars will be held through videoconferencing with
NVCC participants. The program will provide a supportive network that will
develop skills needed to succeed as environmental scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
