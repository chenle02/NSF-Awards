A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement
instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research
vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. The University of Hawaii (UH) supports two
research vessels that provide platforms for research in the fields of
oceanography, marine biology, geology and atmospheric science. They request
funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation and equipment in support of the
multidisciplinary NSF/UNOLS projects to be undertaken on R/V Kilo Moana in 2012.
In order of priority, they propose: 1) Acquisition of spares for EM 710
Multibeam Sonar $113,329 2) Multi-year plan to upgrade and maintain underway DAS
on Kilo Moana $49,982 $163,311

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
