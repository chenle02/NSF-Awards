9217217 Lanni The goal of this project is the construction of a fluorescence
microscope for high-speed, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of
biological specimens. The approach to be taken is a direct extension of
Standing-Wave Fluorescence Microscopy, demonstrated in this laboratory
previously. The proposed instrument will incorporate a laser-based optical
system for excitation field sYnthesis, in which standing wave fields are time-
multiplexed in the specimen to create an effective intensity field that is
peaked at the in-focus object plane. Fluorescence emission will therefore be
excited maximally from only in-focus object features. Serial focal plane images
will then be recorded in the usual way, by use of an electronic (CCD) camera.
The optical transfer function for this field-synthesis fluorescence microscope
(FSFM) covers a band of axial spatial frequencies not accessible through
classical optical sectioning microscopy. In principle, this instrument has the
speed and transverse resolution of an imaging system, and axial resolution
comparable to or better than a scanning confocal microscope. The significance of
this project in the biological sciences can be stated concisely. Microscopes are
most severely limited in axial, as opposed to transverse, resolution. This
problem is rectified by confocal scanning, but with a loss of the fast,
efficient information transfer that occurs in direct image formation. In many
biological problems, particularly in studies of live cells, speed and
photometric efficiency are primary constraints. The field-synthesis fluorescence
microscope is designed specifically to give improved axial resolution while
still retaining the high-performance characteristics of an imaging system.
