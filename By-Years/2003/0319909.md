This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
printable conducting polymers&lt;br/&gt;that can be used to produce polymeric
electronic devices. The printable conducting polymers&lt;br/&gt;envisioned are
initially soluble and become insoluble and spatially fixed after exposure to
ultraviolet&lt;br/&gt;light, thus a positive resist of the conducting polymer
material can be produced with standard printing&lt;br/&gt;processes. This Phase
I project will build on the soluble conducting polymer technology, and add the
ability to form positive resists for polymeric electronics. Conducting polymers
with a conductivity of 10 to 300 S/cm that can be printed into electronic
components for flat panel displays and organic electronics will be developed.
This proposal addressed the need to fabricate large area devices, such as
displays, by a room temperature printing
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include conducting
components of polymeric displays including flexible&lt;br/&gt;display electrodes
and addressing lines, hole injection layers, and printed wiring boards,
other&lt;br/&gt;flexible or non-flexible polymeric electronic chips, EMI
shielding and antistatic coatings.&lt;br/&gt;
