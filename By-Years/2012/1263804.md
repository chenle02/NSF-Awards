This engineering education research project seeks to create a constructionist
exhibit at the New York Hall of Science and use the exhibit to understand how
informal engineering activities change students' pathways in ways that can
eventually lead to more students pursuing engineering degrees, a current
national priority. To understand the impact on students, particularly those in
middle school, the project will log student activities and interaction with
museum staff as well as collect post-visit data from
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project arises from the potential to inform how museum exhibits, which
annually reach millions of students, can be used to increase the number of
students who follow pathways to eventual engineering careers. The project will
reach large numbers of students from groups currently under-represented in
engineering degree programs. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for
addressing societal challenges through engineering.
