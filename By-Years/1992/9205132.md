The 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo is estimated to have produced about 1 km3 of
ashfall and 7 km3 of pyroclastic flows. Much of this volcaniclastic material
remains metastably perched on the flanks of the edifice. Massive lahars are
expected to be generated during the wet seasons of the next several years, and
possibly of the next decade. Owing to the extraordinary thickness of accumulated
pyroclastic debris, hot lahars are expected to occur for the next one or two
years. This presents an invaluable opportunity to study how both hot and cold
rain lahars are generated and how they behave, especially how they are different
from one another. This project, therefore, is intended to: (1) closely
coordinate scientific observation and documentation of lahars on the west side
of the volcano; (2) update lahar-hazard maps and transmit warnings when lahars
are imminent; (3) train Filipino scientists to study lahars and their deposits;
and (4) develop educational materials to instruct scientists, decision-makers,
and laymen in the Philippines and elsewhere.
