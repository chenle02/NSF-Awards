9318674 Gaffey Investigations of Asteroid Families and Shapes. Most asteroids
are fragments of collisionally disrupted planetesimals, and many asteroid
families are such disrupted bodies in an early stage of dispersal.
Investigations of individual parent body fragments and of asteroid families
provide information on the early inner Solar System transient thermal events
which heated their parent bodies, the internal structures of their parent
planetesimals resulting from planetary differentiation, and the large scale
collisions which fragmented them. Dr. Gaffey will conduct observations to
investigate asteroid shapes and asteroid families. Mineralogic compositions of
asteroid family members will be determined from spectra to test the genetic
models of asteroid families, to identify interlopers within families, to test
the reality of proposed families with small memberships, to constrain the
lifetimes of asteroid families, and to evaluate the internal structure of the
parent planetesimals of interesting and important families.
