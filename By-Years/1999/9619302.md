AST- 9619302 Lunar Laser Ranging at McDonald Observatory. Lunar laser ranging
data play a vital role within various astronomical sciences. They form a firm
foundation upon which many fundamental astronomical disciplines stand. They
contribute in areas such as the solid Earth sciences, geodesy and geodynamics,
Solar System ephemerides, terrestrial and celestial reference frames, lunar
physics, general relativity, and gravitational theory. With this award Dr. Peter
Shelus will enhance the collection of lunar laser ranging data at McDonald
Observatory to produce near-real-time Earth orientation parameters and will
develop and implement a Baysian statistics based data identification and quality
control package to improve the quality and efficiency of the product.
