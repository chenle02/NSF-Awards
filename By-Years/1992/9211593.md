In this proposal we motivate an operator condition central to the resolution of
robust design issues connected with (1) design of a computationally simple
adaptive identifier used in many practical adaptive infinite impulse response
(IIR) filtering applications; and (2) design of robust tracking controllers for
uncertain plants having possibly unstable inverses. Our proposed study will
involve a thorough investigation of the aforementioned operator condition. The
primary objective is to focus on the development of coherent design and
robustness analysis methodologies which meet the needs of the problems stated in
the foregoing.
