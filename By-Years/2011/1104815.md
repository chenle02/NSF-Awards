This project will use computer simulations to study the formation and evolution
of flux transfer events (FTEs) at the dayside magnetopause of the Earth. The
primary tool for the simulations will be 3-Dimensional hybrid simulations
(kinetic particle treatment of ions with electrons treated as a fluid) but the
will also use full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in a few cases to examine
issues regarding electron acceleration during FTE events. Results from the
hybrid simulations will be compared with global MHD simulations to determine how
the introduction of ion kinetic effects changes the dynamics of an FTE event.
The results will also be compared with observations from a variety of satellite
missions (primarily NASA's Geotail and the European Space Agency's Cluster
mission).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flux transfer events are an important class of
magnetic reconnection events that transport energy from the solar wind into the
magnetosphere. Understanding FTE events requires global simulations in a
realistic geometry and with realistic (and changing) solar wind conditions. It
is only in the past few years that high performance computing capabilities have
reached the petaflops scale that is necessary to do these simulations. The
results from this work have the potential to transform our understanding of how
and why these events occur. The project has strong educational benefits because
graduate students will be involved with using the state-of-the-art computer
codes and the state-of-the-art visualization tools. The project also includes
using the results from the research in public outreach activities, particularly
targeted toward K-12 schools with large, socio-economically disadvantaged
students.
