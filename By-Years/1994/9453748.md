9453748 Bendet School-based SMART is an institutionalized model program designed
to encourage and educate elementary school-age girls to understand that
mathematics and science are important and relevant to them. SMART provides girls
with active instructional and motivational support in pursuing education and
employment opportunities in these fields. It enhances the existent math and
science curricula by providing hands-on activities in a single-sex environment
that encourages girls to take risks and learn by doing. Every 4th and 5th grade
girl in selected schools is involved in the program, thus eliminating the self-
selection factor inherent in other after-school models. School-based SMART
proposes to give young female students positive and empowering experiences with
science and mathematics within the school setting. The SMART model and
curriculum give girls the confidence to assume positions of leadership in their
co-educational classes. Additionally, heightened administrative awareness of
gender equity issues, in relation to science and mathematics, will be achieved
as a result of the integration of the SMART model. Teacher in-service training
and family education are significant components included in the project's
design. The project includes an outside evaluation and plans for national
dissemination through Girls Incorporated affiliates. ***
