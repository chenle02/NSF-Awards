Many applications of digital image understanding require modeling and analysis
of flexible structures or turbulent fluid flow. Dr. Huang will supervise three
graduate students working on perception and analysis of nonrigid motion in such
applications as heart motion analysis for medical diagnosis, human face motion
for intelligent image compression, and vortex tracking for interpretation of
turbulent flow. Emphasis will be placed on concepts, methodologies, and
techniques applicable to many types of nonrigid objects.
