9415437 Sorooshian The classical approach to model calibration has been taken as
far as it can go. Currently available calibration strategies are poorly suited
to the task of calibrating conceptual hydrologic models in general and are
woefully inadequate in the face of the emerging generation of distributed
parameter hydrologic models. An entirely new conceptual paradigm is necessary
for further progress to be made. The work will explore the use of multi-
objective procedures for the objective identification of the non-dominated model
set, and graphical visualization techniques to facilitate the subjective
procedure inherent in choosing a reduced model set. The exploratory research
will lead to the preparation and submission to NSF, within 9 months of a full
scale proposal addressing the problem of calibrating semi-distributed and
distributed hydrologic models within the framework of the new paradigm.
