This award will support the research activities of the principal investigators
as well as the visitor program. The investigators and visitors conduct research
in the broad area of stochastic processes and their applications. Specific
research topics include non-guassian models and digital processing of random
analog signals, infinite dimensional stochastic differential equations with
applications to neuroscience; nonlinear filtering and random fields, and
stochastic extremes and point processes. This project is being jointly supported
by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, the
University of North Carolina, and the National Science Foundation. This award
will support the research activities of the principal investigators as well as
the visitor program. The investigators and visitors conduct research in the
broad area of stochastic processes and their applications. The visitor program
supports short- and long-term senior and junior visitors. This project is being
jointly supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army
Research Office, the University of North Carolina, and the National Science
Foundation.
