This award supports the development of an instrument for Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopic measurement of biological pigment-
protein complexes in the 1000-140 cm-1 spectral region. At present few
instruments can perform measurements on biological samples below ~1000 cm-1.
Instruments that do have sensitivity below ~1000 cm-1 are inherently slow, and
measurements typically extend over several days. Here, an instrument will be
constructed with sensitivity down to ~140 cm-1, with data acquisition rates at
least two orders of magnitude superior to existing instruments. Such an
instrument will make far-IR difference measurements of biological samples
simpler. The main advance is in the fabrication, testing and incorporation of
new fast and sensitive far-infrared detectors into our FTIR instrumentation.
Extension of FTIR difference techniques down to ~140 cm-1 is highly desirable as
it will open up a window where the bonds between metals and organic ligands
(Mn.O, Mg.N, Fe.N, Fe.S), characteristic of a large number of the protein
cofactors can be directly investigated.
