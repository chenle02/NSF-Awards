This project is developing and evaluating a Strand Map Service to provide an
interactive and flexible interface to educational resources in the National STEM
Digital Library (NSDL). Strand maps depict the interrelationship of science
learning goals based on the AAAS Benchmarks for Science Literacy and the NRC
National Science Education Standards. These learning goals describe what
learners should know, or be able to do, at key stages in their education. The
service enables educators and learners 1) to discover educational resources that
support the learning goals, or benchmarks, articulated in the strand maps; 2) to
browse the interconnected learning goals in the strand maps; and 3) to enhance
their own content knowledge by using the service to explore important background
information on the learning goals, such as prior research on student
misconceptions.
