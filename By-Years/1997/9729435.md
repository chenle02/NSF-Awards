While the surface environments of the planet Earth are dominated by the oceans,
the vast majority of analytical discussions of environmental ethics address
terrestrial or fresh-water environments. Efforts made to date to address marine
environmental ethics have focused on particular topics, like whaling or
fisheries management. Additionally, unlike the terrestrial or fresh-water
environments, human impact on the oceans remains relatively unregulated. The
objective of this project is to develop a holistic approach to marine
environmental ethics that can contribute to improving theory and practice, as
well as policy discussions in this area. The project has several phases. While
investigating various problems for ethics, policy, and marine environments, an
interdisciplinary group of faculty at the University of Georgia will develop a
syllabus for a marine environmental ethics course in the first project phase.
Since the subject is broad and new, the second phase of the project involves an
intensive, three-day workshop including outside experts to refine the syllabus
and develop contributions for a book on the topic. Once the course has been
offered and tested, there will be a week-long workshop for college-level
instructors in the areas of policy, ethics, and marine sciences who wish to
incorporate marine environmental ethics into their course offerings. The
investigators will also initiate day long short courses on marine environmental
ethics for resource users, policy makers, and citizen groups. The combination of
theoretical research, expert workshops, teaching workshops, curriculum
development, and outreach to user groups will increase the body of knowledge
about ethics of the marine environment. The investigators propose to develop an
ethical framework that will serve as a guide to policy makers and as a basis for
graduate education in marine ethics.
