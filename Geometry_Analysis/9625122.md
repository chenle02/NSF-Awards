9625122 Weinstein This project lies in the general area of mathematical physics.
The investigator aims to apply methods of symplectic and Poisson geometry, and
Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, to the study of operators on manifolds and
more generally quantization problems. More specifically, this project will
develop microlocal analysis adapted to the Bruhat decomposition of generalized
flag manifolds, and pursue a proof of an index theorem for Fourier integral
operators and formulate a theory of Poisson modules, with applications to
systems of linear partial differential equations. Symplectic geometry is a
mathematical tool used to lay a theoretical framework encompassing large parts
of classical mechanics. Ideas from symplectic geometry and Poisson geometry can
be used to explain and predict various mechanical phenomena - e.g., locomotion
generation and motion control - in an elegant manner.
