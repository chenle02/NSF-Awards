9354712 Holland The problems we address are not unique to Baruch College:
student lack of interest in science; lack of problem solving skills; lack of
feeling of connection with science and scientists; and low numbers of students
going on to study science beyond the introductory courses. Our overall goals
are: to increase scientific literacy and problem solving skills of undergraduate
non-science majors; to stimulate students to study science beyond the required
courses; to encourage more students to prepare for scientific careers in
research, teaching, or science writing; to provide teaching/learning experiences
for science majors; to create a sense of community among scientists, both
students and faculty, at Baruch. We propose the following specific curricular
changes: (1) introduction of journalistic methods into introductory courses in
Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Environmental Studies; (2) development of a new
interdisciplinary Science/Journalism course with a laboratory component. Our
target audience is undergraduate students: non-science majors in introductory
courses, journalism students considering careers in science journalism, and
science majors who will serve as teaching assistants/peer mentors in this
program. During the two project years this will involve 800 students; when the
proposed curricular changes are fully institutionalized, approximately 2500
students per year will benefit. The methods developed here have wide application
beyond Baruch College. Changes in introductory science courses, the only science
most undergraduates take, will have the most impact on scientific literacy and
problem solving skills. The science/journalism course, a truly interdisciplinary
course including a laboratory component, can serve as a model for other
institutions. ***y
