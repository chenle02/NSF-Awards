This proposal is a request for ancillary equipment that is essential for the
optimal operation of two tandem mass spectrometers used for carbohydrate
research. Modern research grade MS and MS-MS instruments are all designed to be
run routinely in both electrospray (ESI) mode (for liquid chromatography, i.e.,
LC-MS or LC-MS-MS) and electron impact/chemical ionization (EI/CI) mode (for gas
chromatography, i.e., GC-MS or GC-MS-MS). Analysis of carbohydrates by
conventional LC has made great progress in recent years. A new LC system has
been developed involving a patented ion exchange column and pulsed amperometric
detector (PAD) which has become the "gold standard" in sugar analysis. Obtaining
this LC will allow us to extend from ESI-MS-MS into the field of ESI-MS-MS. This
represents the state-of-the-art in carbohydrate analysis.
