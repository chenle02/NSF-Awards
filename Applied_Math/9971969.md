Self-similar behavior is evident in many physical systems including the rupture
of thin films, the pinching of thin liquid threads or solid necks, and the
spreading of liquid drops. This research seeks to increase the understanding of
self-similarity by viewing the mathematical models for these phenomena in the
context of dynamical systems theory. Self-similar solutions can be thought of as
steady equilibria in a rescaled coordinate system that is "zooming" to match the
scale of the phenomena. Most of these models have an infinite number of self-
similar solutions. The foremost goal of this project is the development of a
stability theory that will identify which solution is dynamically selected by
the model.

The ideas developed in this project will provide mathematicians, engineers and
physicists with a set of tools for analyzing self-similar dynamics. A phenomenon
is self-similar if it appears to be unchanging once the time scale is suitably
accelerated or slowed down and the spatial scale is also adjusted. For example,
integrated circuits rely on the deposition of thin metallic traces on a
substrate; this research will help determine when these traces will break during
fabrication and elucidate the details of how the break occurs, since there is
often self-similar behavior near the critical event. Thin fluid films are
created in the application of paint, adhesives and optical coatings; the
techniques developed in this project should describe when and how films rupture
and help devise strategies for preventing these defects, which often develop in
a self-similar way. This grant will also underwrite the research of Harvey Mudd
College undergraduates who will become an integral part of this investigation.
