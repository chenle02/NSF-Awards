The research enabled by the supported infrastructure has the potential to
dramatically impact society in two ways. First, by undermining entire cyber-
crime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social
networks through strategic intervention. Inhibiting the flow of money reduces
the profitability of these activities, thereby subverting the key incentive
underlying modern cybercrime. Second, improved efficiency of data center
networks will significantly reduce operating costs and increase energy
efficiency. The infrastructure will also create educational opportunities for
students at a variety of levels, expanding the research skills of postdoc,
graduate, and undergraduate students to address both data center network design
and security research challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to pursue
two separate multi-year research agendas. One is to collect and analyze
extremely large datasets pertaining to various aspects of Internet malware and
cybercrime while concurrently exploring new high-performance hybrid
optical/electrical network architectures that dramatically decrease the cost and
complexity of the infrastructure required to support such analytics. This award
supports compute and storage resources to both conduct the analytics required
for the Ecrime research, while simultaneously serving as a testbed for our
prototype hybrid network switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research enabled by
this infrastructure has two key components: 1) Through in-depth empirical
analyses of a range of online criminal activities, the PIs are developing an
understanding of the shape of key economic and social forces---as seen at scale
---in terms of relevance for both attackers and defenders. 2) Characterizing
network traffic generated by large-scale data analytics, focusing specifically
on identifying the class of network traffic that a circuit switch can support as
well as the partitioning of the traffic between the circuit and packet portions
of the network.
