9350902 Dugan The project creates an instrumentation repair and maintenance
service for small colleges in Appalachia and surrounding regions in Kentucky,
Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These small academic
institutions must buy and use modern scientific instruments so their mostly
rural students are not at a disadvantage compared to those at major
universities. Factory service for these instruments is, however, prohibitively
expensive, and they are often idle when in need of repair due to this high cost.
This program addresses this need by utilizing the service infrastructure at the
University of Kentucky College of Engineering as a support base of technical
expertise to keep these instruments operational at affordable costs to the small
colleges. Startup funding is being provided by the grant, and through user fees
the colleges are contributing an increasing share of the costs as the program
becomes fully established.
