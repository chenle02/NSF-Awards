Utilizing NSF support, the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at Southern
Illinois University will renovate approximately 12,000 square feet of laboratory
space for the benefit of research and research training activities. NSF funds,
combined with matching support from the campus, will reconfigure large, poorly
designed facilities which reflect the inadequacies of 34 year old building
design. Constructed as an instructional facility, the large laboratories are
inefficient, and many are shared by two researchers. The hood space is limited
and is unable to effectively vent toxic fumes. The vacuum systems are weak. The
NSF-supported effort will correct these deficiencies and allow for the design of
space according to the more specialized needs of seven researchers' individual
programs. These programs include studies in analytical and organic chemistry
with special emphasis in the following specific research areas: synthetic and
physical organic chemistry, catalysis, separations theory and atomic
spectroscopy.
