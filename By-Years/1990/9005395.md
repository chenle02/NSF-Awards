The mid-Cretaceous paleogeography and tectonic setting of southwestern British
Columbia is part of a larger problem along the Pacific Northwest continental
margin. This project continues study of the Tyaughton-Methow basin that records
the mid- Cretaceous history of this area. Prior results have clarified the
relative contribution of convergent vs strike-slip tectonics and this work will
address facies models, paleocurrent data, petrologic data and geochemistry of
the arc volcanics and volcanic sediments to determine back-arc/forearc
positions, subduction zone polarity and the spatial configuration of volcanic
arcs in relation to the ancient margin. Results will add to the regional picture
of terrain amalgamation, accretion and dispersal along the Pacific Northwest.
