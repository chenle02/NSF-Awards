New Guinea's lowland tropical forests are vast and are largely connected. Animal
species living in lowland forests are often common and continuously distributed
throughout these lowlands (in essentially a ring around the central mountain
ranges of New Guinea). However, lowland forest species often show tremendous
amounts of genetic or phenotypic variation. We hypothesize that this variation
is due largely to geographic or geologic history, and we propose several
testable hypotheses that might account for this variation (including specific
historical events or dispersal barriers, habitat differences, and multiple
competing evolutionary processes). We will use analyses of mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA sequence variation from six common, widespread focal bird species to
determine which evolutionary models best explain the pattern and sources of
variation in New Guinea's lowland forests.

This study will be the first to employ modern genetic data and analyses to the
phylogeography of lowland New Guinea. We expect these data to identify lowland
biogeographic provinces heretofore unrecognized, and it will therefore have
important implications for conservation planning. Our biological evidence will
provide independent estimates of the timing of geologic events. In addition,
this study will employ and critically examine new phylogeographic analyses that
are still maturing. We hope to critically examine the assumptions and uses of
these tests in complex geographical regions, such as New Guinea. Finally, the
project will train 6-8 New Guinea biology students who will receive practical
experience in field techniques, systematics, and evolutionary biology.
