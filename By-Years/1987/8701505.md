Linda Keen will work on problems in the theory of conformal dynamical systems
which are concerned with accesory parameter problems from Riemann surface
theory. Lisa Goldberg will also carry out research in complex dynamics. She will
investigate problems which include the computation of the fundamental group of
the moduli space of a generic rational map and the analysis of the action of an
expanding entire map on its Julia set. The general problem of characterising
conjugacy classes of entire functions is the main focus of Keen's research. She
will work principally with the class of functions with no critical points and
finitely many asymptotic values. Goldberg will try to find extensions of results
in the category of Kleinian groups to certain classes of meromorphic functions.
In order to study the dynamics of these functions it is essential to investigate
the geometry of the corresponding Julia sets and stable sets.
