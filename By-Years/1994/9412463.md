9412463 Reid Dr. Reid, at Cal Tech, will participate on a collaborative project
with Drs. Ian Thompson and Steven Majewski, at the Carnegie Institution, which
involves the first systematic study of a classical starcount problem using
modern detectors. Starcounts -- the stellar magnitude distribution as a function
of Galactic latitude and longitude -- have served as an effective probe of the
overall structure of our Galaxy for many years. Despite considerable interest in
Galactic structure, little new starcount data have been published in the past
decade. The aim of this project is to obtain deep, accurate observations with
state-of-the-art detectors to test and improve on an interim Galactic model
prepared by these researchers. With a profusion of parameters that define a
starcount model (including the density laws, luminosity functions, and three-
dimensional form of each population and sub-population) further observations are
essential to test how well the interim model matches the Galactic structure.
These researchers aim to produce a model of the Galaxy which is globally self-
consistent and physically interpretable.
