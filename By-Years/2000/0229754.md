The investigators will determine the nature of the connection between recurrent,
localized flashes of Calcium-II emission in the solar chromosphere and the
underlying magnetohydrodynamics of the photosphere. Hydrodynamic models of
stellar atmospheres suggest that these "cell flashes" are a product of shocks
generated by seismic events in the photosphere. The main effort is to use
magnetograms and other optical observations made at Big Bear Solar Observatory
to investigate the relationship of the flashes to magnetic fields in the quiet
solar chromosphere. A series of spatially co-registered images of Iron emission
from the Vacuum Tower Telescope at Sacramento Peak Observatory will be used to
map acoustic surges, which are a type of seismic event previously identified. By
comparing observed locations and times of acoustic surges and cell flashes the
investigators will look for evidence of a spatial and temporal correlations
between the two phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;
