This grant supports theoretical research aimed at calculating and understanding
the physical properties of strongly interacting, many-electron materials.
Numerical, as well as phenomenological analytic calculations for basic models
such as the Heisenberg, Hubbard, t-J, and the electron-phonon Holstein model are
proposed. The goal of this research is to understand the properties of specific
systems. In particular, what type of order or competing orders, such as
antiferromagnetism, charge density wave, superconductivity, stripe domain wall
formation, or hidden topological order with quantum number fractionalization
does a given system exhibit. In addition, what are the basic mechanisms
responsible for these phenomena and what limits the energy scales or
temperatures, where these various orders appear.

This group is one of the world leaders in computational studies of strongly
interacting many-body physics. %%% This grant supports theoretical research
aimed at calculating and understanding the physical properties of strongly
interacting, many-electron materials. The problems addressed are at the
forefront of of the field and the numerical methods used are state-of-the-art.
The PI has also been very successful working with students and postdoctoral
associates. ***
