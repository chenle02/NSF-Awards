This MRI grant will help support the development of a particle detector being
built by an international collaboration of scientists. The primary objective for
the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of
matter. Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons. Many other
types of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to
exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many
particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles
such as glueballs or hybrid mesons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process of
developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-
technology equipment and electronics. Some of these students go on to develop
new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many
hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners. The economic impact of a highly-
trained workforce is well-documented. The development of this equipment will
train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's
marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD.
