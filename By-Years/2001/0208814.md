The investigators organize the Gordon Research Conference
on&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics. The conference has
nine&lt;br/&gt;formal sessions, each consisting of 2-3 oral presentations
with&lt;br/&gt;an introduction by a leading scientist in the area, and
two&lt;br/&gt;afternoon poster sessions. A wide variety of topics,
ranging&lt;br/&gt;from global environmental models to mathematical neuroscience
to&lt;br/&gt;genetic regulation networks, are represented. The unifying
theme&lt;br/&gt;of the conference is quantitative modeling of complex
biological&lt;br/&gt;networks. Invited speakers are selected on the basis of
their&lt;br/&gt;expertise in the respective areas, at the same time
emphasizing&lt;br/&gt;gender balance, minority representation, and
incorporating&lt;br/&gt;promising junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt; The primary
goal of this conference is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;established and young
investigators from the field of&lt;br/&gt;quantitative biology to share their
approaches and progress and&lt;br/&gt;to discuss the perspectives. Such a
multidisciplinary conference&lt;br/&gt;is very important for identifying
challenges in biology,&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology, and medicine that require
quantitative modeling&lt;br/&gt;and computational approach. Moreover, the
participation of&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs helps to increase the number of
people&lt;br/&gt;working in areas of quantitative biology.
