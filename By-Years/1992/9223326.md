This project will develop a set of collaborative studies about social change,
health, and demographic behavior in Russia. Travel support will allow training
and design of future waves of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. RLMS
data will be used to examine: (1) living arrangements and welfare of the
elderly; (2) role dynamics, health and reproduction; (3) female-headed
households; (4) dynamics of abortion and conception. Not only will this project
strengthen international scientific cooperation between the United States and
Russia, but it will place Russian sociological data-gathering on a much more
rigorous basis. One result will be a substantial body of data about Russian
family well-being and demographics during a period of vast and rapid social
transformation.
