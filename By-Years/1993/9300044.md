This project addresses the properties of superfluid He-3 and spin- polarized
He-3/He-4 mixtures. He-3 serves as model complex superfluid. Experiments on this
system relate to other highly correlated systems, including high-Tc
superconductors. The collective modes in the superfluids will be investigated by
acoustical methods, including second-sound. Additional experiments will use
nuclear magnetic resonance as a characterization probe. The experiments on
dilute spin polarized He-3/He-4 mixtures will focus on relaxation process in the
fluids which arise via domain wall or soliton motion in the fluids. A goal of
the research is to determine the relative importance of direct radiation of
radiofrequency, as compared with radiation of spin waves, as a domain wall moves
in a magnetic field. %%% This project investigates the fundamental properties of
fluids at very low temperatures. These "superfluids" exhibit behavior related to
high-temperature superconductors, whose properties remain unexplained. The
superfluids also provide model system for studying fundamental thermodynamics of
fluid mixtures. Again, the results are relevant to systems at higher
temperatures and in practical conditions. Finally, the author has a facility
that provides a way to apply a very large magnetic field to the samples and
hence carry out unique experiments to study magnetic domain wall motion, and
other dynamical behavior exhibited by magnetic materials.
