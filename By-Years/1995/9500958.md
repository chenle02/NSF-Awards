9500958 Shlosman This research involves the metastable states of the Ising model
in the presence of magnetic field and the time the system needs to escape from
metastable state to the true equilibrium. The metastable states were studied
previously based on the physical level only. It seems now that there are ways to
treat these intermediate states of random systems rigorously. Concerning the
escape time, it is planned to work on proving the Aizenman-Lebowitz conjecture,
which relates the time in question with the energy the system needs to create a
droplet of critical size, which droplet then grows and covers the whole space. A
related question is the shape of the critical droplet, and the aim here is to
show that it is given by the Wulff construction. The research is centered around
the questions arising in the field of systems with random evolution. Such
questions are relevant for our understanding of the results of computer
simulations of complex models. The questions here are two-fold: the typical
behavior of the systems in question before they have time to equilibrate, and
how long this equilibration time really is. The hope to answer to both of the
questions for certain systems. ***
