Weinberg, David AST 96-16822 Dr. Weinberg will improve the Gaussian-mapping
method for studying cosmic structure formation by combining it with a dynamical
reconstruction technique. The improved method will be applied to the IRAS Point-
Source Catalog Redshift Survey and to the Optical Redshift Survey. The
reconstruction results for different cosmological parameters will be evaluated
by comparing observed and reconstructed galaxy density fields and will also be
compared to data from galaxy peculiar velocity surveys.
