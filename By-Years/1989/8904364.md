This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase a Mossbauer
spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the Principal Investigator's
laboratory in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
Washington. The remaining funds required will be provided by the University.
Mossbauer spectroscopy on Fe-57 is a valuable tool for the study of a variety of
phenomena of geochemical interest. The new spectrometer will be capable of very
high resolution and equipped with a high-temperature furnace and a liquid helium
cryostat for the study of earth materials ranging from fine-grained, poorly
crystallized iron minerals in a "desert varnish" and oceanic sediments to
minerals from igneous and metamorphic rocks and pure synthetic iron silicate
minerals. The phenomena to be studied in such samples include oxidation states,
characterization of fine- grained ("X-ray amorphous") minerals, order-disorder
in ferromagnesian silicates, thermally activated electron delocalization in
mixed-valence iron minerals and magnetic phase transitions in iron bearing
silicates.
