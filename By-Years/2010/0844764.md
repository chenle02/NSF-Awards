The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry will
support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Jennifer Shumaker-Parry of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Prof. Shumaker-Parry and her
students will develop and study unique plasmonic architectures with optical
properties that may be tailored through organized assembly and controlled
fabrication methods. Fundamental studies of the correlation of optical
properties with structure shape and assembly will form a basis for tailoring and
optimizing these plasmonic systems as enhanced platforms for sensing and
spectroscopy applications. The research will provide multidisciplinary training
for graduate and undergraduate students. Prof. Shumaker-Parry also will
integrate research in nanomaterials and spectroscopy with educational activities
focused on development of a week-long module for a summer scholars program for
in-coming freshman women interested in math and science careers and a mentoring
program for local middle school Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement
(MESA) clubs to encourage minority and female students to continue on a STEM-
based track into high school and in their careers.
