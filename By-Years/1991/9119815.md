Spin-dependent elastic and inelastic electron scattering will be used to study
the magnetism at surfaces and in ultra-thin films. The spin-dependence of
inelastic scattering in localized magnetic moment systems (3d transition metal
oxides and rare earth materials) will be studied by spin polarized electron
energy loss spectroscopy. The energy resolution will be improved by employing a
new spin detector in order to reach the energy range of collective magnetic
excitations. The spin-dependent attenuation of electron through ultra-thin
ferromagnetic overlayers will be studied by spin polarized photoemission
spectroscopy. The structure and magnetization for ultra-thin films will be
studied by combining quantitative LEED and SPLEED analysis and polarized
secondary emission spectroscopy on ultra-thin films. Spin polarized LEED
measurements will be compared to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations,
thereby allowing a simultaneous investigation of the geometric and magnetic
structure of the films.
