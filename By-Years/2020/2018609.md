Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban economy models are challenged by a growing
body of increasingly fine spatial data. This project develops a framework for
the analysis of urban policies that accounts for geographically fine data. The
project assembles data of new plant and office openings and combines them with
commuting and land price information to analyze the predictions of quantitative
spatial models. The project will provide new directions for the development of
urban economy models. These models are useful for policy makers in their
forecasts and evaluation of the effects of changes to the economic
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional quantitative spatial models
assume a continuum of agents. Therefore, conventional estimation procedures may
over-fit granular outcomes due to sampling noise. This project develops a
granular spatial-equilibrium model that features the optimizing decisions of a
finite number of individuals, as well as land and labor market clearing, leading
to endogenous prices for land and labor. The project empirically implements the
model and illustrates advances over prior econometric approaches. Furthermore,
by collecting and utilizing data on plant and office openings and commuting and
land price responses, the project evaluates predictions of spatial economic
models. These models have become increasingly popular in economic analysis and
evaluating their predictions will increase the confidence in their predictions
and lead to future research on these frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
