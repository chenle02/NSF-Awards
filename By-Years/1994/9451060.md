The the molecular biology component of the plant biochemical and physiological
curriculum at LSU-Shreveport will be enhanced by providing students enrolled in
laboratory class at several levels with the cell and tissue culture facilities
necessary for plant physiology and plant molecular biology laboratory work. The
requested equipment will be used in a series of experiments designed to enable
students to formulate and test hypotheses related to the understanding of
important concepts in plant physiology and molecular biology. In the 100 and 300
level courses, students will investigate phenomena regarding the phytohormone
ratios necessary to initiate the growth of callus tissue and to regenerate
plants from callus tissue. Students enrolled in the 400 level class will gain
experience in genetic transformations using Agrobacterium tumifaciens and
conduct experiments in gene regulation using plant tissue that has been
transformed with the GUS reporter gene system under the control of constitutive
and heat shock promoter elements. In addition to serving a pivotal role in the
instructional laboratory classes, the requested equipment also will enable
undergraduates engaged in research projects to conduct individual
investigations.
