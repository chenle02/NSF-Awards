This award provides support for the Fourth Japan-America Frontiers of
Engineering Symposium to be held November 4-6, 2004 in Japan. &lt;br/&gt;The
activity is designed to bring together a select group of American and Japanese
engineers from industry, academia, and government labs to discuss pioneering
technical work and leading edge research in various engineering fields and
industry sectors. The goal of the symposium is to facilitate an
interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and methodology that could eventually
lead to collaborative networks of engineers from the two countries.
