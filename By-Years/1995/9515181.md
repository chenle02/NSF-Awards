9515181 Ludwig The proposal is a GOALI effort with a focus on real-time, in-situ
studies of silicide kinetics in submicron silicon device structure. The proposed
research will concentrate on the study of Ti and Co interface reactions with
heavily-doped silicon substrates. Studies will be directed towards growth
kinetics with different geometrical arrays and shape combinations. Experiments
will be performed with in-situ, time-resolved, x-ray scattering measurements, to
study the silicide transformation kinetics under rapid thermal annealing
conditions on patterned submircron device structures. The results of this study
should lead to a fundamental understanding of silicide formation, which is an
essential technology for the microelectronics. industry. ***
