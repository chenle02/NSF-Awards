9315508 Lawley The goal of this project is to convert the research conducted
over the past two decades by the participating faculty into two junior level
courses aimed at students majoring in materials. The specific topics to be
included in these courses are: Clean Metals Technology, Gas Injection Processes,
Melt Atomization, Spray Coating and Powder Processing. About 10 to 15% of the
courses will be taught by industrial partners who will bring into the classroom
the practice of the identified technologies. The lecture materials will be
published and disseminated to other schools and institutions.
