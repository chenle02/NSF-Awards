A Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will be held on October 10-12,
2003, at Syracuse University. This will continue the long time tradition of
Midwest Several Complex Variables Conferences which became one of the highest
quality and most successful conference series in Complex Analysis. There have
been many new interesting developments in different fields of this area in
recent years, especially in Complex Geometry, Complex Dynamics, Partial
Differential Equations and Pluripotential Theory. The conference will provide a
forum to exchange and to stimulate new ideas from these disciplines, and to
formulate new challenging problems that will have important scientific impact.
It is expected that this will result in increased understanding of the deeper
mathematical issues in Complex Analysis. The conference speakers include: Thomas
Bloom (University of Toronto), Araceli Bonifant (SUNY at Stony Brook), Jeffrey
Diller (University of Notre Dame), Peter Ebenfelt (University of California, San
Diego), Vincent Guedj (University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse), Sergei Ivashkovich
(Universit des Sciences et Technologies de Lille), Imre Patyi (University of
California, San Diego), Jean-Pierre Rosay (University of Wisconsin, Madison),
Rasul Shafikov (SUNY at Stony Brook), Mei-Chi Shaw (University of Notre Dame),
B. Alan Taylor (University of Michigan), Sophia Vassiliadou (Georgetown
University), Brendan Weickert (Washington and Lee University), Jan Wiegerinck
(University of Amsterdam). Complex Analysis is an interdisciplinary field
involving complex numbers to solve problems in mathematics. The conference will
explore the interplay of research which has taken place in a number of broad
areas: Complex Geometry, Complex Dynamics, Partial Differential Equations and
Pluripotential Theory. Many of the developments in these disciplines found new
applications outside their traditional area. We believe that hosting such a high
level conference will greatly benefit the US mathematicians. It is especially
helpful in educating our graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, providing them
with the opportunity to be in touch with the leading experts working on the
frontier of the field. We will give special attention to attracting young
scientists among the participants and speakers. A significant part of the
conference budget is allocated especially for this. An effort will be made to
increase the number of women who will attend the conference. To disseminate the
information about the conference the organizers created a web site (address:
http://web.syr.edu/ dcoman/SCV/), where abstracts of talks and suggested
problems will be found.
