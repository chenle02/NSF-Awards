9704565 Rezakhanlou An outstanding and long studied problem in statistical
mechanics is to establish the connection between the microscopic structure of a
fluid (or a gas) and its macroscopic behavior. Perhaps the most celebrated
problem in this context is the derivation of the hydrodynamic and kinetic
equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's second law. This
problem is still wide open but some variants have been recently treated. The
investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems modeling
fluids and gas. Recently the investigator in collaboration with James Tarver has
derived a Boltzmann type equation for the macroscopic particle densities of a
class stochastic particle systems modeling dilute gases. Roughly speaking one
shows that after a suitable scaling the microscopic particle density converges
to a solution of a Boltzmann type equation. The investigator also shows that the
convergence is exponentially fast and derives an explicit expression for the
exponential rate of convergence. This result allows us to go beyond the
macroscopic description given by the Boltzmann equation and obtain some valuable
insight about the microscopic structure of the particle system under study. Our
world appears differently at different scales. For example a fluid or a gas is a
collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move
erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to
organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale?
Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and
energy impose constraints not immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The
investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic
structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and gases. The analysis of the
mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles has
proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of fluids and gases.
Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of
simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases.
