Funding is requested for a fundamental research effort in the nature of
seismological parameters controlling generation and propagation of far-field,
i.e., transoceanic tsunamis. Specifically, we plan to carry out the following
research: (i) develop a mantle magnitude Mm based on the measurement of Rayleigh
waves at the very long but variable periods, in order to make feasible the one-
station measurement of the seismic moment of a teleseismic earthquake in real
time thereby providing adequate information for the possible issuance of tsunami
warnings; (ii) research systematically the influence of a number of source
parameters such as depth of focus, geometry of focal mechanism, geometry of
rupture, etc., on the excitation of tsunamis by earthquake sources; we will
focus primarily on the influence of crustal structure, and in particular of the
presence of sedimentary layering, as well as on the effect of non-double- couple
sources such as those involved in landslides and volcanic processes; (iii) use
detailed rupture models to synthetize the tsunamis of individual earthquakes,
including the so-called "tsunami earthquakes", whose tsunamis as much as 10
times greater than predicted from their seismic moments; and (iv) research the
focusing and defocusing effects that variations in oceanic depth creates through
lateral heterogeneity in tsunami velocities, and consequently refraction of
tsunami rays. The proposed research constitutes a broad attempt at understanding
the factors controlling the amplitude of the tsunami at its generation, and
during its propagation, before run-up and resonance effects ass their final
contribution to the amplitude measured at a tidal gauge station.
