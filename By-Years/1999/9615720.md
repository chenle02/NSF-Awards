9615720 Emmermann This award transfers funds to the GeoforschungsZentrum (GFZ)
in Germany for NSF's membership fee in the International Continental Scientific
Drilling Program (ICDP). On February 26, 1996, the NSF and the GFZ (a
Governmentally funded, public law Foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Implementation, Management and Operation
of the ICDP. This MOU is an Annex to the Agreement between the NSF and the
Federal Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Technology of the Federal
Republic of Germany (BMBF) on "Cooperation in Research in the Geosciences." The
MOU stipulates that each member of ICDP will pay an annual membership fee to the
Executive Agency (the GFZ) which will be commingled to provide the base funding
for the ICDP. These funds will be used for support of overall scientific
planning, management, and operation of the ICDP. ***
