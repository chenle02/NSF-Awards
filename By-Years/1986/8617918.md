The design of certain classes of products can be considered as a multi-stage
decision making process. These products tend to be those for which the
components are well-defined and where the design can be characterized as one of
component specification and selection; that is, modular designs. For this class
of designs, dynamic programming can provide the basis for a framework through
which design problems can be structured, quantitatively described, analyzed and
resolved. This research is directed toward the development, formalization, and
implementation of a dynamic programming approach to engineering design problems.
A major goal is the creation of a specific framework through which design
problems can be structured, decomposed, and resolved. This will entail the
development of logic structures, methods of decomposition, quantitative
characteristics, and solution procedures.
