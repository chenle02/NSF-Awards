This proposal requests funds to purchase a freeze fracture unit capable of
producing high-quality replicas, a propane jet freezer, a cryoultramicrotome, a
cryotransfer stage, and an energy dispersive x-ray analyzer with image
processing capabilities for 17 investigators in biological and related sciences
at Cornell University. These instruments will be used in a wide range of
projects in biochemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, cell biology,
cytology, and physiology. This instrumentation will enhance the research
capabilities of a productive group of investigators who are addressing questions
on the nature and function of membranes.
