TCI software will develop transformations between the objects of a scientific
word processor (Scientific Word) and the objects of symbolic manipulation
systems like Mathematica and Maple. The PI's firm, TCI software, has established
credibility in this area, and an award as a Phase 2 SBIR grantee is highly
recommended.
