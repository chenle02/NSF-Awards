The principal objective of this study is the elucidation of the relationships
between nucleation and growth processes, on the one hand, and the fundamental
chemical processes of hydrolysis and condensation, on the other hand, in the
sol-gel production of binary glasses and ceramics. Understanding of this
relationship is necessary to produce the desired homogeneity, bulk structures,
and phase distributions in complex ceramics and glasses. A systematic study of
the effects of formulation and processing of binary glasses via the sol-gel
process is conducted. Several in situ techniques including infrared, Raman, and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies are used to examine chemical kinetics,
chemical transformations, and solid-state structures. The physical evolution of
the sol nuclei and the gel structure are followed with dynamic light scattering
and dynamic viscoelastic experiments of the evolving gel. The sol-gel process is
a very important new technology for the production of high-performance glasses
and ceramics. Applications of binary glasses and ceramics are found in many
high-technology systems, including optical systems as fiber optics and light
guides, chemical systems as catalysts and adsorbents, and electronic systems as
dielectric and ferroelectric.
