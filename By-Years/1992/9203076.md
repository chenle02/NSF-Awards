This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for the research program of Dr. John E. Bercaw of the
Chemistry Department, California Institute of Technology. The research will
focus on the mechanisms of reactions of organometallic compounds. Selective
catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic substrates will be
investigated in detail. Kinetic and thermodynamic factors which influence the
formation and cleavage of C-O, H-O, and M-O or M=O bonds will be emphasized, as
well as 1,2 addition reactions to C-H bonds. Cyclopentadienyl compounds of
tantalum and high valent ruthenium and iron oxo compounds which contain
ancilliary O,O,O-tripodal ligands will be used. %%% Conversion of methane and
other light alkanes to liquids, such as alcohols or higher hydrocarbons, could
simplify transport of these energy sources and enable the first step of their
conversion to specialty chemical products. By developing new types of transtion
metal compounds which are capable of oxidizing organic substrates and providing
a better understanding of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors operative in
these reactions, improved oxidation catalysts may be developed. During the
course of these fundamental studies, new compounds will be synthesized and
careful investigations of the steps of the oxidation reactions will be carried
out.
