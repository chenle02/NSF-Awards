9415385 Sung The objective of this research is to extend intrinsic and extrinsic
UV and fluorescence techniques to important polymers such as vinyl polymers,
bismaleimide and polyureaurethane. In-situ reaction monitoring techniques will
be developed and applied for these three types of polymers by specially designed
fiber-optic instruments using the external reflection ultraviolet and
fluorescence techniques, by taking advantage of the spectral changes as a
function of polymerization. %%% In addition to the development and application
of these in-situ cure monitoring techniques, an additional benefit of this
research is the design and introduction of the transportable ultraviolet and
fluorescence fiber optic instruments with specially designed attachments and
analytical cure software, that can be used in the manufacturing environment.
