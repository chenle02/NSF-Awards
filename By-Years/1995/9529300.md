The prehistoric human inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia were faced with
markedly different environmental circumstances than people living there today.
At the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years ago) lower sea levels and
cooler conditions affected the prehistoric landscape exposing the subcontinent
of Sundaland and reducing the extent of rain forest in favor of more seasonal
flora and fauna. How these circumstances affected prehistoric human diet is the
subject of this research. This paleodietary study will examine stable carbon and
nitrogen isotopes and dental pathology and wear data derived from terminal
Pleistocene and Holocene skeletal materials. Results will be interpreted within
the context of changes in subsistence and settlement in the region. Distinctions
between foraging groups depending on marine food resources will be made against
those subsisting more on terrestrial foods. Changes in diet associated with the
transition to agriculture will be examined as will the issue of rain forest
habitation prior to this transition.
