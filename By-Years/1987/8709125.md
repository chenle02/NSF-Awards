This research planning grant will allow Dr. Moreno-Black to conduct a pilot
study of the impact of the introduction of an irrigation scheme on the
subsistance activities of women in rural Thailand. This is an important topic
and this small award will allow her to develop the basis for an expanded
independent research program.
