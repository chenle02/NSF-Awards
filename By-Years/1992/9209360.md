This Doctoral Dissertation Support award is undergirded by William Julius
Wilson's concentration of poverty thesis. The primary purpose of the analysis is
to examine the political consequences of living in extreme poverty communities.
The model for the investigation incorporates explanatory factors from both the
urban underclass and political participation literatures. The exogenous
variables are neighborhood context and family context, while the endogenous
variables are socio-economic status, political orientation and political
behavior. The data used to test the model will come from a survey of 400 Black
residents in extreme povery and low poverty neighborhoods in Columbus, Ohio. The
data will be collected through telephone interviewing by Polimetrics Laboratory
at the Ohio State University. The significance of the research rests on its
attempts to assess the extent to which underclass or extreme poverty
neighborhoods and impaired family contexts, have debilitating influences on the
political orientations and behavior of residents. Studies of the political
consequences of living in concentrated poverty communities are crucial to the
understanding of the effects of poverty on political democracy.
