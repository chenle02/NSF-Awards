This project continues a pilot project funded last year. A series of 6-day short
courses in manufacturing are being held for mathematics and science faculty
(with an emphasis on 2-year and minority institutions as well as female and
disabled faculty). During the 2-year project life, 120 faculty will participate.
The project uses manufacturing as a vehicle to illustrate the relevant
application of basic scientific, mathematical, and engineering principles.
Previously developed modules on casting, circuit board manufacturing, and
machining are being expanded and improved. A new fourth module on the
mathematics of quality assurance is being developed and taught. In addition the
participants are taken on narrated tours of selected manufacturing facilities by
the course faculty. Discussion sessions facilitate interaction among
participants as well as absorption of the day's lessons. There is heavy emphasis
on providing participants with instructional materials to incorporate into their
own classes. A (single issue) newsletter provides long-term interaction. And, a
final assessment will be performed.
