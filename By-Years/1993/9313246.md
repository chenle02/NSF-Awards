The U. S. Bureau of the Census will provide SRS a report on the stock and
employment of scientists and engineers in four countries: France, United
Kingdom, Japan and Canada. Ellen Jamison of the Center for International
Research of the Bureau of the Census will derive the numbers from the population
census of each country: France, 1982 and from the annual labor force surveys for
1985 through 1992; United Kingdom, 1981 census and from the annual labor force
surveys for 1986 through 1990; Japan, census samples for 1980, 1985 and 1990;
and, Canada, 1986 and 1991 censuses. Ms. Jamison will work with the statistical
offices of each country to obtain special census tabulations when needed. The
report will provide the number of S&E per 1000 of the labor force and their
characteristics: age, sex, education and employment by industry group. This
information will be used in Science and Engineering Indicators and in Science
and Technology International Update for cross country comparisons of skilled
labor force.
