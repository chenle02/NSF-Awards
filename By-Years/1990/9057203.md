The goal of this research is to understand how the amino acid sequence of an
enzyme encodes its three-dimensional structure, and how this structure manifests
itself in function.Enzyme function and protein structure are both manifestations
of molecular recognition. The PI is using the tools of chemistry, biochemistry,
and molecular biology to determine how molecular recognition leads to enzyme
action. The research concentrates on two facets of molecular recognition:
enzyme-substrate recognition (that is, enzymatic catalysis) and intramolecular
protein-protein recognition (that is, protein folding). Dr. Reines is focusing
on catalysis by and folding of ribonuclease A (RNase A). By analyzing in detail
the structure and function of mutant RNase A's, they are delineating the
contribution of particular amino acid residues to substrate recognition and
turnover and to protein folding. They are also interested in protein disulfide
isomerase (PDI), which catalyzes the interchange of disulfide bonds in other
proteins. They have cloned the cDNA that codes for PDI, and are attempting to
express it in yeast. The goal is to illuminate the mechanism of catalysis by
PDI. A considerable effort is being made to develop efficient, selective
catalysts for the synthesis and degradation of complex molecules. Much
inspiration for this effort has come from the study of nature's catalysts, the
enzymes. Illuminating the molecular interactions that give rise to substrate
binding and turnover may provide the knowledge necessary to design a protein
structure that catalyzes a specific chemical reaction. This knowledge, together
with the ability to specify a sequence of amino acids that folds into a desired
three-dimensional structure, would allow protein engineers to create novel
catalysts for medicinal analyses and therapies, and for industrial processes.
