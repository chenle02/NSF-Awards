94188002 Bose Washington State University (WSU) will organize and host a
workshop on the infrastructure issues in electric power engineering. As the
nation focuses on the civil infrastructure systems (CIS), of which the power
systems grid is a vital part, the research issues for the various areas need to
be clearly defined. This proposal is a plan to bring together about 40 of the
top power engineering experts for three days to develop a blueprint for
infrastructure research. The NSF CIS Task Group report provides a conceptual
framework for infrastructure research by defining deterioration science,
assessment technologies, and renewal engineering. A special panel session at the
1994 Summer Power Meeting will shed further light on specific infrastructure
issues in power engineering. This workshop is to be a forum for experts to
continue this work and formulate specific research needs that can be used by NSF
and academic institutions to plan their R&D efforts. A conference record,
including recommendations and summarized discussions, will be produced for
dissemination to a wider audience. ***
