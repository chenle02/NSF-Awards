This grant represents the lead role of NSF in a Government participation in an
existing industry-university cooperative research program that is addressing
problems in integrated circuit technology. The importance of this technology
rests on the fact that the integrated circuits are the key components in the
maintenance of a competitive or leadership position in supercomputers,
information technology, industrial production, communications, and defense.
