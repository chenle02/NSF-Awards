This action funds Amalie Donius of Drexel University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Modifying Nanofibers for Porous Biomaterials" during the
summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The host
scientist is Professor Hiroyuki Yano.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the fabrication of porous
degradable and resorbable biomaterials from environmentally benign and
biocompatible materials. In addition to the macroporosity of the porous
material, a second level of porosity and greater functionality is being achieved
by creating pore walls from biopolymer nanofibers. Such materials have great
potential for applications in filtration and tissue engineering.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
