This proposal is a renewal of the 2 year award made to the Southeastern
Universities Research Association to implement a regional network in the
southeastern section of the country comprising 13 states and the District of
Columbia. SURAnet became operational in March 1987 and has grown to 44 nodes,
including 30 universities and 14 federal research sites. The SURAnet Phase II
proposal specifically solicits participation by the widest possible community of
users and servers. In addition to the SURAnet Operations at the Network
Operations Center (NOC), which is attached to the NSFNET Backbone network and
which provides nationwide connectivity for the region, SURAnet will coordinate
the localized operations and services of Smart Nodes or key sites in each state.
These Smart Nodes will be connected by a high speed backbone net (1.5 million
bits per second). Other nodes or institutions in the state will be connected to
the Smart Nodes via line speeds of 9.6Kbs, 56Kbs, or 1.5Mbs depending on local
needs. Cost sharing is offered by each institution participating in the network
through implementation of local area networks, network information services, and
the payment of annual membership fees to the SURAnet Operations Center.***
