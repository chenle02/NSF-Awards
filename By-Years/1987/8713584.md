Recent technological advances in mass spectrometry make possible the use of
isotopic tracers, present in rocks in very low concentrations, in order to
determine the ages and the ultimate source of samples which originate in the
mantle of the earth. These samples usually reach the surface as inclusions in
lava flows which have been fractionally melted from the deep interior or in
kimberlite pipes which have explosively brought material up from great depth.
This project will assemble a mass spectrometer system that will combine the
features of secondary ionization (ion gun) with laser resonance ionization in
the sample source. The spectrometer is expected to be capable of accurately
analyzing difficult tracer systems such as osmium isotope ratios of masses
187/186 in samples containing only 10 picograms of total osmium.
