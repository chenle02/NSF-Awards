There are several known cases of sensory systems where some particular stimulus
feature, such as visual space or sound frequency, is represented in some kind of
organized "map" in the brain. The sensory system that has been most difficult to
map in this way has been taste, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. There now
is a lot of information on taste physiology in some invertebrates, and this
project utilizes the fly as a model system, where both physiology and anatomy
are used to trace particular taste pathways into well-described parts of the fly
brain. Standard electrophysiological recordings of single nerve cells in the
taste pathway will allow characterization of a cell's sensitivity to different
taste compounds, and dye injections of those cells will allow tracing how the
central terminals of each tested cell projects into central brain regions.
Finding out whether the four different classes of peripheral taste cells have
central connectivity that shows functional groupings would be major step in
understanding the circuitry underlying taste. Results from study of this model
system will have an impact on chemosensory work in other animals, on our
understanding of feeding behavior, of central sensory connectivity in general,
on insect-plant interactions and potentially on mechanisms for pest control.
