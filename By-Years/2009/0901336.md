This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laskowski is continuing his research in
model theory, which is a branch of mathematical logic. The bulk of his research
is organized around the theme of obtaining better structure theorems in three
distinct settings. He will continue his investigations of the fine structure of
models of classifiable theories with an eye on extensions to uncountable
languages, look for a generalization of Shelah's notion of excellence that is
applicable to more classes of structures, and seek more instances where
stability theoretic assumptions automatically bound the quantifier complexity of
the formulas. Additionally, Laskowski will attempt to answer specific questions
about dependent formulas, elementary extensions of expansions of Archimedean
ordered abelian groups, the Schroeder-Bernstein property of a theory, and a long
standing decidability question from symbolic
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is concerned with the interplay
between theories, i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language, and the
classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences. There is
a well established taxonomy of theories, which is based on the embeddability or
non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements into models of the
theory. Laskowski has identified certain classes of theories that have direct
connections to limitations on data compression and computational learning
theory, and will continue his examination of these
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
