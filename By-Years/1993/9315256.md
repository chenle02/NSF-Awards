9315256 Hardin This award will support further development of the Mosaic
software and related activities such as workshops, documentation development,
and internet standards activities. Mosaic was developed by the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign,
building on the World Wide Web software kernal. Mosaic is client/server software
which enables dynamic browsing, retrieval, and display of multimedia data over
the Internet using Unix, Macintosh, or PC computers, using hypertext to allow
English documents to contain words or images as direct links to additional
information. Clicking on linked words or images retrieves and displays new files
and information transparently. Retrieved files in turn contain links to other
databanks, creating a global web of information. Mosaic has rapidly grown to be
very popular; over 300,000 copies of the software have been distributed to date,
with thousands more every month.
