This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research by Dr. John A. Morrison of the Chemistry Department, University of
Illinois at Chicago, concerning polyhedral boron halide clusters. Divalent
anions with equivalent numbers (n) of boron and halide atoms (including n = 7,
8, 10, 11, 12) will be synthesized and their reactivities and structures
characterized using PES, XPS, NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Diboron
tetrahalides and tetraboron tetrahalides and B(14)Cl(18) will also be studied.
Substituents will not be limited to halides, but also will include alkyl,
alkoxide, and amide groups. The goal of the research is to investigate the
bonding modes of these electron deficient compounds which are expected to
exhibit structures not previously observed in boron clusters. Molecular orbital
calculations will facilitate the interpretation of spectra and bonding. %%%
Large regular polyhedral clusters containing up to 12 boron atoms are well
known. Each boron is typically bound also to a hydrogen or halide atom. The
number of "framework" electrons required to hold the cluster together is usually
2n+2, where n is the number of boron atoms in the cluster. Morrison will
synthesize novel species which contain only 2n electrons and observe the effects
on the shape and reactivity of the cluster and its bonding characteristics.
Although the research is fundamental, it may be applicable to clusters of other
elements, particularly those containing metals which are found in many catalytic
and electronic materials.
