This award is for the purchase of computer equipment to enhance the existing
UNIDATA program within the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University
of Arizona. UNIDATA is a program to empower universities, through innovative
applications of current computing and networking technology, to make the best
use of atmospheric and related data for enhancing education and research.
Specifically this grant will upgrade existing workstations and central data
management hardware. In addition, four new workstations will be added to the
UNIDATA system. This upgrade will provide enhanced UNIDATA capabilities to
faculty and students and be used for research and teaching. This equipment will
better enable the principal investigator to educate graduate students in the
meteorological sciences and attract and retain undergrades to a career in the
sciences.
