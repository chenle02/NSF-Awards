The project will develop methodology for multivariate time series analysis.
Multivariate model building is a very important and current topic for research
in the time series area. The proposed methods will be based on the canonical
representation of the process and have the potential of revealing hidden
simplifying structures of the process. This will be useful in obtaining an
appropriate linear model for the process under study. The main tool used will be
canonical analysis of vector processes, including lagged variables. The
investigator has already significant results in the area and has excellent
experience in applying the procedures to real-world problems. Since the research
is primarily concerned with canonical analysis, many results obtained will have
applicability beyond time series analysis.
