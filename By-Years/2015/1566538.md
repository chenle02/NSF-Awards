In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor T. Don Tilley and his research group in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, conducts fundamental
studies of structure, bonding, and reactivity in new transition metal-main group
complexes. In this project, new strategies for chemical conversions are being
developed. These have applications in drug development, polymer and materials
synthesis, and the large-scale production of value-added chemicals. Young
scientists are being trained in the area of catalyst development. In addition,
Professor Tilly and the students involved in this project participate in and
lead outreach activities, such as the training of local high school students and
presenting science demonstrations at a local middle school. Notably, a
collaborative effort within the research group involves planning and presenting
science lessons to grade school students. Group members travel to nearby
elementary schools (at least two each month) and teach basic scientific
principles, hoping to improve early STEM education and encourage budding
scientists.

This project focuses on complexes with silylene ligands, LnM=SiRR'. This
research is designed to provide an understanding of the mechanism and scope of a
new type of hydrosilation reaction discovered in this program and guides the way
to more challenging catalytic hydrosilations. In addition, this program
investigates catalytic systems that utilize cost-effective, earth-abundant
metals such as iron, cobalt and nickel. Efficient catalysis with first row
metals is a pervasive theme attracting strong interest in the research and
industrial catalysis communities, and it is therefore important to learn how
such catalysts may operate.
