9520430 Ma The proposal concentrates on the synthesis, characterization and
application of the Jet-Vapor Deposited (JVD) silicon nitride film for an
advanced gate dielectric in scale MOS transistors for future generations of
integrated circuits. The current dielectric, SiO2, has served the semiconductor
device community well in scaling channel lengths; however, as feature sizes move
to submicron and nanometric dimensions there is a genuine concern about the need
to address reliability issues associated with dielectric films. A JVD process
which uses a supersonic jet of helium carrier gas to transport vapor from the
source to the substrate and because of the very short transit times there is
little opportunity of gas-phase nucleation to take place in the deposition
process. These films show merit for advanced gate dielectrics for scaled MOS
devices, storage capacitors for high-density DRAMS, and interpoly dielectrics
for EEPROMs. ***
