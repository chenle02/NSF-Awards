Students in biology, electrical engineering and other fields of study learn to
use the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for measurements related to their
major area of study. A formal course that teaches students the principles of
operation and the capabilities of the SEM as well as the procedures for using
the instrument is offered on a regular basis. The particular instrument has
several features that allow measurements not possible with instruments not
possessing these features. After completing the course, the students have access
to the SEM for individual project work. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
