9354596 Keeffe The project will develop molecular modelling/computational
chemistry experiments for use in first-year organic chemistry courses.
Computational chemistry, rapidly becoming an almost routine tool for academic
and industrial chemists, offers an unusually good opportunity for students to
investigate efficiently a variety of molecular attributes including
conformational stability, preferred bond angles and lengths, energies of
reaction, and reaction pathways. Results can provide rationalization of known
data, or predictions subject to verification. These benefits will accrue only
with the aid of a high quality, integrated visualization environment, a feature
central to our proposal. These experiments will be introduced as hands-on
exercises to our organic lab students: 240-280 students per year, including
chemistry and biochemistry majors and most pre-health profession students. Our
ca. 500 organic lecture students each year will be shown the results - both
numerical and pictorial - of a variety of pertinent computations. This group of
students includes all of our biology majors and those training for precollege
science teaching careers. ***y
