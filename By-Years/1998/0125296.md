For the past six years, the AMS has provided developing countries with the
Journal of Climate and Monthly Weather Review. The program has been extremely
successful in providing background materials for the scientists in those
countries so that they can be part of the international policy dialogue on
environmental issues. As a matter of national policy, the United States is
committed to build the scientific infrastructure of the developing nations. As a
result, NOAA's Office of Global Programs, NASA's Office of Earth Science and the
National Science Foundation have continued to provide the support for this
significant endeavor. The support has enabled the AMS to provide these two
important journals to 175 organizations.
