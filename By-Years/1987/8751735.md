Providing Discoveries in Chemistry for Elementary School Children is a three
year project of the University of Southern Mississippi which will provide 180
teachers of elementary students with preparation on how to use low-cost
activities which develop an introduction to chemically related physical science
concepts. Six-week summer sessions will be held for primary grades and for
intermediate grades. A master high-school chemistry teacher and an administrator
will be members of each team from each of 18 participating school districts.
They will be involved in the orientation, planning, implementation and follow-up
evaluation phases of the project.
