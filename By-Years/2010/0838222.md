The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory at the University of Massachusetts
consists of a group of scientists and engineers working together in support of a
research program in millimeter-wave astronomy. The FCRAO program emphasizes
three principal areas: (1) astronomical research; (2) development of state-of-
the-art instrumentation; and (3) training of graduate and undergraduate students
in observational astronomy and astronomical instrumentation. The FCRAO is
participating with the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica, y
Electronica (INAOE) in the construction, in Mexico, of a 50m diameter Large
Millimeter Telescope (LMT). The LMT, when completed, will be the largest
telescope of its kind in the world. This award will support key personnel and
students working toward completion and commissioning of the LMT over the next
three years, including development and testing of new instrumentation to take
advantage of the short 1mm-wavelength operating wavelength of the LMT.
