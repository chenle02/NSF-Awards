This instrument will be used for the synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides ranging
in size from 15 to 30 bp. These oligonucleotides will be used for the following
purposes: 1) as specific DNA primers for dideoxy sequencing, 2) as primers for
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) applications, and 3) as primers used in the
technique of site-directed mutagenesis. All three of these procedures require
oligonucleotides of specific sequence, which will be used in these research
projects: 1) characterization of a morine MHC hotspot of recombination, 2)
molecular characterization of bacterial luciferase, and 3) molecular
characterization of a new family of retroviral sequencer in the mouse.
