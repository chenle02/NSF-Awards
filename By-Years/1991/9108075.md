In this project the principal investigator will study quasisymmetric embeddings
and related classes of mappings. In particular, she will look at mappings of
p-dimensional euclidean space into n-dimensional space, where p is between 1 and
n-1. A major objective of the research is to classify all such embeddings that
have a quasisymmetry constant equal to one. Currently results in this direction
are known for the cases p=n and p=1, n=2. It is expected that for the case p=n-1
the only such embeddings are affine (linear + constant) embeddings. Much of the
subject of complex variables is concerned with what is called "geometric
function theory", the subarea in which one studies the properties of functions
or mappings in terms of the geometry of the domain of the function (the set of
points on which the function is defined) and the range of the function (the set
of values of the function). In this project the principal investigator will
study certain types of mappings between euclidean spaces of different dimensions
that distort the spaces in a prescribed way. The goal of the research is to
classify all types of functions that have a given distortion.
