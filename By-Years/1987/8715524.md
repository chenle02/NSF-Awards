This grant is in support of a workshop to examine the application of scientific
drilling to the solution of a wide array of earth science problems in the
Antarctic. In the Antarctic, where 98 percent of the continent is encased in
ice, the application of advanced technologies, such as drilling for
stratigraphic, geophysical and glaciological objectives, will be an important
addition to U.S. research capabilities. This effort is in response to
recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences ("Antarctic Solid-Earth
Sciences Research, A Guide for the Next Decade and Beyond," 1987). The workshop
is planned for the spring of 1988 in Columbus, Ohio, and will bring together
experts in all phases of ice/rock drilling for scientific objectives. The
meeting is an important aspect of the Antarctic geoscience research program and
will point to new directions for future research in this area.
