The investigator develops and analyzes asymptotically methods for inference and
prediction for high dimensional data. His research with collaborators includes
estimation of intrinsic dimension, estimation of high dimensional covariance
matrices and prediction using low dimensional approximate representations of the
data and/ or approximate low dimensional models.

The goal of the investigators research is to improve prediction and inference in
situations ranging from numerical weather prediction to computational biology
when high dimensional data is the basis of action and understanding. In fact,
such data nowadays arise everywhere. The underlying principle the investigator
and collaborators are following is that the data is essentially low dimensional
when properly represented and/or modeled and that appropriate representations
can be found in computationally feasible ways.
