ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0137287&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,
scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will continue to produce
and distribute a standard reference material for the quality control of oceanic
carbon dioxide measurements, in particular those that are made as part of
international global programs. This will help to ensure that such measurements
are comparable and accurate although made in different laboratories at different
times; and will be an important factor in the design of a Global Ocean Observing
System. To achieve this, the Scripps laboratory will prepare standard materials
(seawater) and certify them for the following parameters of the oceanic carbon
dioxide system: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, hydrogen ion
concentration, pH, and d13 C for a sample of sea water. These reference
materials will be distributed to US and international investigators to assist in
the quality control of oceanic CO2 measurements. They will also be used to
provide test samples for use in collaborative studies of the analytical methods
that are used to determine these various parameters. As part of this work, the
scientific team plans to organize various such collaborative studies and will
collaborate with the various investigators to ensure that the experience gained
is documented in reports and in written methods that are widely disseminated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of the project involves planning for the
future. It is essential to assure a long- term supply of reference materials for
future ocean science research, and it will be necessary to identify an agency or
company that will take on this responsibility. To encourage this, the
investigators propose to interact with the U.S. National Institute for Standards
and Technology, as well as with Ocean Scientific International (the IAPSO
Standard Sea Water Service) and with various Japanese investigators to assess
and recommend a plan for the future. &lt;br/&gt;
