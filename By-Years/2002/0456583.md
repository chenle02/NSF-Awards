Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations&lt;br/&gt;Project
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carlos E.
Kenig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will be a continuation of the
PI's research on the regularity of solutions to free boundary problems, the
analysis of boundary value problems under minimal smoothness conditions, the
development of Liouville type theorems for viscous conservation laws, the
development of techniques from Fourier analysis to study qualitative and
quantitative properties of solutions of nonlinear dispersive equations and the
use of quantitative unique continuation methods to study Anderson localization
and the inverse problem in electrical impedance tomography.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These partial differential equations arise in quantum
mechanical models, fluid mechanics and tomography theory amongst other areas so
the analysis of these equations may have many applications.
