AST-9619418 A Survey of Nearby Stars for Extrasolar Planets. Drs. Steven Vogt,
Geoffrey Marcy, and Paul Butler will use the Keck I telescope in Hawaii and the
HIRES spectrometer on that telescope to carry out an initial 2-year
reconnaissance program to survey about 400 nearby stars for giant planets. With
this system they have already proven they can reach a precision of 3 m/s with
their Doppler technique to provide detections of Jupiter- mass planets within 5
Astronomical Units of the parent star. Refinement of the Doppler analysis will
enable detection of Saturn-mass planets at 5 Astronomical Units from the parent
star. =================================
