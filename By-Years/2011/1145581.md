Chemical synapses within the brain are specialized cellular junctions that are
vastly&lt;br/&gt;intergraded to allow for rapid, highly-specific communication
between neurons. Fusion of&lt;br/&gt;neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with
the plasma membrane, subsequent release and&lt;br/&gt;activation of postsynaptic
receptors executes a phase called exocytosis. To prevent the
limited&lt;br/&gt;number of synaptic vesicles from rapid depletion, a secondary
system of webbed pathways&lt;br/&gt;replenishes the vesicle pool through several
modes known as endocytosis. Although the exocytic&lt;br/&gt;pathway, with its
signaling cascade and key proteins are confidently defined, the true nature
of&lt;br/&gt;vesicle re-formation is less clear. The proposed study will
investigate the molecular mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;of endocytosis using biophysical
and electrochemical methods with milli-second time resolution.&lt;br/&gt;We
expect that this work will illustrate the functions of several important
endocytic proteins in&lt;br/&gt;endocytosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results
from this work will likely lead to important insights into synaptic
vesicle&lt;br/&gt;recycling, which is critical for higher functions of our
brain, such as learning and memory. These&lt;br/&gt;results will shed new light
on a signaling cascade that defines the hallmark of inter-
cellular&lt;br/&gt;communication and aid in identifying aspects of cellular
health, thus revealing a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what functional
mechanism(s) are involved in the dominant and most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental
endocytic portal. The investigators will also be dedicated to the training
of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students in scientific research, through
discussion in classes and&lt;br/&gt;research in laboratories.
