Requirements for accurate and efficient processing are common to the transcripts
of all classes of eukaryotic genes. The organization and control of eukaryotic
RNA processing pathways are the subjects of this research. The contributions of
selectivity, kinetics and compartmentation to TRNA processing are being examined
in this proposal. Splicing and nuclear transport are being studied as examples
of key steps in a well-defined processing pathway. Our prior analyses of the
properties of the yeast splicing complex assembly suggested both selectivity and
compartmentation may contribute to ordering. Using nuclear microinjection of
Xenopus oocytes it has been previously noted that tRNA nuclear transport is
selective, requires prior splicing and transport, define kinetic parameters for
export, and analyze compartmentation via multifunctional enzymes and the
formation of stable complexes. Experimental approaches include: (1) Expression
of yeast ligase-dihydrofolate reductase fusion proteins in E. coli to examine
structure/function relationships in this multifunctional protein; (2)
Microinjection of pre-tRNA and other labeled macromolecules in Xenopus oocytes
to examine the requirements for nuclear transport; and (3) Analysis of Xenopus
tRNA splicing and processing both in vivo and in vitro.
