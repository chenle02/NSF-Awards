The principal investigator will study a variety of problems concerning the
qualitative properties of the solutions of partial differential equations which
describe nonlinear wave motion. In particular, an investigation will be made of
the propagation of singularities of solutions along caustics and to study linear
inverse hyperbolic problems like determining the speed of sound from information
given by the problem. The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves is of
significant scientific interest in view of their wide spread occurrence in real
world situations.
