9354721 Karcher We propose a series of investigative laboratories using
transgenic plants for the introductory biology curriculum. Plant biology is
frequently an area that is neglected in the teaching of biological sciences, yet
plants display unique characteristics in their developmental and physiological
processes that set them apart from their animal and microbial counterparts. The
transgenic plants that we shall develop for these laboratories contain an uidA
(gusA) reporter gene under the control of various promoters that respond to
different environmental or developmental signals. Following induction by these
environmental or developmental signals, the gusA gene will respond by producing
the enzyme B-glucuronidase (GUS). When plant tissue is stained with the
chromogenic compound X-gluc, those tissues that produce GUS will turn blue.
Using investigative experiments, students will monitor both the physiological
response of plants to these signals, as well as the induction of gene activity
as reflected by GUS activity. Thus, students will be able to see that
physiological and developmental responses correlate with specific gene activity.
The assay is highly visual, safe for the undergraduate laboratory, easy to
conduct, and relatively inexpensive. In addition, we shall develop a laboratory
manual and a CD-ROM program to be used by students and teachers when conducting
these experiments. We shall test these laboratories first in selected courses in
the Purdue University Department of Biological Sciences core curriculum. We
shall subsequently have these laboratories tested by colleagues in undergraduate
laboratory courses at other universities. The laboratories will be evaluated
both for efficacy as a teaching tool, and for ease in preparation and
presentation by the laboratory instructors. Finally, we shall aid in the
distribution of the laboratory material to other colleges and universities. ***y
