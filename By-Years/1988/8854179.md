The Community College Summer Workshop in Modes of Programming will provide
community college instructors in Washington State who teach computer science and
related disciplines with active experience with new models of computer problem
solving that are supported by high-level languages or established software
packages of high-level building blocks. The specific topics are Expert Systems
Programming, Fourth Generation Language Programming, Graphics Programming and
Object Oriented Programming. Both the selection of topics and approach are
designed to support curricular evolution in the community colleges by providing
exposure to material which, though advanced, can be integrated into the
community college computing curriculum. In addition to NSF support, participants
will contribute approximately an additional 15% toward the costs of the program.
