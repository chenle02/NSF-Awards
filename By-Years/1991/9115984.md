This award supports the visit of three Soviet mathema- ticians, A.I. Kostrikin,
M.I. Kuznetsov, and A.A. Premet, to the University of Wisconsin. They will join
the principal investigators and other members of the U.S. community in joint
studies and discussions on simple Lie algebras of prime characteristic and their
representations, finite p-groups, and other closely related topics in algebra.
The problems to be investigated are all directly related to the theory of Lie
algebras and primarily to the theory of Lie algebras of Cartan type. They have
many common threads suggesting that there are certain underlying principles that
could explain the common phenomena. This research is concerned with a
mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise from another object
called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a sphere where
one rotation is followed by another. Lie groups and Lie algebras are important
in areas involving analysis of spherical motion.
