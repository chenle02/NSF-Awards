Studies of Mars over the past twenty years have determined that early in its
history the climate was warm enough for water to flow on its surface. Liquid
water is not found on the surface of Mars today, because the surface is too cold
and the atmosphere too thin. The cause of this change might be the loss of the
planet’s global magnetic field, allowing the solar radiation to strip the
atmosphere. This would imply a major change took place in the planet’s core,
shutting off the dynamo responsible for the magnetic field. The role of hydrogen
in the dynamics and structure of the Martian core is poorly understood. Hydrogen
is known to form alloys with metallic iron at high pressure. This program will
conduct a systematic study of the phase relations of such alloys at the pressure
and temperature conditions expected for the Martian core. This research will
provide Arizona State University undergraduate students with comprehensive
research experiences. Teaching modules motivated by this research will be
implemented in coding and data analysis courses at ASU.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to advance the
understanding of the dynamics and structure of the Martian core by conducting
experiments to measure the melting behavior and sub-solidus phase relations in
Fe-S-H systems at pressures of 25-40 Gigapascals (GPs) expected to exist at the
Martian core. To achieve this goal a series of high-pressure, high temperature
experiments will be conducted for: (1) possible miscibility (or solubility) gaps
in Fe-S-H systems at high pressure and high temperature conditions relevant to
the Martian core, (2) the effects of hydrogen on the melting temperature of
sulfide alloys and (3) sub-solidus phase relations in Fe-S-H systems at high
pressures and high temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
