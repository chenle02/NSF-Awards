9520528 Brown Research in the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the University of
Massachusetts has been underway for the last twenty years, with emphasis on
studies of the paleosecular variation of the Earth's magnetic field and on the
solution of geologic problems using paleo-magnetism. Current and past research
have been done using measurements from a spinner magnetometer. With the
increasing numbers of samples needed for both paleosecular variation and
tectonic studies, and the detailed demagnetization steps required with current
standards, measurements such as these are a lengthy process. This grant provide
funds for the acquisition of a cryogenic magnetometer that will allow for the
accurate processing of weakly magnetized sediment samples, as well as radically
decrease measurement times. The active Quaternary research group at the
University of Massachusetts will now have a paleomagnetic laboratory that is
capable of competitive research into paleosecular variation studies on recent
sediments and paleoclimatic studies of weakly magnetized materials. The new
instrument will also benefit a larger, five-college Quaternary Research Group
composed of faculty from Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith as well as
the host institution. ***
