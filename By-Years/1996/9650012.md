The laboratory course that is the basis of this project is a timely addition to
the recently expanded program on molecular and developmental biology. This
course enables undergraduates to acquire a research experience with the benefit
of a class structure; its aim is to stimulate interest in scientific research by
presenting experimentation as an intellectual adventure. To this end, the course
is designed to engage the student in actual research by its project-like format
and by an investigative approach in interpreting lab results. With the use of
polymerase-chain-reaction-based cloning techniques, radically shortened
protocols allow undergraduates to clone novel genes from genomic DNA, then
sequence and analyze genes with polymorphic differences, in less than 14
sessions. The student can perform the whole range of activities needed to clone
and characterize a gene. The pooled results of the class can contain high
sequence variation and resemble extensive experimentation by a research group.
Each student, in the final paper, acts as a principal investigator. Two pilot
classes have been conducted, and the program is now expanding through the
purchase of equipment that permits further development of experiments, provides
for a larger class, upgrades the instruments currently in use, and perfects
procedures, making it possible for the course to be emulated elsewhere.
