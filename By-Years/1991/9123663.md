There is a considerable need for astronomers and laboratory atomic physics to
confer occasionally to review recent contributions to atomic data and to decide
on current needs. This proposal will support a conference meeting during 14-17
September, 1992 at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) at
Gaithersburg, Maryland to accomplish this purpose.
