This award provides renewed support for operation of the Indiana University
Axolotl Colony, a self-sustaining, breeding colony of Ambystoma mexicanum, a
neotenic salamander. Each year, the Colony supplies over 50,000 embryos, larvae,
and adults to biology researchers and educators in the United States and
overseas. The Colony's staff also provide technical expertise on request, and
the Colony serves as a communications venue for collaboration and shared
findings. The axolotl continues to represent a valuable, non-mammalian
vertebrate model system. Among its many special characteristics is its ability
to perfectly regenerate numerous parts of the body, including fore and
hindlimbs, tail, heart, brain, spinal cord and jaw, throughout embryonic, larval
and adult life. In the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the
availability of molecular reagents, such as antibodies for immunocytochemistry,
cloned genes for in situ hybridization and DNA libraries for studies in gene
expression and regulation. This accumulation of molecular tools has helped to
maintain axolotls as a modern, model system for study of vertebrate development.
