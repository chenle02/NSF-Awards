Mueller, Frank CCR-0208581 " Reducing Frequency via Speculation and Fall-Back
Recovery"

Conserving power is a key issue in embedded computing. At present, significant
power is wasted because embedded system designers lack detailed knowledge of the
processing speed needed by applications. Naive worst-case timing analysis
exaggerates the required processor frequency, especially as software and
hardware complexity increases.

This work puts forth a two-tier approach to reduce the processor frequency of
complex embedded systems. First, tight worst-case timing analysis reduces the
perceived upper bound on the number of cycles consumed by tasks. This reduces
the maximum frequency, saving power. Second, architecture simulation and
processors with dual frequency/voltage modes enable significant additional power
savings. Architecture simulation produces an approximate worst-case timing
estimate, which does not have to be safe and, consequently, is the basis for a
very low speculative frequency. A higher recovery frequency is utilized as a
fall-back mode to ensure safe operation bounded by tight worst-case timing
analysis, as delivered in the first approach. These two approaches complement
each other. They initially reduce the power requirements by a significant amount
when compared with the naive approach. Additionally, they reduce power
requirements further by exploiting simulation to accurately
