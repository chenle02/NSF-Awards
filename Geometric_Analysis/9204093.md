The principal investigators will study several problems in global Riemannian
geometry related to the existence, classification, and degeneration of compact
Riemannian manifolds which are extremal for an integral norm of the curvature.
They will also study applications of this theory to Kahler geometry,
differential topology, and mathematical physics. One principal investigator will
study the existence of degenerate solutions to the critical metric problem. The
second principal investigator will study the holonomy of complete manifolds of
positive scalar curvature. This award will support research in the general area
of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study
of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
