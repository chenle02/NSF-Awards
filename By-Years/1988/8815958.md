William C. Trogler of the University of California at San Diego will study the
synthesis, structure and reaction mechanisms of 17-electron organometallic
radicals as part of this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program. The goal is to develop catalysts for new
chemical transformations that could be applied to the synthesis of specialty
chemicals and medicinal compounds. Another thrust of the project is the
investigation of late transition metal coordination complexes as possible
reagents for the activation of nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonds in
order to facilitate insertion of unsaturated organic compounds such as olefins
into the metal-nitrogen and metal-oxygen bonds, respectively. This area is also
aimed at better defining the requirements for catalytic addition of ammonia,
amines and alcohols to carbon-carbon double bonds. Compounds to be employed in
the first part of the project are neutral electron rich 18-electron complexes
which can be electrochemically oxidized to give stable or short-lived cationic
radicals. Representative of these are dicarbonyl(olefin)cyclobutadieneiron,
(tertiary- phosphine)(olefin)cyclopentadienylcobalt and
bis(olefin)cyclopentadienylrhodium. Compounds employed in the second part of the
study will be mainly from the platinum group of metals.
