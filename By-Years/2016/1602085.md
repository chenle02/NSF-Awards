This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a robotic
exoskeleton technology to deliver physical therapy to stroke subjects. Stroke is
a leading cause of long-term disability in the US with nearly 80% of all stroke
survivors experiencing some form of upper limb paralysis. Prior work by the PI
has led to the development of a sophisticated exoskeleton for upper limb
rehabilitation, called HARMONY. This PFI:AIR-TT award will support a novel
controls framework for HARMONY that holds potential to improve the
rehabilitation outcomes of not only stroke patients but also those with upper
extremity neurological and musculoskeletal impairments. Currently there is only
one robot commercially available for delivering physical therapy to the upper
body. HARMONY offers improvements over this system through the following
features: i) HARMONY can power entire shoulder movement; ii) HARMONY is
bimanual, so it can simultaneously deliver therapy to both arms, which opens up
possibilities for novel bimanual therapy; and iii) HARMONY allows for
customization of the robot's force is at each joint which is critical for
physical therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new controls
framework that ensures patient involvement and provides the appropriate amount
of assistance so that subjects can complete the desired task. To achieve this
objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1) Develop and
test novel controls framework for multi-DOF, bimanual human-exoskeleton
interactions and Aim 2) Demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive controllers
through experiments with healthy subjects. The team, involving two participants
with business and commercialization expertise, will advance understanding of the
business aspects, including IP, regulatory issues and market need, and will
generate a commercialization plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With mentoring from
personnel with business and commercialization experience and the focus on
developing a commercialization plan, this project will create a unique
opportunity for educating the academic participants in the process of
translating basic research into deployed technology. Successful completion of
this project will aid in the development of the next generation of innovators
and business leaders.
