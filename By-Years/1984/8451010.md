Two problems in the areas of image sequence analysis and multidimensional signal
processing are studied. In the former, the problem to be considered is that of a
rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. Algorithms
are developed for estimation of object motion parameters from a sequence of
20-30 noisy frames. In the latter problem, algorithms for a two-dimensional
deconvolution problem with applications to image restoration are developed.
