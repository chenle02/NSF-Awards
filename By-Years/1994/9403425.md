9403425 Gerrish "Control Methods for Wide Area All-Optical Networks" This
project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an opportunity
for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to participate
in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select
promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.
Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the conversion of the
NSF-funded research into commercial applications and technological innovation
supported by follow-on private venture capital or other non-federal financing.
This Phase II project involves investigation of a Just-In-Time protocol for
control of all-optical high speed networks. The work includes software design
and simulations to obtain the absolute level of performance of the Just-in-Time
protocol in realistic network and traffic conditions. Deliverables are a
protocol recommendation, simulation runs and the developed simulation and switch
processor software modules. ***
