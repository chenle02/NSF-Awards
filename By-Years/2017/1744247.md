This award supports participation in a two day conference entitled "An Upper
Midwest Commutative Algebra Conference" at the University of Minnesota on
September 22-23, 2017. This is one in a series of meetings designed to bring
together faculty and students from the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin,
as well as from nearby collegiate institutions to discuss topics in and around
commutative algebra. Besides promoting scientific discovery and dissemination,
the conferences seek to build a stronger regional community of researchers and
promote the training and education of graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will consist of six plenary talks by invited
speakers from around the country. While a majority of the faculty in commutative
algebra at the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively junior,
both institutions have broad and deep communities of researchers whose work
interacts with commutative algebra, but who primarily work in other fields
including algebraic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra,
representation theory, computational algebra, and more. Thus this meeting is
well positioned to lead to collaborations across different areas of algebra.
Attendees will consist of a mix of professors, postdocs and students from the
two hosting institutions plus other nearby institutions.
