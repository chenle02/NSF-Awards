9553871 Foley Reaching Every Teacher: A Systemic Approach to Increased Student
Achievement K-12 This is a 3-year project, at $899,815, by the Waltham Public
Schools, in collaboration with Educational Development Corporation (EDC), to
launch a multiyear, districtwide, systemic reform of the city's entire K-12
mathematics program. The project will involve all 200 of the district's teachers
of mathematics in 10 days of teacher enhancement in each of the 3 years. It will
focus on deepening teachers' understanding of mathematics, help them view
mathematics as a problem solving discipline, enhance their pedagogical
repertoire, and promote cross-grade dialogue to make K-12 mathematics
instruction an integrated whole. The enhancement will include preparing teachers
to choose curriculum materials wisely. Administrators and parents are involved
in the program, and local industries and universities will provide volunteers to
substitute for teachers while they attend professional development. The district
reform model will be disseminated through the production of a manual describing
the project with suggestions for adaptations by other small-city districts.
Cost-sharing is reported at 144%.
