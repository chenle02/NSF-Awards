The proposers have developed a model for improving teacher education called
Teaching Teleapprenticeships. Using this model, teacher education students and
practicing teachers learn about teaching and learning by participating in
electronic network-based activities with K-12 students and teachers and
university-based scientists and teacher educators. They will implement and
evaluate this model as a means of improving the preparation of science and
mathematics teachers. To support this model, they will develop, evaluate, and
disseminated communication tools that allow these Teaching Teleapprenticeships
to be practiced widely in a diverse set of science and mathematics educational
settings.
