This research is on thermal plasma processing of High Tc superconductor
processing of 1-2-3 compounds. It involves an attempt to develop a technique to
deposit superconducting coatings on a suitable substrate by means of a thermal
plasma jet. The research is intended to produce a uniform and dense coating of
1-2-3 compound.
