9223165 Rauber This project is aimed at determining the physics of the
production and evolution of rain in warm clouds. The initial goal of the
research is to integrate the various data obtained by radars and aircraft in the
Hawaiian Rainband Project to derive physically coherent descriptions of the
evolution of rain in tropical clouds from the time of cloud formation to the
development of the mature rain shaft. The second goal is to conduct detailed
modeling studies to better clarify the physics of the warm rain process that
cannot be deduced directly from the observations. ***
