Heat straightening has been used to repair damaged steel structures for
many&lt;br/&gt;years. However, until recently practitioners use of the method
was based on&lt;br/&gt;experience gained through trial and error. Recent
research had provided and&lt;br/&gt;engineering basis for the method and
established procedures for its use.&lt;br/&gt;The engineering and construction
community has been hesitant to utilize heat&lt;br/&gt;straightening for several
reasons including: past misuse of the process&lt;br/&gt;which has produced
fractures during repair; concerns about the effect of&lt;br/&gt;heat
straightening on material properties, especially ductility; and
a&lt;br/&gt;general lack of understanding of the method. Its current application
is&lt;br/&gt;primarily in repair of damaged bridge girders with limited
application for&lt;br/&gt;other types of construction. Even though a scientific
basis now exists for&lt;br/&gt;the method, there is a major gap in available
data that has limited the&lt;br/&gt;application of heat straightening. There
have been no significant&lt;br/&gt;investigations into the fracture sensitivity
of heat straightened members.&lt;br/&gt;Without this knowledge, a performance
based design approach cannot be used&lt;br/&gt;for designing heat-straightening
repairs. The purpose of this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;to describe a research plan
that will quantify the process and define the&lt;br/&gt;limiting parameters for
a successful repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
