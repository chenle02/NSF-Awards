Students in calculus and statistics are benefitting from a new curriculum that
emphasizes the concepts and strategies that the powerful ideas of those
disciplines make possible in attacking problems. The new courses are supported
by a laboratory equipped with Macintosh computers running Mathematica and
Minitab. The calculus curriculum is being developed within the framework of NSF-
funded calculus project at Macalester College. The institution will contribute
an amount equal to the award.
