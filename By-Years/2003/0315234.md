This proposal is funded to calibrate the Mg/Ca temperature proxy in multiple
species of planktic foraminifers with hydrographic data from the Cariaco,
Guaymas and Santa Barbara Basins to refine the Mg/Ca temperature proxy in
multiple species of planktic foraminifers. The Mg/Ca proxy will then be compared
with oxygen isotope and alkenone measurements on the same sediment trap samples.
The Mg/Ca calibrations will be used to reconstruct the Holocene of the Cariaco
and Santa Barbara Basins from laminated cores which have been AMS 14C dated and
have detailed foraminiferal oxygen isotope records. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
