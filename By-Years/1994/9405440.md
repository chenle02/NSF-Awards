9405440 Eisenberg The subject of this award is the theoretical study of the
effects of ion-channel and ion-ion interactions involved in diffusive ionic
motion through biological channels. The model under consideration involves (i)
the joint diffusive motion of an ion and a constrained dipole (or charged
oscillator) part of the channel wall with Coulombic interactions, (ii) the mean
field, inter-ionic interactions at the entrance and exit to the channel and the
mean field interactions of the ion with the permanent charge inside the pore,
and (iii) the motion of an ion in the pore with interaction with the mean field
and with a constrained dipole (or charged oscillator) part of the channel. The
theoretical work will concentrate on modeling, analyzing, and simulating the
random motion described in these conditions. This award is supported by several

Neuroscience, and Computational Biology.
