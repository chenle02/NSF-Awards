Work on this project will focus on topics in mathematical analysis connected
with orthogonal polynomials. There are two directions the work takes. First one
can begin with a measure on the real line or unit circle and consider the
corresponding orthogonal polynomials and their recurrence relations. Conversely,
one may begin with a class of polynomials arising from a recurrence relation and
ask for information about measures against which they become orthogonal. In this
latter context, the existence of measures yielding the recurrence coefficients
has been known for some time. Work to be done here is that of determining the
measure from the coefficients in a computationally efficient way. Another line
of investigation will pursue the asymptotic behavior of the Christoffel function
associated with a measure. Christoffel functions are related to statistical
prediction theory. They minimize polynomial integrals associated with families
of orthogonal polynomials. In addition, work will be done analyzing eigenvalues
of infinite tri-diagonal matrices used in the study of Schrodinger equations in
central force fields. Specific goals include improving an inequality for the
limits of Christoffel functions on the unit circle associated with measures of
the Szego class and narrowing the gap between the theory of orthogonal
polynomials and signal processing. Results are expected to play an increasing
role in the processing and transmission of electronic signals.
