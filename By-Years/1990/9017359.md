This project is aimed at completing the dating of the Rajmahal, Deccan, CRB and
the Siberian Traps, as well as obtaining equivalent data for the Serra Geral
Province. The work will provide data for rigorous testing of hypotheses
suggesting periodicity in flood basalt volcanism, their genetic link to
lithospheric rifting episodes, global faunal extinction and/or bolide impact
events. Collaboration with Prof. Edward Farrar at Queen's University is planned.
