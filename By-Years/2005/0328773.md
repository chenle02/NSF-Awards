This is a Collaborative Proposal between Dr. Christyann Darwent, University of
California Davis, and Dr. Genevieve LeMoine, Bowdoin College. The PIs propose to
do the first systematic archaeological survey of the majority of the coast of
Inglefield Land, Northwest Greenland. Through a variety of approaches, including
historical biogeography, synchronic and diachronic technology, and the
integration of historical, ethnohistorical and archaeological data, the proposed
research will help to provide a more holistic culture history and cultural
ecology of Northwest Greenland than previously explored. The research will
explore issues relating to culture contact, technological change, climate
change, and mammalian biogeography of the late prehistoric and protohistoric
sites of the Inughuit, the indigenous people of this region.
