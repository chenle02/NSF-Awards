Researchers in many fields (sociology, economics, industrial relations,
education, business management), business managers, and government policy-makers
believe that computers are driving profound changes in the nature of work and
organization, particularly in increased job skill requirements and new
management practices, such as self-directed teams and employee involvement in
decision-making. However, the lack of appropriate data has limited the progress
of research in this area. This project is a two-wave panel survey of a
nationally representative sample of employees (n=2,500) designed specifically to
investigate the impact of information technology (IT) on job skill requirements
and employee involvement (EI). The surveys will use detailed batteries of items
to generate information on the level and trends of IT use, skill demands, and
specific EI practices. Cross-sectional and fixed-effects multivariate regression
analyses will investigate the direct impact of IT on skill demands and indirect
impacts operating through participation in EI practices, as well as the impacts
of IT, skills, and EI on other employee outcomes, such as wages, working
conditions, and job satisfaction. In addition to filling these recognized gaps
in existing knowledge, the survey will contribute new job and organizational
measures for researchers and methods and results will be made available to those
in government, business, labor, education, and human services who engage in
policy and planning relating workplace changes.
