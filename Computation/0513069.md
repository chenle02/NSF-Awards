The objective of this project is to develop a mathematical framework for the
modeling and analysis of images in two and three dimensions based on certain
basis functions. The foundation of this framework is a class of band-limited
functions (that is, functions that have compactly supported Fourier transforms)
which are also locally concentrated in the spatial domain. Although images are
seldom truly band-limited, they are generally considered piecewise smooth, and
are frequently modeled so locally (or piecewisely) by smooth functions such as
polynomials and trigonometric functions. Since common images contain many
features such as edges and textures that are usually locally compact in the
Fourier domain and simultaneously limited in the spatial (or image) domain,
functions of this type are an ideal choice of basis for image representations.
The PI will develop numerical methods for the construction of the band-limited
basis functions, as well as efficient methods for the analysis and synthesis of
images in such bases. Furthermore, algorithms for targeted image analysis
problems such as restoration and texture analysis will be implemented. The PI
will also investigate the adaptive construction of optimal (or near-optimal)
representations of images, and test the effectiveness of such techniques on a
realistic collection of 2D and 3D images.

Potential applications of the mathematical theory and image analysis algorithms
developed in this project include satellite imagery, remote sensing, and image-
based diagnoses in fields such as medicine, and material science. For example,
in satellite imagery where data are acquired with limited resolution, one
central task is to magnify or interpolate the images so that the faintest
details embedded can be reliably enhanced. Since the methods proposed in this
project provide highly adaptive, localized image representation mechanisms, and
therefore are likely to produce advanced image enhancement techniques with fewer
artifacts than traditional methods, information may be more readily and reliably
extracted. Research proposed in this project also comprises methods and
techniques that have been studied in several disciplines: the theory of band-
limited functions in mathematics, fast algorithms in numerical computation, edge
detection and texture analysis in computer vision. Thus, the project affords
opportunities for cross-pollination between researchers and students in
mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering and statistics, and will
particular benefit the participating students by providing a fertile ground for
them to make connections between mathematics and engineering.
