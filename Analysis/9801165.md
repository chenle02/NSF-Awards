Proposal: DMS-9801165 Principal Investigator: Manoussos Grillakis Abstract:
Grillakis proposes to study certain phenomena that are observed in the evolution
of nonlinear waves. The basic object of study is a map from Euclidean space into
a surface, for which two types of evolution will be investigated. The first is
described by a wave equation, while the second is governed by a Schrodinger
equation. The crux of the proposal is to study basic questions for such
equations; namely, whether solutions exist globally or develop singularities,
and how geometric properties of the target surface relate to analytic properties
of the solutions. The two equations that are proposed for study describe some
extremely interesting physical phenomena. The wave equation, for instance, is a
simplified model describing part of the evolution of two "black holes" in the
setting of General Relativity. The Schrodinger equation models the evolution of
magnetization on, say, a magnetic tape. In this context, the development of
singularities serves as a possible explanation of how the tape becomes
permanently magnetized.
