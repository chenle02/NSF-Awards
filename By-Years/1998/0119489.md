0119489&lt;br/&gt;Achilefu&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is
to design, synthesize, and evaluate novel Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD)
peptide-dye conjugates for optical imaging of tumor angiogenesis. This will be
accomplished by targeting integrin receptors which are overexpressed in
malignant tumors. The conjugation on near infrared carbocyanine dyes to integrin
receptor-avid RGD peptides would yield novel tumor-specific optical contrast
agents. The bioconjugates will be evaluated in vitro to determine their receptor
binding affinity, and in vivo to compare the efficacy of integrin receptor-
specific and nonspecific optical contrast agents. If successful, this research
could develop new infrared fluorescent probes for cancer detection. &lt;br/&gt;
