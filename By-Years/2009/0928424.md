One of the biggest challenges in the field of chemical oceanography is
chemically characterizing the components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM)
pool. The composition of DOM changes rapidly on short time scales and these
changes could be linked to metabolites that are produced during marine microbial
activity. When averaged over large spatial and temporal scales, the metabolic
activity of individual microorganisms and the chemical interactions between
microbes culminate in the observed global elemental cycles. Thus, being able to
accurately characterize the major components of the DOM pool would allow
scientists to predict the impact of changing ocean chemistry on microbial
activity, as well as the marine carbon cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Kujawinski from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will use high
resolution mass spectrometry to characterize specific DOM metabolites produced
by marine organisms to link specific compounds with specific metabolic pathways
of organisms. Through this research, she will be able to identify the DOM
compounds that play a significant role in cell-cell interactions in the marine
environment, which could provide the chemical framework to enhance our
understanding of the short-term DOM variability and microbial processes that
take place in the ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research
makes provision for support of a new graduate student. The methods developed
during this research will be offered to all users of the WHOI FT-MS facility.
Furthermore, a travel fund will be augmented for non-WHOI students and
postdoctoral researchers who might wish to use the facility. This fund extends
the research infrastructure by making the facility more accessible to those
outside the institution.
