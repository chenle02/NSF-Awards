Objective: The objective of this program is to combine theoretical, numerical
and experimental studies to investigate ferrofluid hydrodynamics and its
applications in manipulating non-magnetic objects (such as molecules, particles,
cells and droplets) at the micro-scale for lab-on-a-chip
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is
a multi-disciplinary research program that incorporates colloidal chemistry,
magnetism and fluid mechanics, combining fundamental modeling and analysis with
application-oriented experiments. It results in testable theoretical predictions
and a physical understanding of ferrohydrodynamic manipulation of molecules and
particles that enables practical and useful applications in microfluidic
devices. A novel approach involving ferrofluids will be used to provide a
magnetically uniform environment for molecules and cells, which can be
transported with controlled speed and direction via external magnetic fields.
Fast mixing of molecules and efficient manipulation of cells within ferrofluids
will be enabled through this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
broader impacts are: (1) this program will not only advance the fundamental
understanding of coupled nano-scale magnetic phenomena and fluid dynamics, but
also produce a transformative magnetic manipulation platform that is applicable
to a broad range of areas such as microfluidic biosensors, diagnostic chips,
blood cleansing devices, and single cell studies; (2) this program will
integrate research with lectures and laboratory assignments for undergraduate
and graduate students, increase minority and female students? participations in
science and engineering, and bring awareness of scientific concepts to K-12
students using ferrofluids through a ?Summer Institute? for K-12 teachers.
