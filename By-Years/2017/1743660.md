The PI will develop advanced methods for characterizing minimally-invasive
diagnostic medical devices. The research will facilitate the development and
standardized performance testing of novel biophotonic technologies for early
disease detection and image-guided surgery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D-printed
biomimetic phantoms for the performance testing of near-infrared spectroscopy
systems (NIRS) will be developed and the PI will investigate near-infra-red (IR)
fluorescence (NIRF) image quality through phantom-based measurements to explore
the basis for developing standards that can be used to validate NIRF imaging
systems. The development of novel biomimetic phantoms for noninvasive
fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI) will elucidate optimal fabrication
approaches that influence the effectiveness of 3D-printed phantoms.
