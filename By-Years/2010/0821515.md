With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Stuart J.
Rowan and colleagues John D. Protasiewicz and Gregory P. Tochtrop from Case
Western Reserve University have submitted a proposal in response to the MRI
solicitation to acquire a Cyber-enabled mass spectrometry facility consisting of
a Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF)
instrument to be used for the study of biological and non-biological complex
polymeric systems and for detailed characterization of compounds, e.g.,
macromolecules, peptide polymer hybrids, which can be difficult to achieve by
other techniques. Eighteen major users and students from departments including
Macromolecular Science and Engineering, Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering and
the Medical School will use the spectrometer.

MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate
molecular weights on very large molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use
of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique,
especially in studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a
significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry.
