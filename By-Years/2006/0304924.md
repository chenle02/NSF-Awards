The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km
baseline detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, and an
additional 2 km detector in Hanford. LIGO's operating principle is to use
precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of seismically-
isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small forces from gravitational
waves (GW's) emitted by distant astrophysical events. This project at Louisiana
State University (LSU) supports experimental work to reduce the effects of
ground disturbances on the detector and on future improved detectors. It also
supports the development of software that analyzes and monitors the data to look
for astrophysical GW sources and to understand and improve the
detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broad context, this project involves LSU
faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates at LIGO, bringing LSU
people the benefits of working with experienced LIGO and LIGO Scientific
Collaboration (LSC) scientists, and with apparatus that allows an
excellent&lt;br/&gt;possibility of significant scientific discovery. LSU is
located approximately 35 miles from LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO) and has a
long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO
Scientific Collaboration. LSU shares its libraries, networking facilities, and
workshops. The impact on LLO, a close and extensive relationship with a nearby
research university, is expected to be strengthened with continued
collaboration.
