Abstract OPP-9515380 Hamilton Major declines in fish stocks in the North
Atlantic region are having extensive impacts on northern communities. This
three-year comparative environmental sociological and anthropological study
examines how communities are responding to these environmental changes. The
research design involves the collection and multivariate analysis of statistical
data on fishing communities in Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland and Norway
accompanied by more detailed qualitative case studies on single communities in
Iceland, Newfoundland and northern Norway. The objectives are to examine exactly
how people are being impacted, and what households, communities, governments and
other institutions are doing to adapt to these changes. of particular interest
are concerns about sustainability, and how these vary by generation, gender,
family, community, culture, levels of human and social capital, and political
context. Finally, various adaptive responses that increase or reduce the
resource base will be examined. The project is an important contribution to
research on environmental policy, economic change, social change and global
change.
