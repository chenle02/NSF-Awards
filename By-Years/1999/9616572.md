The goal of this research is to develop fast mapping tools and architectures for
logic emulations that can greatly reduce the mapping time, and thus improve the
usefulness of logic emulation, and the speed of logic simulation. Being
developed are: 1) technology mapping tools that integrate decomposition and
covering, and 2) placement tools that use partitioning methods to do higher-
quality global placement. These are designed to improve both the mapping times
and resulting quality for FPGA-based implementations. Routing complexity
estimators are also being developed to guide algorithm choice. These exploit the
mapping time-quality tradeoffs in many techniques. Also being investigated are
new FPGA architectures for logic emulators, and systems that can support much
faster mapping times, yet still achieve high quality results. These steps are
being integrated into a complete mapping-time oriented tool suite for logic
emulation which exploits the mapping time/quality tradeoff in these systems.
