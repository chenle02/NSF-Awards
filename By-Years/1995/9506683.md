9506683 Tackley The PI will perform a numerical modeling study in global
dynamics, with the aim of implementing a model of plate tectonics into numerical
convection code, incorporating geochemical aspects into the code, studying the
Earth's thermo-chemical evolution in the light of phase transitions, chemical
differentiation and mixing, and plate tectonics, using a wide range of
observations to constrain the model parameters. The PI will use large-scale 3-D
numerical simulations on parallel supercomputers, analytical analyses,
parameterized thermo-chemical history models, and interdisciplinary comparisons
between results and observations. ***
