Robert Ofoli Abstract The objective of this project is to use total internal
reflection flourescence (TIRF) to study the adsorption of proteins at the
liquid-liquid interface. TIRF provides the ability to selectively excite species
at or near an interface, and enables one to quantify the adsorption and
desorption kinetics. Specific aspects of the project include adaptation of the
standard experimental protocol used with TIRF at the solid-liquid interface to
extend its application at the liquid-liquid interface, development of a
calibration technique for quantifying adsorption at the liquid-liquid interface,
and equilibrium adsorption of several proteins. The TIRF experimental setup will
utilize a inverted microscope, a 5 W continuous wave ion argon laser, and
standard photometry. The adaptation of TIRF to the liquid-liquid interface
provides a new tool that may be used to elucidate important liquid-liquid
interfacial phenomena. While fundamental in nature, the study is clearly of both
scientific and technological significance,and should help advance scientific
understanding of protein adsorption and interactions at the liquid-liquid
interface. ***
