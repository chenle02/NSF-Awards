9400797 Herb Herb will continue her work in the field of representation theory
and harmonic analysis on reductive p-adic groups. She will concentrate on
studying the most important invariant distributions on these groups, namely
tempered characters and orbital integrals. Specific problems which she is
interested in include computing Fourier inversion formulas for orbital
integrals, and studying reducibility of induced representations for non
connected groups. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics. ***
