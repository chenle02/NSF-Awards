Previous work has shown that many complete t haplotypes and many haplotypes in
wild mice are combinations of t-specific and wild-type alleles. These
exceptional alleles were confined to the distal portion of the t complex,
suggesting that the nature of the chromosomal rearrangements and therefore the
consequences of recombination differ between the proximal and distal portions of
the complex. The first goal of the proposed studies involves testing several
aspects of a hypothesis proposed to account for the origin and evolution of the
to complex, by estimating the relative ages of the proximal and distal portions
of the complete t haplotypes, mosaic haplotypes and their wild-type homologues
through restriction fragment and sequence analysis of selected alleles, testing
whether exceptional loci are confined to the distal portion of the t complex,
characterizing partial t haplotypes in wild mice, identifying the boundaries of
the recombination events leading to mosaic haplotypes, and estimating rates of
gene flow and introgression between subspecies of Mus in Europe. The second goal
involves a gene mapping test of the hypothesis that there is more than one tail
interaction (tct) locus within the t complex and molecular analysis of a 35kb
segment where one of the tct loci is presumably located. The t complex in house
mice offers unique opportunities for studying the origin and evolution of gene
complexes, especially those that act as genetic parasites by preferentially
transmitting themselves to the presumed detriment of the host.
