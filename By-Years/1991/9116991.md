This project involves developing and testing a hypermedia database based on the
computer science literature. Human- computer interaction and information storage
and retrieval research are being applied to develop a new paradigm of user-
centered database development and access. Local testing is being done by faculty
and students at VPI&amp;SU, with additional testing over the Internet. Computer
science literature provided by the Association for Computing Machinery is being
transformed to better serve the needs of a wide spectrum of computing
practitioners. Based on interviews with computer professionals and analysis of
existing publications, "objects" used in computing are being identified so that
a tailored object- oriented database including algorithms, algorithm
descriptions, bibliographic records, full texts of articles, reviews, data, page
images, and related multimedia can be stored and appropriately linked for
searching and browsing. New minimal perfect hashing and graph partitioning
algorithms provide efficient access to the large, distributed graph of objects.
As a result of this project, it will be easier to locate and manipulate
information in the resulting electronic archive, which will facilitate reading,
writing, annotating, and sharing. Software and methodology used in this project
will aid other fields as they develop sophisticated electronic archives with
multimedia capabilities.
