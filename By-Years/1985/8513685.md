Support is provided for the Committee on Natural Disasters. The National
Research Council established the Committee to maintain readiness for conducting
post-disaster reconnaissance studies and documenting perishable information
useful to researchers, designers, planners, building officials, and emergency
preparedness officials. The teams quickly enter the field to collect data on the
performance of constructed facilities and social systems following such events
as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods. Such rapid post-disaster
audits allow for the acquisition of data that would often be unavailable once
rehabilitation work is undertaken in a disaster-struck area. It is anticipated
that four studies will be conducted during this project period. Future study
sites will be selected when it is evident that the performance of engineered
structures and systems under disaster loadings and performance of response and
recovery systems under disaster conditions can be effectively studied.
