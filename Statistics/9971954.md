Abstract: This research focuses on performing functional data analysis, the
study of sets of curves, when the pattern of variation across the population is
complex. Specifically, we focus on three nonstandard patterns. The first is when
some curves have a particular feature while others do not. The second is when
the curves follow a mixture distribution across the population, and the third is
where the curve parameters are not identically distributed, but depend
extensively on covariates.

Functional Data Analysis allows modeling of complex processes in meteorology,
oceanography, medicine, criminology, and other areas. Realistic modeling of
these processes often requires complex descriptions of variation across the
population. For example, if one observes temperature continuously, one can
observe the daily rise in temperature during the day and the decrease at night.
On many days, but not all, this cycle is partially interrupted by storms. Models
for daily temperature must accommodate this behavior. The proposed research is
intended to increase the flexibility of functional data analysis so that it may
provide more realistic analyses.
