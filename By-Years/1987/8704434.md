The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University
of Illinois at Chicago plans to acquire six workstations and a disk server to
expand a research laboratory that was recently established. This laboratory will
support experimentation in distributed query processing, fault-tolerant database
systems, automatic database design, and computer graphics. All the planned
research is fundamentally experimental in nature. It requires a multiple node
network which is separate from the general computing facilities in the
department, and provides special resources needed by each investigator. The
network will be shared by four research groups, but will also be partitionable
so that certain experiments can be performed by one group without affecting
other groups environment.
