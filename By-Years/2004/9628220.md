9628220 Agee The proposed experiments are to determine the wetting behavior of
molten Fe-alloy in perovskite and magnesiowuestite solid matrices. These
experiments will investigate the influence of lower mantle minerals on molten
Fe-alloy percolation. Results will place important constraints on models of
Earth and planetary core formation. Three experimental strategies will be used:
(1) Equilibrate (Mg,Fe)SiO3-perovskite, magnesiowuestite, and molten Fe-alloy in
a multi-anvil device at subsolidus, high-pressure conditions (~ 20 GPa), from
Homestead L5 chondrite. Dihedral angles of crystal-crystal-liquid interfaces
will be measure on quenched run products to quantify grain boundary wetting and
alloy melt connectivity. (2) Equilibrate synthetic mixtures of
CaSiO3-perovskite, magnesiowustite, and molten Fe-alloy at subsolidus
temperatures in the pressure range 16-20 GPa. These experiments will provide a
cross check on the dihedral angle measurements and textural equilibrium. (3)
Experiments will be done to examine the wetting angle of perovskites +
magnesiowuestite in a sulfur-free system. These experiments will offer new data
on the relationship between alloy composition and wetting angle behavior.
