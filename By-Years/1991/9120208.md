The control of the mitotic and meiotic behavior of eukaryotic chromosomes is
essential for genetic stability of cells during growth and reproduction. An
understanding of the cis- and trans- acting elements that are required for
proper chromosome behavior is therefore of critical importance. The focus of the
investigations in our laboratory is on the structure present at the ends of the
eukaryotic chromosome, called the telomere. The goal of this proposal is to
investigate the function of the predominant yeast telomere binding protein,
RAP1. To begin to understand the role of RAP1 at the yeast telomere two
approaches are being proposed: a) the biochemical and genetic characterization
of a series of novel semi-dominant alleles of RAP1 that specifically influence a
number of telomere-related processes, and b) a genetic study of the interactions
between RAP1 and other gene products affecting telomere length. These studies
will ultimately be applied to the isolation and characterization of extragenic
suppressors of rap| mutations: a key step in the identification of factors
interacting with RAP1 in its role at the telomere.
