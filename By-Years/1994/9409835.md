9409835 Shin The past decade has seen a growth in major research efforts
dedicated to the examination of popular support for democratic transformations
of authoritarian rule. Teams of political scientists and sociologists have
conducted national sample surveys of the mass publics of newly democratizing
countries in Est Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Latin America. From
these surveys, much is known about levels, trends, and sources of mass support
for democracy. From the surveys, however, there is little known about the
dynamics of mass support for democratization. Which segments of the mass
citizenry have continued supporting democratization? Which segments have
discontinued their support of it? What has motivated some to modify their
democratic support? Undoubtedly these questions are crucial to formulating an
appropriate strategy for consolidating nascent democratic rule. Yet these
questions have not been addressed adequately in the large body of literature
which has recently accumulated on the mass culture of democratization. This
research investigation seeks to address these questions of strategic
significance from the perspective of life quality which ordinary citizens
experience and envision for themselves and their country. Specifically, the
study hypothesizes that individual citizens react to democratization in response
to their perceptions of how it has affected the quality of their life in the
past and their expectations of how it would affect the quality of their life in
the future. This hypothesis will be tested with a new set of mass survey data to
be collected from Korea, a country which has made considerable progress in
establishing a democratic political culture over the past five years.
