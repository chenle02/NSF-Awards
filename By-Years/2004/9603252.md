This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in condensed matter
physics involves the research groups of Robert L. Stamps at Ohio State
University and Kamel Ounadjela at the Institute for the Physics and Chemistry of
Materials in Strasbourg, France. The award provides travel support and living
expenses to Dr. Stamps and his graduate student. The objective of the research
is to investigate the magnetic interactions and magnetization processes in thin
magnetic multilayer films, wires and patterned arrays of submicron and nanometer
dimensions. The project takes advantage of French expertise in the growth of
magnetic films. This is complemented by U.S. expertise in the properties of thin
films and will advance understanding of magnetic materials.
