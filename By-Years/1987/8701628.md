Phonon Emission From a Hot Two-Dimensional Electron Gas This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. This research project
addresses questions of the measurements on the nature of the phonons emitted
from a hot two-dimensional electron gas contained in semiconductor devices at
low temperatures. Under these conditions, the principal energy loss is by
acoustic phonon emission. The research is of interest because the much higher
electron mobility in these devices should lead to well defined cyclotron
frequencies as well as providing an opportunity to examine effects associated
with cutoffs in the phonon-wave vector. The project is under the direction of
Dr. James M. Madsen, Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden CO
80401, U.S.A., and Professor L.J. Challis, Department of Physics, The University
of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2 RD, England. This award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, language
training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 or the U.S.
home institution.
