This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will research
quantitative metrics for comparing and assessing the performance of shape
retrieval tools (SRT), which have potential application in 3D search. 3D search
enables a designer to search the existing store of parts that have already been
manufactured to find parts with similar shapes. That store incorporates the
cumulative expertise of all the designers and manufacturing engineers who worked
on them and each part has a detailed 3D geometrical description, an associated
manufacturer and a proven process plan that can be depended on to execute
reliably, therefore greatly simplifying to process of making the needed parts.
The developed measures will be used to evaluate available tools and attempt to
identify their underlying strengths and weaknesses, including their retrieval
accuracy and robustness.

Many industries have been transformed by sophisticated search utilities that
give users easy access to services, but manufacturing services remain
inaccessible and too frequently depend on expert intervention and designer-to-
fabricator negotiations. The most critical tool for implementing manufacturing
as a service is a user-friendly 'search engine' for locating geometrically
similar parts that already have been manufactured, along with their associated
manufacturers. Since those manufacturers have all the capability and knowhow
needed to produce the parts, they are potentially high profit parts for
suppliers and low-cost parts for customers. Interestingly, this evolutionary
model has been successful in transforming most services other than
manufacturing, including retailing, publishing, tax preparation, and etc. The
investigator will organize and conduct special panel sessions highlighting his
findings at the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference and an
appropriate Association for Computing Machinery conference.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
