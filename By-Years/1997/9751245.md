The recent addition of computer simulations into the laboratories of several of
the biology courses has greatly enhanced the learning experience of students. By
combining the practical experience of traditional wet laboratories with the
unique opportunities for student input and discovery that is available through
computer simulations, students in these laboratories are exposed to and actively
participate in all phases of the scientific process ranging from the inception
of experimental design to the dissemination of experimental results. In this
project, the number and types of laboratories for which this pedagogic model is
offered are expanded to include laboratories involving modern molecular
techniques. Integration of computer simulations with wet laboratory exercises
provides a better learning environment than either type of exercise provides
alone. Because of past equipment limitations, the university has been unable to
offer wet laboratories to complement the computer simulation of molecular
techniques used in Genetics and Cell and Molecular Biology. A new laboratory
course entitled Molecular Techniques in Biology has been developed to serve as a
general companion course for lecture-only courses. By these additions to the
curriculum, students are better prepared to conduct independent research, enter
the competitive job market, or enter graduate school. Success of these
laboratories can be evaluated using the departmental learning outcomes
assessment process. Parameters used for this assessment include the number of
students participating in local, regional, and national scientific meetings; the
number of publications written by students; and the number of students accepted
into competitive graduate and professional programs. An additional parameter
includes job placement in the discipline within 24 months of graduation. Plans
for dissemination of this project's results include sponsoring an on-site
training program for sister institutions. *
