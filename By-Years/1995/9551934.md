The diversity of communication applications and the spectrum of system-level
technologies upon which they rely provide a rich set of opportunities to develop
projects allowing students to apply and integrate knowledge obtained from
courses across the curriculum while simultaneously developing the spectrum of
CAD, prototyping, and testing experiences critical to the engineering workplace.
Through this project, a Communication System Prototyping Laboratory (CSPL)
provides a curriculum-wide laboratory resource for integration of junior- and
senior-level required and elective topics through multidisciplinary
communication-based design experiences. The CSPL organization emulates the
application-driven interdisciplinary environment of a corporate research and
development laboratory through use of multiple "microlabs" within a single
instructional lab linked by a prototype fiber optic backbone. As the foundation
of the CSPL organization, the Lightwave Microlab supports student design
activities based on lightwave communication applications with a Prototype Fiber
Network; a Photonic Prototyping Center for student optoelectronic interfacing
and optical prototyping; a Lightwave Test Measurement Center for component,
transmission medium, and system-level evaluation; and a Photonic Reference
Library. With basic infrastructure for other microlabs in place, this project
specifically addresses the instrumentation needs of the Lightwave Microlab.
