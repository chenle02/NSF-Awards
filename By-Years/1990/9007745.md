It is proposed to assemble a flexible ultra- high vacuum (UHV) chamber for in-
situ etching and cleaning of III-V heterostructures by a variety of techniques,
including a unique damage-free supersonic beam process under development by the
principal investigator in collaboration with colleagues in the Department of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. The chamber, which is to be attached to an
existing molecular beam epitaxy system, will be used by the principal
investigator and his colleagues in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science research on high performance electronic, opto-electronic,
photonic, and quantum devices and integrated systems. In addition to being
designed for etching and cleaning inside the UHV environment, this system is
designed to enable researchers to mask, etch, pattern, and/or otherwise process
III-V heterostructures outside the growth system; to return them to the UHV
growth environment; and to then clean, etch, and prepare their surfaces for
further MBE growth. It furthermore includes provision to coat the prepared
surfaces with arsenic to protect them from contamination during subsequent
transfer and storage within the multi-chamber growth system, as well as during
removal from the system.
