Theoretical investigations and calculations of low- energy hadron properties
and interactions are being conducted in terms of quark and gluon constituents by
modeling the large distance behavior of the relativistic field theory known as
Quantum Chromodynamics. Two complementary lines of investigation are being
followed. The first involves truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations of
motion, and the second involves use of a model quark field theory to produce an
effective field theory of mesons. Specific topics being addressed include meson
masses and decays, meson-meson and meson-nucleon interaction coupling constants
and form factors, and electromagnetic form factors. The experimental issues
being confronted now in experiments at the Jefferson Laboratory are of primary
concern within this research program. An extension is being made to address
these matters at finite temperature and matter density for application to the
experimental program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility under
construction. The investigations are designed to put onto a theoretical basis
those aspects of meson interactions and electromagnetic couplings that have in
the past been mainly phenomenological.
