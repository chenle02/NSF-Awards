Under this award for a Cooperative Agreement, JOI Inc. will mange the US Science
Support Program (USSSP) associated with the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program
(IODP). This will be accomplished by developing and implementing the following:
planning and program development objectives: pre-drilling activities; instrument
development; platform participation and post-expedition support; education and
community engagement activities; and the creation of a coordinating structure
and administration plan. As it did in USSSP-ODP, JOI will continue to receive
advice and guidance from the U.S. Science Advisory Committee. Within the
implementation period of IODP (2004-2007), it is expected that IODP will
accomplish about 10 drilling expeditions with a light drill ship and perhaps as
many as three Mission Specific Platform (MSP) expeditions in the arctic and
shallow water. The USSSP-IODP will provide the ways and means to enable a broad
cross-section of the U.S. scientific community to advance knowledge and
understanding of all aspects of the planet, including Earth, oceans, atmosphere,
biota, and cryosphere, as delineated in IODP's initial long-range scientific
plan "Earth, Oceans and Life: Scientific Investigations of the Earth System
Using Multiple Drilling Platforms and New Technology." The broader impacts of
USSSP-IODP will be to enhance the nation's research infrastructure by supporting
scientists in a variety of U.S. academic institutions and provide opportunities
to promote teaching, training, and learning. Finally, to enhance scientific
understanding across society and to help grow the U.S. scientific community, JOI
will implement a community engagement campaign that will convert the scientific
results of IODP and the USSSP-IODP into accessible products that will be
disseminated broadly in a variety of formats.
