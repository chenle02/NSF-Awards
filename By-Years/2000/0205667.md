A highly dependable information infrastructure requires systems that are
massively replicated, slow to fail, and resistant to attack. The LOCKSS system
uses novel techniques for increasing dependability that show promise of wider
applicability and increasing importance in this area,
including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a fault-tolerant system from a large
number of replicas that take part in "opinion polls" rather than a small number
of replicas that take part in elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limiting the speed
at which the system operates in order to limit the speed at which it can
fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a system that resists the activities of the
"bad guy" without requiring that secrets be kept, in part by using public
communication and a reputation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience with this
and other peer-to-peer systems shows that the real challenges of making systems
work only become apparent at a realistic operational scale and running on real
networks. The LOCKSS system is now running on the Internet with 60 peers
worldwide. The project will exploit this LOCKSS test-bed to investigate areas in
which further work is needed.&lt;br/&gt;
