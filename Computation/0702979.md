Highly oscillatory problems, ubiquitous in applications, are typically consider
to be very difficult theoretically and demanding computationally. However,
recent developments provide highly effective means to treat problems with rapid
oscillation. The Isaac Newton Institute program brings together professionals
concerned in highly oscillatory phenomena, with an emphasis on multiscale
modeling, homogenization, symplectic integration, Riemann-Hilbert techniques,
highly oscillatory quadrature and exponential integrators, together with
theoreticians and with workers in a wide range of applications. Typical grand
challenges that we seek to address by this multidisciplinary collaboration are
the solution of Schroedinger, Helmholtz and Maxwell equations, as well as long-
term integration of equations originating in molecular dynamics.

High oscillation pervades a very wide range of applications: electromagnetics,
fluid dynamics, molecular modelling, quantum chemistry, computerized tomography,
plasma transport, celestial mechanics, medical imaging, signal processing. . . .
It has been addressed by a wide range of mathematical techniques, ranging from
asymptotic theory, harmonic analysis, theory of dynamical systems, theory of
integrable systems and differential geometry. The computation of highly
oscillatory problems has spawned a large number of different numerical
approaches and algorithms. The purpose of this program is to foster research
into different aspects of high oscillation, including the theoretical, the
computational and the applied, from a united standpoint and to promote the
synergy implicit in an interdisciplinary activity.
