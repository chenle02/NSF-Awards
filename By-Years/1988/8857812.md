This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the work of Dr. Jay
Siegel, University of California, San Diego. This work is focused on the broad
topic of molecular recognition. Molecular recognition is at the heart of all
chemical interactions and reactions. Its details will explain not only the
complicated interactions of biomolecules, but also will allow the design of
specific catalytic processes and important new chemical reactions.
Conformational analyses of helical substructures in both monomers and polymers
will be undertaken. These may lead to isosteric structures having different
electronic and chromophoric properties. Such structures have potential
applications as semiconductors, molecular solenoids, and non-linear optical
materials. In addition, organometallic arene-metal complexes will be prepared to
study metal-ligand dynamics, metal-centered reactivity, and bond fixation in the
arenes.
