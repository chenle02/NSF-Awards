Sablefishes are one of the most valuable ground fish species in the Northeast
Pacific. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to establish a time-series
of juvenile sablefish growth beginning in the 1940s, using otoliths collected
since the 1980s; 2) to evaluate the correspondence between juvenile growth and
recruitment to adult stocks of sablefishes, and the relation of these factors to
year-class strength; 3) to compare and contrast growth rates and recruitment
indices; and 4) to develop preliminary models that relate interannual and
interdecadal responses in growth and recruitment to past environmental
conditions
