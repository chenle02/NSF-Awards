Dr. Craig Montell was awarded the Prestigious Presidential Young Investigator
award. A well-trained investigator and academician, he appears to be well on his
way to achieving an illustrious career in the Biological Sciences. Dr. Montell
will continue his indepth investigations and characterizations of a family of
genes, and the functions of the proteins they encode, associated with the
phototransduction of light stimuli into electrical stimuli within the visual
system. His molecular biological model is in the Drosophila and utilizes
sophisticated methodologies of germ-line gene transfer. Additionally, Dr.
Montell has characterized a number of Drosophila mutants that will be exploited
to understand the molecular basis for differing spectral sensitivities of
rhodopsin cell type pairs affiliated with the visual transduction process. The
potential for Dr. Montell to provide outstanding contributions to the field of
molecular neurobiology is considerable. This award will assist in the
professional development of a young, enthusiastic, and highly motivated
scientist.
