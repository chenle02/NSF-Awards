This grant will support a new summer school focused on the nuclear and particle
astrophysics and cosmology - following themes expounded in the National Research
Council's report "Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos." The school will be held
over the two-week period June 29-July 10, 2009, on the campus of the University
of Washington in Seattle, WA. The proposed school will cover theory, experiment,
and observation, and will welcome students from all of these areas: the goal is
to provide the students with a broad overview of the forefront problems in the
field. The program is being designed to strike good balances between theory and
experiment, and among the fields interested in fundamental astrophysics. The
target audience includes advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral
researchers. The school's program has been organized around six subjects *
Cosmology and the early universe * Formation and evolution of structure * High
energy astrophysics * Supernovae and nucleosynthesis * Gravity and gravitational
waves * Neutrino physics and astrophysics

The PI's are seeking special University of Washington support to help in the
recruitment of participants from under-represented groups.
