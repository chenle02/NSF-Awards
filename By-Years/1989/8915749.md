During 1989-90 the Ice Core Working Group (ICWG) will develop a long-range plan
for U.S. Ice Core Research. This plan will be based on the major research
questions and potential ice core sites identified in the report of the Workshop
of U.S. Ice Core Research and the information gathered in the report on U.S. Ice
Core Research Capabilities. The ICWG will actively solicit the input and
comments of key members of related disciplines, such as paleoclimatology,
climate modeling, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, etc, to identify research
priorities and a suite of ice core projects for the next decade. The plan will
formulate the contributions of the U.S. Ice Core research community to the study
of Global Change (ICSU program). During 1990-91 the ICWG will work with NSF and
its Polar Ice Coring Office (PICO) towards the realization of the research plan.
The requested budget covers the costs of ICWG meetings held to discuss, and
further develop, the long-range research goals, as well as day-to-day
administrative costs of the ICWG.
