This proposal requests funds to purchase an inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (ICPMS) system for trace element and speciation analysis. The
proposed system offers five key improvements over current equipment at UNM: a)
improved detection limits, b) speciation of&lt;br/&gt;metals by HPLC separation,
c) spot analysis of solid samples through use of existing laser ablation
equipment, d) analysis of biological thin sections using a CryoCell, and e)
isotopic analysis. This instrument will be integral to the research and training
missions at UNM in areas related to energy development, water resources, and
protection of the environment, and human health. Knowledge gained from research
conducted at UNM and students graduating from its academic programs will be key
to permitting responsible development of energy resources as well as protection
of human health and environment in the arid southwest.
