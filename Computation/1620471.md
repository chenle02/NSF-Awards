This project combines modeling with numerical methods for the investigation of
the self-assembly of block copolymers. In particular, this project will result
in the development of efficient and predictive computational tools that predict
the self-assembly of block copolymers that present a free boundary. In addition,
this formalism will be used to develop a methodology for solving the inverse
problem of finding the geometry of a mask component that will direct the self-
assembly of copolymer towards a target design. Copolymers are ubiquitous in
science and engineering, they provide unique characteristics that modern
industrial processes depend on to keep up with Moore's law and constitute an
excellent model system for scientific studies of self-assembly. Therefore, the
research has a broader impact in the multiscale modeling and computation of more
general self-assembly processes that arise in other physical and biological
sciences. The specific objectives of the project are: 1) to develop an
innovative, effective computational framework for predicting the self-assembly
of block copolymer in both two and three spatial dimensions in the case of free
surfaces; 2) to use this framework to understand the coupling between
thermodynamic, kinetic and surface tension forces on the self-assembly and on
the geometry of the free surface; 3) to apply this framework to the prediction
of a template's geometry that will direct the self-assembly towards a target
design. Diblock copolymers are melts made of molecular chains with two
chemically different species along their backbone that self-assemble into
ordered structures used in high density hard drives, drug delivery systems,
magnetic dots, nano-pores, nano-wires, membranes with tailored nano-scales
porosity, in battery fuel cells and silicon capacitors. Since the surface of the
melt plays a crucial role in the self-assembly, this research will develop a
computational paradigm that enables the simulation of the self-assembly of free
boundary diblock copolymers. This paradigm combines the level-set methodology
for dynamic interfaces with the self-consistent field theory describing the
self-assembly of diblock copolymers at equilibrium. These studies will be
carried out by the PI who works in an interdisciplinary environment with close
collaborations with experts in the field of diblock copolymers that bring forth
a synergy of modeling and computational ideas. The broader impacts of the work
also include 1) the training of computational students in an interdisciplinary,
international team, 2) the integration of undergraduate from underrepresented
groups, and 3) potential industrial relevance.
