Biomimicking of Natural Tubular Structures L.J. Gibson

Abstract

In nature, small diameter, cylindrical tubular structures are widespread (e.g.
animal quills, plant stems). Almost all have a thin, dense outer shell supported
by a honeycomb-like or foam-like core, analogous to the stiffeners in thin-
walled engineering tubular structures (e.g. aircraft fuselages). In such tubular
structures, the elastic core supports the outer shell, increasing its buckling
resistance. The overall goal of this study is to improve the design of small-
scale engineering tubular structures by mimicking the microstructure of natural
tubular structures. The intellectual merit of the project is in the use of a
honeycomb or foam core material, rather than individual stiffeners, to improve
the design of small-scale cylindrical tubes. The broader impact resulting from
proposed activity includes outreach to Boston public schools and general public,
through educational displays on biomimicking donated to the Boston Nature Center
and the Museum of Science, and through public lectures at the Arnold Arboretum.
There is also potential for commercial development of lightweight tubular
components for use in aircraft structures, robot arms, sporting equipment and
energy absorption devices in automobiles.
