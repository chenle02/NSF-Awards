9622282 Sampath The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State
University will purchase a residual gas analyzer (RGA) and the fixturing
necessary for installation on our existing vacuum processing equipment. This
processing equipment incorporates a unique technology, developed in our
laboratory. This technology allows substrates for semiconductor and optical film
processing to be transported directly from air into a vacuum environment where
film growth can occur then back to air (AVA) with the transportation of
substrates taking place in under a second. This novel capability allows very
precise control over film growth. Unique processing and growth conditions are
possible with the AVA technology. Furthermore, sample processing effort and
experimental variability have been greatly decreased.. ***
