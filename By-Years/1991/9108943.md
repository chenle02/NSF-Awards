Information on the early evolution of the higher primates (anthropoids) is
largely known from excavations at the Fayum in Egypt. Many descriptions of the
Fayum fossil primates have been published over the years but there has been
little attempt to put them in the context of an ecological setting or their
ecological relationships to other extant mammalian species. This project will
seek to detail the mammalian component of the Fayum community and any changes in
its structure over time. Identification of species has already been initiated on
the Fayum fossils housed at Duke University and will be completed on those in
the collection at the Cairo Geological Museum. Identification will be
accomplished through dental analysis. With data on the relative abundance of
species, the PIs will be able to investigate changes in the composition over
time and possibly space and thus provide a clearer picture of the origin of the
higher primates.
