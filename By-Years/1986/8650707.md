The teaching of optics will be combined with modern physics to prepare students
for a technology that increasingly utilizes lasers and opto- electronics. This
emphasis will be expanded in introductory courses, and a new, upper-level
optics, light, and modern physics laboratory will be established. Experiments
have been designed and successfully tested which combine laser light, modern
physics, fiber optics, and computer interfacing. The department will purchase
optical tables and lasers for making holographic and other interferometric
measurements, optical fiber equipment for measuring the characteristics of light
transmission, and equipment for computer interfacing. These experiments will be
coordinated with experiments in modern physics for which little additional
equipment is required. Simpler experiments using this equipment will be
introduced into the introductory courses. The treatment of optics as a component
of modern physics will increase the students' understanding of optical
phenomena, especially those involving quantum mechanical concepts, and prepare
them for a technology that uses electronics to interface lasers.
