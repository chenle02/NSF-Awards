This is an inter-institutional collaborative research project involving
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Wright State University (WSU).
Pictorial systems which retrieve pictures based on contents have wide
applications. For example, learning can be facilitated by retrieving pictures
from electronic encyclopedia; radiologists can be assi sted in diagnosis;
satellite images of desired contents can be retrieved by earth scientists to
perform research; appropriate garments can be viewed by customers before
deciding where they go shopping, etc. The purpose of the project is to construct
a generic picture retrieval and analysis system which can be easily adapted to
various applications , including the construction of digital libraries and their
use in retrieval of information. Similarity based retrieval involving spatial
relationships, and fuzzy and precise matching is used one of the approaches
investigated. Other techniques that play a significant role are: multi-
dimensional searching; parametrized similarity functions; visual query tools;
image analysis techniques such as segmentation; object recognition; and color
and shape analysis. The retrieval subsystem is developed at UIC, while the image
analysis subsystem is developed at WSU. The two subsystems will be combined to
form an integrated system. The usefulness of the system will be demonstrated for
the following ap plications: retrieval of photographs for the photo-shop at UIC,
and retrieval of images for diagnosis of skin cancer at Rush-Presbyterian
Medical Center in Chicago.
