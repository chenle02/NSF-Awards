The aim of this project is to equip all required core-course laboratories with
the best and most versatile computer-based test equipment available. More
complex systems designs can be assigned and the engineer in training will have
to do more creative thinking to perform the more realistic open-ended design
tasks. The major instruments required for each of 27 laboratory stations will be
a personal computer, and the following computer programmable equipment: digital
storage oscilloscope, function generator, multimeter, counter, power supply, and
software. The equipment will be used in three required sophomore and junior
level electronics laboratory courses. The laboratories are open to the students
for special projects. The use of this new generation of equipment will improve
greatly the practical design experience of the engineer.
