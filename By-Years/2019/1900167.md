This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Great Lakes
Mathematical Physics" that will be held June 28-30, 2019 at Oberlin
College.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
mathematical physics, specifically in the areas of random matrices, quantum spin
systems, one- and many-body localization in disordered quantum systems, the KPZ
equation and universality class, and rigorous results in general relativity. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend
and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
