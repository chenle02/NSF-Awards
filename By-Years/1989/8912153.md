The workshop to be held at Huntsville, AL, is on the modeling aspects of the
magnetosphere/ionosphere coupling processes. The focus of this meeting is to
assess the current status of this field on the following aspects: (1) global
plasma characteristics such as density, bulk flow, heat flow and temperature,
(2) mesoscale processes such as polar flow, and (3) smallscale processes such as
turbulence and heating. This workshop will bring together theorists and
numerical modelers.
