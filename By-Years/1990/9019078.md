This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Chenault's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the University of
Delaware. The thrust of Dr. Chenault's research is the chemoenzymatic synthesis
of sugar phosphates, disaccharides and oligosaccharides. New strategies will be
developed for the regio- and stereoselective formation of glycosides.
Phosphorylated sugars, both natural and unnatural, will be prepared as target
molecules, as precursors to oligosaccharides, and as part of phosphorylated
oligosaccharides having new biological and physicochemical properties. In
principle, enzymatic methods are ideally suited to the regio- and
stereoselective manipulation of minimally protected saccharides. Once the
synthetic methodology is established, the chemistry of the derived compounds as
biomechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic tools will be explored.
