9508411 Puckett The Department of Mathematics at U. C. Davis proposes to
purchase a DEC Alpha 2100 computer and peripheral devices. This equipment will
be used to support research in Large Scale Scientific Computation, Geometry,
Asymptotic Analysis and Mathematical Physics. This research will include the use
of symbolic mathematics computer languages and the development of graphical
interface tools for interactive computing and the display of data.
