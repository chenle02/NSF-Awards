9451008 Ben-Avi A multipurpose multi-media systems laboratory with workstations
equipped with hardware to accommodate voice, video, audio and direct digital
inputs is developed. The workstations include specialized co-processors for fast
2- and 3-dimensional and true "stereo" real-time graphics and animation, and a
slave DSP co-processor. Using this high-level platform, students conduct
projects in graphics, animation, speech recognition and processing, AI-based
computer vision, digital and analog audio signal analysis, and biomedical signal
processing and analysis. The laboratory makes possible free experimentation and
the completion of more sophisticated projects, concentrating on the application
area, without the need for months of low-level programming and debugging of
hardware - experiences which are amply addressed in other courses. The multi-
media laboratory enabled modernization of existing courses and the introduction
of a new design-based systems course, "Multi-media Systems Design".
