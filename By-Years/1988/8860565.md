This multidisciplinary investigation is to develop an economical and efficient
ultraviolet absorbing delivery system, based on lignins, for the
nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) which is specific to the gypsy moth, Lymantria
dispar. Since the NPV is susceptible to ultraviolet radiation, the successful
application of this virus to the field is dependent upon the development of an
efficient and cost effective delivery system. This system would associate the
virus with a protective UV absorber which then could be sprayed onto caterpillar
infested trees and forests as desired. The gyspy moth has spread rapidly across
the United States and now represents a serious treat to the Nation's forests.
The development of the lignin-based delivery system will result in an effective
and environmentally safe treatment for controlling this pest. In addition, the
potential market for lignins is large since state and federal agencies are
planning for the spraying of large tracts of forest and parklands. The market
for homes and nurseries is also very significant.
