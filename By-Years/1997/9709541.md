People are motivated for survival purposes to develop cognitive understandings
of the world that are as accurate as possible. When their subjective sense of
accurate understanding becomes strained (e.g., by unexpected events), people
typically respond with an alerting response to the source of the uncertainty and
they take some action to improve their state of knowledge. It is proposed that
the most important source of a motivation for uncertainty reduction is one's
potential failure to understand the relatively unchanging causes of events. When
a person is uncertain about their ability to identify cause and effect
relationships, it is expected to create doubt about one's perception of reality
and one's ability to exercise effective control. The current research focuses on
the concept of causal uncertainty beliefs. The experiments examine cognitive
processes that are associated with causal uncertainty beliefs, and some of the
motivational consequences of such beliefs. This research has important
implications for understanding people's responses to adverse circumstances, the
cognitive bases of human motivation, and individual differences in social
information processing.
