The denotational and fixpoint semantics of Prolog and several related extensions
of conventional Logic Programming are under investigation. The work on Prolog is
concerned with the behavior of negation and with the consequences of the non-
fair selection rule in Prolog. The Logic Programming extensions being
investigated center around the idea of broadening the underlying space of truth
values. The specific extensions being investigated are: allowing undefined and
overdefined as well as true and false as truth values; allowing truth values in
a Pseudo-Boolean algebra 'evidence space'; allowing truth values in a
topological space, for the purpose of modelling partial or inconsistent
evidence; and allowing Kripke models incorporating multiple modalities, for the
purpose of modelling distributed logic programming. The use of languages
developed from logic, Prolog in particular, is expanding rapidly. Research in
progress here is significant in that it provides a deeper understanding of the
design and extension of these languages and of the process of programming
correctly and verifiably with these languages.
