The goal of this project is to lay the foundations for algorithmic research on
self-organizing particle systems. Particle systems are physical systems of
simple computational particles that can bond to other particles and that can use
these bonds in order to communicate with neighboring particles and to move from
one spot to another (non-occupied) spot. These particle systems are supposed to
be able to self-organize in order to adapt to a desired shape without any
central control. Self-organizing particle systems have many interesting
applications like coating objects for monitoring and repair purposes and the
formation of nano-scale devices for surgery and molecular-scale electronic
structures. While there has been quite a lot of systems work in this area,
especially in the context of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems, only
very little theoretical work has been done in this area so far. This project
will prepare the ground for rigorous algorithmic research on self-organizing
particle systems by proposing some basic models and solving some basic
algorithmic problems in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of
this one-year project are (i) to develop appropriate models for particle
systems; (ii) to develop self-organizing algorithms for smart paint problems;
and (iii) to better educate the Computer Science (CS) Theory/Algorithms
community on self-organizing particle systems. The proposed NSF sponsored
workshop will foster collaboration of research in this interdisciplinary area.
