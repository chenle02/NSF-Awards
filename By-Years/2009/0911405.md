The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
supports the research project of Prof. Melissa Hines of the Department of
Chemistry at Cornell University. Prof. Hines and her students will build upon
their recent discovery of an anisotropic etchant that produces Si(100)surfaces
with near-atomically flat morphologies and continue to develop new reactions and
processes that enable the chemical control of surface morphology. They will
study chemically etched Si(100) surfaces and the fundamental chemical mechanisms
that control the evolution of Si(100) surface morphology during aqueous silicon
etching using a combination of infrared absorption spectroscopy, scanning
tunneling microscopy, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The study will
provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students
in a cutting edge research field with direct relevance to high end applications
in the semiconductor industry.
