ESI 9553908 Davenport, Linda The Network for Inquiry in Mathematics Education
(NIME) is designed to pilot a case-based, professional-development curriculum
which was created by teachers and staff participating in the Teaching to the Big
Ideas project. Written for elementary teachers, the two modules of the
curriculum, Building a System of Tens and Making Meaning for Operations,
comprise a 48-hour course. The pilot has been designed to address the following
questions: What do teacher- participants learn from the curriculum? When
participants in the course are teacher-leaders, what do they learn to support
their work in that role? What issues are faced by facilitators as they teach
from the curriculum? Our findings will guide curriculum revisions.
