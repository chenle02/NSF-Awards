The Department of Mathematics of The University of Wisconsin - Madison, with
subcontracts to the Departments of Mathematics of Colby College and the
University of California - Davis, will purchase, at an estimated price of
$37,500, equipment to support research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment consists of dedicated CAM-8 workstations, high-performance pseudo-
parallel processors that enable video visualization of a wide variety of lattice
dynamics at a speed of 25 million cell updates per second. Companion hardware
and software will also be purchased as the budget permits. This equipment will
aid Professors D. Griffeath (Wisconsin), R. Fisch (Colby) and J. Gravner (UC-
Davis) in their research on complex random systems. The three investigators rely
heavily on computer experimentation and graphics in their collaborative and
individual research. Primary benefits anticipated from the present request are
as follows.
