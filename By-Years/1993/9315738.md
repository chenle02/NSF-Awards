9315738 Doyle This project is on research to extract modeling and control
strategies from biological control systems. The specific biological system
chosen for this study is the baroreceptor vagal reflex, which is responsible for
the regulation of blood pressure. The mechanisms of this system have both a
practical engineering interest and a medical interest. The more immediate goal
of this research is to develop synthesis tools for engineering systems modeling
and control. The longer term goal is to develop new understanding of biological
control systems to enable advancement of therapeutic techniques for correcting
malfunctioning control mechanisms. ***
