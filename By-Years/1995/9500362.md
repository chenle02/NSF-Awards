CTS-9500362 James Ritter U of South Carolina A completely integrated
Microbalance systems will be purchased for the determination of adsorption and
desorption isotherms, and sorption kinetics. The equipment will be used for
several research projects, such as solvent vapor recovery, and characterization
of various adsorbents including carbon and oxide gel systems. The equipment will
be helpful in the development of new adsorption techniques and adsorbents for
separations. There is possibility of long term impact on environmentally
conscious manufacturing.
