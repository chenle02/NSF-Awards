Observations of binary stars through the Georgia State speckle interferometry
program can produce accurate binary orbits in angular units. Furenlid will make
matching radial-velocity observations to deduce accurate orbits, distances,
luminosities, and masses of the binary stars. The observations are to be made at
the Cananea Observatory, located in Mexico, south of Tucson, with a new and
specially designed spectrograph. Some of the most basic information in
astronomy, about distances and masses of stars, is derived from observations of
binary stars. Furenlid will take spectra and measure accurate radial velocities
of binary stars whose positions relative to each other have already been
observed with high accuracy, using a technique recently implemented by co-
investigator McAlister. The two sets of data together will yield accurate basic
stellar information not obtainable by any other means.
