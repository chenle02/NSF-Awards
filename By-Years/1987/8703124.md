This research aims to extend model robust statistical procedures to handle data
with general covariance structure, for example, time series and spatial data.
The focus of the research on non independent identically distributed random
variables is computationally intensive and offers tools to merge previous
approaches. Methods of crossvalidation and robust maximum likelihood will be
generalized. This research is in the general area of statistical analysis of
dependent observations and will impact procedures for understanding such data
including radiocarbon dating, nuclear accountability tank calibration, and
software development effort prediction.
