1126128&lt;br/&gt;Hubeny&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation grant supports acquisition a laser cavity ring-down spectrometer
(LCRS) and a elemental analyzer front-end combustion device to support
determination of the elemental concentrations of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
sulfur and oxygen and stable carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter in
sediments, soils, tissues and natural waters. The requested isotopic and
elemental analysis instrumentation would support PI and student research aimed
at determining the provenance and pathways of organic matter transformation
between reservoirs. Studies would range from paleoclimate investigations of
lacustine archives to estuarine benthic metabolism dynamics in response to
environmental changes. Salem State University (SSU) is a non-Ph.D. granting
institution which historically has catered to first generation college students.
Acquisition of this equipment represents a major infrastructural enhancement to
the research capabilities of this regional college and will support a number of
regional scientific users beyond campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
