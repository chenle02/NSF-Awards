Drs. Hall, Sellgren, and Becklin will make observations at near- infrared
wavelengths in order to characterize the motions and the brightness of the
population of late type stars located within a 5 parsec radius of the Galactic
Center. This will test the hypothesis of the existence of a massive condensed
object at the Galactic Center, and it will provide unique kinematic data which
can be applied to our understanding of the nuclei of other galaxies. The center
of our Galaxy provides a unique opportunity to study a galactic nucleus at
spatial scales as small as a few hundredths of a parsec and to obtain
observations of individual stars within the region. Detailed studies of the
nucleus of our own Galaxy may prove vitally important in the interpretation of
other, more energetic galactic nuclei. Because of heavy obscuration by dust, the
center of the Galaxy is not observable at visible wavelengths. It can be
studied, however, at infrared and longer wavelengths, and advances in
spectroscopic instrumentation and array detectors now make possible detailed
studies in the near infrared.
