This project deals with theoretical and experimental studies of diffusion and
reaction in heteroeneous media. The effect of homogeneous and heterogeneous
reactions on the diffusive process in two-and three-phase systems is considered,
as well as an exploration of the influence of membrane resistance on the process
of diffusion and reaction. The method of volume-averaging will be used to
develop one-equation and two-equation models of transport in heterogeneous
media. Expressions for effective transport parameters will be derived and the
constraints associated with the derived equations will be obtained. The
experimental program includes an investigation of diffusion in passive and
reactive heterogeneous systems and heat conduction in three-phase systems.
Carbon dioxide transport through thin films of microcapsular suspension is
studied in a diffusion cell to obtain effective permeabilities. Diffusion of
phenol in double emulsions in a batch reactor is investigated to obtain
effective diffusivities and effective chemical reaction rate constants. Finally,
steady state heat conduction in three-phase systems is measured to obtain
effective conductivities.
