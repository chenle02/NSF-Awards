9306594 Schewe-Miller This project is a research planning activity towards the
explorative synthesis of new ternary metal-rich compounds M-M'-X (M,M' =
transition metals and X = O,S,Se,P, or other nonmetals) and their structural,
and physical characterization. The activities will include: 1) a critical review
of literature on the preparation, structure, and properties of ternary
transition metal- rich compounds of nonmetals; 2) high-temperature synthesis
through induction heating, arc melting, and indirect resistance heating in
tungsten containers; 3) TGA and mass pectrometric analysis up to 2000 K; and 4)
room-temperature X-ray analysis and high-temperature powder diffraction studies
(up to 2000 K) with a rotating X-ray source and a position sensitive detector.
In addition, PI will establish contacts with collaborators, acquire training on
the use of experimental methods available at her institution, and prepare a full
research proposal for submission to NSF. ***
