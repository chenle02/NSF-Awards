We intend to study three topics in combinatorics which are related
to&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science. We will study the diameter problem
for&lt;br/&gt;graphs of polytopes aiming at a polynomial upper bound, and also
try to&lt;br/&gt;find versions of the simplex algorithm with sub-exponential
worst case&lt;br/&gt;behavior. We will study Boolean functions, their Fourier
transform and how&lt;br/&gt;it relates to questions in probability and
complexity. We will also try to&lt;br/&gt;find general methods to relate the
solution of a positive integer&lt;br/&gt;programming problem and its linear
programming relaxation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics have now become the
central mathematical discipline in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science (and
various applied areas of computer&lt;br/&gt;science as well). The role of
combinatorics in computer science today is&lt;br/&gt;quite similar to the role
of logic in the early days of computation.&lt;br/&gt;Problems from theoretical
computer science enriched and enforced&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial thinking and
areas which were regarded as having clear &lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit have
gained surprising real-life applications. Linear&lt;br/&gt;programming and the
simplex algorithm are among the most important&lt;br/&gt;applications of
computers and in our earlier work as well as the planned&lt;br/&gt;research. We
intend to study fundamental questions concerning linear&lt;br/&gt;programming.
Another area of our research, the Fourier analysis of
Boolean&lt;br/&gt;functions is a relatively new area which we helped to develop
in the past. &lt;br/&gt;In view of the importance of Fourier analysis in other
areas we should not&lt;br/&gt;have been surprised to see its recent applications
in combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory and we intend to explore
further connections.&lt;br/&gt;
