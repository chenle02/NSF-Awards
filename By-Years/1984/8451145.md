The objective of the project is to develop a two-dimensional mathematical model
for nucleate pool boiling from a single nucleation site. The conservation
equations of mass, momentum, and energy--along with appropriate boundary and
initial conditions--will be formulated for this boiling problem. The resulting
system of simultaneous equations will be solved in dimensionless form on a
computer by using a finite difference method and an accelerated coordinate
system which follows the bubble as it detaches from the nucleation site. The
resulting solutions may then be compared with the large body of experimental
results presently available in the boiling heat transfer literature.
Consequently, assumptions about the fundamental physics of boiling found in
different boiling models can be verified or disproven. The importance of
structures such as the microlayer can be investigated. Parametric studies which
are difficult, if not impossible, to do experimentally may be carried out. A
study on the effects of parameters such as liquid subcooling, surface
superheating, or gravity is possible.
