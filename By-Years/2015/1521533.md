The project funds travel support to enable students to defray the costs of
traveling to and attending ASPLOS-2015. The conference is being held in
Istanbul, Turkey. ASPLOS is the premier forum for multidisciplinary systems
research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and
compilers, operating systems and networking, as well as applications and user
interfaces. The research may target diverse goals such as performance, energy
and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, and sustainability. The importance
of such cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple with the end of
Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power
wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for
sustainability, and increasingly human-centered
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding provided to students will enable
much broader participation by students, especially by those are US citizens and
permanent residents of US and may otherwise not have adequate support at their
educational institution. Underrepresented minorities will be encouraged to
apply. Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference
and a rich set of workshops and tutorials. Student interactions and mentoring
are vital for the growth of the computer systems research community.
