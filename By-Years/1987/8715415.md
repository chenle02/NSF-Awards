Research equipment includes an automatic data acquisition workstation with
sensors and computer with plotter to complete an existing structural testing
system. The Department of Civil Engineering at West Virginia University has
excellent structural testing facilities including a wide range of load frames,
MTS system, 2500 square feet of test floor and many other items. The present MTS
servohydraulic closed-loop system was modernized spending some $52,000. The
items for the present MTS system will improve research capabilities. The
immediate need for the equipment comes from three areas: a) testing of
structural systems; b) testing of soils and materials; and, c) testing of
bioengineered structural components (orthodontic appliances - tooth bridge and
bracing).
