9500623 Venakides The proposal focuses on the study of dispersive wave
generation and propaeation through nonlinear discrete or continuous media. The
phenomena involve the interaction between two different space-time scales. The
small scale consists of strongly nonlinear single or multiple traveling waves
with wave parameters that vary in the large scale. The waves, that eventually
spread over large space regions are generated at points where the dispersive
nature of the system smoothens the shocks produced by the nonlinearity. An
oscillatory microstructure will thus typically arise out of non-oscillatory
initial data. The proposed projects are relevant to physical applications that
involve nonlinearity and dispersion. Such applications, include electron flow in
quantum semiconductor devices and the effect of impurities in the transmission
characteristics in solid state devices. Our study of nonlinear particle chains
is to a great extent motivated by the desire to understand basic properties of
materials through their microscopic structure.
