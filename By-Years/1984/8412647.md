The macroscopic characteristics of a suspension subjected to flow are generally
dependent upon the motions of the individual constituent particles making up the
suspension and their rotations and subsequent orientation. Any fundamental
understanding of the flow behavior of a suspension should, therefore, consider
the dynamics of the system at the microscopic level. Additionally, transient
flows should be studied as well as the steady state flows which have largely
dominated past research efforts. New optical methods which allow the motions of
colloidal-sized particles to be measured during transient flows will be employed
in this research effort.
