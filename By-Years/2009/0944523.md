This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extraction technique using electro-
concentration, electro-separation, and electro-rupture processes to enhance the
harvesting of oil from bioalgae. The proposed method would provide an economical
alternative to expeller or solvent extraction of lipids from bioalgae.
Elimination of the current use of energy intensive methods and often use of
hazardous solvents to extract the lipids for biofuel would result in a more
favorable treatment of biofuels in the market place. The Phase I project also
will develop a preliminary economic analysis of the process technology.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project would be an alternative to
existing technologies and if economically feasible would be energy efficient,
and a nearly carbon-neutral source of biofuel. There is a potential for the
technology to be further developed for bioplastics, dyes, and pharmaceuticals.
