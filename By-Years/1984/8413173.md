A working demonstration of a tunable, long pulse, high frequency (raman), free
electron maser was presented. Existing microwave tubes create coherent power at
excellent efficiencies and are indispensable instruments of present uses of the
microwave frequency band. The free electron laser is under active research
investigation because it offers high efficiency, high power, and tunability even
into the ultraviolet. This project focuses on achieving results in the
millimeter wave band and concentrates on experimental verification of several
possible efficiency enhancement methods using lower frequencies for some
experiments.
