The goal of this project is for the Physics Department to be an active center
for observational astronomy. This is being accomplished through the purchase of
instrumentation specifically designed to be both portable and effective in
providing a first-hand experience with modern techniques in observational
astronomy. This instrumentation consists of three basic components: (1) a
portable 12-inch computer-controlled Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, (2) a
thermally cooled CCD camera to attach to the telescope, and (3) a portable
laptop computer to control the telescope and to display, in real time, digital
images. The project's primary group is non-science-majors taking Introductory
Astronomy and physics majors enrolled in the Advanced Laboratory course, but the
equipment is also available to all non-science-majors. In addition, the college
is attempting to meet the demonstrated need of the Sioux Falls community, and
the surrounding area, for access to telescope viewing.
