Partial support is requested for publication of the proceedings from the
"Symposium on Ice and Climate" scheduled for August 21-25, 1989, at the
University of Washington at Seattle, Washington. The Symposium is being
sponsored by the International Glaciological Society, with co-sponsorship from
the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society. It will
be concerned with natural forms of ice on land and sea with focus on, (1)
information obtained from ice about climate processes and past climates, (2)
physical processes by which ice influences climate change, and (3) practical
means by which ice effects can be incorporated into large-scale climate models.
The goal is to achieve a cross-coupling between snow, ice and climate scientists
and it is expected that the papers presented at the symposium will provide the
most recent information on climate reconstruction from ice data, and the active
role of snow and ice in climate processes. The execution of the Symposium on the
campus of the University of Washington will be funded through registration fees
paid by participants and the International Glaciological Society will publish
proceedings as Volume 14 of the Annals of Glaciology. The cost of the
publication will be covered, in part, by income from subscriptions. This request
is for the remainder of the publication cost.
