9622671 Dzenis This Research Equipment Grant to the Departments of Engineering
Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Nebraska will be used
to purchase equipment needed for the study of failure of novel composite
materials, durability of adhesive joints, high temperature response of shape
memory alloys, post- yield shape recovery in glassy polymers, high temperature
durability of thin films under stress and high temperature applications of metal
matrix composites. The new equipment will replace tan existing MTS 458
controller with a digital MTS TestStar control system and add an environmental
control chamber. This upgrade for the equipment is needed as the existing
equipment cannot support the temperature range for the research described in the
proposal. This equipment will be used on research projects that foster
interactions between departments and for undergraduate laboratory courses. ***
