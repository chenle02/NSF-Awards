In their research study they plan to: (1) continue a vigorous program of borate
glass formation over an extremely wide range of compositions. High cooling rates
using a roller-quencher will be employed to form glasses out to 75 molar percent
metal oxide. Systems to be studied include rubidium and cesium borates, mixed
alkali borates, borosilicates, and alkaline earth borates. (2) make density
measurements on the resulting glasses from step 1. After securing the density
data, quantitative connections with atomic arrangements will be sought as was
done with lithium, sodium, and potassium borates. and (3) begin a study of glass
transition temperatures using a newly acquired Perkin Elmer Differential
Scanning Calorimeter (DSC2). High alkali content borate glasses will be studied
and the results will be quantitatively related to atomic groupings.
