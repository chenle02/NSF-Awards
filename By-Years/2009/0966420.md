OISE 09-66420&lt;br/&gt;Terence Nile &lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina
Greensboro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-UK project
provides 18 US undergraduate students (approximately 50% from under-represented
groups) opportunities for training and research at the University of Bristol.
The principal collaborators are Terence Nile at the University of North Carolina
in Greensboro and Paul Pringle at the University of Bristol in the United
Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students participate in a seven-week training
program prior to their international research experience. This training
addresses theoretical and practical aspects of organometallic chemistry
research, as well training on ethics, library use and laboratory safety. The
students then spend eight weeks in the UK working in the laboratories of several
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fulfills the program objectives
of providing US students with a global perspective and access to unique
facilities and expertise related to synthetic organometallic.
