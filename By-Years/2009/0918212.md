This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incipient species (species that form
during the very early stages of divergence from a common ancestor) are difficult
to diagnose using morphological or behavioral data. The phenotypic similarity of
novel species complicates investigations into the generation of biodiversity
because it can be difficult to identify speciation processes once the novel
species are recognizably distinct. However, novel species can potentially be
identified at very early stages in their divergence using information contained
within DNA sequences and population genetic theory. This project develops new
theories and methods to delimit species at the initial stages of divergence.
Additionally, data analysis software will be produced that will allow
evolutionary geneticists to apply these methods to their research systems, and
its utility will be demonstrated using data from two empirical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since species are the fundamental unit of
biological research, this work will have broad impacts throughout evolutionary
biology, ecology, and conservation biology. It will also result in the
employment and training of two graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher,
and will benefit society by increasing knowledge of North American Biomes and
the processes that generate biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;
