The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of
polypeptides exposed to the hydrophilic (peripheral proteins) or hydrophobic
(integral proteins) region of the plasma membrane of rat testicular and
epididymal spermatozoa. This will be done by reacting intact spermatozoa
recovered from rete testis fluid and different regions of the epididymis with
permeable, semi-permeable, or nonpermeable, radioactive chemical crosslinking
reagents that are photosensitive. Following photolysis the plasma membrane will
be purified by density gradient centrifugation, and the proteins will be
analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In other
studies, nearest neighbor analysis of selected epididymal secreted proteins will
be carried out. By identifying the major polypeptides that comprise the integral
and peripheral proteins of the sperm plasma membrane as a function of epididymal
transit, these studies may provide the groundwork for future investigations to
test the functional significance of proteins that are added to, or removed from
the sperm plasma membrane during development. The function of surface proteins
during fertilization also represents an important direction for further
research. Finally, these results may prove important to our understanding of the
role secreted proteins play in the reproductive process.
