9618886 Fernandez Imperfect capital markets have long been acknowledged to be
an obstacle to human capital accumulation. This project seeks to examine some of
the consequences of different allocation mechanisms and various education
finance systems given these constraints. The first part examines how tournaments
(which can be thought of as examinations) and markets compare as allocation
mechanisms in the presence of borrowing constraints. This is a novel line of
research. While there has been work that examines how credit constraints may
affect capital accumulation, the literature has mainly focused on how efficiency
improvements maybe obtained via interventions that remain within a market system
such as credit subsidies. The choice of an allocative mechanisms, however, is
also an important dimension of policy intervention and work by the investigator
under her previous NSF grant shows that in education markets can be dominated by
other mechanisms. More specifically, the project investigates the efficiency
properties of educational tournaments (examinations) relative to markets and the
dependence of these properties on the initial income distribution and on the
signaling power of the tournament. The political economy of the different
allocation mechanisms are also explored. Endogenizing the supply side of the
problem, establishing the micro-foundations for the credit constraints (and
hence the interest rate), and studying the dynamic evolution of the system are
all important directions in which this will be extended. The project examines
the mechanism design problem to see if there is some combination (perhaps income
taxes and tournaments) that dominates both tournaments and markets. The project
also studies the effects on aggregate spending on public education and its
distribution across districts of different financing systems. Among the
financing systems that will be examined are a foundation system, a power-
equalizing system, a pure local system, and an equal-spending stat e financed
system. Each of these systems gives different incentives to redistribute income
across communities and has different implications for total spending. The model
will be calibrated to some statistics generated by the experience of a state
like California which went from a foundation system to an almost equal spending
state financed system.
