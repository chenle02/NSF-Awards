Pomeranz A method for solving CAD design and test problems, which is especially
suitable for solving large problems because it does not deteriorate as circuit
size is increased, is being explored. The approach is to scale down the problem
while retaining all of its details; find high quality solutions for a sequence
of small circuits; develop rules for solving these problems; and then scale up
these miniature solutions into a solution for the large problem. Since the
miniature solutions are optimal, the full- sized solutions are expected to have
very high quality. Research problems being explored are: 1. test generation for
various fault models on designs given at the gate and higher levels; 2. built-
in-self-test methods; and 3. testing of synchronous sequential circuits that
require two pattern tests.
