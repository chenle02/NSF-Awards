The aim of this research is to develop a frequency domain design theory
applicable to arbitrary linear feedback systems. The approach is based on three
tools developed over the past half-dozen years: the Youla parameterization, the
Arveson frequency response, and the extended Hermann-Martin model; and will
include investigations of the simultaneous stabilization problem, the minimal
degree compensator problem, the pole placement problem, and the initial value
problem in single variate, multivariate, and general linear systems settings.
