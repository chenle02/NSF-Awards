An award is made to San Jos√© State University (SJSU) to acquire a new HPLC-Mass
Spectrometer instrument with improved metabolomics, proteomics and high-
resolution small molecule capabilities for the SJSU core PROTEIN lab facility.
San Jose State University is a federally recognized minority-serving
institution. This instrument will benefit both current and future faculty across
multiple disciplines by expanding the research capabilities at SJSU. The broader
impacts of this proposal are to stimulate new research activities and strengthen
collaboration among research faculty as well as continuing to train
undergraduate and masters students and expose them to a state-of-the-art
instrumentation in both classroom and research settings. Workshops will be
developed to increase the number of faculty that will use the instrument in
their research. A course in Chemical Biology will be revamped with a focus on
the new instrument to provide valuable research and learning opportunities to
students who are underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the supported research will (1) characterize how compounds
found in fruits in vegetables play roles in cellular metabolism, (2) identify
the molecular mechanisms in mammary gland development, (3) characterize bacteria
that are able to metabolize and use rare earth elements for growth, (4)
characterize the mechanism of action of combination therapies on inhibiting P.
aeruginosa biofilm development, (5) understand how cellular pH plays a role in
cellular processes including cell death, differentiation, and tumorigenesis, and
(6) characterize small molecule development using a novel p450 biocatalysis
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
