The objective of this research is to provide more accurate and robust simulation
of sheet metal forming processes in order to reduce the costs, masses, lead
times, and defects of transportation vehicles. The approach is a cooperative
use-directed basic research project between the Ohio State University and
General Motors R&amp;D Center, with supporting partners Altair Engineering and
The Ohio Supercomputer Center. Novel and practical finite-element analysis
procedures will be developed following basic numerical advances made in the
early stages of the project. In particular, advances in implicit numerical
technology will be sought to confer the usual advantages of accuracy and
consistency, while improving robustness and
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Societal benefits of the project include
improved fuel economy of vehicles, reduced impact on the environment, and safer
and more affordable transportation for consumers. The highly cooperative and
leveraged plan includes 12 months of student internships at GM and Altair aimed
at broadening the training of graduate-level engineers to include experience in
industry. The supported graduate students will profit from the opportunity, via
daily cooperation with partners and internships at partner sites, to work within
and learn the cultures of large companies (GM) and smaller software developers
(Altair). Co-PI Wagoner will utilize the numerical advances realized in the
project to construct reliable instruction modules for student-generated
simulation of sheet forming programs.&lt;br/&gt;
