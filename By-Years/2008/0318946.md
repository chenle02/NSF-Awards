This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will fabricate low
dielectric constant materials by using stepwise coupling polymerization process.
Low dielectric constant materials play a key role in the future semiconductor
manufacture of low-k dielectric materials as inter-metal dielectrics (IMDs).
IMDs will increase chip speed by reducing RC time delays. Currently, organic
polymers (e.g. polyamides) and silica have been investigated and the feasibility
to be used as IMDs has been demonstrated. The approach will to make nano-porous
silicon dioxide by preparing reactive ladder-like polysilsesquioxane (LPS) and
introducing nanometer size pores before converting it into silicon dioxide with
low thermal expansion, low density, high thermal stability and good mechanical
property. The objective will be to make an ultra low dielectric material with a
constant k, 1.8~2.0.

The broader impacts of this work will be to the semiconductor industry's
roadmap. There is a need to develop materials with dielectric constants lower
than that of silicon dioxide for inter-metal applications: lower dielectric
constants mean lower capacitance and therefore shorter RCA delays, faster device
speeds, less cross-talk and less power dissipation.
