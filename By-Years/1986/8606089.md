The March 3, 1985 Chile earthquake presents a special opportunity to study the
adequacy of current design methods for buildings in seismic zones. Many
buildings of modern construciton that were affected by the shock were designed
for lateral forces comparable to those used on the West Coast of the United
States. Six buildings (three heavily damaged and three undamaged or lightly
damaged) are studied for analytical methods for design, evaluation, and
structural details. Experimental study is conducted to establish the
effectiveness of three-dimensional framing systems in the buildings. This
project is prepared as part of a cooperatve research program to study effects of
the Chilean earthquake on building structures.
