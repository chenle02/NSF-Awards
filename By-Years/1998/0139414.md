This project addresses the electrodynamics of complex solids using complimentary
spectroscopic approaches to model organic conductors including low temperature,
high magnetic field synchrotron based spectroscopy. Compounds of interest
include prototypical superconducting, composites, and molecular ladder
materials. Issues being addressed include chemical structure / physical property
relationships, disorder, charge transfer characteristics in ladder compounds,
and the microscopic characteristics of the high-field phase of low-dimensional
superconductors. These projects will advance the training of high school,
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in areas of materials
spectroscopy.

The fundamental understanding and development of new materials, and the
development of advanced spectroscopic tools to probe new phenomena exhibited by
superconducting and conducting organic solids, is a crucial area for emphasis in
the training of materials scientists and engineers. Students with expertise in
these materials science and engineering areas compete well in both the academic
and industrial job markets.
