The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate two gibberellin
biosynthesis mutants of Pisum sativum. The le and na mutant alleles block the
biosynthesis of gibberellins, each at a specific site in the gibberellin
pathway. It is proposed to quantify gibberellin levels in constituent organs of
the isogenic lines througout development, using capillary gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry. By monitoring gibberellin levels it will be possible to
determine the tissue-specificity and ontogenetic specificity of these genes. The
significance of this research is the potential to determine how the levels of
the endogenous gibberellin A1, which is active in regulating internode
extension, causes a dwarf pea phenotype. The findings generated by this work
will lay the foundation for more molecular studies in the future and they may
lead to the discovery of commercially useful peas, i.e., dwarf pea with normal
pod size.
