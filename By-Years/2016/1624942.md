It is well known that nuclei are made from protons and neutrons. One of the open
questions in nuclear science, as identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory
Committee, is: what is the origin of the elements? To produce nuclei having more
than a few neutrons and protons requires a sequence of nuclear reactions that
take place in stars. To produce nuclei heavier than iron requires a highly
energetic environment, such as a supernova explosion or a neutron star merger.
The equipment to be built here, the Separated Capture Reaction (SECAR)
spectrometer, will enable physicists at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (NSCL) to measure rare nuclear reactions that are necessary to
understand the origin of the elements. Phase 2 of the SECAR spectrometer,
planned here, will become a world-leading facility for this purpose.

SECAR Phase 2 opens a wide range of science opportunities. It enables
measurements of the entire range of important reactions in X-ray bursts, the
most common thermonuclear explosions observed in our Galaxy. X-ray bursts occur
on the surface of mass-accreting neutron stars. With the SECAR Phase 2 data,
burst observations can be used to probe the properties of neutron stars and
X-ray binary systems. In addition, predictions can be made of the elements
created that form the crust of the neutron star and may also, in part, be
ejected into space. SECAR Phase 2 will also enable predictions of the element
signatures of astrophysical Nova explosions, especially unusually energetic
events that may be observed with new telescopes in the near future. This will
help to identify the signatures of these events in observational data, and in
the composition of meteoritic grains found on earth. SECAR Phase 2 data will
also help understand the production of radioactive elements in supernovae, the
signatures of the most massive stars ever that existed in the early universe,
the contribution of supernova neutrino winds to the origin of the elements, and
help prove, or disprove, the existence of Thorne-Zytkov objects, hypothetical
stellar objects that contain a neutron star as their core.
