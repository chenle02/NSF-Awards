9528463 Hartman The goal of this research is to explore methodologies for
creating an Internet-based virtual manufacturing enterprise that would link the
U. S. and Russia. The primary research effort focuses on investigating the means
to develop a preliminary architecture, physical network, hardware, software and
interface for the system, and to build a prototype. Several pilot projects in
virtual manufacturing will build on existing U. S.- Russian manufacturing
research collaborations to implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of the
technical capabilities of the network. The work explores novel concepts in
virtual manufacturing by linking two very different manufacturing systems in a
proof-of-concept testbed. If successful, the results could be used as a model
for the development of a more general virtual enterprise network that could be
used jointly by manufacturers widely separated by distance, language and
culture.
