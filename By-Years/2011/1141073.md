The National Academy of Engineering recently outlined twelve Grand Challenges
for Engineering (e.g., Reverse Engineering the Brain) that collectively
constitute the largest and most pressing real-world issues facing engineering
research and practice. Solutions to these problems require engineers to have a
broad skill set that includes communication abilities, team-based interactions,
ethical reasoning, and contextual analysis as well as technical expertise.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates a multiple-stage Grand Challenges
framework that guides students progressively from consideration of the
overarching societal and technical context of a problem, through the discipline-
focused exploration of a related application, and ultimately back to the broad
problem context to analyze both the contributions and limitations of an
engineering approach. Instructional modules will be created that replace
traditional abstract modes of topical presentation with a stepwise progression
from problem context through potential solutions. By emphasizing the real-world
constraints and opportunities presented by a specific problem, the framework
forces students to place traditional concepts into a more realistic context,
which has been shown by recent educational research to improve educational
outcomes. Furthermore, students conclude each module with explicit reflection on
the limitations of their planned solution, so that they see the connection of
the engineering principles to the relevant societal
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grand Challenges framework is being
incorporated into courses from several engineering disciplines and engages
students at different points in their undergraduate education. The framework is
being evaluated in terms of its impact on student motivation and learning
through psychologically rigorous measures and on its transferability to other
courses.
