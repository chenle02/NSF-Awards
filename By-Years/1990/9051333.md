The Biology and Sports Medicine deaprtments are purchasing a Prospector
Physiologic Analyzer in order to upgrade the respiratory and cardiac physiology
laboratories in Exercise Physiology, Animal Physiology, and Human Anatomy and
Physiology. Laboratories in which oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production will be measured have been designed. Students in Exercise Physiology
measure their metabolic responses to different levels of exercise, including
maximum aerobic capacity, respiratory quotient, and onset of blood lactate
accumulation. In the physiology course students can measure breath gas exchange
and end tidal pO2 and pCO2. This equipment will also be available for senior
research projects. This equipment gives students a greater level of
sophistication, the opportunity to conduct physiological research projects, and
to utilize computer interfacing and data analysis. The college will contribute
an amount equal to the award.
