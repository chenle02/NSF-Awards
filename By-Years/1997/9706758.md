ABSTRACT Speh/Barbasch In joint work the PI's will study the residual spectrum
of the split classical groups. Barbasch will continue his research on unipotent
representations for both real and p-adic groups, in particular their character
theory and unitarity. Speh will continue her work with J.Rohlfs on the
stabilisation of geometric invariants of locally symmetric spaces. The theory of
Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been
one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
