The primary objective of this proposal is to continue excavations in Tugen
Hills, west of Lake Baringo, Kenya. This region contains an excellent series of
fossiliferous geological strata dating to the period of 16 to approximately 1.5
million years ago; a time of major significance in the evolution of the higher
primates and bracketing the time of appearance of the first hominids or human
ancestors. The project has already discovered new primate specimens as well as
remains of other mammalian fossils. In total, these specimens are elucidating
not only the anatomical details of the development of various higher primates,
but also setting them within an environmental context, thus clarifying the
conditions which molded the species' evolution. Further fossiliferous sites will
be identified while currently known sites will continue to be excavated.
