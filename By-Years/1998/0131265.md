Professor Kathy Rowlen of the University of Colorado-Boulder is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to use confocal microscopy and
nonlinear spectroscopy to study thin organic films. The goal is to learn how
thin films deposit on surfaces. Three experiments are being performed: the
optical properties of films from sub-monolayer to multilayer will be measured,
the spatial resolution of second harmonic generation and other optical methods
will be increased, and "dip-pen-nanolithography" is used for producing well
defined nanopatterns of optically interesting dyes. Optical microscopy is
required rather than average measurements because inhomogeneities on the
nanoscale can govern orientations and domain growth of thin films.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such studies are required to understand the deposition of
oligonucleotides and proteins which are used for microarrays and lab-on-a-chip
formats. Fundamental research on film deposition serves as an example of how
basic research in chemistry can enable advances in human health. The students
will learn both measurement considerations and surface science.
