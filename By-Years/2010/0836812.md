Geology (42) This project introduces Mesa Community College and other Maricopa
County Community College District students enrolled in geology, physical
geography, and archaeology courses to basic field research on rock art. Rock
art, prehistoric rock engravings (petroglyphs) and rock paintings (pictographs)
common in the American West, is being degraded as a result of anthropogenic
activities and natural processes. The curriculum modules being developed take
advantage of the students' interest in their cultural heritage and use the Rock
Art Stability Index (RASI) to help them link their knowledge of rock types and
weathering characteristics to the preservation of the rock art. As the students
learn about weathering processes, they are generating data that contribute to
the preservation of the rock art. These data are being shared with cultural
resource managers and may lead to new and improved rock art preservation
techniques. The evaluation of the modules is contributing to advancing the
understanding of how "place-based" and meaningful research attracts and retains
underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. K-12 teachers are becoming
familiar with the modules through workshops offered by the Arizona Geographic
Alliance.
