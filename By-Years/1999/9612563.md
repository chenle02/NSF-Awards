Boston College The starter grant award to Boston College supports the research
of Professor Scott J. Miller. The research focuses on the design and synthesis
of systems for the de novo asymmetric synthesis of amino acid derivatives based
on the principle of deracemization. Using the methodology of asymmetric organic
synthesis, rapidly epimerizing alpha-lactams are subjected to reactions with
optically pure reagents. Differential rates of reaction of each alpha-lactam
enantiomer with the chiral reagent result in the dynamic resolution of racemic
mixtures to allow for complete conversion to optically pure products. This
research will provide a new reaction methodology for synthesis of an important
class of natural and unnatural products; namely, optically active amino acids
and peptides. The work advances not only the field of asymmetric synthesis, but
also artificial enzyme design and medicinal chemistry through improved acess to
important molecular building blocks.
