This award will mainly support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
junior researchers based at US institutions to participate in the XI Americas
Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis that will take place
at the University of Alberta, Canada, August 12 to 19, 2017. This conference is
part of the Americas Conference Series that started in 1994 in Taxco, Mexico and
have had meetings on a regular basis. The Americas Conference Series has served
as a means to promote the progress of science and the collaboration among
researchers from North America and Latin America, and to train graduate
students. Through several years of concerted efforts from researchers of all
Americas countries, this conference series has been extremely successful in
achieving its goals. Many researchers who started their participation in the
series as junior researchers have benefited greatly and have become experts in
their fields; now they are making major contributions and play active roles in
the research and training activities of the conference series. The Conference
Series has always been distinguished by diversity of participants. Forty percent
of plenary lecturers are women mathematicians from the Americas. The conference
will have a strong participation of junior and senior mathematicians from
minority groups, with a large percentage of Hispanics and African American
individuals, and will provide a great opportunity for new scientific
collaborations. The XI Americas Conference on Differential Equations is devoted
to the subject of nonlinear applied differential equations and dynamical
systems. The topics will include analytical and computational issues and cover
some of the most important applications of differential equations as well as
some of the latest mathematical analysis techniques for their study. The
activities will include a first part with 6 mini-courses on recent developments
of Hamiltonian PDE and water waves, invariant manifolds, synchronizations and
applications, high dimensional data, dynamics of spatial structures, and
persistent homology, modeling spread patterns of animal diseases that are
communicable to human beings. The second part includes 20 plenary talks on
recent advances in a broad spectrum of current research topics; there will be 8
theme sessions organized by leading experts in respective research areas.
Contributed talks and poster sessions have also been designed to provide
additional unique opportunity for more junior researchers to present their work.
