The first objective of this research is to improve radio astronomy images of
extended sources by Kalman filtering the atmospherically induced phase
fluctuations in the spatial frequency domain. Models for the atmospheric-phase
noise for each antenna pair are obtained with times series analysis. A model for
the radio source is obtained from the CLEAN components by transforming them to
the spatial frequency domain, putting them in the same time-baseline order as
the data, and modeling these series. Both models are placed in the Kalman filter
and then the data are subsequently filtered. The Kalman filter will discriminate
between the wanted and unwanted signals, thereby producing a less corrupted data
set which is ready for mapping. The second objective is to reduce the noise in
the images by segmenting the image into statistically stationary segments,
modeling the signal and the noise in the segments, and Kalman filtering each
segment. New work in this area will be the incorporation of improved
information; the signal and noise processes in the filter modes. One example is
the inclusion of colored noise. This will reduce the background noise and will
reduce the noise in the weak-signal portion of the astronomical object.
