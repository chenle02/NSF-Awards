The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable
widespread adoption of electric vehicle (EV) technologies. The project is line
with the requirements for breakthrough battery technologies articulated by the
US Department of Energy "EV Everywhere Grand Challenge" as well as the specific
goals in the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium's "EV 2020", 25% lower cost, 2x
higher performance. Although Li-ion technology is currently used in relatively
low volume production plug-in hybrid and niche high performance vehicles, the
technological goals required to enable truly mass adoption of EV are likely
beyond the capabilities of Li-ion. Several advanced battery technologies have
been under development but there has been no successful example of
commercialization directly into the large mobility space. As such,
identification of a viable stepping stone market strategy is paramount for
commercialization of a new battery technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project will explore the commercialization potential for a Ceramic Solid-state
Battery. This project furthers develops a scalable, low-cost, bulk-scale solid-
state batteries using superionic conducting oxides. The work builds from
research on a superionic conducting oxide membrane technology exhibiting unique
breakthrough materials properties. Current progress demonstrates that bulk-scale
ceramics processing of these materials is feasible. The solid-state construction
and materials chemistry allows for compatibility with Li metal resulting in 2x
energy density compared to Li-ion. A manufacturing scheme is being developed
which utilizes conventional manufacturing tools and eliminates the need for dry
room processing with a path forward to cost structures lower than competing Li-
ion technologies. While these features can broadly add value in several
industrial sectors, successful commercialization of a battery technology
requires accurate identification of a viable beachhead market so a go-to market
strategy can be developed.
