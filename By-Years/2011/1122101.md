Roundworm infections cause several debilitating diseases in both animals and
agricultural plants, yet relatively little is known about the factors that
regulate either the population dynamics and/or infectivity of most parasitic or
free-living nematode species. This proposal aims to uncover the mechanisms by
which a specific set of closely related roundworm species regulate the ratio of
males, females, and/or infective/dispersive larval forms amongst their
offspring. A combination of cellular, chemical and genetic approaches will be
used. Broader impacts of the proposal studies include establishing research and
student training links between a primarily undergraduate institution (William
&amp; Mary) and an institution with a large proportion of minority students (UT-
Arlington). In addition, these studies may ultimately lead to new avenues for
controlling roundworm infections.
