9418203 Wintsch Terrane assembly and metamorphism are common events in most
orogenic belts, and the well studied New England orogen is no exception.
However, there is a fundamental difference in the tectono-metamorphic histories
of western and eastern New England. In the west, terranes were assembled prior
to, or during loading and metamorphism as metamorphic isograds are not displaced
by terrane boundaries. In southeastern New England, on the other hand, the
terranes were metamorphosed prior to assembly and evidence is mounting that find
assembly occurred in the Alleghanian. The broarder significance of the
difference is not clear, partly because of a large data gap in eastern New
England. This project involves thermochronlogic study of eastern lithotectonic
terranes in this data gap to determine if significant post-Metamorphic faulting
occurred during the assembly of terranes in all of eastern New England, and what
factors are responsible for the resulting pattern. Results will help unravel the
timing of metamorphism and terrane juxtaposition for New England, which should
be of interest in other, less well known, orogens.
