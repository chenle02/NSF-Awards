9412343 Fourer This objective of this research is to establish a dedicated
computing facility for investigating a variety of large scale optimization
problems using parallel processor environment. The classes of problems under
consideration are combinatorial in nature. The equipment obtained as part of the
research will be used by multiple researchers to develop optimization algorithms
that can be implemented in a parallel processor network to reduce the taken
required to solve large scale optimization problems. The class of problems to
which the multi-processor platform will be used under this study include (1)
alternative to direct solution of the normal equations in interior-point methods
for linear programming, (2) difficult discrete optimization problems using
cutting plan methods, and (3) vehicle routing problems. The facility will enable
the development of new optimization algorithms and exploitation opportunities
for multi-processor optimization environment. The feasible demonstration of
parallel processor for solving large scale optimization problems can lead to
technology that offers tremendous opportunity in reducing both computational and
storage facility requirements. The technology can also be readily transferred to
other users and industry.
