This grant is funded from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
under the Computational Science and Engineering Initiative. Its purpose is to
study simple chemical reactions in full quantum-mechanical detail to gain
understanding of the complex changes that take place when an atom reacts with a
two-atom molecule. The general area of this research has been singled out by the
National Research Council in its recent report, "Opportunities in Chemistry," as
one of the most important unsolved problems in chemistry. The recently developed
Adiabatically adjusting Principal axis Hyperspherical (APH) coordinate formalism
will be used to study three-body rearrangement processes. Exact three-
dimensional reactive scattering cross sections will be calculated for the
systems D + H2 = HD + H and e+ + H = Ps + p+, using accurate potential energy
surfaces. The results will be used to interpret existing and future experimental
data obtained at other research laboratories. Also, exact S-matrices will be
determined at several values of the total angular momentum for the systems F +
H2 = HF + H and LiH + F = Li + HF. The work involves close collaboration between
Professor Parker's research group at Oklahoma and that of Dr. Russell Pack at
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
