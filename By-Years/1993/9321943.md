9321943 Jones The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Program offers talented undergraduate students, interested
in a career in the physical sciences, the opportunity to work with a scientist
for ten weeks during the summer at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Approximately one dozen students are recruited
nationally with emphasis on encouraging women, minority students and students
from colleges where research opportunities are limited, to apply. Student
research projects will be designed by CfA scientists in nearly every branch of
astro-physics. Program activities also include field trips to nearby
observatories, informal get-togethers to discuss projects, social events, lunch
time seminars on general astronomical topics and a symposium at the end of the
summer where students will give a short talk about their research project.
