The goal of this project is to develop a feasible plan to further develop a
privacy-preserving technology for cloud computing. Researchers are developing
techniques for the virtualization software to protect users' privacy in cloud
computing environments. The research team plans to develop a demo version based
on their technology and investigate its potential application for end-
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully implemented, this research could
have impacts in research and education by enhancing the understanding of
structural design to support user-controlled privacy protection in cloud
computing. The proposed technology could make the deployment and configuration
of cloud computing simpler.
