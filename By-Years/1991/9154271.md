This national pilot program builds on an earlier project, and provides an
additional three workshops for experienced community college physics teachers.
These workshops are scheduled during 1992 at three geographically-dispersed
community college campuses. Two workshops cover the use of microcomputer-based
laboratories (MBL). The other workshop deals with conceptual exercises (CE) and
overview case studies (OCS) which apply the findings of cognitive physics
research.Each three-day workshop is led by two university/college physics
professors who play a major role in these areas. These hands-on workshops
facilitate the incorporation of this new knowledge at community colleges. The
impact of the workshops is reinforced by the establishment of a networking
system employing a telecommunications bulletin board system and a newsletter.
The ultimate purpose of this project is to help community college students
develop a stronger understanding of classical and contemporary physics. The task
of updating physics programs at community colleges is difficult but essential
for the nation and for science because of the large number of students,
particularly women and minorities, attending community colleges.
