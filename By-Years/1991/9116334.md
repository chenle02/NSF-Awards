This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science research
project between Dr. Hal Caswell, Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, and Dr. Nanako Shigesada, Department of Biophysics, Kyoto
University. The investigators will collaborate on the development of
mathematical population models. The models are intended to simulate population
processes more realistically than current models through the incorporation of
the effects of spatial structuring in local populations. Dr. Caswell specializes
in discrete models, while Dr. Shigesada specializes in continuous models. The
objective of the research is to investigate the relationships among different
classes of spatio-temporal models, particularly contrasting and comparing
discrete and continuous approaches. By clarifying the conditions under which
different kinds of models are appropriate, the work will be of widespread
applicability to ecologists interested in population modelling.
