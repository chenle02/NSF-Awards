Topology of manifolds is a subject aimed at classification of shapes (manifolds)
which are locally modeled on the Euclidean space of a given dimension. The
topology of 4-dimensional manifolds is of particular interest since this
dimension is relevant in physics while studying space-time, and it is the
subject of some of the outstanding open problems in Topology. This dimension is
also special in the sense that it is borderline between "low dimensions" where
many classification results have been settled and "higher dimensions" where
geometric classification problems are known to admit an algebraic reformulation.
This project is aimed at classification up to continuous deformations of
4-manifolds with special characteristics, known as large fundamental groups.

The main part of this project concerns geometric classification of topological
4-manifolds, specifically the topological surgery conjecture and the s-cobordism
conjecture for "large" fundamental groups. The notion of a 1/2-null surgery
problem is proposed, as an intermediate step in the context of universal surgery
problems. A key ingredient is the group-theoretic Engel relation, which is
closely related to higher-order singularities of surfaces in 4-manifolds. The
framework of the AB-slice problem is also considered. Another part of the
project concerns ongoing work on applications of (2+1)-dimensional topological
quantum field theories to combinatorics and to representations of mapping class
groups. The PI also plans to consider questions in geometric and topological
complexity of embeddings in dimension 4.
