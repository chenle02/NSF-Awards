The Diversity Programs in Engineering (DPE) office at Cornell University has
developed a vision of diversity appreciation reflective of the College of
Engineering's strategic plan, which enables members from all backgrounds and
cultures to thrive and succeed at Cornell. DPE provides an institution-wide
integrative approach for providing innovative opportunities that enhance
interaction and learning across groups. The DPE model is relatively unusual in
that it vertically integrates all diversity-oriented activities, from high
school outreach to faculty recruiting and mentoring under a single
organizational structure. Measures of the success stemming from this model
include a 59% increase in the enrollment of underrepresented minority (URM)
undergraduate students between 2006 and 2010, a 25% increase in the number of
women in the undergraduate enrolling class, completion rates for both groups
well above national averages, and a Ph.D. retention and completion rate of 88%
for URM students in the Sloan and Colman graduate programs. DPE has received
national recognition from the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of
Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the National Society of Black Engineers.
