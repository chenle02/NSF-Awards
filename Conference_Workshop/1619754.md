This award supports a week long workshop, titled "L3 Graduate Student Workshop
in Symplectic/Contact Geometry," held at New Orleans, Louisiana, on January
19-23, 2016. Symplectic Geometry is a field that connects several research areas
such as mathematical physics, geometric topology, algebraic geometry, mirror
symmetry and string theory. The goal of this workshop is to introduce
participants to contemporary research and discuss future directions. Graduate
students will give the majority of the talks. The workshop may serve as a pilot
for a future annual event for students of symplectic topology and geometry.

The focus of the workshop is exploring connections between Weinstein manifolds
and contact geometry, with Lefschetz fibrations and algebraic geometry.
Weinstein manifolds are central objects of study in symplectic geometry and
mirror symmetry. They are often given the structure of Lefschetz fibrations,
which describes their geometry in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds of a
Weinstein manifold of one dimension less. Alternatively, one can describe the
geometry in terms of Legendrian submanifolds in a contact manifold. As contact
geometry is generally more flexible, this allows us to make a number of
additional geometric cancellations and makes the combinatorics of the
computations easier. The workshop will begin with a discussion of the essential
objects and tools in the theory, and end with current research and new
directions. The workshop webpage is at
