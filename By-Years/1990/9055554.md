NACME proposes to develop a 20 minute videotape, with a teacher's guide and
student brochure, that will use career opportunities in engineering as a vehicle
to encourage math and science course-taking among minority high school students.
By introducing engineering careers as dynamic, exciting professions that offer
excellent prospects for minority graduates, NACME hopes to motivate students to
take academic track science and math courses beginning at the 8th/9th grade
crossroads and continuing through high school graduation. The video, geared
specifically to a primary audience of 11 to 14 year-old minority students (5th
through 8th graders) and a secondary audience of non-minority students, parents,
teachers and guidance counselors, will focus on the lives of successful young
engineers, male and female, from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
