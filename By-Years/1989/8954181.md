This project is designed to interest young minority women in future careers in
science by providing them with an enrichment of skills, incentives, and role
models upon which to base their career choices. Twenty-four female high school
students in grades 9 or 10 and 6 high school science teachers will be selected
to participate in a 10 day summer training program to prepare them to work on
software teams composed of 4 students and one teacher advisor. The teams will
produce high quality science education software during the school year following
the summer session. The 6 team will be chosen from the Washington, DC area. The
significance of this model lies in its ability to provide a group of young
minority women and their teachers the opportunity to use leading edge technology
in the context of programmer teams using sound software engineering principles
and to produce high quality science education software that will be evaluated by
commercial software developers for possible commercial production and
distribution. In addition, young minority women will be able to reflect upon
their thinking and learning styles in the context of developing science
education software for other learners while teachers will increase their range
of professional experiences to include research data collection and reporting
for a scholarly journal article.
