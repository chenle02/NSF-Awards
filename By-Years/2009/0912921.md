This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the
technical feasibility of developing a robust, high-speed inorganic electron-beam
resist platform that will enable the manufacture of electronic devices with
feature sizes < 30 nm. The requirements of high speed, low line-width roughness,
sufficient etch resistance are extreme for patterning devices at these feature
sizes.

Success in the project will have a considerable impact on continued progress
along the ITRS semiconductor roadmap, which supports several multibillion dollar
industries. New levels of device performance will be enabled, providing broad
societal impacts through the introduction of advanced electronics, while
enhancing prospects for domestic employment in semiconductor manufacturing. The
broader scientific and engineering research communities will benefit from new
techniques to build novel devices at the extreme end of the nanoscale.
