ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal from the Global Carbon Project
(GCP), a joint activity of IGBP, WCRP, and IHDP. The proposal is for partial
support of an international meeting to synthesize recent progress in
understanding of the global carbon cycle and the relevance of that understanding
to progress toward stabilization of atmospheric CO2. The workshop, scheduled for
February 3-7, 2003, in Ubatuba, Brazil, will lead to a rapidly published book,
based on the model of the Dahlem Conferences. The book will appear by November
1, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;
