EAR-9505235 Kedar, Sharon Proposed broadband modeling of volcanic seismic
sources will be used to evaluate the fluid volume changes and mass transport
that take place during volcanic activity, as well as to resolve the source
geometry of the seismic activity. The broadband seismic data will be collected
on Kilauea, Hawaii, and Stromboli, southern Italy, over the next two years. To
date, seismologists have not exploited the new broadband date for the study of
volcanic processes. Although it is a difficult problem, the results could be
very useful for responding to volcanic hazards. The simple harmonic behavior of
volcanic ground motion (Oharmonic tremorsO) renders their interpretation from
band-limited data ambiguous, as any source that tends to resonate may be
responsible. The complex stratigraphy and materials with widely ranging seismic
velocities adds complex path effects to the problem. The broadband signature of
volcanic events has already highlighted source processes that could not be
deduced in the past; broadband seismograms promise to revolutionize the study of
volcanic tremors in the same way that they have impacted earthquake studies in
recent years.
