This proposal seeks funds for the continued operation of the Marine Geology
Repository (MGR) at Oregon State University. The repository distributed more
than 27,000 samples over the past three years, over 70% went to non-OSU
investigators. Institutional support includes support for the senior curators-
in-charge and recent upgrades to the cyber-infrastructure and to refrigerated
storage. The collection was recently expanded with the accessioning of 10,000
samples from the Geosciences Department. Proposed new work includes
implementation of a state-of-the art bar coding system. In addition to service
to the scientific community, the MGR also participates in K-12 and informal
science education projects.
