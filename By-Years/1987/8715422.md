The objective of this project is to develop a research proposal on "The
Synthesis and Accumulation of Chloroplast Proteins During Temperature-Induced
Bleaching in Euglena gracilis." The planning phase of the research will involve
documentation of changes in the kinds of chloroplast proteins that are being
synthesized during heat-bleaching as the transformation of the chloroplast
unfolds. Support of this project will allow a well-trained and promising
biologist to complete the planning and development of a regular proposal. The
planning activities, if successful, will significantly enhance the potential of
the investigator to compete for regular research support.
