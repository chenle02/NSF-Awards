An experimental program will be initiated to study highly excited states of
simple molecules and their subsequent photofragmentation. The new techniques of
resonantly enhanced multiphoton excitation will be developed further for
particular experiments. This represents the first independent support of a
promising young scientist under the NSF Research Opportunities for Women
initiative.
