This project aims to meet the increasing demand for technicians trained in the
use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. The major equipment
purchased includes computer hardware and software to support five GIS
workstations. These make possible the storing, integration and analysis of
information about land aspects including ownership, what is on it, and natural
resources. Associate degree programs in GIS, Civil Engineering Technology and
Surveying are affected by this project. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution. //
