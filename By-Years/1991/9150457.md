A prototype instructional system based on a hypermedia workstation will be
developed for introductory cartography courses. The goal of the project is to
allow students to use an interactive system which will provide a knowledge-based
guided environment in which cartographic theory and knowledge can be stored and
used during the map design process. The system will use a high resolution color
display and will be linked to a set of examples (stored on videodisc) drawn from
the cartographic literature and from the existing body of published maps. These
examples will be used to illustrate options that are available to student
cartographers. Hypermedia technology will be used to structure the system and to
provide the framework in which design options can be explored. The prototype
system will focus on three problem areas: choropleth maps, graduated symbol maps
and map layout. This system will enable students to systematically explore
interactions among elements within these problem areas in a way that does not
require them to invest long hours in manually crafting examples. In addition,
the hypermedia environment allows the system designer to select examples that
are particularly well-suited to the educational objective of the system.
