The Exploratorium, a hands-on science museum, is developing Exploratorium
Online, a digital library collection for lifelong learning. The project is 1)
identifying, selecting, and cataloging existing digitized assets from the
museum's 650 interactive exhibits for end users of all ages; 2) establishing
digital library interoperability mechanisms to enable the widest dissemination
of item-level metadata to NSDL portals including the central main portal; 3)
creating recommended guidelines for cataloging digital exhibit-based science
resources in established metadata element set standards (e.g., Dublin Core, IEEE
LOM)&lt;br/&gt;that capture the unique museum quality and pedagogical value of
Exploratorium digital assets; and, 4) evaluating and refining the usability,
accessibility, and applicability of the digital library and digital exhibit-
based resources for educators, teacher educators, and lifelong learners. The
Informal Science Education program in the NSF Division of Elementary, Secondary,
and Informal Education is providing significant co-funding of this project in
recognition of its importance in enhancing access to informal science
educational opportunities through digital libraries.&lt;br/&gt;
