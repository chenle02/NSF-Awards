In the eastern portion of the Western Gneiss region of the central Norwegian
Caledonides a sequence of cover and structurally higher units have been
intricately infolded with basement gneisses. The regional interference patterns
have previously been explained as the combined result of gneiss dome and basin
formation, recumbent folding and late cross-folding. Recent mapping however
shows that the patterns can be reinterpreted as a refolded sequence of three
highly noncylindrical recumbent nappes with a sheath-like form. This project
will test the possibility that very large sheath folds, on the order of 30
kilometers in wavelength, occur in this orogen. Results are applicable to other
deep-seated orogens where large crystalline thrust sheets have moved long
distances.
