CBET - 0828469 &lt;br/&gt;White, Edward B. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid droplets
on solid surfaces can remain fixed to the surface, run down the surface due to
gravity or run along the surface due to external air flow. Models exist for
droplet stability to gravity forcing as do some low-Reynolds-number simulations
of stability to wind forcing. These models have received little experimental
validation due to the difficulty of measurements needed for model validation and
contact angle variation, particularly on rough surfaces. To address this
shortcoming, a new measurement technique has been developed that reveals a
droplet's interface shape and contact angles by tracking the refraction of a
laser speckle pattern across the liquid/gas interface from top-view images. This
technique will determine how contact angles are affected by roughness amplitudes
and distributions on common engineering metals. It will also determine the
accuracy of existing models of droplets' static stability to gravity forcing and
how it differs from wind-driven droplets. These questions are being addressed
through a systematic program of measurements of distilled-water droplets on
rough metal surfaces, droplets on inclined surfaces and measurements of wind-
driven droplets on inclined surfaces just below critical inclination angles.
Wetting and shedding of liquids from surfaces affect numerous areas of
technology from manufacturing processes to aircraft icing. Beyond its broad
technological impacts, the work will provide ample opportunities for
undergraduate research participation.
