9632757 Prinn This project supports the secretariat of the International Global
Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project of the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Program. IGAC provides services to the atmospheric-biospheric
chemistry research community through: (1) assistance in the coordination of
international atmospheric/biospheric chemistry research projects, (2)
publication of a quarterly newsletter and other documents that summarize IGAC
scientific results, their relevance to society, and future plans, (3) aiding the
IGAC Scientific Steering Committee and activity conveners in the planning and
execution of their tasks, and (4) serving as the central information and
communications center for the IGAC Project. In addition, a "mid-life" scientific
and organizational review and evaluation of IGAC is planned. ***
