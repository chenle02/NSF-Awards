Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of
the RUI institution, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, to acquire, operate and
maintain a high-field NMR spectrometer. The acquisition of the instrument will
enhance the ability of the Department to prepare undergraduates for possible
careers in chemistry and will enhance research in the following areas: a) The
determination of equilibrium constants, stoichiometry, and structures of Lewis
adducts of model organometallic halides of Groups 14 and 15 b) The determination
of the structural determinants of organometallic tautomerism and higher
coordination c) Thermal rearrangements of bicyclic vinylcyclobutances and
stereoselective syntheses of substituted norbornanones and norbornenones and, d)
Investigations of infrared laser-induced organic reactions. The instrument will
also be used in ongoing collaborative projects with neighboring institutuions
such as the determination of substituent effects in phosphineborane
organometallics.
