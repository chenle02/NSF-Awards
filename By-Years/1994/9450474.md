9450474 The proposed research would continue the development of research
emphasis in fisheries oceanography. The scientific focus of the proposed work is
the fine scale vertical and temporal distribution of copepod life stages in
patches of cod and haddock larvae sampled intensively during Georges Bank
"process" cruises. Approximately 40 fine mesh (.064mm) one fourth m MOCNESS
samples selected from four spring cruises conducted in 1981-1983 on the southern
part of the Georges Bank will be processed.
