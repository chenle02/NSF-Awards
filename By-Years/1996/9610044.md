9610044 Garmire An optical correlation system will be demonstrated operating at
MHz level frame rates. This high speed system will provide a practical optical
correlation system for image processing, with potential applications in optical
inspection and machine vision. The proposed project leverages on recent
developments in nonlinear semiconductor quantum well devices, and is a
collaborative effort with Sanders' Microwave Elect
