It is thought that protoplanets, the bodies that eventually gave rise to
planets, formed by a process known as accretion during the early life of our
Solar System. This process cannot, of course, be studied directly. Little is
known about how accretion proceeds at different distances from the Sun. The work
proposed here will address questions of Solar System development by using
sophisticated computer modeling techniques. The investigator will also reassess
the development of the giant planets and the Kuiper Belt of the outer Solar
System. He will establish astronomy and planetary science education programs at
the Sam Noble Museum, Oklahoma's state natural history museum. He will design
classroom programs for visiting school groups as well as adding to the museum's
catalog of Discovery Kits, which can be loaned free of charge across the
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed here will use a GPU-accelerated
N-body code to directly simulate the construction of rocky protoplanets via
runaway and oligarchic growth. The same code will be used to build a self-
consistent model of the dynamical evolution of the early outer solar system.
Finally, he will use a new N-body algorithm to understand the interplay between
planetary and triple star dynamics within the Alpha Centauri and other multiple
star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
