The goal of this research is to explore how low dimensions, strong interactions
and frustration from applied fields act together to produce interesting states
of matter. One such material (Bechgaard salt) exhibits metallic, insulating,
antiferromagnetic, density wave, superconducting, non-ohmic, quasi-periodic and
Quantum Hall Effect phases as temperature, pressure and magnetic field are
varied. Experiments involving magnetic, thermal, elastic, and structural
measurements are conducted on normal, superconducting and exotic phases of the
quasi-one and quasi-two dimensional organic charge transfer salts. New phenomena
found in no other materials also are examined. These include a cascade of
magnetic field induced transitions and new forms of quantum oscillations. In
addition, the effects of extraordinary magnetic field, up to 65 Tesla, on the
behavior of low-dimensional systems are investigated. %%% In this work,
electronic properties of highly anisotropic organic conductors are studied.
Typically, the conductivity is one million times better along the best
conducting direction of the crystal than along the worst. Because the electrons
are constrained to move along chains, they interact more strongly with other
electrons, thus causing a number of unusual transitions and properties. At room
temperature, the materials are metallic. On cooling to liquid helium
temperatures, the materials become insulating, magnetic or superconducting. When
magnetic fields are applied and oriented in different directions relative to the
chains, striking changes in material properties are noted. The object of these
studies is to understand the basic competition between metals and insulator,
magnet and superconductor in a molecular system. The successful completion of
the proposed studies ultimately will lead to the development of new materials
for fabrication of new electronic devices.
