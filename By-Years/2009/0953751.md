Attackers only need to find a single exploitable bug in order
to&lt;br/&gt;install malware, bots, and viruses on a vulnerable user's
computer.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, bugs are plentiful. For example, the Ubuntu
Linux&lt;br/&gt;distribution bug management database currently lists over 58,000
open&lt;br/&gt;bugs. Thus, the question is not whether an attacker can find a
bug,&lt;br/&gt;but which bugs an attacker can exploit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research investigates novel techniques, approaches, and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for
finding exploitable bugs. The ability to deterimine&lt;br/&gt;whether a bug is
exploitable or not will allow developers to&lt;br/&gt;prioritize bug reports so
that the most security-critical bugs are&lt;br/&gt;fixed first. The techniques
investigated will also help developers&lt;br/&gt;distribute patches safely.
