Oceanic primary production plays an important role in buffering atmospheric CO2.
A significant portion of global primary production takes places in the surface
water of the Equatorial Pacific. This project will be a component of the JGOFS
Equatorial Pacific Experiment. Nutrient levels, distribution of particulate
nitrogen and rates of 15N-nitrogen assimilation will be measured to determine:
1) How much "new production" occurs in the central Equatorial Pacific?. 2) What
controls the level of new production?. 3) Does some new production accumulate as
particulate nitrogen?, and 4) Is some new production converted to dissolved
organic nitrogen?.//
