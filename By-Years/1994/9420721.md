9420721 Bandy The major objective of this research is to quantify the
efficiencies for the conversion of dimethylsulfide (DMS) to its various gas
phase oxidation products in a remote marine atmosphere. This information is
fundamental to assessing the significance of DMS as a precursor for atmospheric
aerosol in the marine environment. An enhanced understanding of this linkage
will provide a basis for incorporating tropospheric aerosol into global climate
models and thereby contribute to a reduction in the present large uncertainty in
the calculated climate forcing due to atmospheric aerosols derived from marine
sources of DMS. The experimental work plan is centered on the measurement of
sulfur dioxide (SO2), DMS, and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) during the field portion
of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1). A
novel gas chromatograph/quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system will be used
on-board the NCAR C-130 aircraft platform to perform measurements of these
sulfur-containing gases. This GC/MS instrumentation will measure these three
sulfur analytes at a frequency of one sample every four to five minutes and with
a minimum detectability of approximately one part-per-trillion (volume to
volume). These researchers will combine their analytical data with other ACE-1
measurements to determine the mechanisms, rates, and efficiencies of the
chemical processes that affect the formation, growth, distribution, and
radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols derived from sulfur gas precursors.
