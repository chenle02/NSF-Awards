9406220 Coffey The problem of efficient real-time retrieval of information from
large-scale databases is emerging as an important current application. This
research will use a wide range of techniques derived from information theory to
explore the fundamental limits of such retrieval systems. Many existing
information theory research topics are directly related to the database problem,
and the application in turn generates many novel fundamental problems in
information theory. The basic underlying problem of context-dependent requests
for information -- from a database whose physical structure does not match the
user-perceived structure of the data -- is modeled as a novel type of random
walk problem, in which one random walk (by the user over the data) drives a
designed random walk by the system through the database. Results are derived
which demonstrate that access time can be greatly improved in straightforward
ways by adding redundancy. Potential extensions to systems in which highly
compressible data is stored in databases with arbitrary structure, with more
general forms of redundancy, are discussed. The theoretical results developed in
this research will provide insight into the design of information retrieval
systems appropriate for a variety of scientific applications. These theoretical
results , however, can only provide first-order guidance in system design.
Further guidance can be found by comparisons between the results derived from
somewhat abstract models and those arrived at through more detailed simulation
of systems. This research will investigate the applicability and robustness of
the results of this researah and those of others to system design through system
simulation. Actual datasets and realistic workloads can be used to validate the
models and assess the applicability of the results to actual systems. ***
