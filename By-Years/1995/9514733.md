Anthropologists have long been interested in the relationship between biology
and culture. The Hindu caste system, which established preferred mating
practices among the populations of India, is a good example of the impact of
social processes on human biology. Numerous investigators have studied the
effect of the caste system on genetic variation. Yet the generalizations from
this body of work remain unconvincing for several reasons. First, many of the
polymorphisms assayed are indirect measurements of DNA variation, are sampled
from only a few loci, and are not selectively neutral. Second, many studies do
not estimate significance levels or confidence intervals, leaving the findings
suspect. Finally, no systematic comparisons have been made with continental
populations (i.e., Africans, Asians, and Europeans) using a large, uniform set
of DNA polymorphisms. To date, no one has taken advantage of the recent advances
in molecular biology to address unresolved questions of long-standing importance
to human evolution in India. The proposed research will critically investigate
the genetic evolution of South Indian caste populations by (1) formulating and
testing hypotheses of the effect of caste subdivision on genetic variation; (2)
using a variety of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA polymorphisms; and (3) making
direct comparisons to continental populations. The study will analyze
mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomal DNA, and autosomal DNA polymorphisms with
differing rates of mutation from a sample representing individuals in 4 castes
spanning the caste hierarchy and 2 tribal populations. Comparisons will be made
to our existing data from caste and continental populations.
