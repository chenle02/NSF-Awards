Proposal DMS-0403983 PI: Nader Masmoudi, Courant Institute-NYU Title: Asymptotic
problems in fluid mechanics, gas dynamics and quantum mechanics

ABSTRACT

The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue working on some asymptotic
problems coming from Fluid Mechanics, Gas Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics. These
asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds
number, the Mach number or a time scaling) goes to zero or to infinity. In
studying these problems, many mathematical difficulties arise. These
difficulties are mainly due to the change of the type of the equations, the
presence of many temporal and spatial scales, the presence of resonances, the
presence of boundary layers ... Many tools have been developed to circumvent
these difficulties such as the introduction of different types of measures to
describe the defect of strong convergence, the use of compensated compactness
type arguments, the use of averaging lemma, the use of energy methods and
relative entropy methods ... Of course, many other tools should be developed in
the future. More specifically the PI plans to continue working on the
hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0
especially in bounded domains and relate this to some of the known results in
the compressible-incompressible limit. He also plans to look at the limit when
the Weber number goes to infinity in the water wave problem.

The PI proposes to study some asymptotic problems coming from Fluid Mechanics,
Gas Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics. The study of these asymptotic problems is
very important to get a better understanding about the behavior of complicated
systems in different limiting cases. This also allows to have a better
understanding of the real physical phenomenon taking place. Moreover, it
provides a way of giving rigorous derivations of different physical models. It
also gives a better knowledge about the domain of validity of each simplifying
model. This is very important for engineers and physicists who are looking for
the simplest model that captures the phenomenon to implement numerically or to
apply in real life.
