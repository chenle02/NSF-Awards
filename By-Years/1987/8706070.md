This proposal requests 50% funding for the purchase of equipment needed to
modernize the paleomagnetic laboratory at the University of Wyoming. The
research of this laboratory has made significant contributions in the
characterization of magnetization of the lower continental crust, mechanisms of
acquisition of remanent magnetization during the cooling of igneous rocks, the
Eocene secular variation of the geomagnetic field, and the magnetostratigraphy
of volcanoclastic rock sequences. The workhorses of the lab, a cryogenic and a
spinner magnetometer, are both over 12 years old and approaching obsolescence.
This project will provide an efficient upgrade of these two systems and allow
the laboratory to pursue its research in geomagnetism.
