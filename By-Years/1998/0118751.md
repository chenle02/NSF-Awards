This research examines the health impact of the Wari empire (AD 600 - 1000) on
populations in the state's heartland and periphery through paleopathological,
dietary, and demographic analyses of archaeological human remains. The Wari
state originated in the central Andean highlands (near modern-day Ayacucho) and
incorporated populations throughout the Andes, including those of the Majes
valley in south-central Peru. Demographic, paleopathological, and stable
isotopic bone composition data are collected from three archaeological skeletal
samples-two from the peripheral Majes valley (sites, La Real and Beringa) and
one from the heartland urban Wari site in the Ayacucho valley, Conchopata-to
document past rural and urban community health during the period of the Wari
rule. These data are then used to compare differences in health status, if any,
between those in the heartland and periphery, as well as document
(dis)similarities between the two peripheral Majes valley skeletal populations
that experienced interaction with Wari. Finally, data on sex- and class-based
health and dietary differences are used to consider past social and gender roles
and organization.
