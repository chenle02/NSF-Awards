The goal of the research is to enhance the development of product requirements
through a better understanding of customer requirements. Customer requirements
are those things that customers would like to see realized in a product and are
usually represented qualitatively before concepts are developed. Product
requirements are quantitative, and measurable parameters of a product that will
satisfy customer requirements. For example, a customer requirement for the ON-
OFF button of a remote control may be that "it gives a snap feedback response
against my finger when I push it". From this information, the product team needs
to develop product requirements to define the product, such as "return force = 6
N" and "button travel = 0.5 centimeters". This research is a multidisciplinary
effort joining expertise in engineering and marketing along with industrial
involvement for an endeavor that is both applicable and relevant. Product
requirements that are quantitative and measurable are essential for product
definition. For design projects that involve several individuals, a documented
set of requirements is essential for project management and reaching consensus
among team members. Furthermore, developing product requirements is an essential
step in current design methods, such as Quality Function Deployment, and Value
Engineering.
