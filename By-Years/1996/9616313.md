9616313 Tomozawa The most popular explanation of mechanical fatigue in glasses
is the slow growth of a surface crack promoted by the stress corrosion reaction
of glass with water or water vapor. It has been reported, however, that silica
glass optical fibers can be made flaw-free and that these pristine glasses can
also exhibit mechanical fatigue. Recent observations by atomic force microscopy
(AFM) of glass fiber surfaces showed that the initial strength degradation of
optical fibers is due to surface roughening rather than crack propagation. Thus
it is necessary to understand the mechanism and kinetics of surface roughening
of pristine glass surface in order to predict the fatigue life time of optical
fiber correctly. The initial stage of the surface roughening kinetics of silica
glass with or without stress will be investigated using an atomic force
microscope and will be compared with the theory for the surface roughness
development such as the noise-induced roughening theory and the stress-induced
roughening theory. %%% The long term mechanical stability of silica glass
optical fiber is an important concern in optical communications. Life time
prediction of optical fibers requires the understanding of the mechanism of
mechanical fatigue. In spite of extensive investigations, the mechanism remains
unclear. Recent observations by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of glass fiber
surfaces showed that the initial strength degradation of optical fibers is due
to surface roughening rather than crack propagation. Thus it is necessary to
understand the mechanism and kinetics of surface roughening of pristine glass
surface in order to predict the fatigue life time of optical fiber correctly.
The initial stage of the surface roughening kinetics of silica glass will be
investigated and will be compared with the theory for the surface roughness
