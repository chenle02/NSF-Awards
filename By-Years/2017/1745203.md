Title: Student Travel for Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at
International Conference on Functional Programming 2017 (PLMW@ICFP)

A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop for students is being organized as
part of the 22nd International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), one
of the premier conferences in the area of programming languages. The conference
will be held in Oxford, UK. This grant will support approximately 9 students to
attend the mentoring workshop plus the ICFP conference and its satellite events.
This proposal is intended specifically to target women students and students
from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent
residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the
need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build
the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this
important research arena.
