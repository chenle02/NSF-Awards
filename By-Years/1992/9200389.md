Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Boston University is committed
to providing the education that engineers will need to understand and contribute
to technological change in the twenty- first century. The mission is the
training of the country's future engineering leaders and the expansion of the
frontiers of modern technology. This REU expands beyond the "Freshman Research
Opportunity Program" (FROP). Special attention will be given to recruiting women
and minority applicants. By capturing the interest of undergraduates in research
at an early stage, the REU program hopes to deflect them into the PhD bound
research track, further enhancing the national pool of PhD level scientists and
engineers.
