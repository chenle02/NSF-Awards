This project is a collaborative effort to investigate the emissions of
particulate chloride from biomass burning and the implications of these
emissions on the formation of atmospheric ozone and small particles. The effort
combines the facilities and expertise of atmospheric chemists at Carnegie-Mellon
University (CMU) and University of Washington (UW) for the purpose of conducting
a detailed set of laboratory experiments in a large smog chamber reactor in
CMU's combustion facility. The chamber will be filled with smoke from the open
combustion of globally relevant chloride emitting biomass fuels such as various
types of grasses (e.g. Sawgrass, Wiregrass, Rice straw), and Palmetto (small
palm species). Changes in the concentrations of gas-phase reactants and products
will be determined in real-time using UW's state-of-the-art chemical measurement
instrumentation. The investigators will apply kinetic box models to derive the
combination of parameters that give the best measurement-model agreement for the
development of parameters that can be used in regional and global
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate chloride undergoes efficient reactions
with nitrogen oxide gases, releasing nitryl chloride (ClNO2) in the gas phase.
The presence of ClNO2 can significantly perturb the troposphere's oxidant
budget, the cycling of chlorine (ClOx), hydrogen (HOx), and NOx radicals, the
oxidation of organic compounds and associated organic aerosol formation, and
ground-level ozone levels. This project will be the first laboratory study to
investigate the formation and yield of ClNO2 from dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5),
reacting with chloride in particle systems representative of biomass burning
aerosols.
