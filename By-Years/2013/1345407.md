This award is to continue a program, initiated by the NSF-REU Chemistry
Leadership Group several years ago, which has provided travel support to REU and
LSAMP participants for the purpose of allowing them to present their research at
the Spring National American Chemical Society Meetings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF-REU Leadership Group Travel Awards Program will
partially fund undergraduates from REU and LSAMP programs to attend the spring
National American Chemical Society Meeting. Mentors of these students who need
travel support will also be offered a small stipend. Besides presenting their
research, these undergraduates will also attend programs that have been designed
to provide support and guidance in what, for many of them, will be their first
intense interaction with the scientific community beyond their home and research
institutions. The support programs will include a welcome session to introduce
recipients and mentors to the Leadership Group, to the NSF, and to other award
recipients, as well as an awards luncheon at which a well-known chemist will
speak, with the intent of providing a specific welcome of the award recipients
to the wider community of chemists.
