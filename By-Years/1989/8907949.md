Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will explore the strange
quark content of the nucleon, the question of how the elementary particles get
their masses, and the possibility of a non-standard origin of CP-violation. The
strange quark content of the nucleon has important implications for experiments
probing the possibility of light elementary particles that are related to the
origin of mass. The origin of elementary particle mass and of CP (matter--
antimatter symmetry) violation are, of course, very basic questions in physics.
