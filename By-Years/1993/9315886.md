9315886 Durand This award will fund a project to investigate parameter
estimation techniques for use with neurophysiological systems. The investigators
will compare and test current and new parameter estimation techniques; that is,
Linear Associative Memories. These techniques will be applied to the estimation
of electrotonic and membrane ionic channel parameters. This proposal was
submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and Control Initiative which encouraged the
submission of proposals that through the study of neurophysiological systems
could advance engineering science and advance the knowledge of biological
systems through the use of engineering analysis techniques. The research being
funded by this award has the potential to assist in the modeling of
neurophysiological data and advance the field of engineering in the area of
parameter estimation. ***
