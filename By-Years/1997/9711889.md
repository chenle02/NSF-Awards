Abstract- Linne CTS- 9711889 This is an instrumentation development project on a
picosecond pump/probe instrument based on mode-locked Ti: sapphire lasers.
Addition of a regenerative amplifier makes it possible to observe absolute
concentrations of key species in reacting flow-fields at high speeds and perhaps
independent of pressure. The effort also includes design of novel demodulation
sensors that could have broad applicability in such diverse applications as
ballistic imaging in tissue, imaging spectrographs, and night-vision devices.
