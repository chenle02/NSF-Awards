9419603 zurLoye This research will explore new low temperature synthetic routes
for the preparation of novel nitride materials, particularly ternary nitrides.
Showing the plausibility of using microwave synthesis for the preparation of
additional solid-state nitrides is the goal of this research. Reactions to be
studied include the direct combination of a binary metal nitride, such as those
of gallium, aluminum, or silicon, with a transition metal to produce a binary or
ternary transition metal nitride at milder synthetic conditions. Two types of
reactions will be studied: reactions carried out in closed systems; and
reactions carried out in flowing systems. %%% Even though nitrides are an
important class of industrial materials, only a few hundred are known to exist.
The focus of this research will be on a class of transition metal nitrides that
are increasingly recognized as important industrial materials because they are
hard and strong, and are good conductors of heat and electricity. In addition,
some exhibit superconductivity, and others have catalytic properties. Transition
metal nitrides are finding utility in diverse areas such as structural
materials, corrosion and scratch resistant coatings, and as packaging materials
in the semiconductor industry. ***
