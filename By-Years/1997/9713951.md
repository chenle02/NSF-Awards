Abstract Award: CMS 97-13951 P. K. Banerjee et al., SUNY Buffalo "Pile Group
Under Transient-Impact Loading" This research focuses on the principal force
experiences in transportation and waterfront structures during impact which is
transient horizontal loading. Such loads are often transmitted to the
structure's foundation supported on groups of piles and/or drilled shafts.
State-of-practice design for lateral loading of pile and drilled shaft
foundations used beam-on-elastic-foundation analysis to model this dynamic
loading. In this analysis, load shedding from a pile to the soil is represented
by "p-y" springs in which the soil response (p-y or force versus deflection
curves) is modeled as a series of discrete nonlinear springs. Although p-y
curves have been empirically modified to take into account many of the observed
phenomena such as non-linearity, slow cyclic response, shadow zones and group
interaction factors, etc., the propagation of dynamic disturbance from pile-to-
pile in a group has never been considered. Therefore, the use of these springs
for dynamic loading has ! to be significantly improved and soundly validated by
combined experimental and analytical research. The objective of this research is
to develop and validate an improved method of analysis for the design of pile
groups (including drilled shafts) subjected to transient lateral impact loads.
The research tasks encompass: a) a critical study of the transient impact
behavior of pile groups founded in layered media, both analytically and
experimentally, b) development of improved methods of analysis; c) testing and
validation of the proposed new methods; and d) implementation of the improved
methods in a numerical code. Experimental research will involve analysis of
existing load test data as well as creation of new test data for testing and
validation of the improved analytical method. The work will have national
applicability as well as an immediate impact. From the re sults of this study,
revisions can be recommended to AASHTO for inclusion in rationally applicable
design specifications for the design of new structures subjected to vessel
impact loading. ****
