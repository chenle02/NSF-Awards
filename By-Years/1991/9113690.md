Shape from shading is a central, difficult problem of machine vision. Although
its formulation is precise, its solution has usually been considered ill-posed,
possible only with additional assumptions. In recent papers, however, the PIs
gave the first proof that shape form shading is not only well-posed but solvable
uniquely, for general objects, when the illumination is from the direction of
the camera. For general illumination direction, it was shown that the solution
is determined effectively up to a finite ambiguity. Thus, regularization the
standard technique for selecting a single `physically reasonable' surface
solution by imposing additional requirements such as smoothness is generally
unnecessary. The aim of the proposed research is to develop and implement
algorithms for surface reconstruction without regularization, which, unlike
previous algorithms, will explicitly utilize the strong constraints on the
surface solutions that make shape from shading well posed. Through exploiting
these constraints, the algorithms may be fast and robust. Two of the four
algorithms proposed are non-variational unlike most previous ones, and are based
on the novel mathematical techniques of the viscosity solution, and dynamical
systems theory. The long term aim is to combine shape from shading algorithms
with techniques using other information, such as sparse depth data, for robust
surface reconstruction from shaded images.//
