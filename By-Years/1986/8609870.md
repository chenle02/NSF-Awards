An electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer will be required for studies in
a wide range of biological problems. Applications of the instrument include: (1)
structural and mechanistic studies of the molybdenum centrs of xanthine oxidase
ans sulfite oxidase, (2) studies of the effects of chemical modificatio of
plastocyanin on the structure and function of its copper center, (3)
determination of the oxidation-reduction potentials of genetically engineered
forms of the flavodoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, (4) a spin-label study of
substrate binding to xanthine oxidase aimed at establishing the Kd for binding
of xanthine to the oxidized form of the enzyme and the number of substrate
binding sites present in the active site, (5) use of laser-induced excitation of
carbonmonoxy cytochrome c oxidase and nitrosylhemoglobin to examine changes in
the EPR signals of these centers. Together, these projects constitute a major
application of elctron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy that would greatly
enhance the basic research capability of an extended group of biochemists at
Ohio State University.
