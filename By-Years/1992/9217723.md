This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in the
purchase of a 300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR)
spectrometer. Several new faculty members whose research is dependent upon high-
field NMR will benefit from the acquisition of this instrument. It will open new
opportunities for undergraduates in research that is now difficult to carry out
without such an instrument. Research projects to be carried out with this
instrument include: (1) the synthesis of tricyclic cyclopropenes, (2) hydrogen
exchange studies of proteins, (3) chirality transfer in dioxinones, (4)
synthesis of polythiaethers, (5) electron transfer reactions, (6) pH gradients
across membrane vesicles, and (7) phase chances in microemulsions. %%% This
proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is an essential tool for faculty members at
the University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire engaged in chemical research. The
instrument provides important information which in most cases can be used to
determine the geometric and/or molecular structure of newly synthesized
molecules.
