The research will support the development of an extremely sensitive high-speed
detection system based on Gallium Arsenide for use in a sealed-tube photon-
counting position-sensitive detector. The new type of sensor will be optimized
for ultra-high sensitivity in the 4000 - 9000 angstrom wavelength range, to
provide an imaging detector capable of registering single optical photons with
high quantum efficiency (> 40% up to 8500 angstroms), high time resolution
(approximately 1 nanosecond) with high spatial resolution (better than 1000 x
1000 pixels). The detector will be best suited for unprecedented high-speed
observations of astronomical objects such as pulsars and cataclysmic variable
systems. The advances made in high-speed imaging will be applicable beyond the
field of astronomy, and would be useful, for example, in medical imaging
applications.
