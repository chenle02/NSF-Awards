This proposal will fund the MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial
Thermosphere Aeronomy) II Campaign by relocating a University of Michigan Fabry-
Perot trailer in Chile and monitoring the neutral thermospheric winds from a
second site south of Arequipa, Peru. The addition of a second Fabry-Perot site
will by critical to understanding wind gradients centrally involved in
generating ionospheric structures at equatorial latitudes. The trailer will be
refurbished, relocated to Antofagosta, Chile and run in the oxygen red-line mode
to provide thermospheric wind and temperature measurements, and returned to Ann
Arbor.***
