Abstract

This project addresses global control strategies for chaotic dynamical systems,
based on transfer operator representations of dynamics on an invariant subspace.
Emphasis is on developing techniques useful to experimentalists. During the last
decade, much research has been focused on the realization that sensitive
dependence on initial conditions and parameters allows flexible and efficient
control of a chaotic dynamical system. Major difficulties have been connected
with representing the action of the dynamical system on its phase space. In
contrast, a complete global representation of a dynamical system is available in
terms of its symbolic dynamics, and a graph approximation of the symbolic
grammar is a highly efficient way to completely encode coarse-grained control
strategies. This project reduces the difficult problems of developing a global
control strategy to much easier problems, concerning linear algebra if targeting
invariant density, or combinatorics of path searching if targeting optimal
trajectories. In this coarse-grained approximation, paths through graphs model
trajectories of the dynamical system. Local feedback control and small parameter
variations are used to realize paths through the graph as true trajectories.
Questions under study are closely related to Ulam's method in the theory of
Frobenius-Perron operators and also to the concept of partition in information
theory and in symbolic dynamics.

This project develops techniques for targeting, finding optimal trajectories,
and highlighting desirable states. Potential engineering applications include
Navy ship-to-ship transfer by cargo crane, space mission design, design of
electronic circuits that stay within desirable operating regimes, and perhaps
someday preemptive control of epileptic seizures. The work involves
collaboration with experimentalists to pursue real world applications. In
addition, the project investigates applications of controlling symbolic dynamics
to encode information in chaotic oscillations.
