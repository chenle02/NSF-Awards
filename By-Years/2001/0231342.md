The connections between higher- level mathematics such as abstract algebra and
mathematics generally taught at the secondary level are deep. But rarely are
these connections made explicit in the education of pre-service teachers Hence
their potential contributions to the teaching of secondary mathematics is left
undiscovered. These connections are often left undiscovered in professional
development for in-service teachers as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeing the
Connections is a collaborative among the Education Development Center, The
University of New Hampshire and California State University at Chico. The
project produces, pilots, and disseminates curriculum modules that help teachers
develop a knowledge of mathematics for teaching that bridges the gap between
higher level mathematics and the mathematics generally taught at the secondary
level. These modules form a library of materials that are innovative in
addressing the needs of both pre-service and practicing secondary mathematics
teachers. The project builds mechanisms to ensure wide dissemination of the
developed material, which contributes to the intellectual merit of the field.
The project pilots both new and revised materials from previous proof of
concepts for a variety of college and university settings for both mathematics
content courses and mathematics education courses. The broader impacts are
realized through the broad piloting and dissemination of the developed
modules.&lt;br/&gt;
