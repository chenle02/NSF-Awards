The modern world is awash in data, greatly amplifying the necessity of
statistics education. Introductory statistics courses are often both large and
populated by students from a diverse array of backgrounds. Tailoring what is
said to these students with an awareness of their interests and goals and an
understanding of their background and progress can substantially improve their
learning experience. This is true for all students - from those likely to
struggle to those who most easily master the material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For
this project, learning analytics techniques are being used to drive personalized
instruction for each of the 1400 students who take Stats 250 each term at the
University of Michigan. A detailed portrait of the student's background,
interests and goals is being created as well as a real-time state of each
student's academic progress by collating the rich array of data captured from
student work in the LectureTools active learning environment. Given these
portraits, the E2Coach system is using computer tailored communication
technology to individually address each student and enabling interaction with
the student as if they sat down with the instructional team for the course for
an expert coaching session.
