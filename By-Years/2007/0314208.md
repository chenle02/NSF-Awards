Professor John Tully, of Yale University, is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to study chemical dynamics at solid surfaces.
The objective of this research is to advance the atomistic understanding of
dynamical processes at solid surfaces. New theories are developed and
methodologies are implemented computationally. The focus is on the simulation of
those photochemical processes at surfaces that are mediated by electronic
excitations. There is an emphasis on understanding how vibrational tunneling and
zero point motion affect such processes. Methods for accelerating the simulation
of rare events associated with non-equilbrium chemical reactions are developed.
These calculations rely on the use of density functional theory and conventional
quantum chemistry methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomistic motions and reactions
can evolve smoothly but may also involve discontinuous processes that are
associated with electronic transitions and absorption or emission of light. Such
processes may not be modeled with classical potentials and require an
understanding of both electronic and vibrational processes as well as the
ability to describe interactions between electrons, vibrational degrees of
freedom, and light. Such interactions are strongly relevant to catalytic
activity, materials processing, biophysics and photochemistry. Understanding of
such interactions is also relevant to the problem of nondestructive evaluation
of materials such as ancient artifacts. A program aimed at including
undergraduates in such endeavors is included in this research
initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
