The proposer will apply computer modeling to the investigation of the fluid
dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion. She will make extensive use of a newly-
available research tool, the CRAY supercomputer. The proposer has developed a
reliable computational model in two dimensions. The fluid motion is described by
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and the immersed organism is
comprised of a single filament undergoing time-dependent motion. On the size or
position-dependency of the amplitude of the swimming motion the algorithm works
for a very wide range of Reynolds numbers. This is the first computational study
of aquatic animal locomotion which makes these claims. The major goal of this
research is to extend this computational model to three dimensions. It is also
proposed to improve the two- dimensional model by including a cell body attached
to the undulating filament, and to study phase-locking between neighboring
flagella. This work is pioneering in at least two respects: it is the first
computational model of aquatic animal locomotion which solves the full Navier-
Stokes equations and it makes extensive use of large-scale computational fluid
techniques on a supercomputer.
