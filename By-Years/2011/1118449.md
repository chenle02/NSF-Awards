Conventional climate models continue to struggle to properly represent large-
scale tropical moist convective systems including convectively coupled
equatorial waves) and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). Because these
disturbances have global impacts on weather and climate through atmospheric and
oceanic teleconnections, this casts a shadow of doubt on the reliability of
climate prediction on different timescales ranging from intraseasonal to
seasonal and longer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project has the
goals of improving understanding of the dynamics of these disturbances, and
enhancing the ability to simulate them by using a new Lagrangian atmospheric
model that simulates atmospheric circulations by predicting motions of
individual air parcels. Educational impacts of this project will include further
development of climate modeling capabilities at Yale and Susquehanna
Universities, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students by
introducing them to cutting edge techniques in atmospheric modeling and
convective parametrization. In addition there is a plan to educate the general
public about the fundamentals of weather and climate modeling. Thus the project
has substantial broader impacts.
