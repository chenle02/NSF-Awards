Professor McDonald is funded by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of chemical reaction processes on a time
scale of approximately 250 femtoseconds, using time resolved spectroscopy with
laser pulses of that length. The goal is to study the reaction in the time scale
of the bond-making process itself. A van der Waals cluster containing one
reactant and a nonreactive molecule that can be made into the other reactant by
photodissociation provides a convenient definition of a zero of time for a
bimolecular reaction. The reactions to be studied involve the addition of
radicals and atoms H, Cl, Br, or methyl to small double-bonded molecules such as
ethylene. Products formed in the reaction in a cooled molecular beam will be
detected by femtosecond pump-probe laser fluorescence or by multiphoton-
ionization with time-of-flight mass spectroscopy detection. %%% Very fast laser
pulses will be used in a stroboscopic technique to study the reaction between
two reactants to form new molecules. Starting with the reactants loosely bound
in a cluster, a flash of light begins the reaction. The observations will be
carried out with light pulsing at the time scale of the reaction process itself
to see the making of a new bond in progress.
