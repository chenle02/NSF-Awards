The adsorption of gas on a solid surface can produce considerable variation in
the electrical and optical properties of this surface and eventually lead to the
identification of the gas adsorbed as well as a quantification of its presence
in the environment (pollution). With semiconductor surfaces the adsorbed gas is
able to play a role comparable to a "dopant" and therefore initiate drastic
changes in electrical and optical properties. For example, one part of nitrogen
dioxide in 109 parts of air can be detected on certain semiconductors. As the
phenomenon occurs at the surface of the material, a high surface to volume
ration is advantageous, thus leading to thin films structures. Such structures
can be utilized in a small sensor tailored to a specific gas. The specificity
will result from the compatibility of the electronic structure of the material
near its surface and the atomic structure of the gas being detected. The main
technical objectives of the project will be (a) to study the mechanism of
adsorption over different types of materials (metal, inorganic and organic
semiconductors); (b) to establish the conditions for specificity in adsorption;
(c) to design electronic structures in materials providing selective adsorption
with resulting changes in surface conductivity or optical reflection
coefficients; (d) to prepare thin films of selected materials with the above
structure and incorporate them in a sensor configuration; and (e) to carry on
comparative sensitivity tests with existing sensors or methods of detection. The
University of Texas at El Paso is requesting support from the RIMI program for
equipment for this project, which would involve faculty and students from the
Departments of Physics, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Geological
Sciences. The proposed project will enhance both our Minority Research Center of
Excellence in Materials Science and our newly established Center for
Environmental Resource Management.
