A three.year effort is proposed to continue development and testing of a fully
coupled ice.water.till model for basal processes of wet.bedded ice sheets. At
present, lack of an accepted bed model is the major difficulty in predicting how
modern ice sheets will respond to possible changes in their boundary conditions
caused by anthropogenic climatic change. If model development and testing here
are successful, the model will be used to assess West Antarctic ice.sheet
stability and its effect on future sea levels, and to study other present and
past ice sheets and their deposits.//
