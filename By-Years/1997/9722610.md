This project will study quantum transport of ultra-cold atoms in optical
lattices. One dimensional-standing waves will be combined to form periodic and
quasi-periodic optical lattices in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, and
time- dependent amplitudes and phases will be imposed. Fundamental problems will
be addressed which play important roles in atomic physics, condensed matter
physics, and nonlinear dynamics. These include the role of dimensionally on
dynamical localization, destruction of dynamical delocalization by decoherence,
effects of quantum tunneling and scars, resonant tunneling between energy levels
in different potential wells, spatial spread of atoms and transport of a cold
beam of atoms, and topological quantum numbers.
