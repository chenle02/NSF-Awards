Chi Ho Mak is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in path integral theory of electron
transport in chemical and biological systems. Feynman path integral theory is
applied in conjunction with Quantum Monte Carlo techniques to the study of the
mechanisms for electron transport in a number of molecular electronic systems.
The influence of the chemical environment on the motions of the electron is
examined in relation to the quantum mechanical features of electron transfer
reactions. Various aspects of tunneling, coherence, quantum interference and
electron correlation will be studied, and an effort will be made to understand
the crossover region between adiabatic and nonadiabatic barrier crossings.
Applications include studies of charge separation rate in the bacterial
photosynthetic reaction center, a potentially useful molecular quantum
interference device, and quantum conductance of one-dimensional molecular wires.
The understanding of long-range transport of electrons in molecular systems is
of fundamental theoretical importance. It is also one of the key objectives in a
rapidly growing area which has become known as molecular electronics. Molecular
electronics involves the control of electron flows in molecules through the use
of external signals. Work in this area may eventually lead to electronic devices
with miniaturization on the order of molecular dimensions.
