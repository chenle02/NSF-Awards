The objective of this project is to directly chemically analyze fluid
inclusions from quartz veins from oceanic rocks. Well-characterized, homogeneous
fluid inclusion populations on rocks already in hand will be analyzed by
conventional crush/ leach analysis using atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
This data can then be compared to hydrothermal end members sampled from active
hot springs. %%% Fluid inclusion studies provide important information about the
temperature of hydrothermal systems and about the salinity of the fluid. There
has been no previous attempt to determine directly the chemical composition of
the fluid trapped in the inclusion and such information is important to a
complete characterization of the hydrothermal system. It would be extremely
useful to be able to compare fluid compositions in inclusions in fossil systems
with compositions of presently active seafloor systems. The data to be obtained
in this project could break new ground.
