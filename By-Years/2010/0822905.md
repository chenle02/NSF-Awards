The International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages
and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) is the premier forum for interdisciplinary
research in computer architecture, programming languages and compilers, and
operating systems. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers
in these fields for technical exchange on topics at the intersection of these
discipline, as well as emerging research areas that transcend these traditional
disciplinary boundaries. This proposal aims to increase the impact of this
conference on women by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially
in cases where travel support would otherwise preclude attendance. Priority for
these funds will be given to defray the travel expenses of female students
(graduate and undergraduate) and female junior faculty.
