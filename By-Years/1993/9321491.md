9321491 Oliver New studies of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere by the
incoherent scatter technique with the MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar in
Shigaraki, Japan are conducted in collaboration with the Radio Atmospheric
Science Center of Kyoto University. Prior studies have focussed largely either
on short- term climatology, or on the morphology of local ionospheric wave
propagation and tilts. This award extends the climatology to the better part of
a solar cycle, and these results will form the primary Asian-sector contribution
to global models of electric fields, neutral winds, and case studies. New
gravity-wave studies exploit recent advances in identifying individual wave
packets and in measuring the dispersion relation for gravity waves and
simultaneous measurements with a new co-located passive meteor radar. Several
recent advances in radar data reduction and analysis have made some of these
studies more feasible and all of them more potentially productive. ***
