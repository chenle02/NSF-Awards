Recent studies have demonstrated that certain arc volcanic rocks are enriched
in 10Be and B derived from subducted oceanic crust and sediments. Because the
host phases for these elements are unknown, we propose a systematic ion
microprobe investigation of high pressure- low temperature metamorphic rocks in
order to determine the distribution of Be and B among mineral phases stable
under subduction zone conditions. Specifically, we will determine (1) which
phase are responsible for the Be and B signatures of the subducting slab, (2)Be
and B partitioning coefficients for different mineral pairs, and (3) the
variation of Be and B distribution as a function of metamorphic grade. Analyses
of synmetamorphic migmatites and host rocks from the Catalina Schist, a pale-
subduction zone, will place constraints on the behavior of Be and B during
melting. Analyses of syn-and post-metamorphic vein minerals will place
constraints on the mobility of Be and B in aqueous fluids. We will also evaluate
the possibility that Be and B reside in poorly- characterized phases along grain
boundaries. As in our previous studies, we will continue to collect data on
other elements including H, Li, and selected REE. The results of the proposed
investigation will increase our understanding of subduction zone processes and
arc magmatism.
