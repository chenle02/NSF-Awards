The proposed project is a ?New York workshop on the symmetric groups and related
topics (NYSY)?, which will be held at the City University of New York (CUNY) in
New York City from September 8-10, 2011. The first two days, held at the
Graduate Center (GC) in Manhattan, will focus on current research and new
developments in the study of symmetric groups: ordinary and modular
representation theory of the symmetric group and related groups (including the
verification of generalizations of the McKay conjecture in these cases), Hecke
algebras, connections with geometry, combinatorics, number theory and partition
theory. Special attention will be paid to the recurring role of core partitions.
The third day, held at York College in Queens, a CUNY senior college, and will
be designed as introduction for undergraduates to algebra and number theory
through lectures on the symmetric groups and connections with partitions and
combinatorics.

Symmetric groups appear in almost any brunch of sciences. Their structures and
representation theory can be described in terms combinatorial data and geometric
properties. The research sessions of the workshop will contribute to the
development of the interacting fields of representation theory of the symmetric
groups, algebraic combinatorics, and partition theory in the coming years. This
workshop will enhance regional and international collaborations among research
groups working on similar projects. There is a strong educational component to
these workshop. Undergraduate students from CUNY and area colleges will
participate and even give talks in parallel sessions during the third day. This
is an important opportunity for them to interact with a wide group of active
researchers in their area to achieve a broader perspective of developments on
the frontiers of higher mathematics. This will increase interest in graduate
school and aid in diversifying the candidate pool as CUNY boasts a number of
talented women and minority undergraduate students.
