Artificial reefs serve a useful purpose to promote the growth of sessile marine
organisms such as bacteria, algae, corals, and bryozoans as well as providing a
habitat and food source for species such as fish, crabs, lobsters, and some
marine invertebrates. This project applies the EPA's 12 Principles of Green
Technology to a cellulose based surface that is coated in nutrients to promote
the rapid growth of marine microbes, the base of the marine food chain. This
rapid growth, which begins days after being submerged, starts the food chain.
The mineral based substrate attached to the cellulose based material is denser
than water to allow the entire structure to sink; both the cellulose and mineral
based materials will degrade leaving behind nucleation sites for microbes,
corals, invertebrate collections, and more. The reef is constructed entirely
from biodegradable materials and production costs are economical.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach combines cellulose with silicates
and nutrients (CeNS) to provide a surface for marine life to nucleate and grow.
This approach was developed in the PI's lab over the past decade raising marine
bacteria that produced marine natural products. The team intends to build on the
preliminary results involving carbonate based organisms (i.e. oysters, coral), a
place for larvae to grow (i.e. fish, shrimp and octopus), and to provide a food
source and shelter for schools of fish. This team has started testing its green
technology approach in the Florida panhandle and the Florida Keys. While the use
of wood as a growth and shelter medium for marine life has been practiced since
ancient times, the use of a nutrient mix with cellulose to selectively encourage
and accelerate certain species is unique.
