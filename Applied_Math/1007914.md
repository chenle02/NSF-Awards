The project is devoted to a study of the Navier-Stokes equations using
probabilistic techniques. Using stochastic Lagrangian techniques we will study
the inviscid limit of the Navier Stokes equations in bounded domains. The
probabilistic approach will allow us to address new questions (e.g. the
asymptotic limit of the probability that a particle starting close to the
boundary arrives in the interior of the domain). The project will also study
probabilistic global existence theorems in the following sense: find a process
whose expectation is a strong solution to the (deterministic) Navier-Stokes
equations, and prove that for arbitrary initial data, the blow up time of the
process is infinity with non-zero probability. A secondary aim of this research
is to study the nonlocal, nonlinear PDEs associated with incompressible flows
that promote the creation of hot spots.

The project will study mathematical aspects of fluid dynamics using
probabilistic techniques. One fundamental, unresolved question addressed will be
the separation of the boundary layer and the zero viscosity limit. This is of
great practical interest in studying problems such as the determination of air
flow about an airplane wing. Other problems studied are probabilistic global
existence questions. While the question of existence for all time of solutions
of the equations governing the evolution of incompressible fluids is unresolved,
this project will address a probabilistic analogue of this question. Namely, can
one find a criterion that allows one to decide that certain realizations of the
flow are turbulent and stop them, and show that the remainder "live forever"
with nonzero probability? A secondary aim of this project is to study certain
peculiar stirring methods that keep the fluid hot (i.e. what is the best way to
stir your coffee so that it is hot for as long as possible); this has
applications to combustion processes, and chemical reactions.
