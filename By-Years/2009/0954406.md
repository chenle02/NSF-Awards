Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a new vanadium
dioxide-based focal planar array technology capable of achieving resolution and
sensitivity levels that are beyond the theoretical limits of current focal
planar array technologies. The approach is to integrate vanadium dioxide thin
films with silicon cantilevers and test arrays of such devices in an optical
readout system to be assembled. &lt;br/&gt;Recent discoveries show that vanadium
dioxide-coated silicon cantilevers show an abrupt and large bending during the
coating?s phase transition. This phenomenon will be applied to infrared sensing
technologies. The preliminary work shows that by utilizing this actuation
mechanism, an approximately 6-fold increase in sensitivity over the theoretical
sensitivity limits of current technologies ? based on thermal expansion
coefficient of bimorph cantilevers ? is possible. The thin vanadium dioxide
films did not cause bending of the coated cantilevers at room temperature, which
eliminates issues related to the flatness of the bimorph cantilevers currently
used. This transformative work unveils a new technology that could impact other
areas such as micro-electro-mechanical actuators. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of this work can be found in the development of a new technology for infrared
sensing, that offers resolutions and sensitivities unachievable at the current
state-of-the-art. The development of this technology at the University of Puerto
Rico-Mayaguez will impact participant undergraduate and graduate students in
this institution, since it will give them the opportunity to be part of this
technology development and have hands-on experience in cleanroom technologies
for the first time.
