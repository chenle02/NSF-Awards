This exploratory project is to enhance the ability of teachers to provide high
quality STEM education for all students by developing research-based materials
that enable teachers to facilitate students' progress toward statistical
understanding. The exploratory project has two phases. The first phase will
focus on modeling student learning of difficult statistical concepts by
constructing and developing a set of student learning progressions. Informed by
the first phase, the second phase will focus on developing, implementing,
supporting, and pilot testing instructional materials for teachers aimed at
increasing knowledge and effective practice of statistical concepts. Formative
and summative assessments will be used to evaluate (a) the materials, (b) the
participant activities and experiences with the materials, and (c) the
implementation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Common Core State Standards
for Mathematics and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards
clearly recommend the emphasis of statistics education in K-12 schools. In
recent years, researchers have started to explore issues related to statistics
education in Grades K-8, but little work has been done at the high school level.
This exploratory project addresses a critical need in mathematics education and
fills an important gap in teacher education related to high school statistics.
