A symmetric function is a multi-variate polynomial F(x1,x2,...,xn) which is
invariant under any permutation of the variables. In recent years such functions
have become quite important to several fields of mathematics, and the
representation theoretic, analytic, algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial
properties of different families of symmetric functions form active areas of
current research. Under this proposal the PI will investigate the combinatorial
properties of various families of symmetric functions and other objects of
relevance to representation theory and algebra. One particularly important
family of symmetric functions central to the PI's research program is the family
of Macdonald polynomials. These are symmetric functions in a set of variables
{x1,...,xn} which depend on two additional parameters q,t and also on an integer
partition. Macdonald polynomials have found many significant applications to
date, but there are also several captivating open problems associated with them,
particularly with their combinatorial properties. They are closely related to
the space of diagonal harmonics, an important topic in algebraic combinatorics
and algebraic geometry.

Symmetric functions are becoming increasingly important as tools for researchers
in mathematics and mathematical physics. Through the work of Haiman, Cherednik
and many others, Macdonald polynomials and diagonal harmonics are linked to
mainstream topics such as the Hilbert Scheme from algebraic geometry and the
double affine Hecke algebra. New developments in the combinatorics of Macdonald
polynomials and other symmetric functions, and related objects such as the
Hilbert series of diagonal harmonics, are potentially applicable to many areas
of mathematics and science. The explicit and concrete nature of recent
combinatorial advances in Macdonald polynomials and the space of diagonal
harmonics makes these subjects accessible to a broad range of researchers and
students. Thus problems with connections to advanced theoretical mathematics can
be attacked using techniques from more concrete and accessible areas such as
bijective combinatorics. The PI currently has three Ph. D. students, and
maintains collaborations with faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions.
