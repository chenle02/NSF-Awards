In this NSF Young Investigator Award in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Gruebele will use ultrafast laser techniques and high
resolution sources to study the dynamics of complex chemical reactions. Specific
goals of the research are the study of pathway-selective ion-molecule reactions,
a better understanding of energy relaxation to allow reaction control in large
molecules, and a better understanding of the dynamics of biopolymers. %%% The
results of this research project will aid scientist who are attempting to direct
the pathways which can be taken by chemical reactions by allowing a better
understanding of what drives chemical reactions. Another result is a better
understanding of how biological molecules such as proteins fold into their
unique molecular configurations. Such an understanding has a variety of
applications, including the ability to tailor medicines for specific tasks.
