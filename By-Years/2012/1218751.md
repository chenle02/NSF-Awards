Broadcast is an important operation in ad hoc networks, especially in
distributed multi-hop multichannel networks. Although the broadcasting issue has
been extensively investigated in traditional single channel and multi-channel ad
hoc networks, there are unique challenges that are un-explored in the broadcast
design in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. Existing schemes can have serious
performance degradation due to the neglect of the dynamics in the spectrum
availability in cognitive radio networks. The research objective of this project
is to design, analyze, and evaluate new broadcast protocols for multi-hop
cognitive radio ad hoc networks without a common control channel. The broadcast
design is aimed at maximizing the broadcast success rate and minimizing the
average broadcast delay simultaneously. The approach is focused on exploiting
the spectrum correlations of neighboring nodes and the spectrum diversity of
different nodes in designing new channel rendezvous, scheduling, and collision
avoidance algorithms to achieve the broadcast performance goals in practical
scenarios.

This project will provide fundamental and complementary solutions to existing
cognitive radio networking research on other network operations. It will also
help generate innovative techniques to numerous applications of the cognitive
radio and dynamic spectrum access technology. This project provides an excellent
opportunity for graduate and undergraduate research students to gain valuable
educational training and research experiences. The research results will be
presented at IEEE/ACM journals and international conferences.
