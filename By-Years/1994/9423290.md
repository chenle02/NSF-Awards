This three year project will support undergraduates involved in research
projects in molecular biosciences. University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates and
Native American students from other institutions will receive support. These
students will all be part of UBRP, a large program designed to involve
undergraduates in biologically related research. Students apply to the program
designed to involve undergraduates in biologically related research. Students
apply to the program and once selected by a faculty/student committee, can
choose to work with any of 204 faculty sponsors, 65 of whom conduct research in
molecular biosciences. Once selected, students interview prospective faculty
sponsors to determine where they will work. This insures that students work on a
project that is of interest to them and fosters a productive working
relationship among the students, faculty and lab groups. In addition to the
research, students participate in lab meetings and seminars. They receive an
orientation that covers laboratory and radiation safety training, animal care
and use, and research ethics. In addition, the program sponsors optional field
trips, lab tours, and social events. All students receive a monthly newsletter.
There is an annual conference at which students present their experimental
results in poster form and students who have their work accepted for
presentation at scientific conferences receive travel funds to attend.
