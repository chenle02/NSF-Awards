9314707 SARMIENTO The overall objective of this work is summed up by the second
of the two major JGOFS goals: "to develop a capability to predict on a global
scale the response of oceanic biogeochemical processes to anthropogenic
perturbations, in particular those related to climate change" (JGOFS
International Science Plan, 1990). A major focus of this work is the carbon
cycle processes that determine air-sea exchange of CO2. Achieving these goals
requires models of biogeochemical processes as well as three-dimensional ocean
general circulation models (OGCM's) of physical processes. The physical models
are based on the primitive equation ocean model developed by Brian, (1969). The
biogeochemical model development effort is divided into two parts. One focusses
on the development of ecosystem models of the euphotic zone. To improve our
understanding of the processes that control the surface nutrient content and how
this is related to the carbon balance. The second effort focusses on transport
of organic matter out of the euphotic zone as dissolved organic matter and
particles, and remineralization of this in the deep ocean.
