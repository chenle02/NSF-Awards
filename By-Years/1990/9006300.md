This project concerns the design and analysis of parallel algorithms on extended
models of parallel computers. Abstract machines that accurately reflect
architectural and operating system mechanisms of parallel computers need to be
developed, and their impact on the design and the performance of parallel
algorithms analyzed. Features to be modeled include hierarchical storage
structures, parallel I/O subsystem organizations, and synchronization
mechanisms. An appropriate paradigm addressing these issues is based on using
partitioning algorithms with coarse-grained parallelism. This paradigm
distinguishes between algorithmic and architecture related overheads, is
amenable to quantitative analysis, and provides a framework for scaling
solutions to fine-grained systems, as well as across models from shared-memory
to loosely-coupled, distributed- memory systems. The project involves a
systematic investigation of the paradigm, by appropriate modeling of parallel
architectures, parallel algorithm design and analysis on these extended models,
and validation on actual and simulated parallel machines.
