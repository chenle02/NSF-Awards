Biological recycling of phosphorus (P) in surficial organic horizons has been
suggested as an important mechanism maintaining soil P availability in some
tropical forests. A similar mechanism has been proposed for some temperate
forests, but no direct evidence has been gathered with respect to this surmise.
More recent studies suggest that high densities of microorganisms in tropical
forest floors may actually inhibit plant uptake, and that P might be
particularly susceptible to leaching in organic form. Preliminary investigations
at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in North Carolina have shown strong
geochemical P adsorption in all mineral soil horizons and the importance of
microbial immobilization in the forest floor, suggesting that forest floor
organic matter also inhibits geochemical adsorption. Collectively, these data
strongly suggest that tight biological control of P cycling in the forest may
contribute significantly in maintaining long-term P availability in these
southern Appalachian forests. Research sponsored by a two-year postdoctoral
fellowship award will allow tests of the "biological control" hypothesis by
means of a series of laboratory and field radiotracer experiments. Specific
objectives are to determine the relative importance of microbial immobilization,
plant/mycorrhizal uptake, and mineral adsorption in controlling P dynamics in
forest floor and mineral horizons of a temperate deciduous forest soil, and to
examine vertical movement of organic and inorganic P. The Fellow's host
institution for the study is Duke University.
