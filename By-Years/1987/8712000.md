The proposal requests funds to purchase a DNA synthesizer and printer,
spectrophotometer, and fraction collector. The instrumentation will be located
in a university-wide service laboratory that will operate on a fee basis and
will give focus to research in molecular biology/biotechnology. The
instrumentation will be of particular benefit to researchers working on the
expression of genes during sea urchin embryonic development and the role of the
gene products in the developmental processes, measurement of changes of nuclear
DNA in evolution, erythropoietic system, the role of a transposable ement during
evolution of Hawaiian Drosophila, structure/function aspects of proteins and
their genes, molecular biology of development of higher plants and fungi, genome
organization and DNA sequence evolution, and role of toxins produced by plant
pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of their host plants. The need for the
instrumentation is critical, and the quality of research warrants support.
