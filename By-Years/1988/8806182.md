This research is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The research involves the development of enzymes as synthetic tools
which can lead to highly controlled processes of considerable economic impact.
Dr. Wong's prior work has been very fruitful and well received. The selective
functionalization of hydrocarbons at inactivated carbon centers is one of the
most challenging and technologically important problems in chemistry.
Development of such reactions will open new opportunities for the production of
high-value chemicals and pharmaceuticals and for the treatment of toxic waste
byproducts. Many metalloenzymes are capable of catalyzing such transformations.
This research will focus on two iron-containing monooxygenases capable of
activating molecular oxygen to hydroxylate inactivated C-H bonds: one is methane
monooxygenase; the other is isopenicillin N cyclase. Methane monooxygenase will
be used for preparation of chiral alcohols, epoxides, and sulfoxides from meso
precursors. Isopenicillin N cyclase will be used for preparation of novel
peptide antibiotics; the peptide substrates for the enzyme will be prepared via
amidase-damaged protease and lipase catalyzed reactions. New stereochemical and
radical probes more strained than methylcyclopropane will be prepared and used
to investigate possible radical mechanisms of the C-H activation.
