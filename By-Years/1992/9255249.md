The Geological Society of America will convene a Wingspread Conference to
address key infra-structure issues whixh currently limit the effectiveness of
earth science education. The fifty participants will include elementary and
secondary school science teachers, school counsellors, LEA administrators, state
science supervisors, college professors and college administrators. Conference
participants will be charged with pulling together state or regional teams to
address action items identified at the conference. These teams will develop
specific recommendations for earth science education reform which will be the
focus of a second conference funded by non-NSF sources. The conference will be
held at the Johnson Foundation Wingspread Conference Center, January 15-19,
