Norman Dr. Richard W. Taylor and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Oklahoma are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Students from the central and midwest regions of the United States
are offered a research experience designed to play a pivotal role in leading
them to pursue a career in chemical research.
