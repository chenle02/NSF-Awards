The purpose of the research is to assess the regional impact of chronic
nitrogen additions to spruce-fir forests in the northeastern U.S. on net nitrous
oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes. The approaches to be used include
intensive sampling of gas fluxes in a series of previously studied spruce-fir
forests covering the region between eastern Maine and eastern New York, and from
an experimental site in Southern Vermont where chronic N additions are being
made to a red spruce stand. Both remote sensing and Geographic Information
System (GIS) methods will be used to extrapolate measurements to regional
totals, and an evaluation will be made of the effectiveness of these two
approaches. Specific activities include: 1) intensive measurements of net N2O
and CH4 flues between the atmosphere and soils in five areas within the spruce-
fir forest type with documented differences in nitrogen economies, 2) collection
of foliar samples from each site for determination of total canopy lignin,
nitrogen and cellulose content, 3) remote sensing of canopy chemistry using
broad-band (TM) and high spectral resolution (FLI, AVIRIS) sensors, and 4) the
use of both remote sensing data, and extensive ground surveys of nitrification
rates extrapolated through the use of a geographic information system, to
estimate of net N2O and CH4 fluxes for the spruce-fir zone. The project is
jointly funded by NSF and NASA. The investigators are well qualified for this
type of research and the facilities and institutional support for the project
are excellent.
