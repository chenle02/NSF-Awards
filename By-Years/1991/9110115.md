This research will explore the role of the context provided by one sentence in
recognition of the words in the following sentence during silent reading. The
experiments will investigate specific characteristics of the preceeding sentence
context that might influence the recognition of individual words during reading.
Skilled adult readers will read simple sentences presented on a computer screen,
and their eye movements will be recorded as they read. The research will use
information from their eye movements and the time they take to name each word to
determine the influence of the context in which a word occurs on the
identification of that word. The purpose of the research is to develop a more
complete model of how words are identified during skilled reading and to further
our understanding of the reading process in general. By understanding skilled
reading, we will be better equipped to evaluate reading disability, to assist
dyslexic and disabled readers trying to cope with their reading problems, and to
design methods of reading instruction and remediation.
