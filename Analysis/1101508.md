The proposed research is directed to developing relations between commutative
algebras appearing in several fields: the algebra of Hamiltonians of a quantum
integrable system, the algebra of functions on an intersection of Schubert
varieties in a flag variety, the quantum cohomology algebra of a flag variety,
the chiral ring of an N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, the local algebra of a
critical point in singularity theory. All those algebras are related to the ring
of functions on the critical set of the master function (or superpotential)
associated with a given situation. Developing these relations will be important
and useful for each of the fields and will enrich their interaction.

Multidimensional hypergeometric integrals and their semiclassical limits, Bethe
eigenfunctions and eigenvectors appear as solutions to differential and
difference equations in quantum integrable systems, representation theory,
algebraic geometry, gauge theory, statistical mechanics. The equations and
solutions have rich mathematical structures. The multidimensional hypergeometric
integrals provide a way to transform the objects and structures of those
theories to objects and structures of geometry and analysis of master functions
and weight functions associated with the integrals. The goal of the proposal is
to develop this analysis and geometry with applications to the above theories.
That will lead to better understanding of interrelations of those theories as
well as to establishing new connections among them. The PI has incorporated
results of his prior research into graduate courses and expects to do the same
again. His graduate students and students from neighboring universities will
also be involved in the research.
