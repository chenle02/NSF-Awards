The College of William and Mary will provide research opportunities for ten
undergraduates in research groups in atomic and molecular physics, condensed
matter physics, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, and plasma
physics. There will also be opportunities for collaboration with the School of
Marine Science and the NASA-Langley Research Center. There will be a special
emphasis on involving neighboring institutions. This project is supported under
the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an
adequate supply of scientists for the future.
