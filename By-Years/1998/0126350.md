This project would develop an assessment framework and performance assessment
practices after an analysis of frameworks from many countries for the purpose of
assessing Information Communication Technology (ICT) as it is used in elementary
and secondary schools. The project would identify issues of large-scale
implementation of performance assessments in information technology and develop
performance assessment scenarios and specifications. Moreover, the project would
develop performance assessment tasks and test them in 4 countries and develop
administrative and training manuals. The results of this project would be used
in an international studies called the Second International Technology in
Education Study (SITES) sponsored
