This action funds Patricia Clayton of University of Washington to conduct a
research project, entitled "Steel walls for reducing building damage during
earthquakes," during the summer of 2012 at the National Center for Research in
Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. K.C.
Tsai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is
experimental testing of an innovative steel wall structural system that is
designed to recenter itself following an earthquake and remain essentially
damage-free, thus greatly reducing the repair costs and downtime in buildings.
This research is the first full-scale test of this new wall concept and promises
to verify its capability of achieving this improved seismic performance. The
experiments consist of subjecting the wall to forces and displacements that a
building would experience during different levels of earthquake intensity and
recording how the wall responds to these demands. r This research may also
result in the development of structural design concepts that can greatly reduce
the economic and social impact of earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
