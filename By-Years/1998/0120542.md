The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education initiated the Albert
Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program in 1990. This program
provides outstanding secondary mathematics and science teachers with an
opportunity to serve in the national public policy arena. NSF funding will
support an Einstein Fellow in the Informal Science Education (ISE) program. The
Fellow will bring practical insight derived from being a classroom teacher to
ISE and contribute to the program development and management. The ISE program
supports large regional and national projects targeting informal learners that
include linkages to formal education. The Einstein Fellow can contribute
feasible suggestions on how those linkages can occur, while learning about the
proposal development, submission, peer review and award process. The 11-month
experience will enable the educator to learn about the field of informal science
education from a national perspective through direct interaction with
practitioners and participation in professional development. Collegial exchange
occurs monthly as Fellows serving in other Federal agencies meet to discuss
their experiences. Additionally, participants are required to submit three
written reports to document their experiences.
