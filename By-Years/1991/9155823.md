An Introductory Physics Laboratory Course at Rutgers-Newark is being developed
using micro computer based instrumentation to improve the understanding and
appreciation of the laws of physics and of the instrumentation and methods of
modern physics and technology. The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark student body and
the geography and demographics of the Newark area, coupled with significant
outreach efforts, ensures a large minority student participation in this
project. Teaching and teaming strategies geared to the needs of this diverse
urban student population are being developed. Said strategies utilize non-
intimidating but rigorous discovery based experiments and provide a meaningful
and accurate introduction to the excitement and creativity of scientific
discovery and analysis. The course uses modern sensors for motion, force,
temperature, sound and electromagnetic field measurements. The sensors are being
interfaced to Macintosh microcomputers allowing the students to analyze their
measurements rapidly and to explore alternative physical hypotheses. The project
attract more students into physics and engineering, and produces better educated
students with critical analytical skills in all majors. The program is being
adapted, for and shared with high school teachers and their students as well as
two-year college faculty and students.
