The regulation of initiation of chromosome replication in Bacillus subtilis will
be investigated . It still is not yet well understood. The mechanism likely
involves a multi- component structure inbedded in the cellular membrane which
consists of specific DNA fragments and proteins. As for the protein components,
the structure and function of the proteins encoded by the dnaB operon genes will
be worked out. The function of the dnaB protein is essential for the replication
initiation of the chromosome. The gene and its flanking regions have been cloned
and sequenced. The dnaB gene turned out to be the first gene of an operon which
consists of three or four genes, dnaB, Y-,Z-and possibly genes. Specific
antisera against the first three have been prepared and will be used to isolate
proteins encoded by the genes of the dnaB operon. Antibodies will be also used
for the studies of the in vitro initiation. Attempts will be made to isolate
mutants of the Y- and Z-genes. With regard to the DNA fragments involved in the
replication initiation, we will study the nature of the two types of membrane
binding of the replication origin areas of the B. subtilis chromosome and a
plasmid pUB110. The type-I membrane binding is salt-resistant and dependent on
the dnaB+ gene function, whereas type-II binding is salt-sensitive and
independent of the dnaB+ gene function. It is believed that type I binding is
essential for biochemical processes of initiation and type.II binding is
important for pUB110 and the chromosomal original to be bound to a structure on
the membrane that is essential for both initiation of replication and the
partition of daughter chromosomes. The type -I binding site seems to be located
at or near the origin of replication both in the B. subtilis chromosome and
pUB110. Type-II binding is found in four areas of the pUB110 molecule and in two
areas near the purA16 locus that is located within 20.50 kb from the replication
origin of the B.subtilis chromosome. The properties and functional significance
of these bindings will be analayzed further.
