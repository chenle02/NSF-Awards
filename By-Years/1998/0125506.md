Zhang&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0125506&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viscosity of hydrous silicate
melts plays a critical role in bubble growth, magma fragmentation and volcanic
eruptions. This proposal requests funding to develop a new and long-term project
for viscosity measurement using a novel technique developed over the years in my
lab. It is based on the equivalence between glass transition temperature and the
apparent equilibrium temperature of the hydrous species reaction in silicate
melt. In order to obtain viscosity using this method, the equilibrium of the
hydrous species reaction must also be characterized. Such data are important in
their own right in understanding melt structure, water solubility and diffusion
in magma, and D/H fractionation between water vapor and melt. In the three years
of the grant period, we will concentrate on the following: a) speciation and
viscosity at high pressures for hydrous rhyolitic melt up to 8 GPa; b)
speciation equilibrium in hydrous dacitic melts and the viscosity of such melts
to high dissolved H2O content (up to 8 wt% dissolved H2O); and c) development of
more accurate viscosity models for hydrous rhyolitic and dacitic melts. The new
viscosity model will be applied to re-evaluate previous results of bubble growth
and magma fragmentation.&lt;br/&gt;
