9406891 Schore The focus of this research is to investigate metal-catalyzed
coupling of dissimilar terminal alkynes and metal-catalyzed
cocyclotrimerizations using polymer-linked substrates. The study of polymer-
derived chemoselectivity control in polar and pericyclic reactions and the
application of polymer methodology to free radical organic reactions will also
be undertaken. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Neil E. Schore and Dr. Mark J. Kurth of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Califrnia, Davis. The two
investigators will focus their work on developing methodologies to prepare and
evaluate reactive polymer systems for use in organic synthesis.
