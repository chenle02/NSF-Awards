This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will continue research involving algebraic geometry and certain fully
nonlinear PDEs with the hope of solving the conjecture on the universal bound of
the degree of Fano varieties and the Calabi conjecture on the existence of
Kahler-Einstein metrics of positive scalar curvature. The National Science
Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This
award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional
growth as a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher
and academic leader.
