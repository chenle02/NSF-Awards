Indiana University is offering a three year program on mathematical modeling
for 90 high school mathematics teachers (30 each year). Each year's program
includes a four week summer institute with focus both on developing basic ideas
and tools for mathematical modeling and their use in various modeling projects,
and also on developing classroom implementation plans and materials. Six
teachers from a Summer 1991 pilot project will serve as participant-leaders and
mentors in the first institute; teachers from each of the summer institutes will
similarly serve in the subsequent institute. Follow-up activities include staff
site visits and two follow-up meetings each year. Cost sharing equivalent to
approximately 24% of the award is provided by the university and schools.
