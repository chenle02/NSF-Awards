The project deals with the study of the intermetallic nickel aluminides (Ni3Al)
as binders for cemented carbides. Traditionally cobalt is used as a binder for
tungsten carbide and nickel-iron for titanium carbide materials. These materials
are used for tools and dies in manufacturing. Nickel aluminides can increase the
high temperature (850oC) yield strength of these materials. Also, the abundant
resources for nickel and aluminum can be a good replacement for cobalt which is
scarce and strategically important. The main objectives of this project are the
following: effect of alloying additions on the properties of the new carbides;
comparison of new cemented carbides with existing carbides; and, machining
performance of tools made of these carbides in continuous and interrupted
cutting.
