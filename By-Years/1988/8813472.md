Although the development and reproduction of crustaceans are known to be
hormonally regulated, the identities and roles of the hormones involved are
poorly understood. This research project will study methyl farnesoate, a newly
discovered crustacean compound that is chemically similar to juvenile hormone
that is present in insects. Since juvenile hormone regulates many important
aspects of insect development and reproduction, it seems likely that methyl
farnesoate has equally potent effects on crustaceans. Information about the
roles of methyl farnesoate should increase our understanding of crustacean
physiology, information that may be of considerable utility in the aquaculture
of economically important crustacean species, such as lobsters, shrimp, crabs
and crawfish.
