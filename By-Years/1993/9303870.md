9303870 Jelinski The goals of this project are to delineate the molecular and
processing mechanisms that underlie the exceptional mechanical properties of
spider dragline silk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of intact spiders and
solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of oriented fibers, will be used as
the primary tools. Parallel mechanical measurements will be performed. The
experiments proposed here will provide considerable new, molecular-level
information about the structure, processing, and dynamics of this model
biomaterial. It is likely that these results will contribute greatly to our
ability to genetically engineer robust materials with designed properties. The
MRI experiments, which will be performed as silk is being spooled from the
intact spider, will test hypotheses concerning silk processing. Of special
interest is the dehydration mechanism by which the silk biopolymer goes from an
isotropic liquid in the silk gland to a highly oriented fiber as it exists the
spinnerete. Direct NMR observation of dissected silk glands will also be
performed. The solid state deuterium NMR experiments, to be performed on
oriented, deuterium-labelled silk fibers, will specify the angles that specific
amino acid sidechains make with respect to the fiber axis. The deuterium
experiments will test hypotheses concerning (i) the role of water in the
supercontraction phenomenon, (ii) the role of alanine residues in the elasticity
of silk and (iii) the dynamic environment of glycine in the crystalline and
amorphous regions. %%% In several instances Nature has conspired to produce
biopolymers with superior materials properties. One example is spider dragline
silk, which is stronger per cross-sectional area than steel. The goal is to
understand the origins of these superior properties, so that someday it might be
possible to produce "designer" materials based on insights gleaned from Nature.
