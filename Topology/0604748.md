The PI proposes to develop new techniques and apply existing methods in gauge
theory, pseudo-holomorphic curve theory and equivariant stable homotopy theory
to gain some fundamental understanding of the general shape of closed symplectic
manifolds. Four avenues of investigation are addressed. 1) The PI, joint with M.
Furuta, is developing a comprehensive treatment of a refined invariant
associated with a proper non-linear Fredholm map, which involves a twisted
Pontrjagin-Thom construction. 2) Such a construction applied to the Seiberg-
Witten map turns out to be particular useful in the classification of symplectic
4--manifolds with torsion symplectic canonical classes. The PI has made progress
bounding their Betti numbers and is hoping to fully determine their
homoeomorphism types. 3) The PI searches for a simple characterization of the
symplectic cone of a K\"ahler surface. The case of geometric genus 0 has been
completely settled by the PI and A. Liu. Joint with M. Usher, promising progress
in the case of positive geometric genus has been made, and more is expected by
exploring the somewhat surprising interplay between symplectic forms and
embedded symplectic surfaces with negative self-intersections. 4) Joint mainly
with Y. Ruan, the PI is investigating the properties of uniruled symplectic
manifolds in dimension 6 and above, using relative invariants, their gluing
formula, and localization techniques. We also search for the criterion such that
symplectic blow-downs can be performed in dimension 6. This project belongs to
the relatively new and increasingly important subject the PI has pursued a
successful line of research. The proposed activity raises several fundamental
questions in this field and lays out plans to answer them. It also creates
original concepts in this field and reveals connections with other fields. This
proposed activity will advance knowledge in symplectic topology as well as other
areas including differential topology, mathematical physics and algebraic
geometry.

An n manifold is a space that locally looks like the Euclidean space of
dimension n. For example, the space-time universe we live in is a 4--manifold. A
symplectic structure is a very basic structure that underlies almost all the
equations of classical and quantum physics. A manifold equipped with a
symplectic structure is called a symplectic manifold. Studies of symplectic
manifolds, such as proposed here, will thus enhance our understandings of
mathematics, physics, and science in general.
