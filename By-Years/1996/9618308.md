9618308 McGee the sphere of research includes the development of accurate
continuum methods for vibration and stability of prestressed skewed and twisted
bodies. Three areas of structural mechanics are examined, which include: (1) the
effect of corner stress singularities on the vibration and buckling of sectorial
and skewed quadrilateral planforms of general shapes, (2) the vibration and
buckling of skewed and twisted 3-D bodies having mixed combinations of clamped
and free edge conditions, and (3) the vibration of skewed by path-dependent
centrifugal body forces.
