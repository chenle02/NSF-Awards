There are two main topics of research in this proposal, first,
the&lt;br/&gt;large time behaviour and scattering theory of nonlinear
Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;waves off a potential term which supports many bound
states. This leads&lt;br/&gt;to the analysis of multichannel nonlinear
scattering and metastability&lt;br/&gt;of hamiltonian dispersive equations. The
second topic involves the study of&lt;br/&gt;radiation damping for metastable
mutltibreather solutions of the wave&lt;br/&gt;equation. The large time
behaviour of the linearized wave equation around&lt;br/&gt;multibreather
solutions is analyzed; a theory to estimate the lifetimes&lt;br/&gt;of perturbed
multibreather solutions is developed and applications&lt;br/&gt;to nonlinear
optics, in particular optical guides with non-uniform
diffraction&lt;br/&gt;profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of optical devices
and fibers in today's communication systems&lt;br/&gt;motivates some of the
problems studied in this proposal. In particular&lt;br/&gt;we concentrate on the
problem of effects of defects and other irregularities&lt;br/&gt;in optical
fibers on their transport properties. We also analyze some&lt;br/&gt;novel
optical devices made by modifying the medium in a way to
achieve&lt;br/&gt;better filtering of noise and interchannel
interference.&lt;br/&gt;
