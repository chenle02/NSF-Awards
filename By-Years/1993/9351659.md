This project is developing a program at the institution to improve laboratory
instruction in plant biology. Improvements focus on shifting the emphasis from
demonstration based lab exercises to experimentation. Specific introductory
courses involve General Botany and General Biology which are designed for majors
and non-majors, respectively. Proposed changes in the upper division course,
Plant Physiology, have also strengthened the laboratory component by emphasizing
the integration of cellular, leaf and whole plant processes and by incorporating
a research component, including writing, into the existing laboratory structure.
In addition, the project is expected to expand existing opportunities for
collaborative research between faculty and students and to increase interest in
independent research.
