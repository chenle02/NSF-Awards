When a tadpole metamorphoses into frog extensive remodelling of the skull
occurs. Some of the greatest changes occur in the palatal region, in association
with the transformation of the small, terminal mouth opening of the tadpole into
the wide gape of the frog. This study will attempt to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of this remarkable transformation by describing variability
in the metamorphic pattern among frogs, and by comparing them with salamanders
and caecilians, which have much less extensive remodelling during metamorphosis.
In addition, experimental work on the causal (inductive) relations between
palatal structures will serve to further test any proposed evolutionary
scenario, by allowing more rigorous determination of which structures are truly
comparable between these groups.
