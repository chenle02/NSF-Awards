The Carnap-Quine debate in the first half of this century addressed nothing
less than the very foundations of scientific truth. The central issue concerns
the differing bases for asserting the truth of analytic versus synthetic
statements in science. "Analytic" statements are those which are true a priori
while "synthetic" statements are contingent and based on empirical evidence.
Rudolf Carnap (1891-1970) argued that the axioms of arithmetic, logic and other
bodies of a priori doctrine can be construed as implicit definitions of the
terms they contain. Thus, in order to be justified in believing such axioms, we
need only understand the meanings of the terms; no appeal to intuition is
required. Because these claims and those which follow from them could become
known through an analysis of meaning, Carnap called such claims analytic; all
others were called synthetic. Around these central notions of meaning and
analyticity, Carnap built a systematic theory of knowledge and that an approach
to most of the other major problems of philosophy of science. This approach was
the foundation of "logical positivism." W. V. O. Quine (1908- ) challenged this
theory beginning in 1934. He went to the very foundations of logical positivism
by rejecting outright any distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. He
went on to develop an epistemology to replace Carnap's without retreating to a
reliance on intuition, but instead justified the body of our beliefs as a whole
based on the outcome of suitable processes of revision operating on antecedent
totalities of belief. This debate between Carnap and Quine is one of the central
episodes in the development of contemporary philosophy of science. Dr. Creath,
under this grant, will examine this debate using a massive amount of documentary
evidence which has only just recently become available. His purpose is to show
that the debate is not merely of parochial semantic interest but concerns
fundamental strategies in the theory of knowledge of central importance for our
understanding of the nature of science. The project will contribute both to our
historical understanding of philosophy of science and advance our systematic
treatment of ongoing issues as well.
