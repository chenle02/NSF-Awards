This comprehensive ITEST project would provide sixty middle and high school
teachers with an introduction to Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global
Positioning System (GPS) technologies. The project, which brings together a
leadership team of educators, science researchers and experts in resource
management, is based at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental
Science Appalachian Laboratory, a research facility that studies stream and
forest ecosystems. The program will focus on environmental applications in which
teachers use probes to investigate the properties of local forest and stream
ecosystems. Teachers will apply their technology experiences to creating
standards based lessons aligned with local curricula. The teacher participants
will be recruited from rural, underserved Appalachian communities in western
Maryland and northern West Virginia. Local students will be recruited to
participate in a four-day summer session that includes field-testing the
proposed lessons and learning about career opportunities in information
technology
