The principal investigators will study three problems in symbolic dynamics
pertaining to topological classification and automorphisms of subshifts of
finite type: (i) characterize strong shift equivalence for subsemirings of the
nonnegative rational numbers, (ii) develop tools to understand the Williams
conjecture over the nonnegative real numbers, and (iii) determine whether given
permutations of the fixed points of a subshift are induced by an automorphism.
This award will support research in a branch of ergodic theory called symbolic
dynamics. A symbolic dynamical system is a collection of two way infinite
strings of symbols from a finite alphabet with a rule of formation which
specifies which symbols can follow one another. A central theme in this area is
the classification of such systems with respect to various forms of equivalence.
Symbolic dynamical systems have recently found application in the modelling of
data transmission.
