Using measurements of cosmogenic 35S and 7Be in aerosols and precipitation
collections and gas (35SO2), the PIs plan to 1determine, on a monthly timescale,
the following properties of 35S as a function of time: (1) the rate of 35SO2
oxidation, (2) the fraction of 35SO4 in wet deposition originating from in-cloud
oxidation, (3) the mean residence time of 35SO4 aerosol and (4) the "dry"
deposition flux of 35SO2. The concentrations of the two nuclides in the various
components measured and the wet precipitation fluxes of each (combined with the
effective production ratio) provides a complete analysis of the fate of 35SO2 in
the atmosphere). The PIs intend to make measurements on a monthly basis to
define the seasonal variations in the parameters controlling the removal of
35SO2 from the atmosphere. The PIs desire to show that 35S and stable S are
homogenized in the boundary layer box on a monthly timescale, in which case the
results obtained from 35S are directly applicable to ordinary gaseous SO2 and a
complete evaluation of the atmospheric SO2 system as a function of locale and
season will be obtained.
