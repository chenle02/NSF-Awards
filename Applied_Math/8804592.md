This research is concerned with an interdisciplinary team studying
multidimensional, time dependent problems arising from plastic deformation of
materials, especially granular materials and porous metals. The goals of the
project are to develop a detailed numerical simulation of the flow of granular
material in an industrial or agricultural silo and of the flow of metal in a
forming process and to verify the numerical predications by appropriate
experiments. Technologically, progress on these problems should lead to safer
and more reliable industrial silos and to greater efficiency in metal forming
processes. Scientifically, these problems involve several interesting
mathematical issues; ill-posed partial differential equations, homogenization of
media with microstructure, and large scientific computations.
