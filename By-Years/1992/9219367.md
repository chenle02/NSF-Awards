This research is to continue study of the long-period seismic response of
several idealized isotropic and anisotropic earth models to determine the
observable aspects of anisotropy in the earth's upper mantle. The initial
calculations suggest that upper-mantle azimuthal anisotropy of a few percent,
spatially coherent over the length scale of a typical ocean basin, is sufficient
to generate significant waveform anomalies in long- period surface waves. In
this research the theory will be extended and tests will be done for different
types of anisotropy in the upper mantle.
