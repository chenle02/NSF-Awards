The research objectives involve extending the regression quantile methodology
and developing new asymptotic approaches to cases of large parametric dimension.
Methodological aims include the following: (a) to develop adaptive estimators in
the linear regression model which are fully efficient under any assumption on
the error distribution, (b) to define and investigate outlier detection
prodedures and to apply them for providing resistance to the presence of
outliers and influential observations, (c) to investigate the performance of the
regression quantile algorithm, and (d) to obtain robust analyses for nonlinear
regression models and for structural models in econometrics. Aims for new
asymptotic approaches include the following: (a) to obtain appropriate
asymptotic results for the regression quantile methodology in linear models, (b)
to study standard and robust methods for analyzing structural models, and (c) to
investigate the adequancy of such asymptotic approximations for real and
simulated data sets. This research in the field of statistics is to develop and
analyze robust econometric procedures. Robust statistical methods are procedures
that work well even when applied to situations where the underlying assumptions
in the mathematics are unrealistic and do not hold. Since mathematical models of
the economy are approximations of very complex systems for which the true
underlying mathematical representation may well be unknown, and since data
brings measurement error and other uncertainty with its very creation, it is
advantageous to have statistical techniques that are known to perform well under
adverse conditions.
