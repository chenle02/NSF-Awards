A computational design tool will be developed which will allow for optimal
tolerance allocation for mechanical and electrical components. The basic
approach is to couple a nontraditional optimization method with a Monte Carlo
based tolerance analysis code. The ability to allocate tolerances in an optimal
fashion will allow an installed capital base to be utilized in the most
productive fashion. A successful application of the technique will have a
dramatic impact on reducing manufacturing cost and product cycle times as well
as increasing productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. Current tolerance
analysis used in industry does not provide the ability to allocate tolerances in
an optimal fashion. Traditional nonlinear programming methods are not robust
enough to solve the complex problem resulting from the consideration of a "real"
component or assembly. The combination of the genetic algorithm with a tolerance
analysis package offers an attractive alternative which will run efficiently on
a parallel or distributed computing network. Initial consideration will be
placed on discrete tolerance limit optimization. The applicability to modifying
nominal dimensions and assembly sequence will also be investigated.
