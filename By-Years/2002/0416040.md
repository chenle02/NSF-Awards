With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Carol Bessel of Villanova University is investigating the catalytic growth of
highly structured, crystalline carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The project aims to
correlate the structure and physical p roperties of Cu, Fe and Ni based-
catalysts used in forming CNFs with the carbon structures (e.g, platelet versus
ribbon) produced. X-ray and electron microscope techniques are being used to
characterize prepared catalyst. Additionally, the composition of Fe and FeNi
catalyst is being explored with 57-Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy through
collaboration with the Department of Physics at Villanova University. The
project is providing fundamental understanding of catalyst systems needed to
prepare CNFs with tailored properties. Application of the carbon materials as a
support material for metal catalysts is also being investigated.

The physical and chemical methods being applied to study the properties and
growth mechanisms of carbon nanofibers are enabling new insights into factors
that affect structure and reactivity in nanometer-scale materials that have
application in areas such as catalysis, medicine, sensing and fuel cell systems.
This undergraduate research project is also integrating nanotechnology into
classroom activities to enhance and broaden interest in science.
