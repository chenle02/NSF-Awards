This project will expand the 33-year long Hydrostation S time-series station in
the Sargasso Sea to respond to the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS). The deep-
water station 75 km off Bermuda in 4500m water will comprise an Atlantic
analogue to the proposed GOFS station in the Pacific Ocean north of the island
of Oahu (Station ALOHA). Monthly visits to this station will be made over an
initial 5 year period to bein a comprehensive study of the distribution,
production and flux of biogenic particulate material in the oligotrophic ocean.
The scientific objectives are: 1) to observe and interpret the seasonal and
interannual variability in the biology and chemistry of the mixed layer and the
euphotic zone, (2) to observe and interpret the seasonal and interannual
variability in the rates of particulate flux and apparent rates of particle
remineralization over the entire water column and, (3) to understand the
interrelationships between the processes mentioned in (1) and (20 above and
thphysical charecteristics of the water column. The collected data obtained at
this time-series station will also be used to provide a logistical and data
framework for the GOFS level-2 and level-3 studies at the Bermuda Biological
Station for Researh, Inc.
