Silicon carbide has long received interest as a candidate for high temperature,
radiation tolerant semiconductor devices. Transistors and optoelectronic
components have been successfully fabricated, demonstrating the potential of the
material. A barrier to the widespread use of this promising material has been
the problem of fabricating good quality single crystal films. Previous research
using chemical vapor deposition methods have not been successful in eliminating
major defects on inexpensive silicon substrates. A new method of fabrication is
described which is based on the technique of ion beam sythesis. Novel treatments
are proposed in order to provide single crystal, epitaxial growth on a silicon
substrate.
