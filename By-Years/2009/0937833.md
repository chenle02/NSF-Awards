Data provenance documents the inputs, entities, systems, and processes that
influence data of interest---in effect providing a historical record of the data
and its origins. The generated evidence supports essential forensic activities
such as data-dependency analysis, error/ compromise detection and recovery, and
auditing and compliance analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
project is focused on theory and systems supporting practical end-to-end
provenance in high-end computing systems. Here, systems are investigated where
provenance authorities accept host- level provenance data from validated
provenance monitors, to assemble a trustworthy provenance record. Provenance
monitors externally observe systems or applications and securely record the
evolution of data they manipulate. The provenance record is shared across the
distributed environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In support of this vision, tools
and systems are explored that identify policy (what provenance data to record),
trusted authorities (which entities may assert provenance information), and
infrastructure (where to record provenance data). Moreover, the provenance has
the potential to hurt system performance: collecting too much provenance
information or doing so in an inefficient or invasive way can introduce
unacceptable overheads. In response, the project is further focused on ways to
understand and reduce the costs of provenance collection. &lt;br/&gt;
