Although it is customary for geometry and topology to benefit from the
application of algebraic methods, it is increasingly true that ideas find
application in the other direction as well. Professor Cohen is one of a growing
cohort of mathematicians investigating group theory with much of the inspiration
derived from geometry and topology. He will continue work on the dynamics of
free group automorphisms, with questions concerning the fixed subgroup as one of
the intended realms of application. In addition, the question of whether a
certain "Teichmuller space" for the outer automorphism group is simply connected
at infinity will be investigated. Finally (with lowest priority) a question
about free products modulo a single relator will be studied.
