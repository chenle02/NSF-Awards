9509562 Liu The proposed project involves the development of an engineering
system of Artificial Upwelling and MIXing (AUMIX) which can draw nutrient-rich
deep ocean water (DOW) to the ocean surface as a precursor to commercially-
viable, open-ocean mariculture. This project will be accomplished in two phases.
The first phase, presently being conducted with NSF support, involves the
development of a wave-driven artificial upwelling device which brings nutrient-
rich deep ocean water to the surface in a cost effective manner. Physical and
mathematical models of the device have been developed and tested. Results of the
Phase I research indicated that a single device with a buoy of 4.0 m in diameter
with a tail pipe of 300 m in length and 1.2 m in diameter, can generate an
upwelling flow of 0.95 m3/sec in random Hawaiian waves. The second phase, as now
proposed, will investigate the discharge of the artificially upwelled DOW and
its subsequent mixing in open ocean. The objective is to establish a nutrient-
rich plume that can support an open ocean mariculture. To achieve this
objective, the mixing must be controlled such that the dilution is small and the
settling depth does not go below the euphotic zone. ***
