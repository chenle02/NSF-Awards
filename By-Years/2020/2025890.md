The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will be a fundamental advancement in the way people see, understand, and
work with geospatial data. The proposed research will commercialize immersive
analytics technology across the telecom, Internet of Things (IoT), and
transportation industries, all of which use outdated 2D mapping tools. This
technology can also improve visualization of data regarding environmental
changes, health crises, and other changing situations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project fuses augmented reality and virtual reality with artificial intelligence
to address data visualization pain points in the telecom sector. Like the
buildings they inhabit, wireless signals exist in three dimensions and are
difficult to represent through traditional 2D charts and graphs. The objective
of this research is to develop a an immersive analytics platform where users
literally step inside their geodata and manipulate it in real
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
