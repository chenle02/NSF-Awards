This effort supports various activities related to the National Center for
Education Statistics' (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
(IPEDS), to promote data comparability between agencies and improve the quality
of data. The NCES' IPEDS data will provide the National Science Foundation (NSF)
an essential portion of the statistics needed to establish comprehensive
information on undergraduate education. IPEDS collects data from all
institutions and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide
postsecondary education, including much of the information that is needed from
baccalaureate and higher institutions, and it is the only source of
comprehensive data from two-year institutions. The current proposal will allow
the Foundation to acquire detailed data for each postsecondary institution at an
early date and to participate in the design of data editing criteria.
