This grant will support an experimental investigation of transient and
localized perturbations of the lower ionosphere that occur in association with
atmospheric lightning discharges and with natural wave bursts that originate in
the magnetosphere. Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated the importance
of the lower ionosphere and the middle atmosphere in the coupling between parts
of the atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system. Lightning-induced effects
occurring in the troposphere are coupled to the ionosphere through the
mesosphere, creating impulsive ionospheric electric fields, altering ionospheric
electron density and conductivity, and launching electromagnetic whistler waves.
Energetic radiation belt particles precipitated as a result of magnetospheric
interactions whistler waves and with burst of VLF emissions are deposited into
the lower ionosphere and the mesosphere, causing secondary ionization, x- rays,
light emissions, and heating. The aim of this grant is to gain better
understanding of the processed of downward and upward coupling in the
magnetosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-troposphere system and of the effects of
these processes on the dynamics of the earth's radiation belts. The transient
perturbation events are remotely sensed by means of high resolution measurements
of the amplitude and phase of subionospheric VLF/LF radio signals, which are
sensitive to perturbations of electron density at mesospheric and D-region
altitudes. Simultaneous observations at selected locations in the United States
and Canada will be used to investigate: (i) the geographic distribution and
geomagnetic conjugate relationships of event occurrence and characteristics,
(ii) the association of VLF signal perturbation events with lightning
discharges, (iii) spatial structure of perturbed ionospheric region(s)
associated with individual lightning flashes as well as with active thunderstorm
centers, and (iv) the role of atmospheric discharges in the dynamics of the
radiation belts.
