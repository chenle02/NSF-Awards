9726861 Benoit This research will examine how ecological and social systems
influence each other through either positive or negative feedbacks. The central
hypothesis is that relative health and integrity of ecosystems causes and in
turn is caused by enhanced human performance and productivity. The current
research will use observational techniques integrated by standard statistical
methods to measure the quantifiable linkages between biophysical and social
systems. This investigation will also lay the groundwork for a field experiment
to test whether restoring a degraded watershed can significantly enhance social
interactions in associated human communities. State-of-the-art analytical
methods will be used to characterize approximately 30 subwatersheds in terms of
key hydrological, chemical, biological, economic, and social parameters. This
large number of biophysical and social measures will be integrated within a
quantitative context that allows testing of predictions and generation of an
overall index of watershed quality.
