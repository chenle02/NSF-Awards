This 18 month long project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship
Foundation, will provide a summer program in the History of Chemistry for 50
outstanding high school teachers selected from a national pool. The summer
activities will include lectures on the ancient arts of chemistry and the
evolution of the field up through the development of modern chemistry. The
laboratory and demonstration portion of the project will include the classic
experiments of chemistry. The best of the materials developed by the teachers in
the summer will be edited and published for use in the follow-up and outreach
activities the teachers will conduct during the next academic year. These
outreach activities are supported by the resources provided by the Woodrow
Wilson Fellowship Foundation. The matching funds for the summer portion of the
project amount to about 6% of the NSF grant. The matching funds for the outreach
portion of the project exceeds 300% of the NSF grant.
