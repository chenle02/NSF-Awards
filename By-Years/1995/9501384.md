This award supports research on two main topics: (1) Representations of quantum
groups and Kac-Moody Lie algebras and perverse sheaves over configuration
spaces; (2) Local structure of moduli spaces. The principal investigator will
work on a construction relating certain tensor categories arising from
q-deformations of enveloping algebras of simple Lie algebras and certain tensor
categories of a geometrical nature. He will also work on describing the
completion of the local ring at a point X in terms of the cohomology of certain
sheaves of dg Lie algebras over X naturally associated to a deformation problem.
This research is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie
algebras arise from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group
is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie
groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of sperical
motion.
