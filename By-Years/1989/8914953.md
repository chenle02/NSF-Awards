The Chemistry Division through its Chemical Instrumentation Program, its
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, and its
Inorganic/Bioinorganic/Organometallic Chemistry Program supports a research
project involving a large number of MIT scientists working within the George R.
Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory on the development and application of modern
laser spectroscopic techniques to a wide range of fundamental problems. Led by
Professors Feld and Steinfeld and Dr. Dasari, this endeavor has achieved
efficient collaborative use of expensive optical facilities, while becoming a
model for effective training of large numbers of students in state-of-the-art
optical techniques. Multiple-resonance and nonlinear laser techniques are being
used to study the spectroscopy of highly excited electronic and vibrational
levels (including the regime of quantum chaos) and to follow the evolution of
phase, velocity, and quantum states in collisional processes. Raman and
resonance Raman techniques are being used to study diverse systems, ranging from
technetium pharmaceuticals to enzymes. Pump-probe studies of the conversion of
light to chemical energy are being investigated with nanosecond to femtosecond
techniques. New work is being initiated to investigate photochemical processes
at surfaces, interfaces, or in bulk materials and to develop spectroscopic
instrumentation for deployment at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.
