This proposal is being jointly funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program,
Antarctic Glaciology Program, and the Paleoclimate Program in the Division of
Atmospheric Sciences. The Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) depth-age scale
is accurate within one per cent on an annual basis through the Holocene and into
the Wisconsin and therefore has been of great interest to the paleoclimate
community. Researchers have used, and want continue to use our most valuable
paleoclimate archives, the GISP2 and the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice
cores, to calibrate chronologies from other materials. Because the GRIP core was
drilled simultaneously and in close proximity (30 km) to the GISP2 core,
comparison between the two cores was expected to be similar. However, there are
segments of the cores where there is sufficient variability and the chronologies
have been questioned. This has caused confusion within the ice coring and the
paleoclimate communities. An example of these errors can be seen in the
Antarctic Siple Dome core. Like the GISP2 chronology, the Siple Dome chronology
is based on annual layer counts, but the gas age chronology deeper in the core
is based on correlations with the GISP2 record perpetuating the errors that
exist in the GISP2 chronology. It is critical that the GISP2 chronology be
reexamined and any discrepancies be resolved, if possible. The Principal
Investigator will: 1) use new volcanic records obtained since the completion of
the original GISP2 depth-age as additional tie points for greater calibration;
2) revise the Holocene portion of the GISP2 depth-age scale based on the new
Berylium-10 and Carbon-14 results; and 3) revisit areas of the depth-age scale
where discrepancies exist between the GISP2 and GRIP ice cores based on a recent
publication. Revision of the GISP2 depth-age scale will be accomplished by
reexamining areas of the core that have been identified to be in error by new
data that have come available since the completion of the original GISP2
chronology. Additionally, areas of the core where the GISP2 and GRIP
chronologies vary will be reexamined. The goal in the cases where discrepancies
exist with the GRIP record is not to adjust the GISP2 chronology, but to
identify any errors that are now evident due to new data and make adjustments as
necessary to obtain the best possible GISP2 chronology.
