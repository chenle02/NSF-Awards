The principal investigator (PI) will conduct theoretical and applied research on
distance correlation methods, with applications to high-dimensional
astrophysical databases. This research will be accomplished with co-authors in
statistics and astronomy, and with graduate students. The PI and a Co-PI will
develop Hankel transforms for distributions on matrix spaces and apply the
results to develop goodness-of-fit testing procedures for data consisting of
symmetric positive definite random matrices. The PI and a Co-PI will analyze
high-dimensional astrophysical databases on galaxy clusters to identify
associations and correlations between multiple astrophysical variables. Research
on distance correlation measures for mixtures of Gaussians and general heavy-
tailed distributions will be carried out.

The advances in inference for data consisting of positive definite random
matrices will be applied to develop new statistical theory and methods for
modeling variability in biological shapes and analyzing the movement of water
molecules in biological tissue. The research program benefits human development
and education in the society through the training of graduate students and joint
research with post-doctoral and faculty colleagues.
