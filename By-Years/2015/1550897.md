The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by prek-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools. While national and state standards provide
important benchmarks for algebra learning beginning in kindergarten, they do not
provide rigorously tested models by which these algebra standards might be
attained in elementary grades classrooms in ways that will ensure further
mathematics achievement. This work will addresses this need by closely
documenting the effectiveness of models and tools, developed in our previous
work, for early algebra education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will
use a quasi-experimental design to explore students' knowledge of core algebraic
concepts in middle grades (grade 6), one year after their completion of 3-year,
grades 3-5 early algebra intervention. The project will also study the algebraic
knowledge of a comparison group of students. The research questions are: (1) how
well students who received a specific intervention retain their understanding of
algebraic concepts in future years; and (2) whether and how the intervening year
of regular classroom instruction in grade 6 influences the algebra understanding
of both intervention and comparison students
