A workshop to consider the future of programming languages and compilers
research will be held in Charleston, S.C., on January 13-14, l993, immediately
after the Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) conference. fifteen to
twenty researchers, representing a cross-section of the programming languages
community, from both senior and junior levels in universities and industry shall
be invited to participate. The workshop will focus both on the direction of
future research and on fostering communication within the area and with other
areas. An attempt to clarify issues such as: What developments in the field will
have the greatest impact on science and technology in the near term? In the long
term? How can connections between theory and practice be more fully exploited?
How can researchers in this field facilitate technology transfer to other
scientific areas and the programming community at large? will be made and
presented in a report, edited by the PI's in consultation with the workshop
participants summarizing the consensus of the meeting.
