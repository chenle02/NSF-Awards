9314465 Wang The main objective of this study is to understand the growth
process of ice particles in clouds and precipitation. The study will investigate
the growth of large particles where the particles perform oscillating motions in
air. The PIs will study both the diffusional growth and riming of ice particles
in two contexts, i.e., from both the individual particle and cloud dynamical
points of view. To achieve the first goal, they will numerically solve the
unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for flow past ice particles of various shapes
and then use the flow fields so obtained to determine the diffusional growth and
riming by solving the convective diffusion equations of vapor and the equation
of motion of supercooled droplets. To achieve the second goal, they will
parameterize the results obtained and incorporate them in a cloud dynamical
model. Finally, they will participate in the WISP94 experiment to collect real
ice samples and use their models to interpret the observation. ***
