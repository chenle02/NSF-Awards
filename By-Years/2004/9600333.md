9600333 Schlick This award supports the collaboration between Shulamith Schlick
of the Department of Chemistry, University of Detroit Mercy (UDM) and Isao Ando
of the Department of Polymer Chemistry, Tokyo Institute of Technology (TIT).
Project funding will allow Dr. Schlick to spend four months in residence at TIT,
in order to study swollen polymer networks by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) techniques, and to assess the effect of network structure on gel
heterogeneities and response to meahanical and electric stimuli. Dr. Ando and
co-workers at TIT have solved the difficulties inherent in MRI of solid state-
like samples, by imaging the highly mobile solvent (especially water) molecules
present in swollen polymer networks. The images obtained from the solvent
molecules can then be interpreted in terms of network properties. Dr. Schlick
has developed electron spin resonance imaging in two dimensions (2D ESRI), for
imaging of polymeric materials and polymer-supported catalytic systems. This
method has been used recently to measure the translational diffusion of small
and polymeric tracers in hydrogels that have excellent biological tolerance and
good mechanical properties, and that are especially useful for the production of
contact lenses. This proposal will therefore combine the expertise of scientists
in two countries, Japan and US, in the field of non- destructive evaluation of
materials by magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The familiarity of the US
scientist with polymeric systems and ESRI, together with the expertise of the
Japanese group in polymer physics and MRI, are considered key elements for the
success of the collaborative research plan. ***
