NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for
partial support of the 2020 Polymer Physics Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
the associated Polymer Physics Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). Polymer physics is
a broad and interdisciplinary field with impact across diverse societal needs
and industrial sectors, including energy, infrastructure, transportation, water,
and health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2020 Gordon Research Conference on Polymer
Physics will focus on new experimental, simulation, and theoretical developments
over a range of traditional and emerging topics, including block copolymers
(especially focusing on the formation of quasicrystals), nanocomposites, big
data methods, coacervates, polymer membranes, reconfigurable polymers, charged
polymers, rheology, and networks. The conference will feature eighteen full-
length lectures by senior researchers, whose talks will include a ten-minute
introduction designed for a general polymer audience, as well as a session
featuring shorter talks by eight early-career
investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRS will include approximately twelve
talks delivered by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, two poster
sessions, and a panel discussion. The focus of the 2020 GRS is to highlight the
work of the next generation of polymer scientists and engineers in areas of
current interest such as machine learning, reconfigurable polymers, and
coacervates. The GRS will culminate in a panel discussion on "Becoming an
Interdisciplinary Leader through Polymer Physics" in both academic and
industrial settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
