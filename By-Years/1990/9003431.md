The request is for computer hardware to permit extension of the work to simple
liquid structure and melting in three dimensions. The equipment will allow one
to carry out a wide variety of simulation studies, including realistic
molecular-dynamics simulations of atomic and molecular systems and Monte Carlo
simulations of simple melting models. He believes that the results could pave
the way for the first true understanding of melting and liquid structure and of
complex melted phases such as molecular liquids, liquid crystals and polymers.
