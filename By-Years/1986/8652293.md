Fifty teachers will participate (25 in the summer, l987, and 25 in the summer
l988) in a Master Teachers Workshop for 4 weeks. The foci of this workshop are
on the process-structure of science and the developmental learning theory. Each
teacher will complete the study of two of three curricula: biology, physics,
and/or chemistry. Daily seminars on science and learning-theory bases relating
to these curricula will be an intergal part of the workshop. Three follow-up
sessions for the paricipants will be conducted during the academic year.
Participants will be chosen from school districts in Kansas, Northern Texas,
Arkansas, Southern Missouri, Eastern Colorado, and New Mexico. The primary goal
of this project is to train a cadre of Master Teachers who will provide
inservice for teachers in their school district using learning cycle-based
curricula. The participants will be provided with a complete set of curricula
materials with permission to reproduce the materials for other teachers within
their local school system. Each participant's school system will be required to
make significant commitments and provide adequate support systems to enhance the
summer participants' local staff development activities.
