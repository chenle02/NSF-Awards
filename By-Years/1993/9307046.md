9307046 Jokipii This proposal seeks three years of continued support for a
program of theoretical studies of a range of basic solar-wind properties and
their interactions with cosmic rays. In this continuing program, the
investigations undertaken will include studies of the large-scale morphology of
the interplanetary magnetic field and plasma, with particular emphasis given to
the effect of the field's structure on cosmic-ray and energetic- particle
acceleration, propagation and anisotropies. A new part of this study will
include a study of how cosmic rays can affect fluid flows such as the solar wind
and perhaps even help accelerate the solar wind near the Sun. ***
