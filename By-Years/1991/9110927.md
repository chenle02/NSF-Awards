This research investigates two areas of ceramic corrosion, gaseous reactions
with the production of volatile species and aqueous dissolution kinetics. The
objective is to determine the degradation mechanism and the rate-controlling
steps in each case. The range of possible mechanisms spans from transport
control to surface reaction kinetics. Degradation of microstructure during the
oxidation of multi-component systems will be investigated. Gaseous corrosion
kinetics are determined by thermogravimetry, and dissolution kinetics are
determined by solution analysis with atomic absorption spectroscopy. %%%% This
research seeks to study the fundamentals governing the corrosion behaviors of
ceramics. From the degradation mechanism, better ceramics can be fabricated to
minimize degradation. They can also provide basis for the selection of an
optimum ceramic material for a given hostile environment. Results may also be
useful with respect to ceramic processings.
