The objective of this research is to perform a fundamental study on the
underlying science of terahertz (THz) wave generation and detection in gases.
The approach is to use ambient air and/or selected gases as THz wave emitters
and sensors with femtosecond laser excitation.

Intellectual Merit: The principal design concept is based on recent experimental
and theoretical research on pulsed THz-wave emission and measurements in air or
selected gases. A focused optical pulse with >100 ?√ùJ pulse energy and <100
femtosecond pulse duration in gas creates an atmospheric plasma, which produces
very intense (>200 kV/cm) and ultra-broadband THz waves (0.1 to 10 THz) in the
far field. Using the air-breakdown-coherent-detection (ABCD) method, or the
radiation-enhanced-emission-of-fluorescence (REEF) method, air or air-plasma can
also sense pulsed THz waves both in local or remote distance.

Broader Impacts: The fundamental research of THz waves will have an impact in
many scientific areas, beyond its historical uses in the astronomy and the laser
fusion communities. The resulting technology should find use in many advanced
photonic laboratories. The research has the potential to impact a wide range of
applications including nondestructive testing, homeland security, and biomedical
applications. Research projects with undergraduate students with an HBCU,
Morehouse University, will be started.
