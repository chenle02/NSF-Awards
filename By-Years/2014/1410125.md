Non-technical Description: Gallium nitride (GaN) is a key component in
optoelectronics, such as light-emitting diodes (LED). The investigation and
identification of point defects in GaN is very important and has immediate
technology relevance to longer life time LEDs. The goal of the proposed research
is to bring the physics of defects in GaN to a new level of understanding, to
uncover the microscopic nature of defects, and to solve longstanding problems in
the field of semiconductor physics. The research integrates experiment and
theory by combining advanced experimental techniques with high performance
computing. Collaboration with the semiconductor industry is expected to have a
direct impact on practical applications. The project also builds a strong
foundation for research and education in a relatively small Physics Department
at Virginia Commonwealth University. Students from underrepresented groups have
the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art experiment and
calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The goal of this
research is to gain an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of point defects
in GaN. The study investigates a large number of point defects and various
defect complexes. The experimental work, using advanced tools such as
photoluminescence under uniaxial stress, is conducted in parallel with first-
principles calculations using the hybrid functional theory. Incorporation of
lattice deformations due to uniaxial pressure into the theory enables direct
comparison between the theory-predicted changes in defect-related optical
properties and experimental results. The symmetry and electronic structure of
point defects can be revealed from the analysis of the effect of external stress
based on the luminescence spectrum and its polarization. The integrated
experiment/theory approach allows the direct identification of defects and the
determination of their microscopic structure.
