9420846 Billard The American Statistical Association (ASA) requests a travel
grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 50th Session of the
International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Beijing, China from August 21-29,
1995. The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society,
International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International
Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of
Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical
Education (IASE). Thus it is an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for
thousands of Statisticians. The travel grant will provide partial support to
defray transportation costs for individuals selected from institutions and non-
profit associations. An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide the
opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting. ASA
proposes to make twenty travel grants available, with the major emphasis on
providing partial travel support to individuals who received their Ph.D. after
1984. The grant recipients will be primarily engaged in the meeting activities
as invited speakers, discussants, organizers, and presenters of contributed
papers. Examples of titles of some of the papers presented in 1993 include,
"Object Oriented Methods in Statistics - Graphical Construction and Editing of
Plots" "The Strata of Random Mappings," "Bayesian Analysis of Space-Time
Evolution of Earthquakes," and "Time Series Applications of Astronomy and
Meteorology." The American Statistical Association (ASA) requests a travel grant
