The theme of this project is to generalize the methods of global Riemannian
geometry to better understand metric measure spaces, which occur naturally as
singularity models for the Ricci flow. This proposal builds on joint work by the
PI and Petersen, who have proven a number of classification theorems for
gradient Ricci solitons, or self-similar solutions to the flow. An important
tool in this work is the theory of curvature dimension inequalities developed by
Bakry and Emery and their collaborators, which was also researched by the PI in
joint work with Wei. One aspect of this project is to investigate new theorems
relating Ricci solitons and curvature dimension inequalities. Another component
is to investigate new ideas about classical Riemannian geometry that arise in
the novel setting of metric measure spaces. As an example, the PI will
investigate the interesting relationship between curvature dimension
inequalities and warped product Einstein manifolds.

Global Riemannian geometry studies the relationship between the infinitesimal
warping (or curvature) of a space, and the global shape of that space. These
spaces, or manifolds, appear frequently in science and engineering problems
because physical laws can generally be modeled by partial differential equations
on a manifold. Partial differential equations are also important in geometry
because they are used to draw global conclusions from curvature, which is a type
of local information. This structure on the overall shape in turn allows new
insights into the behavior of differential equations on the manifold. The Ricci
flow, which is one of the most important partial differential equations in
mathematics, has been used to classify the shape of all three dimensional
manifolds. A better understanding of singularities in the Ricci flow promises
deep new discoveries applicable to many areas of mathematics and science.
Because this project advances our understanding of the geometry of manifolds, it
will also contribute to a better understanding of many physical models.
