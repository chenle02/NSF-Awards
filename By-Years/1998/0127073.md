Geography (88)&lt;br/&gt;Increasing use of global positioning system (GPS)
technology within agriculture, transportation, natural resource management, and
other fields highlights the importance of understanding GPS principles as well
as basic geographic concepts tied to location, direction, scale, and distance.
This project is developing instructional modules that address theory, operation,
and applications of GPS technology and its integration with other spatial
technologies. Four modules are being designed for adaptation within
undergraduate geography (or related) courses that emphasize basic
navigation/positioning, spatial data capture, data management/ integration, or
the analysis of geographic information. These modules contain three parts: 1) a
web-based pre-lab exercise to be completed in advance of a class meeting, 2)
presentation materials that can be used by instructors (topic outlines,
photographs, diagrams, animations), and 3) hands-on exercises emphasizing field
data capture and spatial data integration. These modules are undergoing a three
tier evaluation. First, they are being critically examined by a curricula review
team. Second, they are being tested within selected Oklahoma State University
courses. Finally, they are being tested by faculty collaborators at six other
campus sites. Nationwide dissemination of materials is being undertaken through
the GPS Tools for Geographers web page. An important project goal is to update
and revise project materials indefinitely and to attract a following that
encourages contributions of new modules by faculty at other institutions.
