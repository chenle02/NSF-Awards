This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will use
novel biological techniques to improve the institution's cell plasma membrane
research capabilities. These studies will focus on the effects of genetics,
developmental and environmental influences on plasma membrane properties for
freshwater mussel and the aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. It is
expected that plasma membrane fluidity, composition and binding properties will
change in response to environmental and developmental signals. Chromatography
and fluorescence polarization will be used to monitor these changes. This
comprehensive study involving comparative physiology and physiological ecology
will significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly minority
institution The principal investigators have the necessary training background
and experience to do the research. Faculty and students working on this project
will have opportunities to use new procedures to investigate the role of lipid
membrane fluidity in the function and development of certain cells.
