This grant is to support research in theoretical astrophysics by one of the
leading and most productive research groups in the world. Studies will range
from the generation of gravitational waves by neutron star systems to the
dynamical evolution of globular clusters and galactic nuclei to the dynamics of
superclusters of groups of galaxies. Both snslytical studies and numerical
modeling on supercomputers will be used to extend our understanding of the
dynamics and evolution of complex systems.
