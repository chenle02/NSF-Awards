9222916 Goochee This project is on research to investigate the activities of
sialidases in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell cultures relative to possible
extracellular modification of sugar groups on secreted glycoprotiens expressed
during the culturing process. Glycopropteins have many important pharmaceutical
applications, for example, for the clinical treatment of chronic renal failure,
cancer, heart disease, enzymatic deficiencies, blood clotting diseases, and
cystic fibrosis. The presence or absence of sialic acid in glycoprotein
oligosaccharides strongly affects properties such as solubility, specific
activity, and circulatory half - life in vivo. This project contains a program
to determine the bioprocess conditions that minimize or maximize the enzymatic
hydrolysis of sialic acid from glycoprotein oligosaccharides. The properties of
sialidases from several other important mammalian cell lines will also be
explored.
