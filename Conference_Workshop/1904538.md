Commutative Algebra is a ubiquitous mathematical subject whose techniques and
results are utilized in Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Representation
Theory. Morgantown Algebra Days is a Commutative Algebra conference which is to
take place at West Virginia University on the weekend of April 13-14, 2019. The
main objective of the conference is to showcase new mathematical trends to a
large group of mathematicians specializing in the subject of Commutative
Algebra. Morgantown Algebra Days will feature eight research talks and poster
session allowing for younger mathematicians to present their research. The
website for the conference is https://www.math.wvu.edu/mad2019/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
