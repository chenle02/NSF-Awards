A fundamental problem in communications is that of detecting an information-
carrying signal which has been transmitted over a channel subject to
interference, noise and other impairments. This project studies this problem,
with a special focus on the case when the structure of the transmission channel
and the noise/interference is unknown to the receiver. One typical instance of
this situation is suppression of interference that consists of signals from an
unknown number of other transmitters who utilize the same frequency band. This
is relevant to several practical problems: multiuser detection for the third
generation spread spectrum (CDMA) system, and antijamming for the Global
Positioning System (GPS) or wireless communications systems, for example. In
summary, the outcome of the research will help improve the quality of wireless
links and enable a more efficient use of the radio spectrum. The project takes a
systematic, decision-theoretic approach to the problem under study. A new
paradigm is developed, where the key idea is to use mixture models (a.k.a.
``mixture of experts'') for the received data. Specific topics addressed
include: 1) Formulation of a general model/framework for communications signals
via mixture densities. 2) Development of statistically sound methods for the
mixture model parameter estimation. 3) Design of demodulation algorithms that
utilize the mixture model formulation of the received data, and that can be
integrated with soft-decision decodable GF(2) codes. 4) Algorithm design for
practical problems including: suppression of interference with unknown
structure; methods that can trade off between ``noise-prewhitening''
interference suppression and multiuser (joint) detection; diversity combination
with an unknown number of ``significant'' paths (e.g., for CDMA or UWB);
demodulation of signals with unknown modulation formats; suppression of non-
Gaussian noise.
