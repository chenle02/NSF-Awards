This award wil support the experimental nuclear physics group
at&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University. The research will be carried out at
the&lt;br/&gt;FSU Tandem/LINAC accelerator facility and at other
laboratories&lt;br/&gt;around the U.S. Nine FSU faculty members are actively
involved. &lt;br/&gt;Research focus areas include a variety of nuclear reactions
of&lt;br/&gt;astrophysical importance, isospin purity of nuclei, new
insights&lt;br/&gt;into nuclear collective behavior, and properties of loosely
bound&lt;br/&gt;"halo" nuclei. The FSU has had primary responsibility for the
Ring&lt;br/&gt;Imaging Cherenkov detector for the PHENIX experiment at
the&lt;br/&gt;Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and will pursue
electron&lt;br/&gt;measurements to look for nuclear medium effects on the
perperties of&lt;br/&gt;light vector mesons. At Jefferson Laboratory, the FSU
group will&lt;br/&gt;use high-quality tagged photon beams at the CLAS detector
to search&lt;br/&gt;fo rmesons with so-called exotic quantum numbers. This
activity&lt;br/&gt;also ties directly to participation in the development of
the&lt;br/&gt;proposed Hall D detector for Jefferson Laboratory.
Graduate&lt;br/&gt;education will be an essential component of the group's
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
