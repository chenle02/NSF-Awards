Theory of Magnetic Intercalation Compounds: This award recommendation is made
under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists
and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project addresses
questions of the basic magnetic properties of intercalation compounds. A
phenomenological and microscopic analysis will be conducted of the properties
and behavior of magnetic host materials with non-magnetic and with magnetic
intercalants. In addition, such systems provide a means to study the transition
from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnetism. The project is under
the direction of Dr. Laura L. Hinchey, Physics Department, University of
California, Irvine, CA 92717, U.S.A., and Professor M. Balkanski, Laboratoire de
Physique des Solides, Spectroscopie des Solides, CNRS, 4 Place Jussieu, Tour 13,
75230 Paris, France. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as
appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
