Thermal Plasma Synthesis of Fine Ceramic Powders: This award recommendation is
made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of
Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to
enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research
institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan,
Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct
of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected
on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project will address
the study of particle formation mechanisms occurring during thermal plasma
synthesis of fine-powdered ceramics. This will be investigated by use of
equilibrium-composition computer codes, and the selection of suitable model
systems for experimental powder production. This project is under the direction
of Dr. Robert M. Young, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of
Minnesota, 111 Church Street, S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455, U.S.A., and Professor
I. J. Polmear, Chairman, Department of Materials Engineering, Monash University,
Clayton Victoria, 31268, Australia. This award recommendation provides funds to
cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend,
dependents allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
