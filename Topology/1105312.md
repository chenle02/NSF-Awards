The proposed research focuses on applying Floer-theoretic invariants to study
objects in low-dimensional topology and contact geometry. The first project
develops combinatorial approaches to symplectic field theory. The foundation for
this study is a combinatorial formulation of Legendrian contact homology for
Seifert fibered spaces which will be used to explore Legendrian knot theory in
rational homology three-spheres. The second project studies generalizations of
the notion of knot genus. We will develop techniques for studying non-orientable
surfaces in link complements, adapting existing Heegaard Floer invariants to
detect minimal-complexity non-orientable surfaces.

Without the sensory apparatus to detect quantum phenomena, our experience of the
universe is as a three-dimensional physical space or as a four-dimensional
spacetime; this project studies the properties and interactions of three-, and
four-dimensional mathematical objects called manifolds. The last decade has seen
success in studying these objects using techniques from Floer theory, a powerful
yet technically difficult approach. One of the primary goals of the proposed
research is developing versions of Floer-theoretic tools which are easier to
use. This will facilitate the study of low-dimensional manifolds and shed new
light on the original constructions.
