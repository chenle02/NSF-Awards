9454589 Hata The Portland Community College - Intel Corporation cooperative
program in semiconductor manufacturing education is being transported to two
other sites: The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute and Albuquerque TVI
with Intel, and Chemeketa Community College in Oregon with Siltec Silicon. This
academic program is characterized by a solid foundation of science, mathematics,
and communications skills, along with specialty courses offered using industry
facilities. Project activities include curriculum transfer, faculty development,
course implementation and updating, instructional delivery, program assessment,
and dissemination of project results. A central feature of the project is an
annual three-day workshop at which faculty participants collaborate on how
courses should be taught, course content and level, student assessment, and
specification of best practices identified at the various sites.
