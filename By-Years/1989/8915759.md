This award provides one-third of the funds required for the purchase of an
infrared (IR) spectrometer system with capabilities for near-, mid-, and far-IR
measurements. The instrumentation is to be installed and operated in the
Department of Chemistry at the Arizona State University. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this acquisition.
Researchers in the Chemistry Department have an intensive research program in
mineralogy and geochemistry which requires access to state-of-the-art infrared
spectrometry. Current research projects include: (1) structural studies of
silicate and aluminosilicate glasses, (2) studies of water solution in silicate
glasses and melts, (3) atomic order-disorder problems in aluminosilicates, (4)
structural and thermodynamic studies of high-pressure phases.
