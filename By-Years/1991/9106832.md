Renewed support for Ewing's research in sensing of neurotransmitters and related
analytical chemistry comes from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
the Chemistry Division and the Synaptic Mechanisms Program in Behavioral and
Neural Sciences. Research will include assembly of an electrospray time-of-
flight mass spectrometer, which will be used to identify and quantify lipids and
phospholipids from intact cell membranes. In addition, neuropeptides from single
transmitter vesicles will be identified. Mass spectral measurements will
complement microelectrochemical detection of neurotransmitters for
characterization of neural transmission and transduction. %%% While a variety of
small molecules are known to transmit signals from one nerve cell to the next, a
variety of larger molecules are also important in understanding
neurotransmission and nerve cell function. Among these are fatty substances
(lipids and phospholipids) in cell membranes, whose composition varies along the
cell membrane and with the state of the cell. The use of mass spectrometry will
allow identification and structure elucidation of small numbers of these
molecules from single cells. In addition, peptides (small chains or oligomers of
amino acids) which transmit or modify transmission of neuronal signals will be
identified and sequenced.
