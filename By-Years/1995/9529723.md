9520723 Seyfried Title: Halogen (C1, F) exchange and C1 isotope fractionation
during fluid-mineral equilibra: experimental calibration of a new tool to study
subseafloor hydrothermal systems Seawater circulates through the ocean crust and
interacts with minerals there and leaves chlorine (C1 and flourine (f) behind.
This is known from minerals that have been recovered from the ocean floor. The
amount of C1 and F that is taken up by minerals is probably related to the
conditions within the sea floor, yet the relationship between these conditions,
such as temperature, and the abundance of C1 and F in the fluid, and the amount
of C1 and F deposited in the minerals is not known. The investigators plan to
use laboratory experiments to determine how temperature and other conditions
control C1 and F in minerals. This can then be used to interpret the conditions
of the formation of the ocean crust.
