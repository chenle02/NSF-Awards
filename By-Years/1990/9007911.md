The objective of the proposed research is to study the effects of dynamic loads
and extreme environments on structural glazing systems. Specific areas of
research include studying the effects of temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet
(UV) radiation on structural silicone properties and conducting full-scale
failure tests of structural glazing samples under dynamic loads. Investigators
will improve present models which predict properties of a structural silicone
and forces in a structurally glazed panel using data from the proposed research
work.
