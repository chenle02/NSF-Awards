This Research Initiation Award is to study how muscles stretch during
locomotion. The study will make direct measurements on the muscle length during
locomotion. Therefore, it will attempt to verify recent speculation that key
muscles are sometimes forced to increase in length as compared to the popular
conception that they only shorten.
