This award provides funds to establish a computer network linking researchers
in Sociology and affiliated programs at the University of Wyoming to a micro-
computer laboratory, a mainframe computer, and to each other's work stations.
The proposal was submitted to the Instrumentation and Instrument Development
Program. The computer network will greatly facilitate the sociological research
currently taking place at the university by providing researchers joint access
to large scale datasets, easy communication with each other, and much better
opportunitites for training graduate students//
