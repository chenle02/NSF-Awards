Experimental investigations of the properties of amorphous semiconductors,
especially metal-chalcogenide glasses, with the intention of understanding the
defects which occur in these materials. Also to be addressed are questions
regarding the microscopic origins of optically-induced paramagnetism and
photodarkening in semiconducting chalcogenide glasses. A broadly-based
experimental program will be applied, including methods such as magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, optical spectroscopies, combinations of optical and
magnetic resonance techniques, and electrical measurements.
