The genetic control of mating behavior (courtship) is very important for the
survival of a species. However, little is known about the genes that regulate
this behavior. The study of mating behavior of fruit flies provides a simple way
to identify and study genes that control this process since the fly's courtship
ritual consists of well-defined steps that are easy to observe in the
laboratory. &lt;br/&gt; The same regulatory pathways, which determine sexual
differentiation in the animal as a whole, control sex-specific behavior. In
contrast to mammals, where hormones play an important role in this process, the
brain of male fruit flies develops in a male specific manner without requiring
hormones. When parts of the male brain are made female by genetic manipulation,
mating behavior is severely disturbed. Although sexual differentiation of the
brain is critical for proper male behavior, another tissue, which is not part of
the brain, but surrounds it, is also important for courtship. It is unknown how
this tissue contributes to mating behavior. The aim of this project is to study
the role of this tissue in the regulation of male courtship. How does it
influence the brain? It is known that this tissue secretes a number of proteins
into the fly's circulatory system from where they could possibly contact the
brain. One of these proteins has already been shown to play a role in courtship
behavior. How does it work? Are there other secreted factors that affect
courtship? How can diffusible factors influence the brain and behavior? The
study of these questions will contribute to our understanding of how genes and
molecules regulate complex behaviors. In addition, this exciting work will
provide a rich learning experience for undergraduate students in genetic and
molecular techniques&lt;br/&gt;
