The continued destruction of the coastal and tropical forest in South and
Central America threatens the survival of natural animal populations, including
the callitrichid primates (tamarins and marmosets). While the golden lion
tamarins are considered an endangered species, through a highly successful
breeding program at the University of Nebraska under the auspices of the
National Zoological Park, these primates are being bred in captivity and a small
group of six have recently been reintroduced into forests of Brazil. Their
survival as a species, however, depends extensively on understanding how their
reproduction is synchronized to lead to a greater likelihood of fertilization.
Dr. French will investigate the complex interplay between internal physiological
factors and external social and environmental factors in gold lion tamarins.
Unlike Old World primates and apes, the callitrichid primates are monogamous and
thus, develop a close and long-lasting association, or pair- bond, between a
breeding male and female. Dr. French will use noninvasive data collection
techniques for both hormone samples and behavioral measurements to compare the
degree to which social factors influence hormonal regulation of reproduction.
His findings will be compared with the results obtained in similarly conducted
studies in which Old World non-monogamous primate species have been used. This
work will contribute to our understanding of the role of hormonal and social
influences on reproductive behavior in golden lion tamarins as well as other New
World primates of which many are considered threatened or endangered species.
Furthermore, the results will significantly enhance the captive breeding
programs of endangered species and thus, contribute to the preservation of these
small South American primates.
