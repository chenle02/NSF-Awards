The interplay between the effects of the external forces on the electrons and
the effects of the electron-electron interaction is to be studied in a variety
of physical systems: (1) semi- conductor heterostructures, (2) superconductors.
The observable consequences, particularly in optical properties, will be related
to experiments.
