ABSTRACT OPP-9701766 FAIRALL, CHRISTOPHER NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
ADMINISTRATION This research project is a key component of a large, coordinated,
multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The
research program will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice
pack. These investigators will measure atmospheric conditions near the surface
of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean to determine the flux of heat
radiating onto and off of the ice floe. They will determine how atmospheric
heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are
critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
variations in climate. The heat flux measurement program makes an essential
contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric
variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying
above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice
floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate
models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better
predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a
proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
are increased above present levels.
