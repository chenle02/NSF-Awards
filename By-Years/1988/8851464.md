Integrated biotechnology and computer labs for the Biochemistry program will be
set up to train biology, biochemistry, chemistry and other majors in recombinant
DNA and monoclonal antibody production and scale-up methods. Because these
methods have become basic to many areas of science, should develop these skills
as undergraduates for use in required internships and their own research. The
number of biochemistry majors in this department has steadily increased over the
past seven years; 80% of them going on to medical or graduate schools. DNA
electrophoresis and blotting equipment, an inverted microscope, an ultracold
freezer, a preparative centrifuge, a fermenter and two spectrophotometers permit
DNA restriction mapping, cloning, and the production of proteins and monoclonal
antibodies. A Biology Computing Center is being established where faculty
developed software allows students to gain experience with experimental design,
data collection and analysis, in addition to their lab experience. Two
innovative features of this project are 1) the integration of the hands-on labs
with computer simulations, allowing for practical lab experience with realistic
experimental design and data analysis in a short period at low cost, and 2) the
way in which labs prepare students for internships and research where people
cooperate on long- term projects that integrate several methods. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
