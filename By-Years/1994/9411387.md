9411387 Feng Experimental research of new optical fiber sensors for monitoring
civil infrastructure systems is planned. Optical sensors employ a vibrating wire
whose tension can be modulated by external force, strain, or vibration and is
translated into the change in the wire vibration frequency. The wire vibration
frequency is detected by light sent to and reflected from the wire through an
optical fiber cable. Compared to other existing optical fiber sensors which tend
to suffer from the lack of reliability and robustness, the sensors have two
significant advantages: one is that the sensing head is a vibrating wire (rather
than an optical fiber), which can sense a specific physical quantity without
interference from miscellaneous effects: the other is that the wire vibration is
a well understood physical phenomenon. In fact, with a high level of
reliability, its frequency is optically measured and transmitted to recording
and other devices through the optical fiber without attenuation or distortion.
These advantages should make the sensor system simple, reliable and robust, and
hence more readily deployable in civil infrastructure applications.
