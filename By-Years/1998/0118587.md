.0118587 Rose

This award will support Dr. William I. Rose, Michigan Technological University,
in a collaboration with Dr. Eddie Sanchez Bennet, General Director, Instituto
Nacional de Sismologia, Guatemala, and Dr. Carlos Pullinger, Instituto de
Investigacion de Riesgos Naturales, San Salvador, for a study of volcanic hazard
mitigation efforts in those countries, which are part of the second most
consistently active volcano zone on earth. Many of those volcanoes are close to
population centers, and this proposal will focus on specific research problems
addressing areas with high risk such as those.

The researchers plan to address mitigation by the use of satellite remote
sensing and kinematic GPS survey techniques along with digital topography,
conventional field mapping, and laboratory simulation of volcanic processes.
Through these methods they plan to develop a model of current and prospective
hazards to be used to delineate changing hazard. **** .
