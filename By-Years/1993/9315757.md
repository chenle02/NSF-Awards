9315757 Quinn A Conference on Prospects in Topology will be held at Princeton
University on March 16-19, 1994. Sixteen hour-talks are scheduled from important
figures in the field from the U.S. and Europe. The focus will be on new problems
and techniques in topology arising in recent applications. The objective is to
foster communication between those applying topology and those involved in
internal development, to avoid fragmentation and isolation of parts of the
subject. Graduate students will be involved, and an attempt will be made to
publish the ideas presented at a level accessible to general mathematical
audiences. ***
