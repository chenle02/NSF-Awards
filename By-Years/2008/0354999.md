A study of a new optical design and a modified length sensing scheme for the
planned upgrade of the current LIGO detector will be performed. The very high
laser power used in Advanced LIGO will deform the mirrors and degrade the mode
matching between the various optical cavities in the interferometer. In the new
optical design the beam expander in the input optics chain is moved inside the
power recycling cavity. This makes it possible to optimize the mode matching
between the various optical cavities inside the interferometer after all optical
components are installed and the thermal deformations are measured on site.
However, thermal modeling of the new layout is necessary and will be done over
the next years to optimize this design. In addition, the current length sensing
scheme for Advanced LIGO has some limitations because it requires rather high
modulation frequencies but still generates a highly coupled sensing matrix. The
modified length sensing scheme which will be derived over the next years will
use non-harmonic, low-frequency modulation signals to reduce these problems
significantly. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)
operates two laser interferometer in Hanford, WA, and one in Livingston, LA, to
detect gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. The current LIGO
interferometers will have to be upgraded in a few years to improve the
sensitivity to better resolve the waveforms and locate the sources. This
research will develop technologies to optimize the spatial mode matching between
the various optical cavities in the Advanced LIGO detector. This will increase
the signal strength and reduce the requirements on many technical noise sources
like laser beam pointing and intensity fluctuations.
