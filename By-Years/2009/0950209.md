For a decade, it has been recognized that successful comprehension of language
is facilitated by mental simulation, i.e., the mental re-enactment of real-world
perceptual and motor experiences. This simulation occurs while understanding
language because linguistic knowledge is grounded in our experiences.

However, studies investigating the role of simulation in formulating utterances
are very limited in both their number and methodology. Using a promising new
experimental method that requires hand/arm motions during language production,
this dissertation examines whether motor activities affect cognitive processes
and ultimately influence the shape of the resulting language. That is, do
speakers change their language choice as a result of related hand/arm movements?
This study examines both English and Japanese. The inclusion of Japanese, a
language with relatively flexible word order, allows critical insight to
simulation in sentence production since word order can reflect the temporal
order of stages in the simulated event, in addition to choice of linguistic
content and speech onset time.

Two sets of experiments are conducted in two languages. The first set explores
the interaction between motor activities and unconstrained messages (e.g., the
relationships among the event's participants and objects are not yet
established). The second set investigates the relationship between motion and
the production of a fixed message. The timing of executing physical motions is
manipulated in each set of experiments in order to explore the time course of
integrating motor activities into meaning construction processes. Results, from
two typologically distinct languages, showing that meaning construction and
human language production are sensitive to motor actions would suggest that our
language is cognitively grounded and acquired through a tight bond with our past
experiences. This project will help shed light on the influence of motor actions
on the human cognitive system, and more generally on the relationships among
linguistic and non-linguistic cognition.
