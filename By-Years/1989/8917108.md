The purpose of this research is to determine if evolution produces long term
progressive improvements in organisms. That is, do species become better adapted
over time? To test this idea Dr. Key will use the fossil record of bryozoans.
Bryozoans are marine animals that were common in the geologic past and are still
abundant today. They live like corals in large colonies on the sea floor. This
study will focus on a single lineage of bryozoans consisting of roughly 140
species that all evolved from a common ancestor. The species within this lineage
lived throughout the world from 480-380 million year ago. The structural design
of the colonies from the species within this lineage will be examined for
progressive improvements. Dr. Key will do this by measuring the constructional
properties of the colonies and analyzing changes in these properties through the
evolutionary history of the lineage. This research should determine if bryozoans
have become more efficiently constructed over time. This has implications on all
forms of life in that if there is no progressive improvement, it may challenge
our traditionally held view of evolutionary progress.
