Haskell Indian Nations University proposes a five year Tribal College/University
Program, &lt;br/&gt;.Mathematics: Keystone for Success. to increase the number
of American Indian students &lt;br/&gt;entering STEM fields. It will do so by
building the capacity of Haskell Indian Nations &lt;br/&gt;University to
complement the knowledge of incoming students and to deliver rigorous
&lt;br/&gt;mathematics/science instruction. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Elements of
the proposal required to transform Haskell.s mathematics and mathematically rich
&lt;br/&gt;disciplines from pure service areas include: 1) Enlarging the
existing and highly successful Ross &lt;br/&gt;Hall Learning Laboratory: The
Laboratory is successful in swiftly moving students from &lt;br/&gt;precollege
mathematics to College Algebra. Its expansion would place all students in this
&lt;br/&gt;excellent and supportive environment and release Mathematics faculty
to develop and teach &lt;br/&gt;higher-level mathematics courses. 2) Providing
faculty development: The faculty require &lt;br/&gt;updating through taking
classes, being involved in in-house workshops and attending
&lt;br/&gt;conferences. 3) Develop mathematics and mathematically rich science
courses: A series of &lt;br/&gt;classes to provide a .comprehensive. minor in
mathematics at Haskell will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;Complementary curricula
will be developed in pre-engineering, in Geographical Information
&lt;br/&gt;Systems (GIS) and Biology/Environmental Sciences; and courses to
serve Liberal Arts students &lt;br/&gt;will be created. 4) Incorporate
Technologies into Haskell courses: The use of a variety of
&lt;br/&gt;technologies will update course presentation and allow students to
explore technological &lt;br/&gt;advances in mathematics. 5) Expanded career
related experiences for students: Students will be &lt;br/&gt;provided academic
year and summer research and internship experiences that will arouse their
&lt;br/&gt;interest in pursuing their education in mathematics or mathematically
rich disciplines. 6) &lt;br/&gt;Enhanced infrastructure including recruitment,
assessment, retention and makes sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;tracking of student
progress possible. &lt;br/&gt;
