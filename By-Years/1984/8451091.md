The objective of this project is to extend the range of studies that can be
performed using direct stability analysis techniques. The transient energy
function method (TEF) has been used successfully in direct transient stability
techniques assuming a classical power system model. The classical model is
satisfactory for the initial analysis of many power system stability problems.
However, a large set of problems of critical concern to utility planners and
operators requires more sophisticated models to obtain realistic results. Hence,
there is a need to develop direct methods using more sophisticated models. This
project will consist of extending the classical model in the following areas:
including detailed synchronous machine models and effect of fast exciter
systems, incorporating HVDC terminal effects remote from disturbances, and
modeling the effect of relay operations.
