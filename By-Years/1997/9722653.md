This three-year award will support the research of a faculty member, a
postdoctoral fellow, and a graduate students to participate in a program in
relativistic heavy-ion research at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The
experiment is studying the flow of nuclear matter following Au-Au collisions at
various energies up to 10 GeV per nucleon. The study of the high-density nuclear
matter in these collisions offers the possibility to determine the equation of
state for nuclear matter and possibly (although unlikely at these energies) the
discovery of a new state of matter, the quark- gluon plasma. The PI is also a
member of the STAR collaboration for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
effort at BNL, which is scheduled to begin collecting data in September, 1999.
This grant will support the development of tracking software for the Silicon
Vertex Tracker and extend it to integrate it with the existing tracking software
developed for the STAR Time Projection Chamber.
