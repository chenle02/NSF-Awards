A long tradition of social influence research has documented many antecedents of
social change. In contrast, little is known about consequences of change. This
project examines group dynamics in the aftermath of change that occurs when, due
to social influence, majority and minority factions within a group switch their
positions. The proposed theoretical model posits that such a change is more than
a mechanical reversal of positions. Rather, change is assumed to affect
functioning of the group as a whole. An asymmetry in reactions to change is
hypothesized such that typically negative reactions to loss of majority position
are stronger than typically positive reactions to gain of the majority position.
As a result of the asymmetry, change initially should weaken group functioning,
including a group's ability to retain its members. This hypothesis will be
tested in an experimentally created group with opinion-based majorities and
minorities. Examining the effect of change on the functioning of these groups is
a first step in counteracting negative consequences and capitalizing on positive
consequences of social change. This research, therefore, has implications for
political, work, and other groups in which advocates of once prevailing ideas
trade places with proponents of once uncommon but eventually embraced ideas.
