Magnetic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) make it possible to
allow the study of the cross-over from 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D)
systems, the testing of existing theories of 2D physics, and investigation of
the associated randomness in 2D systems. The proposed study is to synthesize and
measure the physical properties of magnetic ternary GICs such as a random
mixture GICs (RMGICs) and graphite bi-intercalation compounds (GCICs). The
measurements will be made using ac and dc magnetic susceptibility, ac
calorimetry, electrical resistivity, neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, and
electron microprobe techniques.
