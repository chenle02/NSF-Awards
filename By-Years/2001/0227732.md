SHINE (Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary Environment) is an affiliation of
researchers within the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities
dedicated to promoting an enhanced understanding of the processes by which
energy in the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun
and/or accelerated in interplanetary space, and on the mechanisms by which these
fields and particles are transported to Earth through the inner heliosphere. A
focal point for the SHINE research activities and targeted campaigns is the
annual four-day SHINE workshop. This grant provides financial support for the
participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and a few select
international scientists. It also defrays minimal costs associated with the
management and organization of the next three workshops. For more information on
SHINE see, http://www.shinegroup.org.
