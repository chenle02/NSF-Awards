This proposal aims to study analysis and geometry of locally symmetric spaces
and the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. Riemann surfaces with canonical
metrics are important examples of locally symmetric spaces. Though their moduli
spaces are not locally symmetric spaces in general, it has been recognized for a
long time that they share many similar properties with locally symmetric spaces.
Indeed, many topological properties of the moduli spaces have been found by
following this principle. This proposal proposes to pursue further the analogues
between them and understand and contribute more to common properties of locally
symmetric spaces and the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. For example, the
spectral theory of locally symmetric spaces is fundamental in automorphic forms
and the celebrated Langlands program, and one project of this proposal is to
understand the spectral theory and the geometric scattering theory of the moduli
spaces of Riemann surfaces with respect to some canonical complete Riemannian
metrics. Another project is to understand the Gauss-Bonnet formula and the index
theory of the moduli spaces. The reduction theory for arithmetic groups is
crucial for understanding locally symmetric spaces and quadratic forms, and this
proposal also proposes to study analogous reduction theory for the moduli spaces
of Riemann surfaces.

Symmetry is a very important concept and has played a fundamental role in
science and art. It is not only effective but also beautiful. For example, many
basic laws in physics and nature are derived from the principle of symmetry, and
beautiful forms and designs also follow the principle of symmetry. The
mathematical language of symmetry is group theory and related symmetric spaces.
Probably the most symmetric space is the Euclidean space. Indeed it is one of
the important class of spaces called symmetric spaces, which include the
hyperbolic spaces and spheres. Quotients of symmetric spaces are called locally
symmetric spaces and they are closely related to another important class of
spaces in mathematics, moduli spaces which classify mathematical objects.
