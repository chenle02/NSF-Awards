Thermal and Rheological Controls on the Emplacement of Basaltic Lava
Flows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207919&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Cashman &amp;
Kauahikaua&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a renewal proposal that follows directly
in theme and approach to the previous award. Recent studies of active pahoehoe
and `a`a flows in Hawai`i, including those by the PIs, have shown that the
explicit link between flow morphology and emplacement involves the relative
rates of cooling, crystallization, and flow advance. Critical are conditions of
lava transport from the vent to the flow front. Field observations of flow
surface morphologies have led to rheological studies on yield strength
development in crystal-liquid suspensions. Novel experiments using PEG wax
suggest that solidification in uniform channelized flows may be described by a
single dimensionless parameter and channel aspect ratio. Non-uniformities such
as channel divergences, constrictions, and sinuosity also may stabilize or
disrupt surface crust. Results from the previous award illustrate the success of
these approaches. The current award will use high resolution satellite remote
sensing to map basaltic flows, complete additional analog experiments to better
define important material parameters and flow controls, and compare model
predictions with detailed field observations of flows. This renewal award
continues support for the collaboration between Cashman (Univ. of Oregon),
Kauahikaua (U.S.G.S., Hawaiian Volcano Observatory), and Griffiths &amp; Kerr
(Australian National University). The research team brings together expertise on
the field mapping and interpretation of Hawaiian lava flows and expertise on
fluid mechanical analysis of solidifying flows.&lt;br/&gt;
