CTS-9423090 Charles Martin CO State Univ. Novel molecular - recognition
membranes will be developed for use in separations. The composite membranes
consist of an ultrathin film (less than 100 nm thick) of a chemical selective
polymer deposited onto the surface of a microporous supported membrane. The
selective film will be composed of a molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP). MIPs
are prepared via template polymerization that yields sites which selectively
bind the print molecule. Ultrathin MIP films that are nanoporous rather than
macroporous will be synthesized. The effects of synthesis conditions on the
selectivity and rate of transport of the print solute will be determined. The
research may lead to the development of nanofiltration membranes with high
transport selectivity. The proposed membranes have potential applications in
biochemical and petrochemical separations as well as sensor technology.
