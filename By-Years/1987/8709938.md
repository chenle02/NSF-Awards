The investigator will spend 24 months examining the acquisition of grammatical
tone by young children learning Sesotho, an African language which makes
different use of tone than languages for which there have been previous tone-
acquisition studies (Thai, Chinese, Japanese). Analysis will be within the
theoretical framework of autosegmental phonology. Preliminary investigation
indicates that some Sesotho grammatical tone constructions are only mastered
after several years, contrary to expectations that acquisition of tone patterns
should precede full mastery of a language's segmental phonology. Demuth has the
advantage of excellent command of the language under investigation. The
methodology of the project has been meticulously devised. The results of the
research will provide excellent comparative material to be used with the earlier
studies of far better-known languages.
