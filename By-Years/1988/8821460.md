Computer-extended series, developed from perturbation analysis, will be
utilized to resolve a number of paradoxes in certain flows. These are as
follows: Flow in a coiled pipe; flow separation in a corrugated pipe; boundary
layer separation in both steady and unsteady flow; the role of transcendentally
small terms in series expansions for flows at low Reynolds number; and
viscoelastic flows with convergence problems at critical values of internal
relaxation time. In each case, there exist puzzling discrepancies and paradoxes
which have prevented the utilization of large scale computations with confidence
in their results. *
