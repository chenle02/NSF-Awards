This is a new Faculty Early Career Development Program grant (CAREER). The
research plans of the P.I. center around the study of Old World monkey evolution
from a molecular genetic perspective. Three major components of this plan are -
1) the search for genes which are most informative on the phylogenetic and
evolutionary histories of the monkeys; 2) the analyses of such genes; and 3) the
actual population genetics of these monkeys using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
markers. This is a very new and exciting area of genetic applications, and the
investigator is well situated, in training and with facilities, to undertake the
work. The instructional component of the proposal is especially strong and
innovative. He will be bringing computer-aided instruction and hands-on
laboaratory experience into the NYU curriculum. He is also developing auto-
tutorial and self-paced labs and practicals for several classes. He has been
particularly attuned and accessable to the minority student body at NYU, and
this, in the inner city, is especially appropriate.
