A laboratory containing DECstations 3100 running ULTRIX is being used to support
a new course, Numerical Methods for Supercomputers. Students are learning to
design programs that exploit vector and parallel architectures, submitting jobs
to a remote supercomputer, and in their home-campus lab they are synthesizing
large quantities of output data into an animated graphical display. By focusing
on the last stage of the modeling process - interpretation - students are
learning to evaluate the solutions to their mathematical and numerical models so
that they become familiar with the entire modeling process.
