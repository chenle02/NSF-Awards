The purpose of this applied engineering research is to characterize ultrasonic
wave propagation in tissue. The research will involve both experimental and
modelling effort. The ultrasonic waves will be measured after they have
propagated through an inhomogeneous medium under carefully controlled
conditions. A series of materials of increasing inhomogeneity will be used to
insure that the modeling and the experiments coincide as the research
progresses. The results should place bounds on the limits of resolution for
ultrasonic imaging systems, provide new parameters for characterization of
tissue, and allow development of new focusing techniques.
