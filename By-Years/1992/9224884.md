In this continuing study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
of the Division of Chemistry the properties of bulk metals, metallic surfaces,
and catalytic materials are being studied with the aid of the corrected
effective medium (CEM) theory of metallic bonding. Computer programs for the
implementation of the theory are being upgraded so that increasingly larger
systems can be studied. Specific areas of investigation include studies of
hopping vs replacement mechanisms of diffusion, of the thermodynamic stability
of thin films and surface alloys, and of the kinetic processes in metallic film
growth. %%% The surfaces of metals play a particularly important role in many
physical and chemical processes including crystal growth and catalysis. Modern
computational methods based on quantum mechanical models of the electronic
structure of metals are being used in this project to obtain a better
understanding of these processes.
