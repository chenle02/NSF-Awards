Title: Mutual Climatic Range Reconstructions of Late Quaternary Climates in
Beringia The aim of this grant is to synthesize and quantify paleoclimate
reconstructions on the basis of fossil insect data from Eastern Beringia
(Alaska, the Yukon Territory) and the Bering Land Bridge using the Mutual
Climate Range (MCR) method. The Quaternary insect fossil record is a source of
proxy data that provides sensitive, accurate paleoclimatic reconstructions for
terrestrial ecosystems. As with any single source of proxy data, fossil insect
interpretations cannot provide the complete paleoenvironmental picture. This
investigation will promote interdisciplinary cooperation by generating
calibrated, quantitative paleotemperature data for fossil beetle assemblages
that will be more readily comparable to the reconstructions based on the
interpretation of other proxy data, such as pollen response surfaces and
transfer functions. A principal objective of this investigation will be to
establish the nature, timing and intensity of the major climatic transitions of
the late Pleistocene. Secondly, this method will be applied in Eastern Beringia
to calibrate existing data and provide seasonal temperature reconstructions.
