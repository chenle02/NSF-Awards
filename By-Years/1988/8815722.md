Theoretical investigations will be undertaken of nonlinear phenomena in plasmas
and fluids. The four major areas of research will be: (1) Nonlinear effects on
laser-plasma interactions, (2) solitons in optical wave guide systems, (3)
algebraic structure of integrable nonlinear dynamical systems, and (4) control
of plasma instability by neural networks. It is intended to study the effect of
an induced smooth incoherent beam on nonlinear parametric instabilities,
particularly the dramatic reduction of Raman backscattering. Analytic and
numerical calculations will be performed of the distribution and emission rate
of solitons from a resonant region as a function of pump power. Regimes will be
identified in which regular propagation of steady solitons is possible in
optical glass fibers. Attempts will be made to understand the mechanism that
makes a nonlinear dynamical system integrable. Strategies will be investigated
to feedback control macroscopic plasma instabilities through use of neural
networks; a possible model system is a nonlinear multi- resonant electrical
network with active elements.
