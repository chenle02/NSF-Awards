Biosensing using advanced semiconductor technologies and methods based on next
generation DNA sequencing generate information about biological systems at an
unprecedented scale. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT)
award prepares master's and doctoral students at Colorado State University with
the tools to extract meaning from huge amounts of sensor and genomics data.
Through innovative curricula and internships, trainees will learn to handle the
new computational, statistical, mathematical, and engineering challenges that
biologists, computer scientists, and engineers are unable to overcome alone.
This traineeship program contributes to a new generation of scientists and
engineers who are able to tackle complex problems related to large datasets in a
variety of disciplines. Moreover, this program builds a community of university,
K-12 schools, community colleges, and industry for a wider participation of
effective scientific discovery, teaching, and
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities integrated with the training
program will address themes critical to advance understanding of some
fundamental data-related questions facing biological sciences. Interdisciplinary
teams will tackle research involving biological sensors, detection of microbes,
regulation of gene expression, and evolutionary genomics and genome assembly.
Faculty across engineering, life sciences, computer science, mathematics, and
statistics will develop a flexible, customizable collection of training modules,
to create a training experience personalized for each student regardless of
their background. Trainees will develop the skills and tools to process,
analyze, visualize, and understand large datasets from biosensing and next
generation DNA sequencing. Additionally, the program incorporates a wide range
of transferrable skills training so that trainees will be well equipped to
engage and lead data-centric research within or outside academia.
