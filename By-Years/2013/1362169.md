In many models of statistical physics, such as the Ising model for
ferromagnetism, patterns and shapes emerge from randomness. Similar shapes can
be observed in various real-life situations, as the models aim to describe
natural phenomena. Whereas self-similar sets such as snowflakes look exactly the
same at different scales, the random sets the PI studies look only roughly the
same at different scales, with their appearance being described by some
probabilistic law. While these sets are easy to observe and not hard to
simulate, they are difficult to treat mathematically. The last decade has seen
dramatic progress in the understanding of such random shapes, but many
fundamental questions are still open. The PI's work aims towards resolutions of
some of these questions, and tries to provide tools to investigate the shapes of
random sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aforementioned progress is
largely based on conformal invariance properties of the scaling limits,
connecting it to the Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE. For instance, by work of
Smirnov and others, interfaces of the Ising model at criticality are forms of
SLE(3), and the scaling limit of the collection of outer loops is the Conformal
Loop Ensemble CLE(3). The PI investigates conformal representations of CLE's
using tools from circles packings, aiming at an analog of Bonk's uniformization
theorem for(deterministic) Sierpinski carpets. The PI also studies conformal
representations of planar graphs using uniformizations of flat surfaces with
cone singularities, as well as their representations as Shabat polynomials or
Belyi functions. A main goal is to establish the existence of a distributional
limit of the conformally natural embedding of random trees as the number of
edges tends to infinity. A key tool is the conformal welding of laminations of
the disc.
