Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for research to develop
accurate approaches for describing strong (also known as static or non-
dynamical) correlations in electronic structure theory. More than eighty years
after the formulation of Schrodinger's equation, computational quantum chemistry
has matured considerably, yet there remain formidable challenges to describing
the electronic structure of many molecules and solids. When near or exact
degeneracies are present, the single determinant picture breaks down and a
description of strong correlation due to these degeneracies becomes crucial for
even a qualitative description of the electronic structure. Addressing emergent
electronic phenomena in chemistry, biology, and materials science requires
calculations with significantly large active spaces, necessitating the
development of alternative, more efficient descriptions of static correlation.

The focus of this proposal is a method known as Constrained-Pairing Mean-Field
Theory or CPMFT. The work is expected to significantly enhance our ability to
model from first-principles the behavior of electrons in molecules and solids,
resulting in better understanding and prediction of materials properties and
chemical reactions. Many of the tools developed in the PI's group are widely
used in academia, national laboratories, and industry. The current work is
expected to have an equally broad impact and to contribute to the training of
students at all levels.
