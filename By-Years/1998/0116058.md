This proposal will result in a Large Angle Beamstrahlung Monitor at CESR, an
electron positron collider. Colliders have become the tool of choice for
frontier experiments in particle physics. The technique proposed here has the
potential to provide a wealth of information about beam overlap at the collision
point of colliders which can result in substantially higher luminosity, which
means more data on the rare processes of interest. In addition to improving the
performance of a collider, which is of direct interest to the particle physics
experimenters, extracting the information from the beam overlap could lead to
improvements in the understanding of the beam-beam interaction. This idea, if
can be made viable, will have application in many colliding beam accelerators.
