0107079 Wiltschko&lt;br/&gt;0107064 Sharp&lt;br/&gt;Banded fibrous veins are
common features in deformed rocks, and are classically interpreted to indicate
operation of a crack-seal mechanism in which a crack event is immediately
followed by a cement-precipitation event due to local pressure drop. However,
recent results of mass-balance considerations have cast doubt on this being a
valad mechanism. This project will examine the question of the formation of
banded veins from a new perspective model that includes two simplifying
processes - pressure exerted by growing crystals and geochemical self-
organization whereby a nearly constant fluid composition at the vein-host walls
leads to oscillations in precipitated species. A series of tests will be applied
to veins sets using both geochemical/microthermometric data and textural
information to understand chemical and mechanical processes responsible for
these types of veins. Results will help improve understanding of vein formation
and therefore their use in understanding the tectonic setting in which they
formed.&lt;br/&gt;
