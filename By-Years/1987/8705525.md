Questions concerning self knowledge have intrigued theologians and philosophers
for much of recorded history. Psychologists are now investigating the manner in
which memory structures about the self influence human information processing.
In previous research, the self has been demonstrated to be a powerful encoding
aid for adjective recall. This self- reference effect has been most often
interpreted in terms of either effecive encoding processes (elaborative
associations) or effective use of existing cognitive structures (use of internal
retrieval cues). In this research, the mnemonic potential of the self-reference
effect will be explored for the educationally relevent task of recalling prose
material. Although preliminary data indicate that the self-refernce effect found
with adjective recall does generalize to connected discourse, the operative
components and theoretical underpinnings of this effect are not well understood.
In a series of studies, a number of important issues will be addresed. In past
research, self-reference instructions have often been confounded with active
decision making. In the research to be conducted with this grant the relative
contribution of both of these processing activities to the robustness of the
self-reference effect will be assessed. Moreover, the degree to which similarity
of the prose to the reader's own experiences influences the effectiveness of
self- reference instructions will be evaluated. The relationship of this concept
of "similarity" to the "typicality" variable investigated by other researchers
will also be determined. Finally a theoretical model of the self-reference
effect will be tested. This model focuses on the associability and
constructibility of the internal cues generated by subjects at the time new
information is encoded. This model extends other models by suggesting that the
property of associability is composed of at least two aspects -- relatedness and
distinctiveness of the internal cues. The explanatory power of this three factor
model (relatedness, distinctiveness, and constructibility) will be assessed in
this research.
