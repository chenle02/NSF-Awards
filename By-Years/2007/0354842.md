This project continues a computational study of very strong field gravitational
wave sources, concentrating on the interaction of black holes. Interacting black
holes are described by Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Most approaches
to solving the ten equations of General Relativity on the computer consider use
only six of these, called the evolution equations. The remaining four, called
the constraint equations, remain solved mathematically but can become
problematical due to unavoidable numerical error in a computer simulation.
Various computational algorithms developed under prior awards, additional ones
to be developed in this project, and mathematical studies of relevant properties
of the equations will be applied to a 3D constrained (i.e. using all ten
equations) simulation of interacting black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because
the first generation of gravitational wave detectors is coming to maturity,
prediction of waveforms from astrophysical gravitational wave sources, such as
interacting black holes, is imperative. Recent developments, some of them
originated in prior work at Texas, are coming together to allow more robust and
physically relevant source simulations. These developments, very importantly,
the introduction to fully constrained evolution of the Einstein equations. This
has been made possible by a series of developments in this field, This work will
be done with a combination of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students,
and postdoctoral researchers. It will contribute to the community appreciation
of science and astrophysics in particular, and will contribute to the success
the LIGO and LISA gravitational wave detectors.
