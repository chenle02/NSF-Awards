9732637&lt;br/&gt;Lopez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award supports US-
Spain cooperative research on dynamic control and parametric excitations in
hydrodynamic systems between John Lopez and Jie Shen at The Pennsylvania State
University and Francisco Marques at the Polytechnic University of Catalunya in
Barcelona, Spain. The objective of the research is to refine the analysis and
control implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research utilizes the
complementary strengths of the two institutions. The US side will focus on
developing dynamic control of hydrodynamic flows and the Spanish side will
emphasize the dynamics of fluid flows and combined theoretical, computational,
and experimental study of hydrodynamic systems. The research will result in a
deeper understanding of the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrodynamic
systems. &lt;br/&gt;
