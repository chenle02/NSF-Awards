9629018 Wysession The P.I.'s research involves using seismology to map the
interior of the Earth, and interpreting these maps to understand the big picture
of what our planet is made of and how it works. Just as medical doctors use a
sonogram or CAT-scan to image a patient, he uses the reflecting and refracting
waves from large earthquakes to image the Earth. This most significant
contributions have come through the mapping of the highly variable boundary
between Earth's core and mantle, half-way to the center of our planet. This
information has helped change the ways geologists perceive the dynamic processes
at work inside the Earth. Over the next five years he will continue to develop
his research program in the mapping of Earth structure in several directions. He
will concentrate on the core-mantle boundary region, but will examine other
regions of the Earth, including the Earth's core, the olivine phase transitions
at depths of 410 and 660 km, and the upper mantle structure beneath spreading
plate boundaries.
