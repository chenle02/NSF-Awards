The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps proposal lies in its
potential to enable a new degree of precise control over medicines that could
substantially increase the efficacy of many current therapeutics as well as re-
invigorate the potential of drugs that previously failed clinical trials owing
to unfavorable toxicity profiles. By enabling clinician-defined control over
when and where a drug is active in the body, this technology has the potential
to improve the efficacy of on-target effects while mitigating toxic side-effects
that decrease patients' quality of life. Not only do pharmaceutical companies
invest significant time and money honing the pharmacokinetics of each drug they
bring to market, once a drug is in the clinic, companies have no means of
altering the final product to adapt to the individual needs of patients. This
project could streamline the costly process of tuning drugs' pharmacokinetics,
while also improving their efficacy for a broader patient
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
combination of two enabling technologies. It combines advances in molecular
engineering to create molecules whose activity can be controlled using different
wavelengths of light, with a process for identifying light-responsive molecules
that possess specific therapeutic properties of interest. Suites of light-
switchable molecules have been designed in non-therapeutic contexts as a proof-
of-concept, though these technologies have not yet been applied to therapeutics.
A research pipeline for applying this technology to medically important
molecules is being developed.
