This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
high-power Terahertz (THz) source concept and an overall THz system definition
for fabrication and testing under a subsequent Phase II program. THz
electromagnetic radiation, in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 THz, is the
next frontier in imaging science and technology. THz radiation promises to find
broad application in areas that embrace&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging, counter
terrorism and homeland security, and land mine detection. New initiatives and
advanced technology developments in the THz band have, to date, been very
limited because, while potentially rich, the source technology, at least for
high-power applications such as imaging, has not been developed. A unique and
extremely high power THz source that is orders of magnitude brighter in average
power than previous source technologies, thereby enabling rapid, wide field-of-
view (FOV) THz imaging for the first time will be developed. The resultant
source coupled with a detector system can in principle be used for rapid,
nondestructive, stand-off detection of hidden weapons, contraband materials such
as plastic explosives, and chemical and biological
agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing and demonstrating a novel, compact,
high-power THz source, this research seeks to capitalize on an emerging
capability to utilize THz radiation for non-destructive evaluation. Potential
applications include but are not limited to: walkthrough portals for personnel
screening, through-wall imaging for emergency personnel, stand-off explosive and
contraband detection, land mine detection for humanitarian relief, crowd and
material screening.&lt;br/&gt;
