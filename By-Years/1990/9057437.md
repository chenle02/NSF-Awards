This project addresses work in several topics, including the development of
techniques to analyze nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, and the
development of local and global techniques for understanding bifurcations and
for predicting chaotic dynamics of deterministic systems. Both analytical and
computational issues are addressed. The primary research goals are: (1) to
develop computational techniques for understanding large chaotic multi-degree of
freedom mechanical systems, (2) to develop algorithms for modeling nonlinear
distributed systems (characterized by partial differential equations) by a
finite number of ordinary differential equations, and (3) to develop symbolic
algorithms for performing feedback linearization and to design nonlinear
controllers for the nonlinear control systems defined on inertial manifolds.
