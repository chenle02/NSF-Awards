The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Roy
Glauber of Harvard University and Dr. Maciej Lewenstein of the Polish Academy of
Science's Institute for Theoretical Physics is to examine problems of
photodetection within a dielectric medium and on radiative interactions of
single atoms or ions . The researchers will continue their efforts to develop
the theoretical framework for treatment of optically pumped and dielectric media
and use it to demonstrate novel quantum mechanical effects in photon counting
distributions and related correlation functions. Results may yield a new method
of photon detection that can be used to investigate several quantum phenomena,
such as quantum mechanical tunneling, effects of cavity resonances, influence of
spatial wave packets, and the radiative interactions of ion pairs. This project
in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
