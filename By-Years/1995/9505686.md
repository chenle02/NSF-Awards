9505686 Brown The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Melissa J. Brown to work with Professor Dong
Luo of South-Central Nationalities College in the People's Republic of China.
During this award, the PI will do ethnographic fieldwork on cultural change
among the Tujia, a state-designated ethnic minority, in Fengyan Xian in western
Hunan Province with the collaboration of scholars at the Zhongnan Minzu Xueyuan
(South-Central Nationalities College), or Min Yuan, in Wuhan. Little is known
about Central China since no western anthropologists have worked there and the
Chinese scholars located there have had neither contacts or funds to disseminate
the results of their research outside China. Therefore the historical experience
of the Tujia will provide a means for examining cultural change in relation to
local structure since they changed first toward and then away from a Han Chinese
cultural model. ***
