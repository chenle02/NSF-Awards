Flexibility for product customization, low variable production cost, short lead
times, and high quality of manufacture have become essential for maintaining
competitiveness in discrete parts manufacturing. Cellular Manufacturing (CM),
the assignment of dissimilar machines and workers to a team to produce one or
more families of similar parts, has been shown to be effective at achieving all
four performance measures. This project will be devoted to enhancing the ability
to optimally design and operate CM systems. The specific objectives include: (1)
interacting with industry interested in CM to determine the real-world
objectives and key constraints of cell formation; (2) development of optimal
cell formation algorithms based on the realistic cell formation problem
formulation using discrete and stochastic optimization techniques; (3) inclusion
of human and organizational factors into the cell design problem including
issues such as group recognition systems, employee cross-training, multi-
functional operation, decentralized organizational structure, performance
measurement and activity-based costing; (4) determination of optimal cell
operation strategies for various environments including the use of pull type
systems, mixed and multiproduct model scheduling, and determination of optimal
work scope for cross-trained operators; and (5) transfer of developed techniques
to industry. Relative to existing results for CM, the research will
significantly broaden the scope of the CM design problem to include all relevant
factors including flexibility to temporal changes and training/allocation of
employees. In addition, the application of new production strategies to cells
will be examined analytically. The anticipated outcome of this project is a
clear understanding of how to optimally design and operate cells from both a
technical and human perspective, and an estimation of the improvements from CM
relative to process layouts as a function of the manufacturing environment.
