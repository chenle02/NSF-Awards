Advances in fabrication and analytical equipment have provided new opportunities
in superconductive materials and devices. A new system is procured for
deposition and analysis to fabricate and study superconductive device
structures. The system has a load-lock chamber, a sputter chamber with two well-
isolated eight-inch heads, and a separately pumped analysis chamber which is
equipped with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system for surface analysis.
The system also is equipped with an ellipsometer and a residual gas analyzer. It
will be computer-controlled for accurate repeatability of depositions, and wafer
transfer from chamber to chamber is effected without opening the system. This
system will be used to study two different types of superconductive devices. In
one, niobium or niobium nitride electrodes will be deposited on a crystalline
silicon substrate that is heavily doped in the (0.1um) gap between the
electrodes. The interfaces between the electrodes and the silicon substrate are
crucial and will be analyzed using the ESCA system. In the second case, whole-
wafer trilayers of niobium (or niobium nitride), amorphous silicon, niobium (or
niobium nitride) will be fabricated for use as Josephson junctions.
