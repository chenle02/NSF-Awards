0101111&lt;br/&gt;Spencer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support American
graduate students, middle school science teachers, and university faculty to
participate in research related activities in Japan in connection with NSF's
Summer Programs in Japan. The project is led by Professor B.F. Spencer,
Department of Civil Engineering, University of Notre Dame, in collaboration with
Professor Yozo Fujino, Department of Civil Engineering, University of Tokyo.
Faculty and students selected for the program will participate in workshops and
site visits prior to participation in the formal NSF Summer Programs. The
workshops and site visits will provide broad exposure to natural hazards
mitigation research in Japan and enable the American participants to establish
relationships with Japanese researchers and students in their field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan is a world leader in natural hazards mitigation
research. Professor Spencer's project will help connect American students and
researchers to the most active Japanese university, government and corporate
laboratories in this field. It is expected that this will have the long-term
result of increasing U.S.-Japan collaboration, to the benefit of both
countries.&lt;br/&gt;
