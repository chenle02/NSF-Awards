This research lies in the areas of numerical analysis and the mathematical
theory of fluid dynamics. Part of the work will examine stiff systems of
ordinary differential equations on a bounded interval. Such equations arise in
the study of nearly inviscid fluid flow problems, semiconductor physics, and
reaction-diffusion phenomena. Numerical methods to solve these nonlinear
equations will be developed based on continuation and linearization. The
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two space dimensions will also be
considered. Results will be tested at the level of the smallest scales. This
resolution is needed in flow problems with high Reynolds numbers. Results of
this work will be immediately relevant to the numerical simulation of
homogeneous turbulence. They will also lead to the development of better
algorithms for fluid flow problems and increased physical insight into the
mechanisms of stability and transition.
