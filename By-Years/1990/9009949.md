The surface segregation of one species from a binary polymer blend has
important consequences in determining the strength of polymer- substrate
composites. In this it is proposed to study the surface behavior of a binary
blend, in which all segments of one chain interact identically with the surface,
while the end moieties of the second species, which has the same repeat units as
the first chain, have energetic interactions with the surface that are different
from the central beads. Preliminary analytical calculations on this subject
suggest that the difference in energetic interactions between chain ends and
middle beads of the second species with the surface will dictate which component
will partition to it. It follows that one can maximize the surface segregation
of an appropriate species from the blend by controlling the chemistry of the end
moieties, thus allowing for the design of polymer composite with desired
mechanical properties. Experimentally, these theoretical predictions will be
verified by a new technique, neutron reflectivity. From a theoretical viewpoint,
analytical lattice models are being developed to examine these situations.
