9400623 Tivey In this project the PI will conduct a field study to measure
magnetization of the crust where the Jaramillo/Matuyama boundary intersects the
Blanco scarp and of the adjacent seafloor. He will do this by progressively
increasing the resolution of measurements through repeat surveying of the same
transect using surface magnetic measurements to deep-tow measurements and then
finally ALVIN measurements. The primary purpose of this study is to determine
the source for marine magnetic anomalies. This study will also provide
constraints on the time dimension of the origin of oceanic crust. ***
