The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting work by John W. Brady, Jr. at Cornell University on molecular
dynamics simulation of the conformations and dynamics of carbohydrates in water
solution. The work includes parameterization of a molecular dynamics program
especially designed to reproduce the factors controlling carbohydrate
conformational flexibility as affected by aqueous solvation. Theoretical
prediction of molecular structure by use of empirically derived vibrational
force and interaction constants has had much success both for small molecules
and in large DNA and protein studies. Little effort has been expended on the
biologically significant family of carbohydrates, probably because of the
difficulties presented by their polyfunctional, highly flexible structures. Dr.
Brady is attempting to extend the use of molecular mechanics to these systems so
that the technique can be used in studies of cell binding, antigenicity, and
viral attack.
