This project is concerned with research in the area of numerical methods for
large-scale continuous optimization. The work will focus on iterative algorithms
for linear/nonlinear/network programming and complementarity problems. It will
cover both the theory (convergence, complexity, etc.) and the practice
(implementation, numerical testing, etc.). Methods to be investigated include
(i) coordinate descent algorithms, (ii) approximate gradient algorithms, (iii)
residual reduction algorithms, (iv) multiplicative multiplier methods, and (v)
operator splitting algorithms. Particular attention will be paid to the
efficient implementation of these algorithms on sequential and parallel
machines. The computer codes produced by the study will be made freely available
to the research community for dissemination.
