Topology is the study of objects up to rubbery stretching, and geometry the
study of rigid bodies. The goal of this project is to understand certain
fundamental problems in these areas by combining surprising relationships
between them with deep connections to other areas of mathematics and computer
science. Both topology and geometry are becoming more important to applications
such as data mining, and this project includes collaboration with computer
scientists as well as developing software for exploring aspects of these
problems which will be freely available to other researchers via the
web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on four topics. The first is
effective Mostow rigidity and torsion growth, specifically, the extent to which
topological and geometric properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be varied
independently. The second is the computational complexity of finding the genus
of a knot in the 3-sphere, in particular whether it can be determined in
polynomial time. The third question is whether there exists a word-hyperbolic
surface-by-surface group. The final topic is to elucidate the relationships
between Heegaard-Floer homology, group orderability, and taut foliations for
3-manifolds.
