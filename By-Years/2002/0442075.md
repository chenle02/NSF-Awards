Plasma instabilities and turbulence in the auroral and equatorial electrojet
currents are investigated using numerical simulations. The particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulator is expanded to 3-dimensional capability using new parallel
computing capability, and the three dimensional simulations are the first such
3-D descriptions of kinetic E-region turbulence. The mechanisms by which thermal
gradients within waves and within the ambient atmosphere drive or modify wave
growth and wave evolution are revealed in this new 3-D simulation. By
consequence of the new insights gleaned from the simulators, interpretation of
radar echos from E-region instabilities becomes more precise, and the diagnostic
and predictive capabilities of the Aeronomy and Space-Weather communities are
enhanced. Improved numerical plasma simulators are useful to many aspects of
applied and theoretical plasma physics research, and this research is expected
to benefit a large cross-section of the plasmasphere community.
