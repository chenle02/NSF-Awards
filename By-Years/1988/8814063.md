The research described in this dissertation proposal will examine a variety of
influences on the process of becoming a scientist. A series of sophisticated
multivariate analyses will be carried out using several existing data sets: the
1962 and 1973 Postcensal Study of Professional and Technical Manpower; several
panels of the Survey of Science and Engineering Graduates (the NSF New Entrants
Study); and both 1962 and 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey.
Influences on this process which will be studied include demographic factors
(such as race/ethnicity, gender, birth cohort), socioeconomic factors (parents'
education, occupational status), other background variables (father a scientist)
and ability. The process itself will be represented by such variables as the
expressed aspirations for becoming a scientist upon high school graduation,
whether students remain science majors or change into or out of a science major
during college, the likelihood of attaining a college degree in science, the
likelihood of continuing on in science after completing a bachelor's or master's
level science degree, and the likelihood of moving into adjacent science fields
following graduation from college. The project should make a major contribution
to our theoretical and empirical understanding of how social factors shape some
of the events between high school and mid-career which take place among students
who may potentially become college educated scientists. This research should
inform efforts to address current and expected shortages of science personnel,
male or female.
