DMS-9500915 Mizel This is a proposal for a research project in mathematics.
Part I of this proposal involves work on the foundations of the calculus of
variations and control theory. Part II involves work on simplified models for
materials possessing higher order and nontrivial microstructure, as well as work
involving control problems for matterials which are in the liquid crystal state.
In each part, the proposed research represents, in part, a further development
of previously accomplished work, and , in part, the introduction of new research
topics. In part I, renewed interest in a gap phenomenon discovered by Lavrentiev
in 1926 has come about because of the potential implications for nonlinear
elasticity and related subjects. The recently gained insights into this
phenomenon in first order one-dimensional Lagrange problems are now being
supplemented by the study of higher order problems in one-dimension, by the
study of first order problems in higher dimensions, and by the study of
isoperimetrically constrained problems in higher dimensions. In part II, a
homogenization method for examining a simplified model of a second order
nonlinear material leads to a characterization and minimization problem
involving Young measures which is currently being investigated, and a study of
the implications of polyconvexity for initation of fracture in isotropic
materials is under way..
