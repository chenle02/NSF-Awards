This award provides funds to enhance the introductory biology labs at Texas
A&amp;M University by upgrading laboratory instrumentation, so students can use
state-of-the-art equipment to design and perform their own experiments in both
formal and less structured laboratory exercises. Biotechnology is being
incorporated into the laboratory curriculum to complement lecture topics in
molecular biology. The purchased equipment is necessary for students to have
hands-on experience with electrophoresis and restriction enzyme analysis -- two
techniques widely used by researchers in molecular biology. Computers will be
purchased to interface with laboratory equipment so that students can design and
perform experiments with more costly equipment. Students will use these in
conjunction with existing equipment to design their own experiments, analyzing
data and write a report. Because of the versatility and affordability of the new
teaching technology students can be involved directly in data acquisition and
analysis and rely less on demonstrations. The grantee is matching this award
with non-Federal sources.
