One mode of speciation that has been proposed for plants in general, and
especially flowering plants, is diploid/diploid hybridization. This idea is in
wide currency among plant evolutionary biologists although there a no
unequivocal examples of this process and theoretically it seems highly unlikely.
The PI proposes the test to chart the evolutionary genetics of three putative
examples of this mode of speciation. In the process, he anticipates additional
tests of the hypothesis that the three species are of hybrid origin. Subsequent
events, such as chromosomal rearrangement, that might have had a bearing on the
success of the hybrids and on isolation barriers will also be explored. Because
hybridization has been assumed to be of widespread importance among the
flowering plants, the results of this study could have a profound influence on
our concepts of plant evolution.
