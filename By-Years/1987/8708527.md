Started in 1979, then repeated every two years, the Conversation in the
Discipline: Biomolecular Stereodynamics, has become the principal meeting for
discussion and debate of the developing ideas and discoveries in biological
structure, dynamics, interactions and expression. Over 500 scientists from both
the U.S. and foreign countries attended the last meeting. Both young and senior
scientists from around the world will meet in June for the Fifth Conversation to
discuss and debate developing ideas and discoveries in biological structure,
dynamics, interaction and expression. In addition, there will be a panel
discussion on DNA bending and curvature. Currently there is a true fusion of
some of the elements of technologies in instrumentation are allowing scientists
to explore the frontiers of this discipline. The Program recommends support.
