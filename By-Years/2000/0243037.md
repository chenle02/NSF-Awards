0086363&lt;br/&gt;Podila&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Gopia Podila and students
from the Michigan Technological University in a collaboration Robin Sen of the
Department of Biology at the University of Helsinki, Finland. The project will
focus on the molecular characterization of cellular development and functioning
processes in conifer ectomycorrhizae, which are symbiotic root-fungal organs
essential for seedling establishment and tree growth in nutrient-limited soils.
The essence of the symbiosis is that the fungus provides roots with needed
nitrogen and phosphorus in exchange for carbon at the root-fungus interface. A
deeper understanding of the functional genomics of the symbiosis is an essential
part of forest science and has considerable potential in future forest
biotechnology applications the U.S. and Finland. Each lab brings unique
equipment and expertise to the research, and the collaboration is a perfect
match for advancing fundamental knowledge of the molecular bases of
ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to add
an international dimension to their training and to allow them to establish
international connections early in their careers.&lt;br/&gt;
