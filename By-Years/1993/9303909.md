a mineral separation system to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology at Kent State University. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The Principal Investigator and
students are involved in research in tectonics and geochronology which requires
extensive use of mineral separates. ***
