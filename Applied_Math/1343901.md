This NSF award supports the "Conference on integrable systems, random matrix
theory, and combinatorics", which will take place at the University of Arizona,
October 23-27, 2013. The goal of the conference is to foster interaction between
researchers in integrable partial differential equations and researchers working
in random matrix theory and combinatorics. The event is timely because
integrable methods are now ready to have an impact on problems of graphical
enumeration and newly discovered combinatorial identities make the rigorous
proof of the full expansion of partition functions a reachable goal. The
conference will include morning lectures on the most recent developments in
random matrix theory and integrable systems, followed by afternoon workshops to
investigate new research directions and collaborations in these areas. The
majority of the participants will consist of junior researchers and graduate
students. Information about the conference can be found at the conference
website http://math.arizona.edu/mcl/CombConf.htm.

The main objective of the conference is to promote research and education in the
areas of partial differential equations and random matrix theory and
combinatorics, and to bring together senior researchers, junior researchers and
graduate students from two exciting active areas in mathematics with potential
applications to mathematical biology and theoretical physics.
