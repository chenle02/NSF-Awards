This award supports a multidisciplinary study of three lakes in eastern
interior Alaska to investigate how lake-levels, vegetation, and sedimentary
processes are related to climate change. The study will focus on the late
Wisconsin and early Holocene (c.a. 14,000 to 6000 years B.P.), a period of
marked and relatively rapid climatic change. The lakes are expected to be
sensitive to climatic fluctuations and have sedimentation rates rapid enough to
record high-frequency events. This work has three components: 1. assessment of
the detail with which a lake-level record can be constructed; 2. comparison of
high resolution records of vegetation change from fossil pollen with the lake-
level record to examine how lakes and vegetation differ in their response to
climate change; 3. the construction of basic hydrologic budgets for each lake
and their use to estimate past values of important parameters of the hydrologic
system, in particular precipitation. This project represents an element of the
PALE project (Paleoclimates of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries).
