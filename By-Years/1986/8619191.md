This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will be undertaken by
Dr. Vernon Asper, a post-doctoral assistant professor at the Center for Marine
Science at the University of Southern Mississippi. The project's goal is to
develop an integrated camera system to assess the flux, abundance, and sinking
speed of marine snow aggregates in the open ocean. The system will include dual
cameras, customized electronics, CTD, a transmissometer, and a specially
designed settling chamber. The system is designed to improve upon an earlier
prototype system. It will provide scientific information that cannot readily be
obtained by existing methods. The project is in response to a long-term
requirement of marine chemists and biological oceanographers to measure the
abundance, distribution, and settling rates of microscopic particles in the
ocean. The information is needed to better understand their role in the marine
ecosystem and in sedimentation processes. The extremely frail nature of these
ubiquitous particles makes these measurements very difficult to obtain, and an
in-situ camera system is the most reliable way to obtain high quality data. The
proposal includes plans to test and use the proposed instrumentation on funded
research projects and to make it available to other scientists.
