Nonlinear evolution equations, also known as soliton equations, are used to
model a wide variety of physical systems, such as ocean waves or fiber optic
communications. Many such equations, for example the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
equation for waves in shallow water, have the exciting feature that many of
their solutions can be given exactly by an explicit formula. This allows one to
develop a precise understanding of the underlying physical processes. However,
the range of conditions for which exact solutions are currently known is
restrictive, inhibiting the use of such solutions in real-world applications.
This project aims to find larger families of exact solutions to soliton
equations, and use these solutions to develop statistical theories of the
corresponding physical systems. The main goal of the project is to construct and
study new families of solutions of soliton equations such as KdV, Nonlinear
Schr√∂dinger, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili. These solutions are obtained as limits
of multisoliton solutions, and are bounded and non-decreasing at infinity. They
are described by a Riemann-Hilbert problem and can be efficiently computed
numerically. The first goal is a rigorous mathematical description of these new
solutions. The PIs will investigate to what extent these solutions solve the
initial value problem for KdV and related systems. They will study spectral
properties of the associated linear operators and construct non-periodic one-
dimensional ideal conductors. Finally, the PIs will develop a statistical theory
of integrable turbulence for KdV and other soliton equations.
