Project Abstract INTERACTIVE EPISTEMOLOGY In game theory and its applications
to interactive contexts like economics, national and international politics,
ecology, computer science, law, and social psychology, it is important to
consider what the protagonists know and believe about what other protagonists
know and believe. This area of research is called `Interactive Epistemology.`
The current study concentrates on two aspects: (1) The consequences of assuming
`Common Knowledge of Rationality` -- that all protagonists are rational, all
know that, all know THAT, and so on; and (2) developing a `syntactic` model of
interactive belief, in which events are described in plain language, rather than
the better known but less transparent `semantic` model, in which events are
characterized as sets of `states of the world.`
