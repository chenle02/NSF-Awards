Emerging machine learning and data-driven applications are bringing smart
technology, new functionality, and automated decision-making to devices and
systems ranging from consumer products to major public infrastructure. These new
capabilities require real-time scheduling where each intelligent software and
their interaction must be performed in a timely manner for safe and successful
operation. Doing so effectively calls for innovative approaches to the
scheduling methodologies. This project will produce three important advances:
(1) improving the real-time performance of data-intensive applications on
heterogeneous embedded hardware architectures, (2) exploiting application-level
requirements for data-oriented scheduling and efficient system design, and (3)
enabling intelligent applications to deal with software infrastructure failures
and dynamic environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
enable greater capabilities across the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-
physical systems like smart cars, smart buildings, factory automation, and
mobile health. It will encourage more robust design of these systems so that
they are easier to build, more resource-efficient to operate, and more
trustworthy and reliable. This will make it possible to adopt intelligent real-
time systems in applications where safety and timeliness are essential. The
tools developed in this project will be made publicly available, serving as a
design tool for industry and an educational tool for colleges and universities.
Further, the research will serve as the foundation for education and training
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
