9410138 Halloran This career advancement award provides support for research in
the areas of mathematical statistics and bio-statistics, concentrating on the
understanding and development of statistical inference with particular
applications to the analysis of diseases. Particular emphasis is on decision or
inference, on testing or estimation, the use of prior information, location and
nature of inference and sensitivity of sampling procedure. Development of skill
involving statistical computing will play a major role in this activity. Methods
such as bootstrap, exploration of posterior distributions and likelihood
functions, Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms will be explored. Some of these
studies will take place at the University of Minnesota where methods and
applications of Bayes and empirical Bayesian methods of inference are being
developed. Statistical methods in the analysis of causal inference, especially
in studies of spread of infectious diseases and effectiveness of vaccines is an
important and highly developed component of the mathematical sciences. This
project will continue this effort in the study of disease transmission and
designs for vaccine evaluation. ***
