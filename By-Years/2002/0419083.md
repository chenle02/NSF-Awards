This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
processing approaches for fabrication of mixed proton-electron conducting
membranes that will be used in the future for economical production of high-
purity hydrogen derived from biomass and coal. The objective of this Phase I
program will be to demonstrate the feasibility of novel processing methods to
fabricate thin (< 15 micon thickness), supported mixed proton-electron-
conducting membranes. The novel processing methods will be demonstrated via
fabrication of supported membranes on small porous disk supports. The hydrogen
separation properties of these membranes at elevated temperatures will be
evaluated using a bench-scale test system.

The impact of the proposed research would include facilitation of
commercialization of hydrogen-powered vehicles and improvement of the economics
and environmental impact of stationary power generation processes. Such
development would also lessen the dependence of the Nation's economy on foreign
oil imports.
