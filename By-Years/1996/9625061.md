9625061 Duenyas The research focus of this CAREER award is on new techniques,
structural results, and approximations for dynamic production control in the
presence of variability. The research develops effective control mechanisms in
three main areas: batch processing machines, machines with significant setup
times, and time-constrained ("perishable") processors. The investigator will
apply results from semi-Markov decision theory, closed queueing network
analysis, and stochastic ordering to obtain structural results for small
problems that guide the development of heuristic techniques for larger problems.
The teaching plan includes the development of a new course integrating
manufacturing processes and planning that will be offered in conjunction with a
federally-funded educational coalition whose mission is the development of
manufacturing expertise in a disadvantaged, inner-city population. Production
control problems addressed in this research are particularly relevant in the
manufacture of semiconductor devices and flat-panel displays, both critical
industries for U.S. military and economic competitiveness. The investigator will
work closely with manufacturers in both industries, including a developer of
commercial factory planning/scheduling software for the flat-panel display
industry. This research has the potential to increase both yield and throughput
in these manufacturing facilities.
