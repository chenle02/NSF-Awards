9632927 Storm This grant supports a conference on recent advances in the
understanding of fundamentals of formation and breakdown of oxide films on
metals and on other protective films and layers of special interest to aqueous
corrosion. There are individual sessions on oxide films on metals and their
breakdown, localized breakdown of passive films and microscopic techniques for
study, coating and corrosion protection, corrosion in electronic and
communication systems, and mechanical and chemical effects on oxide film
adhesion and fracture. Scientists from six countries are represented at the
meeting. The $4,000 supports student researchers to attend the meeting and
present posters. %%% The conference explores new developments in the field of
corrosion, which is a continuing problem in the performance life of materials
used in industrial machinery, transportation, and raw materials production. ***
