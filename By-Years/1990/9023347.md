This project describes the synthesis of novel organic materials that will serve
as precursors for the preparation of organic superconductors. The synthesis of
the organic compounds, the preparation of the organic conductors by
electrocrystallization, and the structural characterization of these novel
conducting materials will be carried out at Indiana University. Transport
measurements, Meisner effect determinations, and more demanding structural
studies such as neutron diffraction will be done at Argonne National
Laboratories, and a collaboration on quantum chemistry/physics and band
calculations will be done jointly with North Carolina State University.
