User errors or delays while performing security-critical tasks can lead to
undesirable or even disastrous consequences. The impact of both accidental and
intentional distractions on users in such situations has received little
investigation. In particular, it is unclear whether and how sensory stimuli
(e.g., sound or light) influence users' behavior and trigger mistakes. Better
understanding of the effects of such distractions can lead to increased user
awareness and countermeasures. Preliminary studies suggest somewhat surprising
effects of auditory distractions; this project develops an unattended study
allowing more rigorous evaluation of the impact of
distractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project conducts controlled user studies
to examine the effects of different sound variations on participants' speed and
accuracy when logging into a computer network, controlling for participants'
awareness of the distraction event. Existing theory suggests auditory
distractions can both improve and degrade performance; this will be carefully
evaluated to determine how various stimuli impact security actions. The
experiments will be conducted in a fully automated manner, which makes large-
scale studies feasible and also avoids any potential experimenter bias.
