The research supported by this award focuses on large random structures that
have strong motivation from a number of physical disciplines. The PI attempts to
improve understanding on a range of fundamental models and phenomena in
mathematical physics and computer science, including the insulator-conductor
transition, the limit of computing power in solving realistic problems, and some
two-dimensional random surface models of importance to conformal field theory.
In addition, the PI is actively collaborating on application-oriented projects,
and one of the specific goals is to help consolidating theoretical foundations
for some statistical learning procedures. Finally, the PI intends to provide
research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in
probability theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study limiting behavior for
stochastic models with emphasis on geometric, optimizational and spectral
aspects as well as interactions among them. The stochastic processes under
consideration cover a wide range of spectrum and are of fundamental importance
in respective research communities. For instance, random geometry of Gaussian
free field has been a phenomenal research topic in two-dimensional probability,
and the closely related Liouville quantum gravity surfaces can be thought of as
the canonical models of random two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds; random
constraint satisfaction problems have strong connections with spin glass theory
and complexity theory, and it is of major interest to understand the connections
between the phase transitions of the solution spaces and the algorithmic
transitions; random field model has been a classic example in understanding how
presence of disorder affects the behavior of statistical physics models;
Anderson localization for random Schroedinger operators is motivated by
understanding the conductor-insulator transition. In order to make progress on
these problems, the PI will attempt to bring in new insights from physics,
develop new mathematical tools and identify new connections among different
mathematical branches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
