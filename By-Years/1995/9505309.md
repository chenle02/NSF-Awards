9505309 Lee This research is to optimize the thermal performance of woven fabric
components. A micro-structure engineered material approach will provide the tool
for predicting the radiative properties of multi-layer fibrous composites. The
morphology of the material is accounted for through a solution to Maxwell's
relations. Experimental measurements of the bi-directional and hemispherical
transmittance and reflectance of the specimen will also be taken. A computer
program will be developed for performing optimization and design analyses. The
technology developed will result in a unique optimization software for the
design of advanced fibrous composites and the optimization of existing
materials. The design and improvement of such materials will ensure substantial
cost savings for the development of advanced fibrous composites for applications
in aerospace, industrial, and personnel fire-protection clothing.
