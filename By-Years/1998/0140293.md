&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with research activities that will lead to the
detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays to study their origin and identity.
The PI's proposal will enable him to cover the following
responsibilities:&lt;br/&gt;1. Management, integration, and quality assurance of
surface detector elements.&lt;br/&gt;2. Implementation of detector trigger and
calibration schemes and refine software for event
reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;Funding is recommended at a slightly reduced level, a
level that will enable the PI to fulfill his commitment at the rate AUGER is
progressing.&lt;br/&gt;
