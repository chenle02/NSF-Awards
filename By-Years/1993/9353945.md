9353945 Hubbard SUNY College at Brockport in cooperation with the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) and the American Water Resources Association (AWRA)
will conduct a Water Science Workshop for Science and Engineering Faculty and
for Education Faculty who direct the preparation of middle school and secondary
science teachers. The purpose of the two-week workshop is (a) to provide
participants up-to-date learning in the science of hydrology, (b) to make
available learning materials such that each participant leaves with a water
science teaching kit which emphasizes first-hand learning in hydrology, (c) to
acquaint participants with the instructional potential of materials and
information available from the USGS-WRD including the AWRA/Department of
Interior Water Education Initiative, and (d) to promote learning by pre-service
teachers through participant-conducted Water Resources Education Agent (WREA)
Workshops during the following Academic Year, with the objective that pre-
service teachers will multiply the effort by themselves acting as WREAs. A one-
week follow-up workshop will focus on evaluation, revision and further
implementation of WREA activities. Presentation of the WREA experience and
educational materials and additional follow-up will take place as part of the
Thirty-First AWRA Conference in Houston in Fall 1995. ***
