Professor Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop general theoretical methods for
studying glassy states of chemical systems. The two major aims of the research
are to : 1) investigate the efficacy of density functional theory (DFT) in
describing the nature of glassy states; and 2) to develop generalized ergodic
measures to ascertain the onset of activated transitions and to estimate the
average free energy of activation separating various glassy minima. Thirumalai
will develop methodologies based on the properties of eigenvectors of the
instantaneous dynamical matrix to describe the optimal reaction pathway for
structural relaxation. These methodologies will be applied to "soft" colloidal
glasses such as O-terphenyl and glycerol as test cases. %%% Glasses are non-
crystalline states of matter which have unique materials properties of
significant commercial importance. Glassy states exist in many chemical systems
including polymeric materials and biological systems such as DNA and RNA.
Thirumalai's research employs statistical mechanical methods to the study of
glassy materials in an attempt to obtain a molecular level understanding of the
physical properties which are unique to this class of materials.
