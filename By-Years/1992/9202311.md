The goal of this research is to identify and synthesize a polymer system to
serve as a scaffold for functioning mammalian cells. The optimal polymer system
would maximize cellular function in vivo. The basic requirements for the
scaffold include biodegradability, biocompatibility, suitable mechanical
properties, and an adhesive moiety to facilitate cell attachment. In order to
reach this goal, several steps need to be completed. The exact ordering of the
polymer processing and adhesion moiety attachment steps will be determined
during the project. Cell culture studies will be conducted on these polymers in
vitro, and surgical implantation of these systems with an assessment of
structure and function in vivo will be attempted.
