Abstract 9513864 Fewtrell This proposal is to study the role of calcium in
stimulus-response coupling in non-excitable cells. Both the amplitude of the
calcium signal and its frequency of calcium oscillations have been found to be
important, as well as additional signals like protein kinase C. In this proposal
the temporal relation between changes in intracellular calcium and secretion
will be studied in single cells using a mucosal mast cell line. Intracellular
calcium will be measured by indo-1 photometry, and the secretion of individual
serotonin-containing granules will be measured simultaneously in the same cell
by constant potential amperometry. This will determine the calcium response
associated with a burst of secretion. Fluorescence imaging will be used to
monitor the calcium responses of a number of cells simultaneously. These calcium
responses will be measured in response to a number of different stimuli. %%%
This project will examine the role of calcium in the secretory response of mast
cells to specific effectors, which is a type of stimulus response coupling, that
occurs in many physiological responses. ***
