The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Ralph
Jaccodine of Lehigh University and Dr. Wojciech Fabianowski of Warsaw Technical
University is to examine and characterize new monolayer coupling agents which
interact both with metal and polymers. The researchers intend to determine the
mechanical and electrical properties of these metal-monolayer-polymer composite
structures. Results should be useful in addressing multiple problems associated
with joining dissimilar materials in a range of applications. This project in
materials research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
