9507994 HEDLIN This research is to analyze global network recordings of short-
period precursors to the inner-core seismic phase PKP(DF) in order to test the
feasibility of directly imaging small scatterers at or near the core-mantle
boundary (CMB). The expectation is that migration techniques developed for
crustal scattering problems can be used to back-project precursor energy from
the free-surface to the CMB. A goal is to identify areas in which we have
sufficient resolution to image small-scale CMB scatterers and to discriminate
between core entry and exit point structure. Following synthetic experiments, a
comprehensive analysis will be done of PKP(DF) precursors in all available
short-period and broadband data from the global seismic networks. This research
is a component of the Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior program.
