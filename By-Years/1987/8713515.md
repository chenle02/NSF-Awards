Multilayer devices are made by depositing thin films of two materials in an
alternating sequence. Multilayer monochromators have been fabricated with
d-spacings within the 60-200 Angstrom range with reflectivities greater than
95%. The use of such monochromators in small angle scattering experiments has
resulted in an increased flux and better resolution of the spectrometer. The
automated rf sputtering system will be used to make a series of spectrometer-
specific multilayers. These multilayers will include: multiple d-spacing
multilayers for the small angle station which will increase the flux in the high
wavelength range; multilayers with a gradation of d-spacings along their length;
guidetubes with top and bottom surfaces made of supermirrors; and focussing
multilayers for converging the vertical spread of the beam. Spectrometers can be
used in biology to study macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, lipid complexes,
virus particles, and polymers. Multilayer monochromators are components of
spectrometers which determine the wavelength of the neutron beam used to study
macromolecule samples. Improvement in the resolution of the neutron spectrometer
will increase its efficacy for structural work.
