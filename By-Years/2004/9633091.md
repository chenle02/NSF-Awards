9633091 POPP The isotopic carbon composition of the marine phytoplankton
reflects not only the isotopic composition of seawater but also the
environmental conditions under which photosynthesis occurs. Oceanographers and
paleontologists are particularly interested in how phytoplankton isotopic
composition is related to ambient temperature so that fossil organic matter
preserved in marine sediments might be used to infer climatic conditions in the
geologic past. Because variety of factors is responsible for the algal isotopic
composition actually found, there is a need to understand their individual and
collective impact. This research team from the University of Hawaii and the
Scotia Institute of Oceanography will use laboratory and field studies to
examine how conditions such as physiological state, growth rate, and
environmental conditions affect carbon isotopic 'fractionation' by the
phyplankton. The laboratory studies will involve careful culture work with two
algal species, and the results will be compared to samples collected from the
water column and sediments of the Arabian Sea and at the Hawaiian Ocean Time-
Series station near Oahu using a mathematical model relating various
physiological and environmental factors to algal isotopic composition.
