9514698 Mayfield The general aims of this research are to understand
translational regulation of chloroplast gene expression. Nuclear genes that
regulate translation of chloroplast mRNAs are being isolated and characterized.
These genes have been tagged by insertional mutagenesis in the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Nuclear genes and gene products required for the
translation of the pbsA mRNA, which encodes the light regulated D1 protein of
the photosystem II reaction center, are being identified. These genes are being
cloned and their protein products characterized. From this analysis it should be
possible to identify proteins that function in all aspects of translation of
chloroplast mRNAs. This would include translation initiation factors, elongation
factors, and even signal transduction proteins. The approach is a genetic one
and makes no assumptions about what type of proteins might be identified. It is
expected that some of these genes may encode proteins that directly interact
with the 5' untranslated region of the messenger RNA, which are being studied
under another grant. Formation of the chloroplast and its ability to
photosynthesize is dependent upon developmental and environmental signals, and
requires close cooperation of the genomes of the chloroplast and nucleus. This
research is expected to make an important contribution to our understanding of
the regulation of the genes involved in photosynthesis, a process used by plants
to utilize energy from light. ***
