Imagine a child who encounters a sea lion for the first time and learns that it
is a mammal. What do they retain and abstract from this experience? How do they
use this knowledge to make sense of future examples? With the funding of an NSF
CAREER Award, Dr. Bradley Love will develop a general model of human learning to
account for learning from examples and direct instruction. The model represents
human knowledge in terms of natural bundles of information, referred to as
clusters. For instance knowledge of mammals might consist of several clusters to
include primates, four-legged mammals, sea lions and whales, bats, and so on.
The models learning procedures alter clusters to suit learners' variety of
goals. For instance the goals with respect to sea lions of a marine biologist
and fishing-vessel captain can be quite different and knowledge is organized to
reflect such differences. Behavioral studies involving undergraduate and primary
school students will test the model's predictions.&lt;br/&gt;The integration of
research and education figures prominently in this CAREER project. Dr. Love's
undergraduate research courses will center on the actual experiments that
involve primary school students. For instance classroom lessons in experimental
design will involve considering and critiquing the designs of these primary
school studies. Undergraduates will assist in the actual research and
undergraduate students will participate in outreach activities to provide
primary school students, teachers, and parents with an understanding of
psychology as a science. These combined activities are all aimed to advance our
understanding of human learning, increase the effectiveness of classroom
learning, and educate undergraduates and the community at large about the
science of learning.&lt;br/&gt;
