ABSTRACT --- CTS-9311848 Controlled thermal combustion offers the potential as
an effective treatment process for the disposal of organic hazardous chemical
wastes. Senkan and Gutman have developed an approach which they refer to as
their integrated macroscopic-microscopic program and it is proposed to expand
this work to the study of chlorinated C3 alkanes, alkenes and dichlorobenzene
with particular attention given to isomer specific reactions. Senkan will have
cognizance over the macroscopic program in which CHC's are burned in a flat
flame configuration or in heated flow reactors for the determination of
concentration profiles of reactants, intermediates and products. Specifically,
concentration profiles of the major and minor intermediates in the combustion of
1-C3H7Cl, 2-C3H7Cl, CH2CHCH2Cl, CH2CClCH3, CHClCHCH3, and o-, p-, and m--C6H4Cl2
at one atmosphere will be determined. These data will be used to develop
Detailed Chemical Kinetic Mechanisms (DCKM) describing the combustion. The
microscopic portion of the program will be undertaken by Gutman, using laser
photolysis and photoionization mass spectrometry to study individual elemental
reactions of chlorine-containing free radicals and of atoms and free radicals
with chlorine-containing stable reaction intermediates and products. In addition
computational studies of the rates of individual elemental reactions using
quantum mechanical and SAR techniques will be conducted. Sensitivity analysis
will be used to determine new rank-order of reactions.
