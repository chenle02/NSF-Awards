This is funding to support a one day interdisciplinary Workshop on Interactive
Systems in Healthcare 2011 (WISH 2011), to be held on October 22, 2011 in
conjunction with the 2011 Annual Meeting of the American Medical Informatics
Association (AMIA). The workshop will bring together a diverse set of
researchers from a range of disciplines, all of whom do research relevant to the
development of Interactive Systems for Healthcare but who rarely have
opportunities to interact. Attendees will include specialists in medical
informatics, nursing informatics, medical sociology, human-computer interaction,
and related fields. The goal is to promote interdisciplinary exchange of ideas
about this important area of research and to advance the development of new
healthcare technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be selected
through a peer review process based on materials submitted in response to the
call for papers. The submission materials include a five-page paper in the AMIA
submission format, including an abstract and a description of the participantÂ¨Vs
research. The papers for accepted participants will be available as part of the
WISH proceedings. Selected papers will be presented as either short talks or
interactive posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Addressing the
complex interplay between human, organizational, and technological systems in
healthcare is an important research area with the potential to impact quality,
safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care in America. The workshop
will improve attendees' current research projects through interdisciplinary
feedback from other workshop participants, promote this area of research more
generally through its visibility at the AMIA conference, lead to new
interdisciplinary collaborations that can advance medical informatics, and help
educate graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who want to work in this
area. A workshop website and proceedings will make the content widely available
to other researchers and the general public.
