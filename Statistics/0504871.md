This project develops a comprehensive approach to estimation, model selection
and inferences for certain regression models, with applications to health
sciences, economics, astronomy as well as other disciplines of scientific
investigations. Various parts of the project are connected through several key
components: computational aspect is handled by linear programming, inferences by
simulation-based resampling, simultaneous estimation and model selection by
suitably constructed penalty functions, and asymptotic properties by empirical
process theory. The investigator develops efficient algorithms for parameter
estimation and distributional approximation, establishes small and large sample
properties, and extends the methods and theory to data with censoring,
truncation or other kind of non-random missingness.

This research project is motivated by and closely related to many important
areas of scientific disciplines, including health and life sciences, economics,
astronomy and sociology. It develops new tools to assess health risks, drugs and
treatments effects and genetic variations, to analyze policy formation, such as
intervention in unemployment and health insurance, as well as to understand
astronomical phenomena. It provides a platform to attract and train students
with tools for multi-disciplinary applications.
