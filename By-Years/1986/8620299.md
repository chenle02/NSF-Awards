The biennial publication of the proceeding of the International Symposium is one
of the most valuable ongoing contributions to the scientific literature. Support
(to the extent of $4,000) is a fine investment to make in connection with the
1986 Symposium. A 12-month grant is recommended from FY87 funds in the amount of
$4,000.
