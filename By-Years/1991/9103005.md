This grant is to investigate and develop a working example of a new class of
signal channel demultiplexers that are intended for use in fiber optic
communication systems. The proposed demultiplexers employ the dynamics of
photorefractive elements to separate the channels through a competitive
interaction among modes of a collection of ring oscillators. The most remarkable
property of the proposed systems is their ability to separate channels through a
self- organizing process: unlike most other techniques, these optical circuits
need to "know" very little about the incoming signals; in particular, one need
not specify or know the frequency (or wavelength) of the incoming optical
channels. By their very nature, the photorefractive circuits will tend to track
drifts in the frequency of the signal source. They furthermore can accommodate
spatial information and may therefore be applied to multimode fiber
communication systems.
