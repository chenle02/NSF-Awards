This research is aimed at obtaining data to validate numerical modeling of two-
phase flow in porous media relevant to enhanced oil recovery. The temporal and
spatial variations of fluid saturation within a porous medium will be mapped
using X-ray computer tomography imaging technology. This same technique will be
used to obtain information on the local porosity (and hence permeability) of the
porous media. Miscible, immiscible and gas displacements will be visualized. The
research may contribute to more efficient recovery of petroleum from reservoirs.
