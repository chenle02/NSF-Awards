This Targeted Research project is examining systemic issues that directly impact
classroom teaching and learning in science, technology, and mathematics at the
critical middle school level. In addition, the project is informing the
development of an important component of a new NSDL portal targeting K-12
science and mathematics teachers. Through surveys, experimental studies, focus
groups, interviews, and observations of teacher activities in curricular
development and classroom practice, the project is establishing a research
foundation to successfully develop and deploy new K-12 resources within NSDL and
promote high quality teaching that integrates digital resources. The project is
using multiple mechanisms to disseminate the research results including formal
research reports and white papers, practical workshops, classroom Web resources
for and by teachers, and involvement of learning communities. The Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences (MPS) is providing significant co-funding of this project in
recognition of the value of this work in advancing the larger educational goals
of MPS.
