This award will provide support for participants in the "Workshop in Dynamical
Systems and Related Topics" for years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. This is a
long-standing series of conferences that are held each fall at Pennsylvania
State University-University Park. The theme of the Penn State dynamics workshop
varies from year to year; the focus areas include smooth ergodic theory,
rigidity theory, smooth group actions, and classical mechanics.

The format of the conference provides ample opportunities for young
mathematicians to present their work and otherwise to participate fully in
conference activities. The bulk of the support goes to graduate students,
postdocs, young faculty and women. A specific feature of the conference in the
odd years is the announcement of the winner of the bi-yearly Michael Brin Prize
in Dynamical Systems, endowed by the father of one the founders of Google,
Professor Emeritus of the University of Maryland Michael Brin, and a special
session featuring talks on the winner's work by the leading international
experts in the area.
