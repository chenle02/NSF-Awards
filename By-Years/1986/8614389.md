The purpose of this project is to develop a complete exhibition kit on the topic
of biological diversity that can be used in a wide variety of settings,
including schools, museums and libraries. The kit will include a series of
poster panels, an accompanying audio-visual presentation, and an owner's manual
that includes programs and ideas for educators to use in conjunction with the
exhibit. The exhibition will be developed by the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), building on a National Forum on
BioDiversity to be sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian and the National Academy
of Sciences in September 1986. The objective of this exhibit is to educate the
public about the need to maintain global biological diversity, the ways in which
it is currently threatened, and steps to preserve diversity of organisms and
environments. Each year, due to a wide variety of factors, including
development, population increase, movement of peoples, and poor agricultural
practices, the planet is losing both habitats and living species. The loss of
tropical forests, advancing desertification in many areas, depletion of
agricultural soils, and polluting of the ocean are serious problems for all
countries. Preserving biological diversity is a subject that has been the
fundamental principal guiding conservation strategies for the last two decades,
but there has never before been a comprehensive exhibit on this topic in the
kind of easily accessible format proposed by the Smithsonian Institution. This
project is funded jointly with the Directorate for Biological, Behavioral and
Social Sciences.
