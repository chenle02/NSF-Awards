This award supports work on two sets of major problems in commutative algebra.
The principal investigator will work on Serre's conjecture on interesection
multiplicity of modules and Chow groups of a complete ramified regular local
ring. He will also work on the canonical element conjecture of Hochster and
related problems. This research is concerned with a number of questions in
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions
of families of polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the
solution set or approach problems algebraically by investigating certain
functions on the solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This
dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry.
