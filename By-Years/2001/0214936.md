This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate
the feasibility of employing novel conducting polymers (e.g. poly
3,4-diphenylpyrrole) to prepare solid state gas sensors. The proposed sensor
will be low cost and selective to a specific class of chemical compounds, namely
chlorinated hydrocarbons. The proposed sensor will also be capable of operating
at room temperature, thus eliminating the need for significant power consumption
and making the development of small, selective, low-cost, and portable detectors
feasible. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of preparing solid-state
gas sensors based upon this material. Variations in materials chemistry,
including monomer composition and dopant ion, will be used to develop sensors
that are highly stable, sensitive, and selective to chlorinated hydrocarbons.

This sensor technology will complement Nanomaterials Research's existing product
line by continuing the development of low cost sensor technologies that provide
unique commercial advantages. The proposed sensor will be marketed to companies
who manufacture instrumentation for health and safety, environmental monitoring
and process control applications.
