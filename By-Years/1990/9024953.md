The goal of this project is to develop a general purpose portable system for
automated reasoning based on a new inference rule - RUE Resolution - which
incorporates the axioms of the equality into the definition of resolution,
producing much shorter and more transparent proofs. Experiments with a prototype
RUE theorem prover have produced excellent comparative results. A theoretical
study of the implications of RUE resolution as applied to Logic Programming, to
the Reduction Method of Knuth and to Paramodulation will be made.
