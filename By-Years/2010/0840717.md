This project asks whether genes that are known to affect cognitive and social
functions in humans exert similar effects in a simple organism, the fruit fly
Drosophila, which is particularly well suited to experimentation. The most
striking and specific human genetic syndrome that affects social behavior and
cognition is Williams Syndrome, a genetic condition produced by abnormalities in
a small slate of genes on human chromosome 7. Fruit flies have their own
versions of the genes affected in Williams Syndrome. The goal of this study is
to re-construct the Williams Syndrome set of genes (and subsets of it) in
strains of the fruit fly, and then test these strains in a variety of well
characterized cognitive and social tasks worked out for this organism. The value
of testing the role of these genes in the fruit fly is that it offers unequalled
potential for delving into the mechanisms through which genes affect brain
functions relevant to social behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work would have
repercussions throughout the world of Special Education in particular, and
education in general. Understanding the genetic and neurobiological bases for
cognition, social behavior, and their interaction will have a profound influence
on how we educate children with disabilities, as well as how we structure
education in general, thus opening avenues that will ramify far outside of the
narrow research field in which it is conducted. In addition, it will also
provide a training opportunity for a postdoctoral research fellow.
