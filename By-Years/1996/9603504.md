Webb 9603504 Polydnavirus genomes and life cycles are complex. Campoletis
somnorensis (PDV) has at least 28 DNA segments with genome size estimates in
excess of 250 kb, of which the most abundantly expressed are nested. There is
little understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have driven or allowed
segmentation of the viral genome. PDVs are obligate symbionts of some parasitic
hymenoptera and replicate asymptotically from integrated proviral DNA only in
specialized calyx cells of the female reproductive tract. When the wasp
paristizes the lepidopteran host, the virus genome invades the host, ceases
replicating and viral genes are rapidly expressed at a constant level producing
infection. Such viral gene expression is required for successful development of
the endoparasitic wasp. The hypothesis that PDV genome segmentation has resulted
from selective pressure for high level gene expression in parasitized insects
will be tested by cloning and mapping genes on nested viral DNA segments, by
evaluating a number of viral structural proteins and by manipulating the level
of viral gene expression in host insects. The results of these studies will
produce the first comprehensive characterization of a polydnavirus genome
allowing critical evaluation of the linkage between segment nesting and levels
of gene expression and may produce fundamental insights into the evolutionary
forces that have shaped the genomes of polydnaviruses, the only group of
segmented DNA viruses.
