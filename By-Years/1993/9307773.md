It is proposed to apply the chaos theory to mixing of particle systems, without
and with an interstitial liquid, and to develop and experimental approach to
quantify the mixture performance in a simple flow configuration. Mixing of
particle systems is significant different from mixing of fluids due to the
segregation and secondary phenomena caused by interparticle interactions. Even
if mixing plays an important role in chemical, petroleum, mining and
pharmaceutical processes, no reliable theory with a larger range of generality
has been developed. The proposed approach offers a sound background for
developing a chaos based theory, and a simple device for model calibration and
testing. Several technological improvements are expected by the introduction of
various disturbances which would enhance mixing of particulates. The research
project to be focused on the differences between single fluid mixing and
particulate mixing, and on the generic aspects which can be obtained from the
experiments on the proposed device. The feasibility of the chaos theory applied
to particulate mixing is a main goal of this project.
