The field of colloidal suspensions remotely controlled with an application of
electric, magnetic, electromagnetic, or acoustic field has seen a rapid growth
in recent years because of its potential applications in many fields including
health, defense, bio or chemical sensing, and bioelectronics. For example, one
may use suspensions of specialized magnetic particles, with their surface
suitably modified with attached polymers, to block temporarily a blood vessel
for microsurgery with the help of applied magnetic field.

This award will provide partial support towards travel for approximately 30
invited speakers to attend a four-day (April 7-11, 2013), American Chemical
Society (ACS) Symposium entitled, Remotely Controlled Colloids, Interfaces and
Biosystems in New Orleans. The invited speakers cover wide range of
interdisciplinary expertise drawn for academia and medical and defense industry.
The symposium will provide a forum for these experts to present recent advances
in the field and to give a sense of major challenges that need to be addressed
in the near future.
