The objective of the proposed project is to introduce the use of molecular
fluorescence technique into all levels of the chemistry program at Regis
College. The solicited fluorescence spectrometer will strengthen the laboratory
courses in Analytical, Physical and Biochemistry. It will also contribute to our
plans to integrate Physical Chemistry with Instrumental Analysis. The proposed
system will be primarily used for identification, analysis, study of molecular
dynamics and conformation of biomolecules. In Addition, it will advance several
ongoing biochemical research projects in which undergraduate students are active
participants. Several new experiments have been proposed as independent
projects. The requested instrument will enhance student experience in consumer
and environmental chemistry courses generally taken by non-science majors. Given
our small class size at Regis, each student in every advanced chemistry course
will benefit from hands-on experience with the fluorescence spectrometer.
