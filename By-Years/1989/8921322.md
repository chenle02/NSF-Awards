Silicon nitride has potential uses in automobile engines, as turbine blades and
any other parts needed for very high temperature service. Silicon nitride has
high: strength, thermal shock resistance, and oxidation resistance at elevated
temperatures. Silicon nitride powder is now produced by a batch process which is
very expensive. The PIs plan to explore developing a continuous fluidized bed
process which would more economically produce high purity silicon nitride powder
in large quantities. The project will proceed in three stages: (1) study of the
kinetics of silicon nitride formation (2) elucidation of the reaction
mechanisms, and (3) development of a fluidized bed reactor system for producing
the material. Specific work done in each of these stages will include: (1) study
of the kinetics that may be expected in a fluidized bed reactor by investigation
of the reaction mechanisms in detail in terms of the correlations between
reaction conditions and product crystal structure using TGA and X-ray
diffractometry methods; (2) development of a mathematical model to describe the
progress of the reaction on the basis of the data obtained from the above
experiments and (3) building and testing a fluidized bed reactor to handle this
very complex process. Because particles in the one micron diameter range will be
involved, three techniques will be tried to generate the fluidized bed: (1)
partly sintering this very fine silicon powder to form aggregates 200 - 300
microns in size which fludize satisfactorily, (2) mixing the fine silicon powder
with larger (greater than 100 microns) inert carrier solids which fluidize well,
and (3) trying fast fluidized beds and/or pneumatic transport reactors.
