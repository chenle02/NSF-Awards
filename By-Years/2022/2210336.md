The ADAPT in SC project will build capacity in the design of biomedical devices
with AI enabled, customized performance and secure their manufacture in South
Carolina. This initiative focuses on establishing a statewide collaboration
which will harness and realize the potential in the state for integrating AI
into the design of accurate devices of diagnoses, smart surgeries, and precision
rehabilitation. The proposed planning grant will be used to fund three meetings
comprising a series of dialogues among ADAPT in SC participants and
stakeholders. These meetings are anticipated to refine the ADAPT in SC teamâ€™s
understanding of the state of the art in fundamental AI science and its
application in biomedical devices; the state of the art in education, training,
and workforce development in the fields of AI and biomedical device design; and
stakeholder perceptions of social, commercial, and economic factors affecting
acceptance and adoption of AI techniques and AI-enabled
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
