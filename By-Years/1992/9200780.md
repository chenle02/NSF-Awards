This award will allow the PIs to continue the development of Thorium-230
profiling in marine sediments as a paleoceanographic tool. Th-230 flux to
seafloor has been shown to be largely independent of particulate flux, but
closely related to the rate of production in the water column. This property can
be exploited to independently calculate sediment flux to the seafloor. Sediment
trap work accomplished so far supports this model for modern sediment flux and
in the next phase the work will be carried back to isotopic stage 5/6 in
Southern Ocean.
