There is considerable industrial interest in the development of Hot Isostatic
Pressing (HIP) of material powders into a truly net or near-net shape. The
objective of this research is to set the basis for the development of an
efficient methodology to predict shape changes in HIP. The study will
characterize the two principal causes of shape distortion: (1) the effect of
powder container stiffness, and (2) the formation of densification fronts by
inhomogeneous heating. Iron powder will be used as a first target material for
its mechanical behavior is well understood. Commercially pure titanium will be
investigated in a second stage as relevant material data becomes available. The
response of the iron powder material to stress and temperature will be simulated
via an internal variable constitutive model. The model will be calibrated and
incorporated in a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element code streamlined for
HIP applications. A novel hot triaxial compaction apparatus will be used to
provide data for the calibration of the constitutive model. In the final stage,
experiments in an industrial scale will be performed to validate the overall HIP
predictive capabilities. The primary benefit of this work will be: (a) the
capability of assessing the manufacturability of a component via HIP, (b) the
design of a container with a minimum number of trial parts, (c) efficient
programming of the HIP unit operation schedule as the effect of cycle and
workpiece distribution in the unit work zone becomes better understood, and (d)
exploration of new products with the potential to influence the design of a new
generation of HIP units.
