*** 9661439 Guire This project is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of a
generally applicable, facile, and cost-effective approach to coating of plastic
materials used in specific binding assay and biosensor systems. Covalent
passivation of the surface with a biomolecule-compatible stabilizing agent,
patterned immobilization of biomolecules, which are critical and enduring
obstacles to the commercial development of biosensor technology, will be
resolved through the preparation of a photoreactive "universal binding" thin
film surface. Covalent photochemical bonding of the high affinity general ligand
(biotin) derivative and of the passivating/stabilizing agent, will be
accomplished quickly under mild reaction conditions by patterned and uniform
illumination, respectively. A patterned array of X-avidin immobilized on
passivated optical grade plastic will be obtained by dip-coating this surface
with a crude or purified solution of this multi-site binding protein, then
prepared for multianalyte assay use with essentially any nucleic acid probes or
specific analyte binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) assay through differential
loading of the individual assay dots of the array by inkjet printing (e.g., with
the desired biotinylated oligonucleotides for cystic fibrosis gene defects).
This approach is expected to provide cost-effective solutions to the outstanding
technical problems of the biomolecule-sensor interface of small sample,
sensitive , multiananyte, rugged portable commercial devices under development
for nucleic acid probe and immune assays of value for environmental, food,
infectious disease, and gene sequence analysis and monitoring. ***
