9360521 Murthy The objective of the proposed work is to develop efficient and
accurate computational techniques for the solution of moving front problems such
as those occuring in phase-change, pollutant dispersal, groundwater transport
and others. We will use MIMD parallel processing to obtain the computational
speed necessary to solve these computer-intensive problems. Phase I of the
project will be devoted to developing tools for dynamic partitioning and load
balancing.
