This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (UWEC)
for the summers of 2009-2011. The REU site will be directed by Alan Gengenbach
from the UWEC Department of Chemistry. Eight undergraduate students will conduct
research for 10 weeks under the direct supervision of their faculty mentors.
Research opportunities in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, physical,
biochemistry and materials science are available. The primary objective of this
REU site is to provide a bridge between UWEC and regional two-year institutions
including Minneapolis Community and Technical College, St. Paul College and the
UW Colleges. These partnering institutions will help identify talented students
who will increase the quality and diversity of the students conducting summer
research in the UWEC chemistry department. A weekly seminar series will cover a
variety of topics such as scientific careers, the role of science in public
policy and effective communication of scientific ideas. Each REU participant
will present the results of their research work at an end-of-summer
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
