Dr. Megan Tracy of James Madison University will conduct research on the effects
of the melamine poisoning scandal in China's dairy industry in 2008, focusing on
the scandal's aftermath in order to understand how industry actors, regulatory
agencies, transnational organizations, and food safety advocates have attempted
to implement regulatory and transparency norms. Ethnographic research in China
will be used to document the role transparency plays in global regulatory
processes. The research will also examine how individuals, motivated by global
scandals and the pressure to prevent future incidents, transmit and transform
food safety regulations and best practices across international borders. The
research will trace the chain of actors involved in producing and monitoring
food safety in China's dairy industry and will consider how and why various
technical practices are chosen, as well as how diverse techniques become marked
as fulfilling transparency and accountability demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will employ a range of social science research methods, including
modified participant observation, interviews, and the collection and analysis of
documentary practices. Field research will take place across a variety of sites,
including corporate campuses, processing plants, factory farms, and industry-
sponsored events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food safety scandals raise questions
about complex and globalized food production and distribution systems, the
impact on consumer health and well-being, and the global governance of food and
health risks. Results of the project will increase knowledge of the transmission
of food safety standards and contribute to public discussions about food safety
and security in the U.S. and China, resulting in greater opportunities for
improved food safety. The project will also strengthen interdisciplinary
partnerships between U.S. and Chinese researchers and present opportunities for
the mentoring of U.S. and Chinese students.
