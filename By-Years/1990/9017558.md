The proposed research plans to improve the performance of trellis coded
modulation. Trellis coded modulation (TCM) improves the noise performance of
digital transmission without increasing the required bandwidth or reducing the
effective data rate. The performance improvement reduces the power requirements
for transmission at a specific data rate. %%% The primary goal is to investigate
methods of analytically evaluate the distance of TCM codes. In developing a
simple, effective method to evaluate TCM codes distances, comparison of codes
will be facilitated. In addition, it is hoped that the analytical evaluation
method will lead to a code design method which increases TCM code performance.
The evaluation technique will be confirmed by computer simulations.
