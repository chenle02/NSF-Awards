The Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee--Knoxville will use
this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to help purchase
a mass spectrometer data handling system. The areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: characterization of
biochemical systems, including farnesylated proteins and aberrant enzymes
potentially linked with carcinogenesis, fundamental studies of fullerene
chemistry, gas-phase ion chemistry, nonlinear chromatography and kinetics
monitoring. Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate structural
details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,
bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The acquisition of a mass spectrometer
is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields in
chemistry, and a modern data handling improves the instrument control and the
efficiency of the facility.
