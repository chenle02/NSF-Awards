The principal investigator will work on questions at the interface of
differential geometry, probability, and mathematical physics. The starting point
for this research is the work of Varadhan and Donsker, in the setting of
Euclidean space. Start with a Poisson distribution of spheres of fixed radius,
and consider a large sphere of radius N. Let D be the Laplace operator. With
Dirichlet boundary conditions on both the large sphere and the smaller ones,
there is a probability distribution of eigenvalues (appropriately normalized) of
-D in the large sphere. As N increases, the random measures converge to a
deterministic measure. One question then involves the limiting behavior of this
measure on the interval (0,v) as v converges to 0. The investigator has extended
known results in Euclidean space to hyperbolic spaces. Proofs in both types of
spaces involve probability arguments and heuristics. The Investigator Intends to
extend these results into other less restrictive spaces, where for example, the
invariance properties of the underlying process would no longer be available.
