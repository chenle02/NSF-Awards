Scholarly integrity is recognized as an important issue in scientific research
and training. Yet there are profound differences in the larger cultural context
for ethical decision-making. As international collaborations become more common,
these differences need to be confronted. Training in the Responsible Conduct of
Research tends to ignore the cross-cultural challenges of ethical decision-
making. Instead, RCR instruction has largely been proscriptive, field- and
country-specific, and universalizing, based on fundamentally western notions of
individual intellectual property rights rather than collaborative values. This
project, supported by the Ethics Education in Science and Engineering program at
NSF, will put its emphasis upon cultural context and upon partnership with
international scholars and diverse community groups in developing a new kind of
training in scholarly integrity. It will develop a module for graduate students
launching fieldwork projects, collaborative international partnerships or
community-based partnerships with diverse populations. The project will itself
be a partnership, and will foster discussion of ethical values across
international and cultural boundaries. Researchers at Brown University will work
together with collaborators at the Indian Institute for Technology and Zhejiang
University in China. The final results of this project will include: 1) a
research paper discussing the formation of the physical science disciplines of
physics, chemistry and engineering, and the impact of that discipline formation
on ethic decision-making, 2) a case-study-based curriculum developed in
collaboration with our international partners, 3) a research paper on the
curriculum design and its assessment module, and 4) a web site dedicated to
making these resources available beyond the three campuses where they were
developed.
