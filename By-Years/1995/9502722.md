9502722 The objective of this research is to develop optimization tools for
solving planning and scheduling problems of significant importance to the
process industry. In particular, the following problems are investigated: (1)
model formulation to support production and scheduling needs in the process
industry, (2) decomposition algorithms to exploit special problem and model
structures, (3) method of modification or revision of production plans to
accommmdate unexpected changes in demand and/or the production process itself,
and (4) how to account for uncertainly in solving production planning and
scheduling problems. The educational component of the project is focused on
improving the way in which optimization, engineering design, and production
planning and scheduling are taught to students. Interdisciplinary new courses
will be developed while existing ones will be revised. Successful realization of
the objectives of this research can produce several valuable results. It will
provide production planning and scheduling tools for the process industry. It
can produce significant savings in production cost to make the industry more
economically competitive. Teaching the needs of the process industry to students
and introducing them to methods of modeling and analyzing such systems can pave
the way for more future development.
