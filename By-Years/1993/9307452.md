This is SBIR Phase II research on designing a synapse for a neural network (NN).
During Phase I the company devised a novel synapse circuit, which is linear over
a range that is 10 times that of previous state-of-the-art circuits, and half
the size of previous circuits. Also a NN for the chip was designed. During Phase
II, the company is designing and testing the remaining network elements and
improving the synapse. A full scale prototype chip that implements on-chip
learning, and contains up to 650,000 synapses is being developed. The chip
design enables interconnection of several chips in order to form a multi-layer
network. In addition a prototype back propagation network which will integrate
all network elements on a single chip and allows interconnection of at least two
chips is being designed.
