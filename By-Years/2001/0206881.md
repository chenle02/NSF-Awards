0206881&lt;br/&gt;Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will
support a workshop on nonlinear dynamics to be held in conjunction with the
fifth American Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Dynamics at
the University of Alberta, Canada, July 7-12, 2002. The goals of the workshop
are to nurture high quality scientific activity, to strengthen international
scientific collaboration, and to stimulate students' involvement in this area.
The workshop, which is being organized by Drs. Kening Lu and Konstantin
Mischaikow of Bringham Young University and Georgia Institute of Technology
respectively, jointly with Drs. Michael Li and James Muldowney, both of the
University of Alberta, will feature participants from several Latin American
countries as well as a number of U.S. graduate students and junior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
