9415989 Sinton This work is the combined effort of three investigators to
analyze rocks collected during a dive program that was conducted on the East
Pacific Rise between 17 and 19 degrees S in December 1993. The rocks are from
the ridge axis, from an abandoned ridge a few kilometers from the active ridge
and from nearby seamounts. The purpose in analyzing the rocks is to determine
the frequency and chemical variability on this very fast spreading ridge. They
will also review dive tapes and photographs to estimate the volumes of
eruptions. The techniques to be used are electron microprobe of basalt glass,
XRF of whole rocks, and U-Th-Ra geochronology. ***
