The goal of this proposal is to provide laboratory experience in molecular
biology for upper level student majoring in biotechnology. The requested
equipment includes electrophoresis and slot blot apparati, micropipettors, and
photodocumentation equipment, as well as micromanipulators and computer
equipment, which are used in a course that exposes students to DNA and RNA
analysis, DNA transfer into cells, micromanipulation and microinjection, and
cDNA synthesis and cloning. This equipment will also be used to expand
opportunities for undergraduate research experiences.
