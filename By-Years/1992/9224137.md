This SBIR Phase II award is for further research on a variable- geometry socket
for above-knee and below-knee amputee prostheses. This socket will provide for
easy and precise adjustment of the fit of the socket and therefore should
greatly increase comfort. Large volume changes from muscular atrophy of the new
amputee will be easily accommodated. The system is comprised of a generic
polymer-socket shell, five standard liquid-filled positioning bladder-pump units
that align the stump in and vary the volume of the socket, and a generic
elastomer-foam liner. Full suction-socket capability is retained with this
design. The variable geometry socket system has an estimated market in the USA
of $40 M/year with a prosthetics cost saving potential of over $100 M/year.
