Rykowski 9507091 The overall objective of this work is to determine the complete
3-dimensional interphase chromosome structure of specific genes of Drosophila
melanogaster at several critical times in development in diploid embryonic
chromosomes. The parameters of the ultra-high resolution in situ hybridization
(URISH) and computational optical microscopy and image analysis will be
characterized followed by a characterization of cell by cell variation in
transcription using the Notch gene. The effect of global structure on gene
activity will also be determined. There will be on-going software development
which should be of use in other studies as well as this work. %%% An integral
part of gene regulation is the structure of the gene itself. Proteins associated
with the chromosome on a constitutive basis act to modulate the action of
transcription factors and replication machinery. Alterations in chromatin
structure early in embryonic development can lead to the wholesale silencing of
the genes. Clearly, the structure of interphase chromosomes is an active player
in gene regulation. Using high resolution in situ hybridization and
computational optical microscopy, the structures of the gene changes during
development and as a result of cell cycle progression will be determined. ***
