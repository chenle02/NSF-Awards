9522745 Goodwin This research is to develop a method for measurement of the
refractive index (RI) of very small volume liquid samples. This measurement is
achieved by launching light into one end of an optical fiber with a necked
region that is interacting with the sample, and measuring of the amount of light
lost from the fiber at the other end. The loss of light at the fiber waist
provides a direct measure of the RI of the sample. Placing the fiber waist
within a coaxial flow cell enables RI measurements in volumes of thirty
nanoliters or smaller, making measurement suitable for use in either liquid
chromatography (LC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE). Additional refinement of
the process, such as the development of fabrication procedures, and identifying
and minimizing noise sources will also be accomplished. This technology will
allow the use of RI measurements as a routine detection method in very low
sample volumes in LC and CE. These unique characteristics make the detector
employable in the various markets for RI detectors.
