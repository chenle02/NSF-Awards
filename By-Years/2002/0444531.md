The proposed research by Drs. Manfred Binder and David Hibbett concerns the
evolutionary relationships of Boletales, a diverse and ecologically important
clade of mushroom-forming fungi (homobasidiomycetes). Systematics and ecological
studies have been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive phylogenetic
classification for the group. The proposed research will use a multi-gene
analysis for 52 key species of Boletales and selected outgroups to resolve the
major groups of Boletales. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region
(ITS) and the nuclear large subunit (nuc-lsu) of approximately 700 species
sampled worldwide will be assembled into extensive datasets to generate a broad
phylogenetic framework and to study character evolution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to a global classification of
the Boletales. The proposed research will provide resources for molecular
ecologists and systematists, and will promote the discovery of new species of
Boletales. A series of pages in the Tree of Life Web Project will be created for
each of the major groups of Boletales to offer resources for a broad audience.
In addition, this project will design and implement a four-week learning module
on "Molecular Ecology and Systematics of Mycorrhizal fungi" for high school
students, in collaboration with Minuteman Regional High School (Lexington, MA).
This module will engage students in a discovery-based project that demonstrates
the integration of molecular biology, organismal biology, and
bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;
