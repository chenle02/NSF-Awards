The exploratory research addressed by this project focuses upon development of
a theory of imprecise risk that is consistent with well-established engineering
design mathematics, yet allows subjectively specified probability measure.
Engineering design activity often requires the a priori subjective assignment of
a probability measure to all uncertain design inputs. While subjective a priori
assignment of probability measure eliminates imprecision in the characterization
of risk, experience with such exercises shows that decision makers are not
necessarily self-consistent and often do not satisfy the axioms of probability
measure and/or utility theory when attempting to assign probabilities. The
objectives of this research activity are: (1) to investigate imprecise risk
associated with decision making in engineering design using measure theoretic
principles; (2) to develop, from measure-based principles probability bounds on
risk using subjectively assigned probability measure. Should this research
effort prove successful, it will provide an analytical framework for quantifying
imprecise risk arising from often inconsistent, subjectively assigned event
probabilities. This will enable substantially improved decision making in
virtually all engineering design.
