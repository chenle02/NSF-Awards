The proposed research aims at improving the mathematical foundations of
nonlinear stochastic optimization under high uncertainty. We plan to develop new
models involving infinitely many constraints on functions characterizing
distributions of random outcomes. In particular we will consider semi-infinite
optimization problems with constraints on the probability distribution functions
and their transforms, e.g., excess/shortfall measures. We will analyze the
structure of these models and we will develop optimality conditions and duality
theory. Further we will carry out an analysis of stability and develop new
approximation methods for these problems. These theoretical advances will serve
as a basis for developing new numerical methods for solving optimization
problems under high uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many practical problems
optimal decisions must be made under uncertain conditions. Investment planning
is one example, but problems of this type occur in telecommunications, insurance
and finance, electricity generation and distribution, supply chain management,
manufacturing, and in the military, as well as in other areas. Existing
techniques do not work well when there are events that are very unlikely to
occur but which cannot be safely ignored. This project will provide new
mathematical tools and numerical methods to deal with such problems.&lt;br/&gt;
