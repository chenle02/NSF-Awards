With funding from this Presidential Faculty Fellow award, Professor Nowick will
elaborate the factors affecting the structure and interactions of biologically
relevant molecules. For example, the aim of this work is to develop new
strategies for the delivery of biologically active nucleic acid derivatives
across cell membranes and to gain fundamental insight into protein structure.
This is accomplished by modifying a micelle with a receptor molecule such as a
nucleic acid component thymine. Subsequent, introduction of a complimentary drug
which hydrogen bonds with the base provides a means for transporting a rather
polar compound across lipid bilayers or biological membranes. By exploring
inhibitors and a variety of other molecular probes it will be possible to gather
information on 3 dimensional peptide structure and how it effects molecular
transport. In specific, this research addresses the subject of protein folding
which is a problem on many investigator's palettes. Understanding the principles
by which physiologically active compounds are bound and transported across cell
membranes would provide scientists with tools for making new drugs, making those
presently known more effective and creating new artificial systems which are
medically beneficial to mankind. This awardee and this project are destined to
have a major impact on this subject area and thereby is highly significant.
