With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Saint John's University will acquire a liquid
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection, including atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization and electrospray probes. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) isolation of bioactive natural
products; b) quantification of pesticides and pesticide residues in the Sauk
River watershed; c) analysis of biological mechanisms for drug resistance; d)
modeling a trinuclear site in multicopper oxidases; e) oxidized LDL studies; f)
DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; g) identification of endothelial
proteins involved in tight junction formation; and h) vitamin K status in female
athletes.

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. It
has become almost indispensable in industry; therefore, it will be crucial in
the preparation of students for careers in industry or graduate school. This
instrument will also be used by students at the College of Saint Benedict (an
all women's college) and students at Saint Cloud State University.
