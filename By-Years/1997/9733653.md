Nanomechanics is employed to characterize the nonlinear thermo-mechanical
properties of sculptured thin films. Also, a homogenization theory of sculptured
thin films is formulated to analytically and computationally derive the
effective constitutive and evolution equations of these nano- engineered
systems. Software and computer-based courseware is developed to simulate the
experimental activity used in the identification of the thermo-mechanical
properties of homogeneous as well as composite materials. The project
contributes to the improvement of fabrication and life prediction techniques for
a new class of composite thin films with promising applications on
electroluminescent devices, optical sensor technology, micro-sieves for
entrapment of viruses or for growth of biological tissues on surfaces of
biological and on-biological origin.
