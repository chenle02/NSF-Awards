This project has two components. The first is to develop adaptive mesh
algorithms for shape-parameter identification in partial differential equations.
Such algorithms are useful in seismic, biomedical and other non-invasive imaging
problems. The other topic involves the concept of domain control. This work
applies to such problems as the control of flexible airfoils in order to achieve
a desired response.
