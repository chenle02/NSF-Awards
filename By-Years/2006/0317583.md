This project extends upon previous aerosol phase behavior studies by this
investigator on particle classes exerting a significant anthropogenic cooling
contribution to global direct radiative forcing, and is aimed at understanding
tropospheric aerosol phase behavior assessed quantitatively through combined
laboratory and modeling approaches. Mixed salt crystallization experiments will
be conducted to determine crystallization relative humidity on relevant model
tropospheric particles, followed by optical constant measurements on solutions
with the same composition. These data will then be incorporated into a global
chemical transport model capable of resolving radiative forcing and chemistry.
Results will have a broad scientific impact on society through improved optical
constants and predictive understanding of particle phase, by reducing
uncertainties in existing satellite inversion algorithms used in the global
assessment of atmospheric particles, and generally increasing current
understanding of how anthropogenic particles contribute to radiative forcing.
Such issues are of high policy relevance with respect to the global community in
terms of energy planning, production and use, the regional and long-range
transport of particulate pollution, and the impact on global climate. The
project supports graduate student and postdoctoral researcher involvement, and
includes integration of research results into undergraduate education and
outreach.
