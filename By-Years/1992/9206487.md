We propose to explore the reasons why the different approaches to estimating
the flexural response of the lithosphere in the Basin and Range province yield
different estimates and to develop models that reconcile the discrepancies. By
combining several types of data that are sensitive to different aspects of
lithospheric deformation, it should be possible to substantially improve
understanding of lithospheric rheology. Instead of just finding the best elastic
thickness to fit a particular class of data the goal is to understand the
tectonic and rheological processes responsible for the apparent rigidity and to
develop techniques that will permit those processes to be more easily
recognized.
