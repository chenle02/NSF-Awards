Plants grown in soil are often faced with surviving under conditions of
flooding or water logged soil. Oxygen becomes limiting and oxidative metabolism
is inhibited. Some plants respond to this condition by initiating changes in
protein synthesis as well as carbon metabolism. This stress response has been
particularly well studied in corn. Dr. M. Freeling of the University of
California, Berkeley has found and characterized over twenty corn mutants that
show varying degrees of survival under anerobic conditions. Dr. Winkler will
study the various biochemical alterations demonstrated by the various classes of
mutants and relate them to the level of survival of that particular mutant under
conditions of water stress. Other mutants will be isolated. An understanding of
how plants respond to environmental stress at a biochemical level is
fundamentally important but will also have significant economic ramifications
since the flooding of crop fields or the use of waterlogged soil as a field are
important commercial problems.
