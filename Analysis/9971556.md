Abstract Spatzier

The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems and
differential geometry. Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical
and geometric structures of "higher rank" systems. Such systems naturally appear
both in dynamical systems and geometry. In particular, the investigator will
study rigidity properties of hyperbolic actions of higher rank abelian and
semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying
such systems. The investigator also plans to investigate Riemannian manifolds
(especially higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and
group theoretic tools will be used in this research.

Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate
the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in
a fluid flow). New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have
changed our perception of the world fundamentally. Dynamics and ergodic theory
provide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical
systems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic
dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe
codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far
afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is one of the oldest fields in
mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional
analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.
Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied for
aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and other sciences and applied
areas (computer vision e.g.). Geometry and dynamics are closely related as some
important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and geometry also provides
tools to study dynamical systems. The main goal of this project studies when two
dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes
brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry.
