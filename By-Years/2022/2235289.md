This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences
(SBE). The goal of this REU Site is to create an undergraduate research
fellowship program. One of the two major aims of this program is to improve the
diversity of our scientists. To improve the education, training, and subsequent
representation of diverse populations in psychology, we will provide students
from underrepresented backgrounds with rigorous research training so that they
are better prepared to pursue a future career in STEM. Our second major aim is
to improve the diversity of our science. Unfortunately, in most published
research, variation based on context, socio-economic status and race, for
example, is difficult to study, as our samples are not representative of the
general US population. Instead of controlling for variability based on socio-
emotional context, in this proposal, we seek to study it directly in an attempt
to find systematic relations between this variability and basic neural,
cognitive, and social processes. Overall, it is our hope that this training
program will not only create a more diverse next generation of scientists, but
that it will also train current and future generations of researchers who are
highly motivated and well-equipped to produce more diverse
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1-year fellowship program will have three main
componentsâ€”a) rigorous hands-on research training, b) professional development,
and c) community engagement. To gain hands-on research training, fellows will
receive a stipend to work full-time in a Rutgers-Newark lab in the Psychology
Department for the duration of the summer. To foster career professional
development and enhance their research skills, fellows will also take part in a
weekly, one-hour research seminar during the academic year. Finally, they will
receive training in community engagement so that they can learn how to recruit a
diverse and representative sample of human subjects for their own research, and
how to disseminate their findings directly to those community
members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
