Queueing models arise in diverse applications such as computer performance
evaluation, communications networks and transportation scheduling. Queueing
systems can be described by stochastic processes since customers' arrival times
can be viewed as random variables. This project is to pursue the study of
diffusion equations which approximate the stochastic model. In particular, a ray
technique for obtaining approximate solutions to multi-dimensional diffusion
equation and a similar technique applicable to the original discrete model will
be developed.
