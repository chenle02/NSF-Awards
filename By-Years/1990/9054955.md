This project is enabling the Departments of Geological Sciences and Astronomy to
develop a series of new freshmen/sophomore seminars for all liberal-arts
undergraduates at the University of Michigan. The goals of these seminars are to
enhance the science instruction of potential science majors as well as non-
science majors. These seminars are limited in enrollment to twenty students, are
taught by senior faculty, have teaching assistants to provide extensive outside-
class help to students, and require an oral presentation as well as a written
paper on selected topics. Seminars are in-depth treatments of scientific issues
(in astronomy, geology, paleontology or oceanography) which are of importance to
students' lives; the courses are not meant to he comprehensive introductory
offerings. Ample time for in-class question/answer periods and discussions
enhance student participation and critical thinking; at the same time, the
classes with their small size provide better opportunity for student-faculty
contact than our present large lecture offerings. Some of these seminars have
hands-on laboratory or computing components, others are planned with short field
trips. The teaching assistants associated with these seminars help lead
discussions and give occasional lectures under close supervision of the faculty;
this allows us to train these TA's in classroom methods. It is hoped that an
increase in the numbers of undergraduate concentrators in science fields will be
an eventual result of these seminars.
