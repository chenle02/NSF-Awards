EIA-0226053&lt;br/&gt;Cary Coglianese&lt;br/&gt;Harvard
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government and E-Rulemaking: New
Direction for Technology and Regulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulemaking is the
process by which government agencies take laws passed by Congress, provide the
detailed scientific, engineering, and economic analyses necessary to reduce
those laws to regulation and practice, and then consult with any interested
parties. They must then consider any external recommendations and accept or
reject them. Documenting their reasons for doing so. The entire process and
decisions must be open and transparent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Federal
agencies have begun experimenting with using the Internet in the rulemaking
process. The hope is that this will increase the accessibility of the process to
the public, while providing an easier way to document the interactions between
the agencies and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop will
bring together information technology researchers, legal and administrative
experts, and agency personnel to develop an information technology and
social/political science research agenda related to this very important
democratic process.&lt;br/&gt;
