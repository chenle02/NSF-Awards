As new edge detection papers appear, convincing proof of real advantages over
past techniques is critical to community recognition and acceptance. This
requires establishment of methods to objectively and quantitatively demonstrate
whether a new algorithm offers performance improvements. This research will
result in a carefully developed and documented experimental framework for edge
detector evaluation by adaptively sampling edge detector parameter space and
generating ROC curves. The research includes documenting how well the results of
the pixel-level evaluation agree with evaluations based on higher-level tasks
such as perceptual grouping, structure from motion and human object recognition.
The work will leave behind the artifacts (image sets, software, ) necessary for
others to use, and to build upon, the research. In particular, a web site will
be created that promotes the use of this framework as a standard technique.
Beyond providing a solution for performance evaluation of edge detectors, the
results may also serve as a model for the development of performance evaluation
methods for other computer vision problems.
