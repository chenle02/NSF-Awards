9351871 Dick The Department of Geology is incorporating a refraction
seismograph, earth resistivity equipment, a laptop personal computer, and
supporting geophysical processing and interpretation software into a sophomore-
level course entitled Subsurface Investigations. In addition, the instructional
facilities of Applied Geophysics, an existing advanced level course, are being
improved. Subsurface Investigations is being developed in order to introduce
students to the various methods of subsurface investigation used in
environmental geology problems. The objective of the course is to stimulate
student interest in geology, physics, and chemistry by integrating these
scientific disciplines in an applied geology course. The objective of Applied
Geophysics is to provide students with hands-on experience in conducting
geophysical surveys and interpreting geophysical data. ***
