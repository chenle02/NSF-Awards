This proposal is to support the travel program for the XXXI IUPS Congress in
Helsinki, Finland. The support will enable the Society to support the travel of
U.S. scientists to the premier international meeting in the physiological
sciences. The American Physiological Society and the U.S. National Committee
intend that 50% of the support be dedicated to young investigators and that NSF
funds will be used to insure adequate representation of women and minorities in
the award program. The program will consist of lectures from leading scientists,
contributed presentations, teaching workshops, symposia, and exhibitions of
biomedical laboratory equipment and publishers from around the world. The
international character of the meeting will prove important in the education of
young U.S. scientists.
