9413900 Dunbar This award provides 62 per cent of the funding required for the
acquisition of an analytical electron microscope to be installed and operated in
the Department of Geoscience at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
to acquire the instrument. The new electron microscope laboratory will be
managed as a campus-wide facility open to all qualified staff and student users.
The system will be equipped with x-ray micro analytical capabilities as well as
with the usual imaging capabilities. The need for both capabilities is present
in many research and teaching programs at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology, but the institution has never had such an instrument available for
research and teaching on campus before. The research groups having the greatest
need for this instrument presently include those studying a) igneous petrology
and volcanology, b) structural geology, metamorphic petrology and geochronology,
c) global change, d) sedimentology, e) environmental geochemistry, f) ore
genesis, g) crustal evolution, and h) metallurgy. ***
