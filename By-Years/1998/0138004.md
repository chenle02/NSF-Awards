ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Stories from the Circle: Science and Native
Wisdom," &lt;br/&gt;A Workshop with Extensive Dissemination
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop entitled "Stories from the
Circle: Science and Native Wisdom," will be held at the Tsaile campus of Dine
College, near Chinle, Arizona on May 13-18 of 2002. This is the first major
gathering of Native scientists, scholars, and elders with Western scientists and
scholars that is to be planned, organized, and carried out within Native, rather
than Western, worldview. Extensive dissemination through a film, books, a museum
exhibition, and curriculum materials is an integral part of this project. These
means of dissemination will allow the workshop's objectives to be widely
communicated. The objectives of the workshop are to make a statement about
science from a Native cultural perspective and to show the dominant culture
another way of looking at the world that can help solve some serious problems we
all face. The workshop and dissemination materials are being planned by teams of
Native scholars and scientists from many nations, in collaboration with selected
non-Native scholars and scientists. &lt;br/&gt;
