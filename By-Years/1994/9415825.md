Barros 9415825 This U.S.-Brazil Joint Seminar award supports travel expenses of
15 U.S. participants in a workshop on Multidimensional Complex Analysis and
Partial Differential Equations. U.S. organizers of the meeting are Drs. J.
Barros-Neto and S. Gindikin of Rutgers University, and the Brazilian co-P.I. is
Dr. P. Cordaro of the University of Sao Paulo. The workshop will survey recent
progress in the fields of several complex variables and partial differential
equations, and promote further research in both fields. The meeting will focus
on recent results and future perspectives in the theory of CR manifolds,
hyperfunctions, and overdetermined systems of differential equations. U.S. and
Brazilian scientists have close ties in these areas, and the workshop will
provide guidance to younger researchers in the field, stimulate further
progress, and involve a new generation of U.S. and Brazilian mathematicians in
the research. ***
