The objective of this internship project is to develop and apply automated
process planning and production planning systems within an electronics
manufacturing environment. The particular process to be analyzed will be printed
circuit board assembly including specification of machine operating sequences
and generation of machine instructions to execute the operation sequence. It is
expected that the results of this work will be relevant to electronics
manufacturing in general. The project will also serve as a catalyst for the
development of a state-of- the-art research and teaching laboratory for
electronics manufacturing system analysis and a senior level multi-disciplinary
course in this area.
