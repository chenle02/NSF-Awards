Formal methods for ensuring the reliability of software will only become
ubiquitous if they can be seamlessly integrated within widely used language
ecosystems. The Liquid Haskell (LH) system integrates verification within the
Haskell programming language, by allowing developers to specify correctness
requirements as contracts extending Haskell's types. LH can then automatically
verify these contracts at compile-time ensuring the deployed program will always
execute according to its specification. This project's novelties are in new
methods to integrate LH within the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) toolchain.
Consequently, the project's impacts will be to enable tight integration within
the engineering workflow used in industry making it possible to run LH on large,
industrial code bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build on GHC's
recently added plugins and annotations mechanisms to integrate refinement types
within the compiler. This integration will allow LH to reuse GHC's module system
to allow programmers to publish specifications for their libraries that can be
reused by clients of those modules, and to support incremental verification that
is essential for scaling verification to industrial sized code bases. As a
result, the project will yield a tool that is tightly integrated within a widely
used, industrial strength compiler, enabling engineers to utilize decades worth
of formal methods research to eliminate hard-to-find correctness bugs from
deployed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
