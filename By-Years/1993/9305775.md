The Department of Statistics at Penn State University will purchase
workstations for use in computationally intensive statistical research and in
the Department's network, and several items for work in color graphics. The
equipment will be used in several research projects, including: (1) Statistical
Analysis and Visualization of Space (2) Posterior Simulation and Imputation in
Large- Scale Incomplete-Data Problems (3) Statistical Consulting Center (4)
Achieving Observational Economy in Ecological and Environmental Investigations
(5) Algorithms, Inference and Curve-Fitting in Generalizations of Isotonic
Regression
