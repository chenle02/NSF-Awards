While computers have revolutionized introductory mathematics and statistics
courses, students often find that more advanced courses do not take full
advantage of the new approaches and training that they have received. However,
powerful and user-friendly software for visualizing complex geometric relations
and for typesetting mathematical documents is now available to be used
effectively in middle- and upper-level undergraduate courses. The objective of
this project is to prepare mathematics majors to address large problems_such as
understanding the motion of a drum_using computers. Computer graphics help
students visualize a problem, and mathematical typesetting tools allow them to
synthesize their understanding by writing documents that incorporate text,
graphics, and mathematical formulations. This project concentrates on three
intermediate- and advanced-level courses in the calculus sequence and three more
in statistics. The department is developing modules for class discussion and
exploration using computers and disseminating them through the Web site and the
FTP site maintained by the mathematics department, as well as through
presentations to meetings of the Mathematical Association of America and the
American Statistical Association.
