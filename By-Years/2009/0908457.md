A comprehensive set of new algorithmic and scientific computing tools to
numerically investigate the modeling of binary black hole collisions with higher
efficiency will be developed. Symbolic manipulation tools to automatize and
obtain higher order post-Newtonian expansions of the Einstein equations
using techniques from Quantum Field Theory will be developed.  The use of
heterogeneous computing and, more specifically, general purpose Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) in numerical relativity will be
explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools developed in this project aim to
explore the physics of binary black hole collisions, expected to be one of the
main sources of gravitational waves to be detected by ground- and space-based
interferometers such as LIGO and LISA. The parameter space is so large that new
computing paradigms are needed to explore it. The results of this project
should be of interest in the broad areas of general relativity, gravitational
waves, symbolic computing algebra, field theory, and high performance computing.
