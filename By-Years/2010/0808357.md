Climatic and geological change can affect both species and genetic diversity,
and the nature of such responses to environmental change has implications for
forest structure and adaptive potential and is of importance to conservation
measures. In Central America, major geological changes during the uplift of the
Panama land-bridge and climate fluctuations during the ice ages may have caused
extinctions and re-colonizations of populations. Such events can be
reconstructed by examining genetic relationships among current populations. DNA
sequencing and fingerprinting techniques will be used to examine genetic
patterns of populations of three Central American tree species and determine
whether past geological and climatic change had common and significant
influences on the trees? diversity and evolutionary history.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will reveal the impact of past climatic and
geological change on Central American forest species. Understanding species?
responses to past climate change enables prediction of responses to future
climate change, which is particularly critical in this biodiverse and heavily
exploited region. The information derived from this project can be used to
improve conservation strategies and potentially ameliorate habitat
deterioration.&lt;br/&gt;
