The project is for the development of a spectrometer correlator system that will
enable high-resolution spectroscopy in the mid-infrared with the Infrared
Spatial Interferometer at the Mt. Wilson Observatory. The new capability will
allow some unique capabilities, including studying the presence and extent of
water and other molecules in environments directly surrounding red giant stars.
The work will involve several students and summer interns, and will provide them
with hands-on research.
