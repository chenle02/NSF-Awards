9322524 Krawinkler This research project will develop basic data needed to
formalize and implement a demand/capacity based seismic design methodology that
explicitly considers the inelastic response characteristics of structures. The
objective is to make the design process transparent and equally applicable to
the seismic evaluation of existing structures and seismic designs of new
structures, using conventional structural systems as well as new structural
systems, materials, and innovative energy dissipation or base isolation systems.
The design objective is to provide a structure with sufficient strength,
stiffness, and ductility such that the deformation demands imposed by design
earthquakes do not exceed the deformation capabilities associated with design
limit states (e.g. serviceability, collapse safety). It is intended to achieve a
consistent level of seismic protection for structures of different
configurations and structural systems, which may be located in regions of
different seismicity. The proposed research is directed towards achieving this
goal by focusing on the following objectives: (1) evaluate, refine, modify, and
develop (if needed) the basic concepts on which a consistent and transparent
seismic design methodology can be based; (2) develop a comprehensive set of
information on seismic demand parameters for inelastic SDOF systems, which will
form the basis for the design of MDOF structures; (3) develop the knowledge
needed to modify the SDOF demand parameters in a manner that accounts for multi-
mode effects present in real MDOF structures; (4) investigate the effects of
ground motion characteristics for expected cumulative damage effects; and (5)
formalize and test the proposed seismic design methodology in order to make it
useful for the engineering profession. The information on demands and capacities
created in the project will have an impact on the state of knowledge and will
facilitate and accelerate the adoption of more realistic and transparent design
procedures. ***
