A network bringing together scientists working with laboratory based collections
of microbes is being established. The network will hold numerous workshops
teaching best practices for managing, preserving, and distributing bacteria,
fungi, and other microscopic organisms in the context of formal culture
collections. Biosecurity and regulatory issues will also be emphasized at
workshops. Additional goals include re-establishing a professional society of
culture collection researchers in the US, developing internet based collection
management tools, and fostering communication between US collections, foreign
collections, and international collection
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collections of living microbes assure that
current and past research and innovation are available to future generations of
scientists. Biological materials which are made available via well managed
collections represent the foundation of the modern biotechnology industry.
Materials in culture collections impact fields as diverse as human health,
agricultural productivity, biotechnology, and bio-diversity research. While
there are several professional collections in the US, most collections in the US
are small and do not have long term strategies for survival. The network
supported by this grant will ensure that smaller collections benefit from
expertise available at larger living microbe collections.
