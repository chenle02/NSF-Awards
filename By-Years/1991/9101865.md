This CEDAR program is aimed at achieving a better understanding of the upper
atmosphere through studies of the coupling, energetics, and dynamics of
atmospheric regions. This grant supports instruments upgrade and data analysis
from the University of Michigan optical observatory at Thule Air Force Base in
Greenland in support of the CEDAR program. The Thule optical facility is
uniquely situated to measure atmospheric state variables in the deep geomagnetic
polar cap with 24-hour a day during the winter by observing season. Measurements
are made of thermospheric and mesospheric parameters within the polar cap by
observing various optical emission features at high spectral resolution using
several optical instruments. Data from the optical facility at Thule have been
used for several CEDAR programs in the past. This grant will help assure support
to maintain and augment the scientific capabilities of this unique facility.
