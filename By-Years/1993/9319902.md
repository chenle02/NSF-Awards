This award provides funding for a workshop to convene experts and scientists to
assess the unique needs educators have for the rapid prototyping of integrated
circuits and to suggest potential solutions for continuously improving the
state-of-the-art in U.S. universities. User data indicates that in some cases
resources are not being used in the most effective manner. This workshop focuses
on the prototyping facilities offered by MOSIS and how these facilities can be
most effectively utilized by the education community. The workshop discusses and
makes recommendations in the areas of: new technologies; design methodologies;
testing; and policies, procedures, and information dissemination. Invited
participants from universities, government agencies, and industry seek to
determine how universities can improve their capabilities in the rapid
prototyping of integrated circuits. A report will be produced and distributed to
microelectronics educators as well as selected government and industry leaders.
