This award supports an aeromagnetic survey of part of Ross- Transect,
Antarctica, in cooperation with the FRG Federal Institute for Geosciences and
Resources (BGR). Two BGR ski- equipped Dornier 228 geophysical aircraft will be
operated from McMurdo Station. Specific scientific objectives of the survey are:
(1) The northwest part of the Ross Ice Shelf; to determine whether the Terror
Rift in the Victoria Land Basin continues south of Ross Island and to establish
the presence or absence of submarine and subglacial volcanos and subvolcanic
intrusions associated with the late Cenozoic rifting; and (2) Ross Island, an
active volcanic edifice; to locate areas of thin volcanic cover which could be
used for scientific drilling sites on land.
