This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project will further
develop ELEX (Electro-Extrusion) which is a manufacturing process for
prototyping and batch manufacturing high-aspect ratio microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) and related microparts and microstructures. The goal is to
replace (in many applications) the so-called LIGA process, which is an
electrodeposition-based technique, requiring the use of a clean room and
synchrotron.

The commercialization potential of this project to the MEMS industry will
provide a dramatic reduction in cost and time, which will greatly accelerate the
commercialization of MEMS and other microscale devices.
