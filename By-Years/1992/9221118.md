This award, made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program, extends
support for the research of Murray and coworkers on the design, characterization
and electronic properties of thin molecular films. The goals of the research are
to (1) study the electrochemical formation of ultrathin dielectric and
conductive films with discrete electron-hopping sites by in-situ atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry; (2) Prepare nanostructures by using the AFM
tip to create patterned holes in the films and to re-deposit other thin film
materials in the holes, and (3) study transport properties of mixed valent
molecular films which lack ionic conductivity by measuring the Hall effect and
magnetoresistance. Assemblies of the films will be utilized in electron and
hole-injecting contacts, rectifying molecular junctions, thin film transistors
and molecular light emitting devices. %%% This highly interdisciplinary research
will explore the underlying fundamental chemistry of thin film synthesis and
characterization, develop new technology for producing nanostructures and
advance the understanding of the physics of devices where charge transport is
controlled by electron-hopping.
