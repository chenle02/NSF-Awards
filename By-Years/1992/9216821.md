This project will study plasma turbulance in the solar corona and solar wind
using radio propagation techniques. The sources of the radio waves are
extragalactic radio sources which emit partially linearly polarized radiation
over a wide frequency range. The sources are observed with standard
radioastronomical instruments such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA). When these sources are viewed through the turbulent
plasma medium of the corona and solar wind, various distortion or "blurring"
effects may be observed. From measurements of these effects, information about
the intensity, spatial power spectrum, and physical nature of the turbulence can
be deduced. During the proposed grant period information on coronal turbulence
will be obtained from two types of observation. The first is a measurement of
angular broadening or "blurring" of a radio source viewed through a turbulent
medium. These observations will be carried out with the VLA and VLBA. The second
type of observation consists of measurement of Faraday Rotation of the plane of
polarization of alinearly polarized radio source. These observations will be
made with the VLA and will provide information on variations in the magnetic
field in the corona as well as density variations. Finally, theoretical work
will be made which relates radioastronomical observables to properties of
coronal plasma waves. #
