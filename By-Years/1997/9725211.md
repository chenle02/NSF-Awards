Walsberg 9725211 Despite the extraordinary challenges presented by high
temperatures and the absence of water, a large number of animals survive without
drinking while occupying extreme desert conditions. The goal of this study is to
elucidate how the physiology of one important group of such animals allows them
to survive desert conditions. Developing this understanding requires addressing
three basic questions. (1) What themmal and hydric environments do these animals
occupy in nature? (2) How do these animals thermoregulate under such conditions?
(3) How do they meet their water requirements? This study will focus upon
kangaroo rats, which are small rodents that are among the most conspicuously
successful groups of desert mammals. The thermal and hydric conditions
experienced by these small mammals in subtropical deserts will be quantified.
Physiological analyses will focus upon determining how closely these animals
approach their limits of tolerance to dehydration and high environmental
temperatures under naturally prevailing conditions. This will include analyses
of (a) short-term effects of high environmental temperatures upon body
temperature, (b) intemmediate-term effects associated with animal dehydration
during activity, and long-temm effects mediated through alterations in the
location and timing of animal activity in nature.
