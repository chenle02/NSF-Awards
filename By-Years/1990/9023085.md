There is widespread agreement among health economists that there is a persistent
empirical association across samples and over time between years of schooling
and health. However, there are several explanations about why this association
occurs. One explanation is that there is a direct effect with schooling endowing
people with greater knowledge and skills to practice preventive medicine or use
medical care more widely. Another is that schooling enhances health through
allowing access to safe jobs, discouraging smoking and encouraging seat belt use
and exercise. Others point to the possibility that poor health in childhood or
adolescence results in less investment in schooling. Finally, it is suggested
that unobserved variables such as the rate of time discount is the "true" cause
of both high levels of schooling and good health and that increased schooling
does not lead to better health or slower deterioration of existing health. This
project will develop models which will allow for testing of many of these
hypotheses in addition to comparing rates of health returns to schooling across
gender and race. Four large national data sets are used in the project: National
Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANESI) I and II, Epidemiological
Followup Survey to NHANESI, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Several
dependent variables relating to health will be used: blood pressures, smoking,
body mass and early death. The estimation techniques will take into account self
selection models, where appropriate. This study will be the first to focus on
the race and gender differences in the correlations between schooling and health
in the same way that the classic studies focused on the gender and race
differences in the financial returns to schooling.
