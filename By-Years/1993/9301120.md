Professor Thomas Hayden is jointly funded by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program, the Computational Biology Program, the
Biophysics Program, and the Computational Mathematics Program to continue his
theoretical research in the application of distance geometry to the
interpretation of NMR spectra. Data from NMR experiments provide lower and upper
bounds on the values of interactomic distances allowed by the ensemble of
conformations of a molecule. Distance geometry can be used to improve these
bounds by methods known as bound smoothing. New applications of distance
geometry to bound smoothing are being investigated. Specific geometric
structures and their relationship to certain classes of distance matrices are
being carried out. One goal of understanding this relationship is to suggest
possible conformations that can serve as a template for the design by a
pharmaceutical chemist of rigid drug analogues which are active at a specific
receptor site. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques are rapidly
evolving which will enable chemists to determine the 3-dimensional structures of
large protein and nucleic acids in solution. These techniques provide an
important complement to the more well-established X-ray crystallographic
methods. The primary results which are obtained from such NMR experiments are
internuclear distances between selected hydrogen atoms in the backbone of the
protein molecule. Distance geometry methods, such as those being developed by
Hayden, provide the primary mathematical tools which are used to determine the
3-dimensional geometry from these distance constraints.
