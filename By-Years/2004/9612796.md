The PI will perform coordinated studies with the radar facility at Sondrestrom,
Greenland with a new resonance lidar capability. The lidar and radar will permit
new studies of metallic layers in the very high-latitude ionosphere, and
complement and extend an existing observational radar program. The radar may
determine the occurrence of thin metallic ion layers, as well as the detailed
spatial and temporal variations in the electric fields, which play a critical
role in metal-layer formation. The lidar will determine altitude profiles of
neutral sodium and iron, as well as calcium ions. Watkins will investigate the
relative roles of different neutral and ionized metallic structures, and the
relevant physical and chemical processes associated with neutral and ion layers.
Spatial and temporal structure in ion layers may be determined from antenna
scanning experiments with the radar; therefore, making feasible the study of the
sodium and iron variability in terms of ion layer structure and temporal
behavior. The PI will use the lidar calcium-ion measurements with the radar
total-ion measurements and electric field data to determine the relative effects
of ion layers with different ion masses, and make detailed comparisons with
model simulations of ion-layer formation.
