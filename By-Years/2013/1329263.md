This award will support student travel to the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on
Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI '13), which is being held
in Seattle, Washington. PLDI is a top conference in the fields of programming
languages and compilers. The funds will help support U.S. students, focusing on
Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would
otherwise not be able to attend PLDI. Supporting student travel to attend
professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.
Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this
important research area.
