Abstract Proposal: CMS97-01947 PI: Nazli Yesiller: Wayne State University
"Nondestructive Evaluation of Geomembranes" The objective of this study is to
develop nondestructive testing techniques to characterize geomembranes and to
determine the physical, mechanical, and degradation properties both in the
laboratory and field. Basic correlations will be established between NDT
parameters, material properties, and microstructure of geomembranes. NDT methods
provide fast, simple, and sensitive testing alternatives to conventional testing
methods, and the tests can be performed in the field without disturbing in-place
geomembranes. The NDT methods proposed for use in this study include liquid
penetrant inspection and ultrasonic testing. The experience gained in the
research component of this work will be used to add a laboratory session to an
existing design-oriented geosynthetics course. The testing methods developed in
the study will be used for demonstrations in Landfill Design and Civil
Engineering Materials courses. ***
