This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program
allowed the University of Maryland at Baltimore to build the Data Intensive
Academic Grid (DIAG) that includes 100 nodes for high-throughput computational
analysis and 5 nodes for high-performance computational analysis. This resource
will optimize data sets generated by mining the data from public data
repositories like Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine Microbial
Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) and the National Center for Biotechnology
Information and will leverage technologies developed for existing grid resources
such as the TeraGrid, and Open Science Grid. The bioinformatics community will
access the DIAG using Ergatis, a web based pipeline creation and management
tool, bioinformatics oriented Virtual Machines, as well as interactive and
programmatic access using technologies such as Nimbus and the Virtual Data
Toolkit from the Open Science Grid. The software produced at the DIAG site will
be easily utilized by projects such as the Globus Workspaces Project, Open
Science Grid and other projects involving large multi-institutional
collaborations, as well as providing spillover capacity for two other science
grids, located in Illinois and California. The DIAG development will enable
training of the next generation of biologists, by bringing a powerful new
analysis system to undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students in 15
different classroom settings, and the allocation of system time to universities
with predominantly under-represented minorities, greatly enhancing the available
computation and computing infrastructure for these groups.
