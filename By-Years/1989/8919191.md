The goal of this research project is to develop methods and procedures that can
be utilized to empirically describe and to normatively understand and assess the
different theoretical perspectives of 38 agencies, 95 projects, and over 760
participants at various levels in the redevelopment process, in the two counties
of the Inland Empire. The Inland Empire include Riverside and San Bernardino
counties in California. The policy-making process in the Inland Empire includes
public sentiments and beliefs of the individuals actually involved. The
intensity and stability of public sentiment on specific policy issues seems
especially different to measure but it may be less difficult to find out the
beliefs of selected officials in public policy decision-making if the process of
public policy decision-making is accurately described. Three major paradigms;
Pluralism, Elitism and the Growth Machine perspective presently operate within
the field of community power.
