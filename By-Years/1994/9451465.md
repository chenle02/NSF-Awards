9451465 Baker The Department of Chemistry, Physics and Engineering Studies at
Armstrong State College is improving its undergraduate chemistry curriculum and
strengthening its general science instruction through acquisition of a gas
chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The instrument is being used in organic courses
to improve existing experiments. Students in qualitative analysis are using the
instrument in an integrated lab to identify and quantity amounts of volatile
organics in water from various sites along the Savannah River. Students in an
advanced instrumental analysis course use the instrument along with the FT-IR
and NMR spectrometers to quantify compounds via isotopic dilution methodology.
In addition, the instrument is being incorporated into the department's physical
science sequence to introduce non-science majors to modern laboratory
instrumentation and enhances the department's outreach program for high school
chemistry students.
