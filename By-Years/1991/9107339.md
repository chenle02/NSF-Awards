Drs. Milne and Johnson will use the theory of phase transitions to study the
origin, maintenance, and dynamics of broad-scale vegetation patterns in semiarid
lands of New Mexico, USA. By definition, landscape phase transitions exhibit
power-law behavior in the number of patches of woodland when the landscape
changes from grassland to woodland. Two other characteristics, including the
length of patches and the probability that a shrub resides in a continuous
cluster of shrubs, also vary as powers of total woodland cover. Related power
laws are predicted that describe the resilience of the system to disturbance.
These studies will account for the effects of climatic teleconnection,
elevation, slope aspect, soil texture, and land use. Models will be constructed
to: (1) test that pinyon-juniper woodland ecotones exhibit characteristics of
true phase transitions; (2) assess the equlibrium vs. nonequilibrium nature of
ecotones. (3) investigate changes in vegetation patterns under possible climate
change scenarios; and (4) use renormalization relations to express predictions
of landscpae change at coarser levels of resolution. In summary, this project
presents an approach for detecting ecological responses to environmental change.
These investigators are leading scientists in the area of quantitative landscape
ecology. Institutional facilities for conducting this research are outstanding.
