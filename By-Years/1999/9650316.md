This project provides fluorescence, luminescence, and scintillation equipment
to serve a range of biology and chemistry laboratory courses. The department has
been successful in modernizing and enhancing curricula in biology and chemistry
supporting classroom instruction and independent student research. The
instruments tie into the existing computing network and enable students to use
modern methods of data collection and analysis. The resulting laboratories and
exercises consist of interdependent and multiply specialized methods as found in
programs offered on many college campuses. Since the project is aimed at a
cross-section of science majors and nonmajors, the improved facilities represent
a cost-effective program for enhancing a modern biology and chemistry curricula.
The multidisciplinary approach to the improvements spring from and enhance
interdepartmental collaboration. Objectives are being achieved by using modern,
efficient instruments for measurement of fluorescence and radioactive
disintegrations. The specific equipment supports sensitive biological,
environmental, organic, and inorganic fluorescence analysis, and biochemical and
bioanalytical micro well applications. The instruments are also being used by
biology and chemistry student researchers and their faculty mentors. Biology and
chemistry faculty can assess student use and performance through schedule
development and student reports. These can be used to inform an active cross-
content development of lab exercises and course modernization as part of an
ongoing process of performance evaluation for both specialized applications and
networked tie-ins. The inclusion of modern methods of data analysis in the
curricula can result in graduates who have an enhanced capacity to understand
the nature of modern scientific data collection and analysis and a more solid
foundation for future achievement in a technologically demanding society.
