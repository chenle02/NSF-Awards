This research project is aimed to develop a novel 3-D surface contouring system
which can be used for industrial inspection and reverse engineering purposes.
The system is based on the full-field fringe projection technique, with a
digital fringe projection system for rapid, automated surface contouring. The
planned research tasks include: digital fringe creation and projection, adaptive
fringe projection, phase-shifting and fringe-ordering, calibration and error
compensation, and on-the-object error mapping. The technology goal is to enable
high-accuracy, high-resolution contouring with abilities for fast and accurate
location of defects. There are many challenging issues in the proposed
development, adaptation and integration of novel technology components for a 3-D
surface contouring system. The system, if successfully developed, has many
advantages compared with the coordinate measuring machines and mechanical
checking fixtures presently used in the automotive, aerospace, semiconductor,
and other industries.
