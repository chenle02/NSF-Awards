This award is for the Partnership for Research &amp; Education in Materials
(PREM) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) (Humacao, Cayey, Bayamon, and
Rio Piedras campuses) and the University of Pennsylvania (PENN) Materials
Research Science &amp; Engineering Center. Current research topics that will
continue during the extension period include nano-electronics devices,
simulations of electrodes and ion movement in supercapacitors, and development
of electrochemical biosensors. In addition, education and outreach activities
conducted with PENN will continue. The PENN-UPRH PREM has been very successful
in recruiting minority students for careers in materials science. A total of 14
new PhDs have graduated from PREM students and 23 are currently in graduate
programs in the USA and Puerto Rico.
