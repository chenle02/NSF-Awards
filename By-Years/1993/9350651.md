The goal of this project is to better prepare students of computer
science/software engineering, both majors and minors, in the areas of hardware-
dependent software development. A laboratory built around the central theme of
the interdependence of software and hardware in computer, as well as embedded,
systems will be developed. This laboratory will serve as the hands on and
experimentation center for three courses; Computer Architecture, Microprocessor
Systems, and Real-Time Software Systems. Students graduating from such a
program, will have had hands-on experiences with interfacing, data acquisition,
real-time programming, and observing the physical results of numerically
computed solutions to problems. They will be better prepared for positions as
systems developers and/or applications programmers to work as members of
computing and/or embedded systems development teams. Likewise, the laboratory to
support this series of courses will better prepare students for graduate school.
