This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Barnard College for the renovation
and repair of Altschul Hall which houses that institution's biology research and
research training activities. This building was constructed in 1969 and has not
been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $125,000 and $125,000
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by enhancing the adequacy of the space for
accommodating disparate activities, including increasing its capacity for the
maintenance of various cultures of micro- organisms and the housing of
experiments, and by an overall upgrading of the space involving modification of
its structure and the electrical, the plumbing, and the heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The increased availability of laboratory
space to students that accrues from this renovation can be expected to raise the
quality of the student research training experience and to permit more students
to study and major in biology. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and the
training of quality undergraduate students. It will help Barnard College
maintain and expand its long standing leadership as an undergraduate source of
women scientists.
