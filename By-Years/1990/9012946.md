The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. George
Gruner of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. A. Janossy of the
Hungarian Central Research Institute for Physics is to study the low temperature
and thermoelectric properties of CDW (charge density waves) conductors. Efforts
will focus on two aspects of CDW dynamics: 1) exploration of thermoelectric
phenomena in the broad frequency and electric field domains and 2) clarification
of the role played by Coulomb interactions in low temperature CDW dynamics.
Results of the research should answer fundmental questions about the validity of
Onsager relations to nonlinear systems and about the cross-over from high-
temperature to low-temperature dynamics. This project in solid state physics
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
