This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the West Coast
Operator Algebra Seminar South Eastern Analysis Meeting (WCOAS) on the campus of
the University of New Mexico, October 1-2, 2011. The WCOAS conferences bring
together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students,
and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in operator algebras. At this
meeting participants will learn of progress in most of the following fields:
free probability, subfactors, operator spaces, quantum groups, semigroups of
endomorphisms, classification of C*-algebras, non-commutative geometry; graph
C*-algebras, and non-commutative dynamical systems. The conference goal to bring
participants up to date on developments in the aforementioned areas is
especially important to junior investigators and graduate students. Particular
care is taken to ensure that the schedule is balanced between younger and more
established speakers. Based on the tradition of past successful WCOAS meetings,
there is every expectation that this conference will be an event with
significant research and training impact.

Operator Algebra refers to a broad array of related topics that sprang from
papers of Murray and von Neumann circa 1930. The initial motivation was to
provide a foundation for quantum mechanics in physics, and today there is much
overlap between various areas of physics and operator algebras. Application and
interaction of operator algebra are more broad than physics, however, getting
into number theory, dynamical systems, random matrices and numerical linear
algebra. Priority for funding and speaking opportunities will be given to
graduate students and other young researchers as well as members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics. The professional development and integration of
a diverse group of researchers into the operator algebra community are
anticipated impacts of the project. Scientifically, there is potential for
advances in the theory of operator algebras and related disciplines and
applications of operator algebras to other disciplines.
