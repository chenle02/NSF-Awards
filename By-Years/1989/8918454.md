The rust fungi are plant pathogens that are responsible for several
economically important diseases of pines and their conifer relatives. The
taxonomy and phylogeny of rust fungi are controversial because the organisms are
small, with few discernible morphological differences, and they have complex
life histories with several spore-bearing stages. Dr. Thomas Bruns of the
University of California-Berkeley will use modern molecular techniques to
investigate evolutionary relationships among rust fungi of the major family
Melampsoraceae. He has developed methods that allow specific amplification of
DNA from small amounts of fungal material, even from preserved specimens, and
with this refinement plant-host DNA will no longer interfere with the study of
the fungus. Selected nuclear and mitochondrial genes of numerous species of rust
fungi will be analyzed for their nucleotide sequences, and these will be
compared using computer programs to generate a likely phylogenetic framework for
related species. The phylogeny thus constructed for the fungi will then be
compared to current notions of pine species phylogeny to test the idea that
fungal parasites and host pines have evolved in association ("coevolution")
through geological time. In addition, the molecular analyses will provide unique
genetic markers of individual rust-fungus species, valuable for purposes of
accurate identification in other taxonomic and ecological studies.
