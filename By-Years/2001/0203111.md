The PI proposes to: 1. Analyze AMANDA II data and a program, Eview, for muon
propagation in ice. 2. Develop and test a fused silica module. 3. Develop a
fluorescence data logger to be lowered at the time of drilling a hole in ice.
This device is to provide a way to characterize the optical property of ice as a
function of depth. Funding for the duration of three years is recommendation.
Funding level for years two and three will depend on IceCube funding.
