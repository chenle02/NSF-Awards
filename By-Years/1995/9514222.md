researchers to participate in experiments at three laboratories: Brookhaven,
Fermilab and DESY. The experiments will search for rare composite hadronic
objects, measure the properties of charmonium, and probe for quark substructure.
The techniques include heavy ions, cooled antiproton beams and electron-positron
collisions in a large collider collaboration known as ZEUS. ***
