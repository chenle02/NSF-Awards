During a decision, people tend to distort new information to make it seem more
favorable to the leading alternative than it really is. The present research
explores this predecisional distortion of information in several ways. First,
what are its causes? Is distortion a sacrifice of decision accuracy in order to
preserve consistency among all evaluations, to reduce effort, or to maintain a
more positive mood based on a successful progression toward a clear decision?
Alternatively, is distortion caused by using consistency as a misguided signal
of accuracy? Second, what are its implications? Can manipulating the order or
format (but not the content) of information influence the alternative that
people choose? The answer may well be yes. Third, what are the limits of
information distortion? Does it extend to the evaluation of single alternatives
as well as to choices, to objective decisions, to predictions of future events,
to very precise information like single numbers (e.g., prices)? Finally, how can
people eliminate or at least reduce information distortion so that they do not
end up choosing an inferior alternative? Will warning alone work? Does the
apparatus of multiattribute utilities analysis prevent distortion? And last,
does deciding in a group help (or hurt)? In many important real decisions,
information is acquired sequentially (e.g., filling a job, market research, and
medical diagnosis). Furthermore, organizational pressure to justify the next
step in the information-gathering sequence may enhance distortion (rather than
detecting biased judgment). In sum, there are material implications of the
information distortion phenomenon for decision making in real, consequential
situations.
