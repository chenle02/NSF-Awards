We will conduct a textural and geochemical study of samples of gabbro (igneous
rocks crystallized within the Earth) from different depths of the crustal
section of the Oman ophiolite (a tectonic slice of oceanic crust exposed on
land). The "stratigraphic position" of samples in the crustal section is well
known, and therefore these samples provide an excellent opportunity to determine
vertical variation in igneous crystallization histories. After filtering out
variation that is related to composition, we will look for systematic
similarities or differences in cooling rates between upper and lower gabbros,
using textural and compositional characteristics that may record the initial
stages of igneous crystallization. Image processing will be used to obtain
crystal size distributions (CSD) to constrain nucleation rates, growth rates and
residence times. Analysis of these parameters can be used to estimate cooling
rates during crystallization. Additionally, analysis of textural data on EPR and
SWIR gabbros will allow us to assess how Oman samples compare with those from
two contrasting mid-ocean ridge environments. Such studies will provide
constraints on the magma storage, thermal history and structural evolution of
magmatic systems at oceanic spreading ridges.
