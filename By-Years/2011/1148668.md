The specification of goals in the form of utility or reward functions is a
cornerstone of most approaches to developing autonomous artificial agents, and
to understanding and shaping the behavior of natural biological agents - in
fields ranging from control, AI, economics, psychology, and ethology. But in
practice there are actually two notions of goals: the (human or evolutionary)
designer's goals and the (artificial or natural) agent's goals. Should these be
the same? The conventional (implicit) answer is "yes", but new work by the PIs
shows that the answer may be "no" for computationally bounded agents. We define
a new problem in agent design, the optimal rewards problem, whose solution is a
reward function to assign to the agent so that in attempting to maximize its
reward the agent best achieves the designer's goals. This project explores
optimal rewards, through computational experimentation and analysis, on two
broad fronts. We will develop new principles and algorithms for bounded planning
agents, demonstrating increased performance over using conventional rewards,
even when taking into account the cost of finding the optimal rewards. We will
make significant advances in two areas of behavioral economics and ethology: the
understanding of subjective utility in humans, and the understanding of foraging
behavior in animals, by using optimal reward theory to rigorously derive
subjective reward functions that take into account the computational limits of
the natural agents. The results of this work, disseminated through published
theory and software, should lead to foundational changes in the way we
understand and design incentive structures for humans, animals, and artificial
agents, and thus to significant practical benefits for any methods in
engineering, education, economics, and health that depend on finding good
incentives for desired behavioral outcomes.
