The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory is held approximately
every eighteen months at sites alternating between the United States and foreign
countries. The 1991 symposium will be held June 24 through June 28 in Budapest,
Hungry. The areas covered in this symposium will include detection and
estimation theory, coding and modulation, neural nets and communications, source
coding, data compression, storage channels, multi-user comminications,
cryptography, data networks, pattern recognition, optical communications, and
information theory. The proposal requests support partial travel support for US
scientists whose papers have beem selected but who sould without support be
unable to attend. Many of these will be advanced graduate students. About 30
awards are anticipated. The awardees will be chosen by a committee headed by the
PI. This is one of two such meetings for which the NCR program has a history of
providing partical travel support. The other is the IEEE Communications Theory
Workshop.
