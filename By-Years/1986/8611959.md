CARPENTER The investigator intends to develop and analyze models of neural
systems networks. These models will be designed to carry out a self-organizing
pattern recognition and category learning. As formal architectures, the models
will be translated into machine designs. As neural networks, the systems will be
based on psychological and physiological data and will be used to analyze the
brain and behavior in the process of pattern recognition and category learning.
From a mathematical point of view, these models are based on nonlinear,
singular, high dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations. Network
design is constrained by the conflicting requirements of stability and
adaptability, and by the complexity. Given an arbitrary complicated sequence of
inputs, the system must be able to extract stable categories, without a teacher.
However, the system must also remain plastic, open to new learning. New network
designs will generalize systems which have been shown to stably encode arbitrary
lists of binary input patterns in such a way that, after an initial phase, each
input directly activates its category representation. The search mechanism is
automatically disengaged once the learning is complete. The more general system
will encode graded input patterns, and be embedded in network hierarchies
adapted to the particular constraints of natural and artificial vision and
speech. Research described in this project is highly cross-disciplinary, as it
involves the neural networks science, communications, some aspects of robotics
and computer vision, neural cognitive processes, and mathematics.
