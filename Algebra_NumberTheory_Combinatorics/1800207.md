This project aims to investigate a central object in modern algebraic
combinatorics: a class of cluster algebras. These cluster algebras are related
to a wide variety of other mathematical objects arising in algebraic geometry,
representation theory, and other areas, but are also important in particle
physics, where they are related to scattering amplitudes in certain quantum
field theories. Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only
interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in
other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for
students through involvement in the research.

Rigid modules, invariant curves, and knots are fundamental objects in many
branches of mathematics. This project takes a cluster-algebraic approach to
studying these objects. The research goal, largely motivated by homological
mirror symmetry, is to study invariants for indecomposable modules over
hereditary algebras, for quiver Grassmannians, and for alternating knots. The
project aims to develop new combinatorial and geometric objects to reveal more
concrete relationships between cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics.
The educational goal of this project is to train undergraduate and graduate
students in topics at the intersection of algebra, combinatorics, geometry,
topology, and representation theory.
