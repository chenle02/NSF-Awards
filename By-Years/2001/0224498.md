ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0224498&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although dissolved organic nitrogen
(DON) is the largest reservoir of fixed nitrogen in the surface ocean, little is
know about its relationship to nitrogen fixation and the nitrogen nutrient
requirements of the oceanic phytoplankton. In this Small Grant for Exploratory
Research, investigators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will take
advantage of a cruise to the centtral gyre of the North Pacific Ocean to study
the relationship between climate variation, water column physics, the biological
community dynamics of obligate diazotrophs, and the production of dissolved
organic nitrogen. The research team will conduct observational studies as well
as shipboard incubation experiments to determine how the fixed nitrogen
generated by the activities of Trichodesmium and other diazotrophs are cycled in
the surface ocean and how it relates to the pool of DON.&lt;br/&gt;
