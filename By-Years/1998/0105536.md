The research focuses on techniques, algorithms, and methodologies for the
analysis and transformation of monolithic programs, which use operations on
entire arrays. High-level monolithic analysis drives the mechanical optimization
and efficient scalarization of such programs. Whereas optimization of monolithic
code has previously focused primarily on expressions, this project investigates
optimization over larger units of program granularity.

The optimum elimination of unnecessary array partial results, with a particular
focus on partial results assigned to a program variable may studied. A given
array value assigned to a program variable may contain a permutation of the
elements in some other array variable, and hence a compiler may be able to avoid
materializing the given value. In contrast to minimizing materializations, there
are situations where compiler introduced materializations, such as data
rearrangement, or partial materializations, can significantly improve the
efficiency of memory access at various levels of the memory hierarchy.
Optimization techniques are studied both for avoiding materializations and for
utilizing compiler introduced materializations.

An intrinsic aspect of compiling monolithic code is scalarization. The use of
monolithic analysis to obtain information that guides or drives scalarization,
hopefully directly yielding optimized scalarized code.
