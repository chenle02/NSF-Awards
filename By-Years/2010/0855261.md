The objective of this project is to acquire and set up a wireless measurement
infrastructure and use it to research new wireless link signatures and their
applications. The signature of a wireless link between a wireless transmitter
and a receiver represents the wireless link's unique physical characteristics.
Wireless link signature applications include secret key establishment between a
wireless transmitter and a receiver without ever communicating the secret key,
and location distinction which is the ability to detect at one or more receivers
when a transmitter changes its location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this research includes (i) extensive measurements of wireless link
characteristics under (a) heterogeneous indoor and outdoor settings, (b) a
variety of wireless standards with different types of transmitters, and (c)
different frequency bands with the help of highly capable spectrum analyzers,
(ii) development of novel methodologies for different wireless link signature
applications including location distinction, and secret key establishment, using
these measurements, and (iii) evaluation of the methodologies through
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research impacts the development and
deployment of wireless link signature-based applications. It also contributes a
vast amount of measurement data that is useful for understanding unique wireless
link characteristics, and also traditional wireless link performance modeling
and evaluation. This research activity is integrated in the education curriculum
through new measurement and inference projects in the networking and security
classes. Furthermore, this research is used in conjunction with an existing NSF
STEP project for high school outreach.
