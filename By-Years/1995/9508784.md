9508784 Reimer This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Paul Meyer Reimer of the Turner
Precision X-ray Laboratory at Goshen College. This fellowship will enable Dr.
Reimer to begin a collaboration with Dr. Hiroo Hashizume of the Tokyo Institute
of Technology to develop new x-ray methods to investigate two-dimensional
physics: the understanding of surfaces and interfaces. This project aims to
develop new methods of finding the atomic structures of surfaces and interfaces
based on high-intensity x-ray scattering experiments. The research program is in
the spirit of the Program objectives to transfer and exchange scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr.
Reimer will make measurements and become familiar with research techniques and
equipment at the nearby Photon Factory synchrotron in Tsukuba, in addition to
other contributions to the research effort. The fellowship will enable Dr.
Reimer to work with a premier researcher, as well as developing personal and
professional connections with a wider group of researchers at one of Japan's
foremost research facilities.
