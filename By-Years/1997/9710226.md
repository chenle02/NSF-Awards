Percival Lowell was an astronomer of the later Victorian era. This book-length
biography will reveal new facets of Lowell by placing his life and work in
cultural context. The book will show how Lowell's upper-class background in
Victorian Boston and his ten-year testing of scientific approaches to
understanding Japanese culture shaped his decision to establish the Lowell
Observatory and to embark on projects such as the searches for life on Mars and
on Planet X. To accomplish this task the biography will necessarily explore the
borderland between history of science and cultural history and will explore such
themes as Lowell the Brahmin, the Victorian polymath, and the evolutionist in
order to clarify the intersection between science and culture. Among the sources
to be consulted are the papers of Lowell's contemporaries and rivals, including
Seth Chandler, W.W. Campbell, and E.E. Barnard.
