Abstract CTS-0120135 S. McLean, University of California Santa Barbara

This is a renewal proposal of the Grant CTS-9634261 "Mechanism of sediment
transport in complex flows" which ended in August 2001. In this Grant, the
research is focused on the interaction mechanisms between the bed forms and the
flow, and the processes by which the flow field moves the sediment grains as
bedload or suspended load. The investigations were carried out by experiments in
a flume and simple method of predicting sediment flux over a two-dimensional
dune was developed. In the present proposal, the PI plans to investigate the
processes governing how gradients in sediment flux give rise to changes in bed
topography. More specifically, it is proposed to investigate five different
types of flow with increasing complexity.
