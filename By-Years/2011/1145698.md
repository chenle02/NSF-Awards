The concept of experimental paleogenetics was proposed more than forty years ago
as a way to exploit molecular sequence information to gain a better
understanding modern phenotypic diversity. Only recently have computational
reconstructions of ancestral sequences been supported by models of character
state inference and robust phylogenies. Laboratory synthesis of the inferred
genes and proteins has, in turn, guided inference regarding ancestral phenotypes
based on the properties of these ancient biomolecules. This approach aims to
improve the accuracy in inferring ancient genes though the development of an
application in experimental phylogenetics. The approach allows researchers to
connect genotype and phenotype for ancestral sequence reconstruction methods in
a manner currently not possible. The software uses theoretical and computational
simulations to benchmark the performances of various models. The proposed
research will extend and experimentally validate the field of ancestral sequence
reconstruction, allowing researchers to place confidence in the ability of
ancestral sequence reconstruction to facilitate the community's understanding of
molecular adaptation.

The research group participates in teaching and service activities intended to
train the next generation of scientists. On one hand, this consists of teaching
courses that include Evolutionary Synthetic Biology and Astrobiology. On the
other hand, this consists of promoting scientific ideas and training outside of
the University setting. For instance, a K-12 science outreach program has been
created to promote a diverse learning community and increase the participation
of underrepresented groups in evolutionary biology and molecular evolution
research.
