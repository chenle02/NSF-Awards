Guckenheimer 0101208 The investigator studies slow-fast decompositions and
bifurcations of trajectories in dynamical systems with multiple time scales.
This extends the theory of bifurcation in generic families of dynamical systems
to those with two time scales. Emphasis is placed upon relaxation oscillations,
periodic orbits that have both slow and fast segments. The initial stages of the
work seek a classification of degenerate decompositions appearing in periodic
orbits of one parameter families with relaxation oscillations. Geometric methods
are used to determine bifurcations associated with each degenerate
decomposition. Numerical investigation of examples is used to motivate the work
and to ensure that the results are directly applicable to biological models.
Together with collaborators Kathleen Hoffman and Warren Weckesser, the
investigator is reexamining a classical example, the forced van der Pol system
that gave birth to the discovery of chaos for dissipative dynamical systems, and
expects to give a full description of the bifurcations that occur within this
system. He also develops algorithms for the computation of structures that are
difficult to compute with existing methods. Rhythmic phenomena are ubiquitous in
biological systems. Examples include the heartbeat, the cell cycle, circadian
rhythms, legged locomotion, and electrical signals in the nervous system. Most
of these involve multiple time scales. The investigator pursues new mathematical
theory and computational methods that apply to dynamical systems with multiple
time scales. Emphasis is given to models of neural systems, an area in which the
presence and importance of complex dynamics are manifest. The investigations
draw upon decades of research in characterizing generic phenomena observed in
dynamical systems with a single time scale. The resulting body of mathematics,
sometimes called chaos theory, needs extension and modification to fully explain
the behavior of systems with multiple time scales. Those extensions are the goal
of this project. On a longer time frame, the project lays foundations for coming
generations of biological models for cellular processes such as gene expression
and signal transduction. New biotechnology leads to ever more complicated
reaction networks that are simulated as dynamical systems. This project produces
results that aid the implementation and interpretation of such simulations of
complex, multiple time scale dynamical systems.
