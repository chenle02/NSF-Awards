In response to concerns about health-related problems associated with the drift
of agricultural pesticides to people located near application sites, safer, more
concentrated means of application have been developed. Major questions remain
unanswered regarding the degree to which people are still exposed to chronic,
low-level amounts of pesticides. This project will evaluate of data on pesticide
applications, weather patterns, and population patterns from sites in
California, Ohio, and New Jersey to test three hypotheses related to the impacts
of agricultural pesticides on suburban residential populations: (1) Traditional
analyses of pesticide drift as a hazard only when acute, high-level exposures
occur underestimates levels of potential chronic, low-level exposures, (2)
suburban development into agricultural areas magnifies possibilities for
chronic, low-level exposures, and (3) demographics patterns further increase
risks because suburban populations usually have higher proportions of children
and young adults, which are the groups most vulnerable to chronic pesticide
exposures. This project will significantly enhance our knowledge of the dynamics
by which pesticide drift affects nearby populations by relating data from
different sources in three representative but distinctive sites. The research
also will provide valuable new insights that can be used to evaluate current and
prospective policies regarding pesticide application and urban development, and
it will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to
continue to develop independent research skills.
