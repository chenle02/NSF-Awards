Custom domain-specific architectures have great promise for achieving energy-
efficient flexible designs for a suite of applications. For practical
deployment, however, there is a great need to develop smart algorithms for
mapping applications of interest onto these architectures. The main thrust of
this research is to discover novel mapping algorithms by making use of human
intuition and ability to recognize patterns and opportunities even in complex
problems. Participants are presented with successively more difficult mapping
problems in a game environment, and the vast dataset of participants' moves is
analyzed to recognize common patterns used by successful game participants. The
insights gained from strategic moves humans make while solving problems based on
their visual intuition and experience can be used to discover new mapping
approaches that are beyond what can be conceived with traditional algorithms.
For broad scope and impact, this research places particular attention on
multiple architectural designs, highly constrained (and thus very difficult)
mapping problems, and engaging a broad community of contributors through
crowdsourcing.

Fast and effective mapping techniques, and a methodology for developing new such
techniques as needed has the potential to inspire architectural innovation and
result in production of devices that are faster, cheaper, and smarter. Results
from this research can advance next generation portable/wearable devices
critical to health, safety and security, personal multimedia, and aerospace.
