The Eleventh ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM
SIGCOMM and ACM SIGMETRICS, in cooperation with USENIX, is to be held in Berlin,
Germany, November 2-4, 2011. This award provides funding to assist approximately
8 graduate students from US institutions to attend this conference. IMC is the
primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing
measurements of the Internet. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount
importance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have
the opportunity to present their work and all attendees have a chance to
interact with many others performing leading-edge research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal will serve to
widen the audience attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising
the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new
investigations, and higher quality research. Given the rising cost of
international travel, the grant will enable students (who otherwise do not have
sufficient funds) to attend the conference in
Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This award, by enabling students
to attend who might not otherwise be able, increases the dissemination of the
conference?s research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also
integrates research and education of graduate students by allowing students to
observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the
field. Giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students widens
the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by
advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a
more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the
conference.
