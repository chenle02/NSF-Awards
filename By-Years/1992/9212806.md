This equipment will be used for several research projects, including, in
particular, (i) the investigation of growth and protein synthesis rates during
the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (ii) the study of protein synthesis
and secretion in mammalian cells, and (iii) the evaluation of feeding and growth
rates during the cell cycle of Tetrahymena pyriformis. The rotor equipment will
be used (i) in combination with fixed asynchronously grown cell populations for
the preparation of size fractions of cells for the determination of their
macromolecular composition with conventional techniques, and (ii) in combination
with viable asynchronous cell populations for the generation and subsequent
study of synchronized cell populations. These studies will complement ongoing
investigations that are carried out on synchronous cell populations using flow
cytometry as an analytical tool, and that have suggested the occurance of
several cell cycle dependent dynamic phenomena that are highly significant for
the use of eukaryotic organisms for engineering purposes.
