Pathogens play an important role in the health, welfare, and survival of
wildlife, agricultural, and human populations. Only recently, however, has it
become evident how quickly pathogens can change, rapidly developing drug
resistance, adapting to new hosts, and becoming more (and less) virulent. These
changes may be predictable. By understanding how traits beneficial to a pathogen
(e.g., reproduction and transmission) are linked to potentially costly traits
(like harming one's host), we may be able to explain how pathogens change under
certain ecological conditions. The proposed research will first examine the
relationship between replication, transmission, and virulence, using a lethal
virus of salamanders as a model system. Then, using these relationships among
traits, it will assess how this virus changes its level of virulence under
conditions favoring or inhibiting transmission. Understanding how and why
virulence changes over time can make epidemics predictable, and potentially more
easily controlled. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
