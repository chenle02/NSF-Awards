This proposal will investigate a new manufacturing process which builds up
parts in layers from a powder by selectively sintering each layer with a laser.
The objective of the process is to automatically produce three-dimensional parts
of general shape directly from a CAD database without part-specific tooling or
human intervention. Each layer that is built up corresponds to a cross-section
of the part. Powder is deposited into a box in thin layers; after each layer is
deposited, the surface of the powder is raster-scanned with a high-power laser
beam. The intensity of the laser beam is modulated so that the powder is
sintered or fused in the areas that are to be occupied by the part at that
particular cross-section. In those areas not sintered, the powder remains loose.
Another layer of powder is then deposited and raster-scanned. The process is
repeated until the entire part is produced. The methodology to be used is an
experimental/empirical approach used in conjunction with computer modeling and
analysis. The objectives of the proposed research are to formulate a process
model and rules for selection of powders and process parameters, and to explore
post-treatments. Preliminary work has been conducted with plastic powder; the
proposed work is needed to demonstrate feasibility with common engineering
materials. The proposed process which produces a three-dimensional part by the
combination of a raster scan and selective sintering from a CAD database without
part specific tooling or human intervention appears to be novel. This process
should facilitate the quick production of prototype parts which should reduce
product development time.
