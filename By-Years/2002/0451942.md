The COSMOS Corporation has served as an external evaluator for the Urban
Systemic Program (USP) since its inception in FY1999-2000. To date a nearly
completed cross-site evaluation has been conducted on the first two cohorts of
the USP. The emerging data show that the USP has positively impacted STEM
education in urban schools (and improved student achievement) across the first
two cohorts.

Funds are requested to ensure that evaluative efforts span the entire portfolio
(cohorts 1-3) to provide a longer-term perspective for education reform over a
number of years. In addition, the proposed project will allow the researchers to
test the construct validity of reform measures to ensure that the instruments
used adequately and accurately assess the worth and merit of the systemic
reform.
