This project explores algorithmic techniques for archival, indexing and reuse of
complex knowledge. Hierarchical graphs have emerged as a powerful knowledge
representation structures, however existing database and data mining techniques
are not able to manage the extreme combinatorial complexities required to
compare, classify, index and cluster these structures as primitive data
elements. Research challenges include (1) capturing the inner structure of graph
based models, and their topological sub-structures, to use for pattern matching
purposes; (2) classify the stability of these approximation techniques in the
presence of noise; (3) identifying how to translate these techniques into
suitable database mechanisms. The basis of the approach is a mapping of the
topological structure of a graph into a low-dimensional vector space through an
eigenvalue characterization. This SGER studies these problems in the context of
collaborative and distributed engineering design, where teams of agents (human
and computational) interact over the network to realize a product (e.g.,
software, electro-mechanical device, building, etc.). This process is modeled as
a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes the design modeling operations and
decisions, as well as the flow of the information along the modeling time-steps.
Knowledge acquisition agents will be fielded to capture these knowledge
structures and a validation of the theoretical methodology for indexing and
reuse of process knowledge will performed. Some of this work will be done in
collaboration with Bentley Systems. If successful, these techniques will lead to
dramatic new possibilities for database and information management systems:
allowing them to efficiently store complex graphs as single large objects and
identify useful patterns in and across large sets of these combinatorial
structures.
