The research objective of this award is to develop facile methods to allow
conjugated organic molecules forming a highly organized nanolayer structure.
Three main tasks will be performed: 1) rationally design a head-tail structure
for a conjugated molecule: the head operates as a critical component for charge
conduction and the tail as an active component for layered linkage; 2)
investigate the layered formation process and optimize the packing of the
ordered structures: the organization depends upon many factors, such as chemical
design of the head-tail structure, conformational changes after organization,
and a quantified assessment of the interactions between these molecules; and 3)
model the molecular packing, revealing size effect or functional group effect to
a desired structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to design, synthesize and
model molecules and allow them to form rarely observed nanolayers will add
significantly to the body of knowledge regarding to material design/surface
engineering. If successful, the ordered film is expected to possess superior
electronic properties unachievable in bulk materials. As a result, this work is
expected to be of general interest to research laboratories and high-tech
industries working on biological thin films, organic electronics, large-area
flexible displays, mobile devices, and high-speed sensors. Graduate and
undergraduate engineering students and high school teachers will benefit through
classroom instruction and summer research involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
