"Biotechnology Technicians for the Future" is expanding and disseminating
successful activities developed and implemented through "An Advanced
Biotechnology Education Partnership Program," funded through the ATE program
(94-54555). The overall goal of the project is the improvement of technical
education in biotechnology. It represents a collaborative effort among the
Biotechnology Laboratory Technician Program at Madison Area Technical College,
the University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement Program, and the industry-
supported BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute. Efforts-to-date include
the development and dissemination of curriculum materials for technician
training at the two-year associate degree level; teacher enhancement activities
for associate degree instructors and high school teachers; and, school-to-work
experiences for high school students. Through this grant, these activities are
being significantly enhanced through: (1) continuing technician curriculum
development and dissemination, (2) expanding participation geographically
through collaboration with other University of Wisconsin system campuses and
other technical and community colleges in the state and in the Midwest region;
(3) increasing participation by students and faaulty at all levels from middle
school through baccalaureate programs; (4) offering opportunities for "lifelong
learning" to technicians already employed; and, (5) increasing the participation
of qualified women, minorities and persons with disabilities. This partnership,
supported by an extended network of collaborators, is poised to effectively meet
the challenge of recruiting, training and providing continuing education for
employees so critical to the continued success of the biotechnology industry,
offering the Wisconsin Model for replication. *
