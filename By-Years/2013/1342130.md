This workshop on "Airborne Networks and Communications" in conjunction with the
annual American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
Infotech@Aerospace Conference will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, on Aug. 21,
2013. The workshop will provide a discussion forum for researchers in
disciplines important for airborne networking, including wireless
communications, autonomous air vehicles, routing planning, cyber-physical
security, and test beds, and important to real-world situations such as in
disaster relief during which communications, coordination, and sensing are
critical. This project provides travel support for invited speakers and for U.S.
graduate students.
