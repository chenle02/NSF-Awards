9424113 Rosakis This project will study the dynamic decohesion and failure of
polymer/metal and polymer/ceramic biomaterial interfaces. It is a cooperative
three year parallel experimental and analytical study involving two universities
with differing expertise. A variety on biomaterial systems possessing different
mechanical property mismatch and bond strengths will be tested. Fractographic
studies of the failure surfaces using SEM microscopy will be made. High strain
rates will be included in the experiments. The results of differing experiments
will be jointly evaluated. ***
