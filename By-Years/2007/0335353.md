This small grant for exploratory research aims to develop an integrated
architecture for intelligent behavior. Most work in this area has focused on a
particular class of architectures - production systems. This work proposes a new
novel cognitive architecture, Icarus, that embodies quite different principles.
The research will make basic advances in representation, utilization, and
acquisition of knowledge in intelligent physical agents. Moreover, it relies
centrally on the integration of these capabilities into a unified cognitive
architecture that must be general enough to operate in many domains. Such a
unified framework for intelligent behavior could have a major impact on both
artificial intelligence and cognitive science.&lt;br/&gt;
