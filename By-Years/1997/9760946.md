*** 9760946 Roychoudhry This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
is aimed at developing a low temperature methane catalytic combustor for
applications in power generation, air purification and emissions control. In
Phase I of this Project, PCI will develop an adherent high specific surface area
coating for the, short channel length, high cell density (SCL-HCD) metal
monolith elements, incorporate the catalytically active phase (of palladium) on
the resulting high specific area substrate, and test the viability and
efficiency of these catalyst systems for low temperature catalytic oxidation of
methane. This technology has potentially important applications for ultra-low
NOx power generation. Because of the economic penalties associated with NOx
production, catalytic combustion is being increasingly recognized as a clean and
efficient alternative to exhaust after treatment. Based on previous PCI work in
catalytic combustion applications, an SCL-HCD metal monolith based catalytic
combustor could be appropriate for power generation across the full size, range,
from very small mobile source applications (30 kW range) up through machines
generating two hundred MW of power. ***
