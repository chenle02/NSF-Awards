With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Howard E. Zimmerman of the University of Wisconsin - Madison will
study mechanistic fundamentals of organic photochemistry, via computational
approaches to understanding of hypersurfaces and radiationless processes, and
computationally supported systematic approaches to solid state photochemistry.
The project includes examination of ways to predict the ability of alternative
transition structures to fit in reactant crystal lattices (i.e. ways to
determine what products are viable in solid state photoreactions), studies of
whether barriers on excited hypersurfaces or radiationless decay processes
control photoproduct formation in certain specific instances, and a study of
polymer matrices as constraints on molecular photochemistry. The phase in which
a chemical reaction is conducted - crystal, amorphous solid, liquid, or gas -
can determine the outcome of the reaction. Crystal constraints are frequently
very great but are not usually readily predictable. This work will develop a way
of prediction of favored reaction pathways for light-induced reactions in
crystals using computational techniques. Other computational techniques will
allow understanding of details of reactions in less constrained environments
