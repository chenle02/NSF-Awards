This research is concerned with the development of fast algorithms for
constraint satisfaction problem. Constraint satisfaction formations are
currently used in many ways, including the generating test of correctness for
electronic circuits, the understanding of line drawings by computer, the
solution of combinatorial problems, and folding of RNA molecules. The set of
constraint satisfaction problems is one of the NP complete problem sets, so it
is unlikely that a fast algorithm for all constraint satisfaction problems will
ever be found. For several hundred years some of the best researchers have been
looking for fast algorithms for NP complete problems sets, and they have never
found an algorithm that is fast for every problem in an NP complete set. None
the less, algorithms have been found that are fast for most problems in certain
NP complete problems sets. This research is concerned with sets where the
importance of the problems in the sets vary as parameters associated with the
set are varied. By studying the average running time of particular algorithms as
the parameters are varied, algorithms that are fast under a wide range of
conditions can be found.
