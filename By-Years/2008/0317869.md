Dr Yee is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program to study the unusual magnetic properties of tetraazaphorphyrin-based
molecular magnets. The first goal of the program is to discern how the
competition between zero-field splitting and interstack coupling effects
magnetic properties of OETAP complexes. These studies will center on the
differences of manganese and iron OETAP complexes since the manganese complex is
spin-glass-like while the iron complex exhibits a canted ferromagnetic state.
The second major goal of the program is to examine how changes in the size or
nature of the peripheral alkyl groups of the porphyrin effect antiferromagnetic
interstack coupling. Proposed studies will utilize SQUID magnetometry and
Mossbauer spectroscopy. The study of molecular magnetism will provide a rational
approach to the production of ordered spin systems that display net magnetism in
the absence of an applied field. Further, understanding magnetic behavior of new
materials could lead to the development of new magnetic media for information
storage.
