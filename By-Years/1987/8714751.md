Crystalline salts that contain alkali metal anions (alkalides) or trapped
electrons (electrides) and cations complexed by cyclic or bicyclic poly-oxa or
poly-aza molecules will be synthesized and characterized. Emphasis will be
placed on the search for thermally stable alkalides and electrides. Species
identification will be made by optical spectroscopy alkali metal NMR
spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibilities. Structural studies by x-ray powder
and single crystal diffraction will be made in order to correlate structure and
properties. Conductivities, susceptibilities, EPR, and alkali metal NMR studies
will be made on powders and, where feasible, on single crystals. The utilization
of solutions of alkalides and electrides in aprotic solvents such as dimethyl
ether and THF to carry out reductions of salts to elemental metals will be
explored.
