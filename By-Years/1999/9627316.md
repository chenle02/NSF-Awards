First-order logic is a common formalism for representing mathematical and other
formal knowledge. Many traditional techniques for proving first-order theorems
on a computer suffer from severe inefficiencies on certain kinds of problems
such as near-propositional highly non-Horn problems. Under previous grants,
theorem proving strategies have been developed that avoid many of these
propositional inefficiencies. These include hyper- linking and hyper-linking
with semantics. The latter method is able to make use of realistic models, or
semantics, of the problem. However, the kinds of models it can use are limited
to those involving linear inequalities and those with finite domains. This
approach will now be extended to include a much more general class of models,
those whose functions and predicates are computable. First-order logic with
equality is a more powerful formalism that is also often applicable. For this
formalism, methods based on term-rewriting systems are commonly applied. The
above-mentioned semantic techniques will be extended to first-order logic with
equality. Other topics related to equality will also be studied, such as rigid
E-unification and specialized algorithms for handling permutations that arise
from equational systems. A general framework---recently developed for studying
the search efficiency of theorem proving strategies, and applied in a largely
propositional context---will be extended to first-order logic. Complexity issues
related to term-rewriting proofs will also be studied. ***
