Despite a major focus on nitrogen as the limiting nutrient in marine
ecosystems, there is evidence that in some marine environments, especially the
vast oligotrophic central gyres, that phosphate appears to be refractory and
potentially limiting, although a fraction of the phosphate pool does appear to
turn over rapidly. Dissolved nucleic acids will be examined as a model component
of this rapidly-cycling fraction, because many of the breakdown rates and the
concentrations of the resulting intermediates can be measured. These parameters
will be measured by a combination of fluorometric, isotopic, and
spectrophotometric techniques and will be compared to parallel measurement of
the major phosphate pools and fluxes. This project will test the hypotheses that
microbial breakdown of dissolved nucleic acids is both: 1) a quantitatively
important pathway, and 2) a model pathway for the cycling of labile dissolved
organic phosphate in the oligotrophic North Atlantic. This research will further
our understanding of the cycling of dissolved organic phosphate, a suite of
compounds with potentially global importance to marine primary production.
Furthermore, this research will lead to insights into microbial processes of
biopolymer and monomer breakdown. Finally, since dissolved nucleic acids are
genetic material and also significant reservoirs of dissolved organic carbon and
nitrogen, these studies will increase our knowledge of environmental gene
transfer and of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen cycling in the
environment.
