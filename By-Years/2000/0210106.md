&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a NER proposal for a specific one-year
trial to (1) characterize single ZnO nanowire laser structures using spatially-
resolved confocal microscopy detection, and (2) to introduce pump - stimulated
emission dump probing to study stimulated emission processes of single nanowire
laser configurations. The requisite morphologies of ZnO nanowires have been
produced and synthetic refinement will be performed to obtain the best quality
crystalline patterns of multiple nanowires. Laser and confocal optical
microscopy tools that are available in this laboratory will be used to optically
excite ZnO single nanowire laser media and to detect spectrally and spatially
resolved stimulated emission. These include novel ultrafast pump-dump
experiments with a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser. The fundamental science of the
exciton-exciton scattering mechanism to produce stimulated emission in
crystalline nanowires and the transition to an electron-hole plasma stimulated
emission mechanism will be explored. These studies are designed to develop new
confocal microscopy methods to interrogate nanowire laser devices, with the
specific ability to explore a single device at a time. Single molecule
spectroscopy experiments have revealed a number of intriguing aspects of
individual molecular environments over the last few years. These studies are
intended to transfer this remarkable type of investigation to the study of
single nanowire lasers and stimulated emission.&lt;br/&gt;
