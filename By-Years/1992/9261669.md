This project concerns the development of a diode-pumped solid state laser for
material processing. The laser is expected to demonstrate 45% conversion
efficiency from diode pump light to fiber coupled light at 2 and 1 micron
wavelengths. The increased efficiency results from the novel pumping geometry
which traps the light into an optical cavity containing the laser rod. Also,
diodes produce only light which is directly usable by the solid- state material,
reducing the thermal difficulties associated with arc lamp sources which produce
light throughout the spectrum. The research seeks to develop a small-scale laser
to deliver at least 8 watts of power through the optical fiber at 2 micron and 1
micron wavelengths. The geometry can potentially deliver 500 watts from a single
industrial-sized laser. Multiple rods of this size can be coupled to achieve
multi-kilowatt power delivery through a single optical fiber. Thus, the research
is focused on results that could lead to next generation equipment that could
substantially raise production rates and reduce costs in manufacturing processes
such as welding and cutting.
