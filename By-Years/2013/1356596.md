The University of Hawaii at Hilo seeks to establish a scholarship program for 19
economically disadvantaged students who intend to major in astronomy, biology,
chemistry, computer science, geology, marine science, mathematics, or physics.
The goal of the proposal is to recruit local Hawaii students as well as students
from the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands (Samoa and Micronesia) and retain them
in these targeted STEM fields through graduation. The following support services
are planned for the participants: (a) a summer Bridge Program prior to the
freshman year, (b) faculty mentoring, (c) peer-tutoring for introductory STEM
courses, (d) summer and academic year research support on campus, (e)
opportunities for research internships, (f) advising and support to participate
in summer research programs at US mainland universities, and (g) community
service in which students provide math and science tutoring for K-12 students.
Some of the program activities operate in conjunction with, but expand upon,
current university programs, such as the Keaholoa STEM Scholars Program
(supported under the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program), while other
activities are new initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data generated through
assessment and evaluation supports the rationale that institutionalizing
initiatives that provide students with a supportive community motivate them to
become self-identified scientists who are retained through graduation. Formative
and summative evaluation focuses on determining which support strategies are
most effective and which can be improved in relation to four areas (a)
recruitment and retention, (b) student support activities, (c) research
opportunities and internships, and (d) STEM careers/graduate education. Data
collection methodologies include mixed methods, including faculty and student
participant surveys, interviews and observations. Dissemination occurs through
annual professional society meetings and peer-reviewed education journals such
as the Journal of College Science Teaching. Project deliverables include results
of summative evaluation and the activities developed within the project.
