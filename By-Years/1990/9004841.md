Deadly Toxic yeasts secrete proteins that are toxic to other yeasts. The P.I.s
interested in evaluating the role of toxic yeasts in the organization of natural
communities of yeasts species. The investigators past work has shown that these
yeasts are relatively common in nature with at least one species present in all
communities examined (i.e. the distinct yeasts communities associated with stem
necroses of various cacti, slime fluxes of trees and decaying tissue of fruits).
The P.I.'s will investigate two different yeasts, Pichia Kluyveri and P.
thermotolerans, that occur in rotting fruits and decaying stems of cactus
respectively. The system of Toxic P. Kluveri is especially interesting since it
has a very flexible genetic system that displays species specific killing
genotypes. In order to understand and link the knowledge on both the genetics
and ecology the investigators will do an in depth ecological survey that assays
genotypes of P. Kluyveri in conjunction with he resistance phenotypes of
associated yeast species. This work, in parallel with detailed laboratory
genetic analysis and field/laboratory experiments designed to reveal the
adaptive significance of specific killer genotypes should allow the evaluation
of the importance of toxin production to the organization of the community. The
proposed work with P. thermotoloerans will provide comparative information from
a relative different system; an system that is restricted terms of hosts
(saguaro cactus) and geography (Sonoran Desert). The overall goal is to
understand the fundamental reasons for community structure. Deadly toxins in
yeasts represent an opportunity to study a case where the mechanism of
interference competition is clear and unambiguous.
