Funds are provided for a modeling study focused on processes that control melt
pond evolution on sea ice. The general objective is to understand the physical
processes that generate melt pond growth through lateral and bottom melting and
evaluate the potential role of pond albedo feedback mechanisms. The main
hypothesis to be tested is that melt pond growth involves a feedback process
whereby increased pond depth and pond size leads to a decrease in pond albedo
and greater solar absorption by the pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
approach is to simulate an idealized melt pond using a coupled pond/ice model
based on large-eddy simulation (LES) and a three-dimensional ice model.
Predicted melt pond characteristics, such as the ratio of the side to bottom
melt and vertical heat flux, will be tabulated and used to construct a
simplified melt pond model based on a bulk thermodynamic energy budget.
Ultimately, the simplified pond model will be coupled with a hydrological sea
ice melt water model for use as a parameterization of summer melting sea
ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our present inability to model the summer evolution of
melt ponds on sea ice constitutes a significant shortcoming of climate models.
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be rapidly transitioned
into improvements of these climate models.&lt;br/&gt;
