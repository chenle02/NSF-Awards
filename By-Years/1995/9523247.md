The objective of the proposed research is to explore the effects of
biodiversity in plant species and of plant growth forms on ecosystem cycling of
C and N in arctic tundra. In addition, it will test whether functional groups of
plants are an adequate approximation for detailed physiological information on
all species in understanding vegetation controls over ecosystem processes and
the response of ecosystems to perturbations. Effort will be focused on arctic
tundra, a high priority ecosystem. An integrated program of modeling and
experimentation is proposed. Experimentally, diversity in the tundra will be
manipulated by removing different growth forms of tundra plants (which represent
functional groups in the tundra), and all possible combinations of the species
from two growth forms, and effects on ecosystem C and N cycling will be
measured. Simulation models will be developed to compare the effects of growth
of individual plant species on ecosystem-level resource supply and cycling with
those of functional groups constructed by averaging the characteristics of the
different species in the growth form. Plant growth for each of the major species
and competitive interactions during growth will be modeled. Model predictions of
the distribution and net productivity of species or functional groups, ecosystem
net primary productivity, and nutrient cycling under current climatic conditions
will be compared. Effects of removing or introducing species or functional
groups from the models, and of perturbations caused by herbivory or variable
climate will also be examined, and will be compared with experimental results of
removing species and growth forms. This research is novel because it is the
first experimental test of the effects of species and growth form diversity on
ecosystem processes in the tundra, and it is the first attempt to model the
impact of plant species and their competitive interactions on ecosystem
processes in arctic tundra. This is critical to understanding the role of
species and functional group diversity in ecosystem processes.
