This Research Initiation Award will permit Dr. Healey to study the physics of
color image formation and the use of physical models in segmenting and analyzing
color imagery. Highlight grouping and clustering of normalized colors will be
used in new algorithms for color edge detection, segmentation, and material
identification. Image sensors will also be modeled, and high- speed
implementations will be studied. This work may be particularly important in
industrial inspection tasks, where color information can compensate for
uncalibrated illumination changes and poor or varying sensor optics.
