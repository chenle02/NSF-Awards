In multiple regions of the world numerous pre-Columbian state systems formed and
collapsed resulting in periods of widespread socio-political upheaval. A major
archaeological question is how local communities experienced and adapted to the
rise and fall of regional state systems through the renegotiation of power,
territory, and group identity. In this doctoral dissertation proposal
researchers investigate this topic through a bioarchaeological study of one set
of regional mortuary assemblages. These date between the fall of one regional
empire and the rise of another. The study investigates the strategies and
mechanisms the society used to either consolidate power and integrate
communities during times of state expansion, or develop smaller-scale local and
regional systems, and renegotiate territory and group identity during periods of
state decline. The archaeological work is also significant to the contemporary
regional population who retain strong cultural connections to the prehistoric
group and claim them as local ancestors. The research thus contributes to
community efforts to promote, protect, and preserve cultural patrimony.

Through combined genetic, isotopic, and osteological analyses the researchers
reconstruct aspects of kinship, community composition, migration, and group
identity to understand the nature of the community and how it was impacted by
the later rise of the Inca empire. Bioarchaeological analyses provide fine-
grained perspectives on community and social group composition, and the lived
experiences of past individuals. Strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (áºŸ18O) isotope
analyses document past migration to determine how population movements
contributed to the formation of the society, and whether later Inca influence
involved extensive population relocation. Ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses
reconstruct the nature of biological relatedness within and between local
communities to determine the extent to which communities were interconnected via
kinship. Genetic analysis also reveal whether first generation migrants
associated with Inca imperial expansion were having children with local
individuals, which would provide evidence of interwoven kinship networks.
Finally, observations of cranial vault modification are integrated with the
isotopic and genetic data to determine how this visible trait was used to
communicate and display aspects of social status, kinship, or identity in the
region. By integrating multiple lines of complementary evidence for how
communities formed, interacted, and defined themselves, the research
reconstructs how past communities and individuals experienced the effects of
socio-political change.
