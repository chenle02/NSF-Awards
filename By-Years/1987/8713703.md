The availability of supercomputer resources through National Science Foundation
Supercomputer Centers has opened new vistas for researchers in three-dimensional
continuum structure problems, joined-rock calculations, and calculations
relevant to tribology and surface wear. The important computations which are of
current interest are all three-dimensional, and without access to supercomputers
such calculations are not feasible. At this time, the group of researchers at
the Technological Institute of the Northwestern University needs to upgrade
their local communications link to the NSF Supercomputer Centers. This grant
provides partial support for that purpose.
