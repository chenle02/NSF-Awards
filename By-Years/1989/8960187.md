It is proposed to develop a fiber optic probe for lithium ion based on new
fluorescent lithium ion carriers immobilized on fiber optic bundles by Langmuir-
Blodgett film techniques. In Phase I the new fluorescent ionophore will be
synthesized and tested for Li/Na specificity. Optical properties will also be
investigated to determine suitability for use in a fiber optic probe. Following,
some additional analog of the flourophores prepared in Phase I will be
synthesized. Those having the best specificities and optical properties for
lithium will be used to prepare fiber optic probes. The probes will be used to
develop a method for determination of Li+ ion in the blood serum of patients
being treated with lithium for manic/depressive psychosis. Immediate application
of the lithium ion sensor is in an inexpensive instrument for determination of
Li+ in the blood of manic/depressive patients using Li therapy. The use of L-B
films as a means of immobilizing specific fluorescent chelator will have much
broader application in the preparation of ion sensors for other metal ions.
