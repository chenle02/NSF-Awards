This research project will study human-machine interaction such as haptic and
medical sensing devices to customize and embed sensors (e.g. force) to
accommodate wearer-specifications. Many mechatronic devices that interact with
the human body require wearer-specific geometry to function adequately. Examples
include instrumented /sensorized orthotic, haptic and medical devices and safety
and computer interface equipment. The project will yield a novel sensor design
and such methodology. Fabrication of the sensor will be achieved with Layered
Manufacturing (LM) processes capable of creating multiple different materials
within the same part to combine flexible and rigid structures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable the development of low cost,
sensorized smart interfaces with increased comfort that can facilitate the
routine use of these devices at home for medical, computer and other daily
activities requiring monitoring capability. In addition, this project will
initiate undergraduate students (including students from under-represented
groups) to research in mechatronics applied to rehabilitation. Collaborative
projects on mechatronics with the science and technology high schools of
Massachusetts will be established.
