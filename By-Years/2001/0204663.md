The principal investigator proposes to analyze the critical behavior of lattice
models in classical equilibrium statistical mechanics by using renormalization
group methods based on Osiris wavelets. Various types of wavelets have been
successfully applied to problems in signal analysis and image reconstruction.
Since critical phenomena in statistical mechanics are intimately related to
scaling, one expects wavelet analysis to be very useful in the study of
statistical-mechanical models as well. Osiris wavelets appear to be particularly
well-suited for this purpose. One of the goals is to obtain cleaner hierarchical
models by which renormalization group calculations of critical exponents can be
determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lattice models in classical equilibrium
statistical mechanics are designed for the study of condensed matter physics,
which deals with the critical behavior of solid materials with respect to
changes in pressure, temperature, magnetic field intensity, etc. For example,
the low temperatures at which supercomputers need to be maintained is a
consequence of the fact that certain materials become super-conducters below a
critical temperature. Other examples of critical behavior would include the
agnetization of a bar of iron, which can be induced at room temperature, but not
above a certain temperature. There are countless examples in nature. Wavelets
are mathematical functions that are especially effective in recovering
structures from compressed data. As such, they should be suited to the
multiscale resolution of of these types of problems. This project aims to
exploit the properties of a special class of wavelets, Osiris wavelets, to
obtain better models in statistical mechanics.
