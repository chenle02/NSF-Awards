The purpose of this project is to contribute to the understanding of the
processes that control community structure, productivity and abundance of
planktonic organisms in lakes. It will maintain the continuity of a long-term
study of Lake Washington that was started in 1949 and has been continuous since
1961. The response of the lake to an earlier episode of pollution with secondary
sewage effluent and its recovery after diversion showed that the lake could
respond promptly to changes in input of nutrients. The goal now is to measure
the way the biological and chemical conditions of lake change in response to
natural variations in external factors such as weather and hydrology, and to
various kinds of human activity. The major changes are expected to be in land
development and management of fisheries. The result will provide a useful base
for evaluating the effect of foreseen future changes. Changes in biological and
chemical conditions in 1988 suggest that the lake is currently being affected by
changes in land use. A study of the new conditions and an attempt to identify
the specific causes and processes of change should be rewarding for both
scientific and practical purposes.
