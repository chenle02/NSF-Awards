9317901 Harwood This award supports a study of fossiliferous glacial erratics
from the McMurdo Sound region. This work will help to establish the record of
Eocene, and possibly Cretaceous, marine and terrestrial biota on the margin of
the Victoria Land basin. The Eocene is poorly known from Antarctica, represented
only by outcrops in the Antarctic Peninsula and by glacial sediments recovered
near Prydz Bay. Fossils known to be present in the erratics include leaves,
wood, organic mats, and marine invertebrates. The goal is to study the included
fossils to determine paleontological ages of the sedimentary rocks and to find
clues to the paleoenvironmental conditions. Specifically, documentation of the
fauna and flora in these erratics will allow better understanding of marine and
terrestrial biological and ecological systems during the early Cenozoic and will
provide a basis for comparison of the Ross Ice Shelf region with lower latitude
sites in the Southern Ocean. This work will also help form a framework for
interpretation of early Cenozoic paleoenvironments in drill core from the Cape
Roberts region that is anticipated in the near future. ***
