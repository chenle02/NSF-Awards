The Principal Investigators will conduct high-resolution seismic imaging of the
San Andreas Fault zone by analyzing data from a removable, multilevel and multi-
sensor, 3-component seismic array in the borehole of the SAFOD Pilot Hole.
Specifically, they will record the borehole seismometer string during the active
source experiments that are funded through other awards. To these sensors, they
will add two mutually orthogonal surface spreads to perform a high-resolution,
3D, direct reflection imaging of the SAF zone from the surface to the depth of
about 2 km. For sources, they will use a downhole vibrator and surface Vibroseis
from a reflection/refraction line across the borehole site. The high-resolution
seismic experiment will be an inexpensive alternative to a full surface 3D
survey (very expensive!), with the advantages of direct and detailed imaging of
the fault zone. ***
