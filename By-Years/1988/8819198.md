The mechanism of protein translocation across cellular membranes is not well
understood. This proposal will focus on the translocation of proteins across the
two membranes of the chloroplast envelope during the course of protein import
into pea chloroplasts. It is the goal of this proposal to define and
characterize a protease resistant fragment that is trapped when the organelles
are exposed to low temperature or when photophosphorylation is blocked by the
uncoupler nigericin. Three alternatives have been proposed to account for the
formation of a protease resistant import intermediate. These are: A) a two step
process in which the precursor successively crosses first the outer envelope
membrane and then the inner envelope membrane; B) and alternative two step
process in which the precursor spans the intermembrane space while crossing both
the outer and inner envelope membranes; and C) a one step translocation
mechanism at envelope membrane contact sites. We propose to test these
alternative import pathways in an in vitro chloroplast import assay. For this
assay, specific mRNAs encoding the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase precursor (prSS) will be expressed by in vitro transcription from
plasmids. The precursor proteins will be translated in a cell free wheat germ
translation system. By modulating the temperature of import, we will define the
temperatures at which the protease protected fragment accumulates as well as the
permissive temperature range of import. The trapped intermediate will be
analyzed to determine: a) which domain or region of the precursor is protected
from proteolysis; b) in which chloroplast compartment the precursor fragment is
protected; c) if other chloroplast precursors follow a similar import pathway;
and; d) the biochemical basis of import inhibition by low temperature and
nigericin. It is expected that the results of this study will not only serve as
a model system for other protein translocation pathways in the cell, but will
also expand our understanding of chloroplast biogenesis.
