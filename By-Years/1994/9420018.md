ABSTRACT 9420018 Readhead, A.C.S. There are two major scientific foci of this
research program directed by Dr. Anthony Readhead at Cal Tech: The first is the
study of the astrophysics of active galaxies and unified theories of active
galaxies. The second is the study of cosmology, particularly measurements of the
Hubble constant and the deceleration parameter. The successful execution of
these programs will depend upon skillful exploitation of the Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA). Much of the research program depends upon software developed by
this group with close attention to the scientific drivers. ***
