This research will focus on the spectroscopic characterization of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their interactions with proteins. Peroxidases
have been recently studied as plausible candidates for the biodegradation of
polycyclic aromatic compounds and other highly dangerous dioxin pollutants. This
study will include a complete determination of the optical properties of the
heme prosthetic group upon adduct formation, and an assessment of the kinetic
and thermodynamic manifestation in relation to the proposed oxidizing mechanism
of PAH pollutants by peroxidases. Haloperoxidases, lactoperoxidases and
myeloperoxidases will be prepared and characterized and their interaction with
aromatic compounds such as 2,4,6-trochlorophenol will be studied to clarify the
general mechanisms of action of peroxidases with PAH compounds. The interaction
of PAH compounds with DNA and the role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the
biodegradation of hazardous materials will also be studied.
