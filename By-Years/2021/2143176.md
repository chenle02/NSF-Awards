Algorithms increasingly influence the decisions people make in their everyday
lives, from what clothing to buy to what movie to watch to what healthcare plan
to adopt. There is a pressing need to understand how algorithms interact with
human behavior in these settings. This project will develop theoretical
foundations and applications for new machine learning algorithms that learn and
predict human decisions descriptively from data, as they are, rather than as
behavioral theories prescribe them to be. These new algorithms build on recent
interpretations of choices as driven predominantly by pairwise interactions,
involving new tools from graph theory to modeling human decision making. The
unique practical potential of this project stems from its goal to operationalize
these behavioral theories within a machine learning framework, making it
possible to employ the lessons of behavioral economics to improve the design of
large-scale web systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on a set of key
breakthroughs in the recent literature on machine learning for human decision
making that model irrationality through interferences between alternatives in
choice sets. The project aims to understand the theoretical limits of these
interference-based approaches to modeling human choices, as well as to apply the
methods to complex choice problems including ranking problems. The project also
aims to adapt these new modeling tools to construct defensive tools capable of
protecting people from malicious platform designs, measuring "irrationality" and
developing a testing framework for identifying platform designs conducive to
"more rational" decisions. The new tools for machine learning algorithms for
modeling irrationality rely heavily on graph-theoretic pairwise analysis, and
the project will therefore also build bridges between the literature on decision
theory and the literature for the modeling and measurement of social networks,
the birthplace of many of these graph-theoretic
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
