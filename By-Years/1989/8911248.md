Dr. Lillian Hoddeson and Dr. Catherine Westfall are undertaking a pilot study to
explore the workings of "big science" in American physics through a critical
historical examination of the last 25 years of Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory (Fermilab), the base of the world's highest energy particle
accelerator. Their ultimate hope is to examine the effects of institutions like
Fermilab on scientific research of increased size, scope, and cost of facilities
and experiments; the changes in experimental research resulting from large
working teams and long time-scales; the influence of politics and government
control, "user" orientation of facilities, geographical concentration and
computerization. Under this pilot study, they will produce an initial overall
analysis of the major issues in the full-length project and three specific
studies: (1) on the construction and early research program at Fermilab; (2) on
the impact of the SSC; and (3) on the history of the Collider-Detector Facility
(CDF) "experiment." Dr. Hoddeson will focus on technical aspects of the
designing of large accelerators and detectors, including the 400 GeV syncrotron,
the 1000 GeV Tevatron, the CDF detector, and the SSC, as well as the
experimental program after 1980 and the impact on Fermilab and high energy
physics of the SSC. Dr. Westfall will deal more with the political and technical
origins of Fermilab, construction of the 400 GeV machine, the early experimental
program (1971-80) and the establishment of the SSC. This study should greatly
enhance our understanding of the operation and impact of big science in physics
today.
