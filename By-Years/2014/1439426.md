This proposal involves wireless power transmission (WPT) that can be used to
either continuously power up a device or intermittently recharge its battery
without any direct electrical contact between the energy source and that device.
The typical users will be researchers that currently have difficulties in
conducting behavioral research on small freely behaving animal models with
today's technologies. In animal research, long-term biological data acquisition,
stimulation, and drug delivery are necessary, and involve cables connected
between sensors or electrodes attached to or implanted in the animal body and
rack-mounted data acquisition and processing devices, leading to constraints on
animal movements and behavior. The proposed technology allows uninterrupted
animal experiments in enriched experimental arenas with arbitrary shapes and
dimensions.

By providing a large wirelessly-powered and communicated experimental arena,
called the EnerCage system, the proposed innovative solution is expected to
allow researchers to design experiments that are not possible with today's bio-
instruments. The 'EnerCage' system is capable of conforming to experimental
arenas with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, and creating a focused magnetic
field distribution across these arbitrary shaped arenas by utilizing an array of
overlapping hexagonal planar spiral coils, closed-loop control of the received
power, dual-band wireless data communication, and wireless non-line-of-sight
tracking of the animal subjects via an array of magnetic sensors. The EnerCage
system will enable uninterrupted neural interfacing with freely behaving animals
in large experimental arenas.
