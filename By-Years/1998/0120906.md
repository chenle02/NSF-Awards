The objective of this project is to improve the chemical characterization of
polar organic compounds within the lower troposphere. Polar organic compounds
contribute to degradation in air quality and may be associated with the adverse
health impacts of air pollution. The project includes the development of a
relatively new instrument configuration to identify polar organic material by
combining Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry with Atmospheric Pressure
Electrospray Ionization Analysis. Protocols will be developed for extracting
polar organic compounds from fine particulate samples into aqueous solutions and
using high-pressure liquid chromatography for separating complex mixtures
containing polar organic compounds before introducing them into the instrument.
A searchable library of polar organic compounds will be generated using prepared
standards that are analyzed by this technique.
