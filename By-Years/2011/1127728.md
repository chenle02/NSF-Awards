Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Cornell University, and commercial
partners ITT-Geospatial Systems, Lockheed-Martin, and Pictometry International
propose to establish the Consortium for 3D Innovation (C3I), an effort dedicated
to translating innovative 3D research and development to the commercial sector.
The consortium will (i) leverage 3D algorithm research by RIT and Cornell
through a non-exclusive, royalty free intellectual property (IP) agreement, (ii)
combine technical expertise at RIT and Cornell with business/marketing know-how
from commercial partners, facilitated through the Saunders College of Business
at RIT, and (iii) educate the next generation 3D innovators in the form of
imaging science, computer science, and business students that are affiliated
with C3I. The intellectual merits of the effort are underscored by the market
need for 3D spatial products, the readiness of existing R&amp;D to transition to
market, and lack of a vehicle to accomplish technology
transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society, students and faculty will benefit
broadly from the proposed plan of activities. The project flow follows the model
of RIT's NSF funded Science Masters Program in Decision Support Technologies for
Environmental Forecasting and Disaster Response which requires students to
understand fundamentals of business, markets, and entrepreneurism in
participation with the Business School. Dissemination of the results of the work
will be in keeping with the regular publication of non-proprietary academic
achievements and through the commercialization of image analysis and rendering
products. The benefits to society will come through the adoption of these
products, aided by the creation of a significant number of skilled workers in
the field.
