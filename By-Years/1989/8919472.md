Research in Circuits and Signal Processing since l960's has contributed to
developments in many areas such as filter (analog and digital) design,
processing of signals (one- and multi-dimensional), VLSI architectures for
signal processing and computer aided analysis and design tools for integrated
circuits. The field is now at cross-roads with many researchers looking at
various problems, some new ones and some that have been around for a long time.
This one-of-a-kind workshop is being held to identify problems/topics that are
relatively new and or worth investigating and topics that are mature and or may
not lead to significant breakthroughs.
