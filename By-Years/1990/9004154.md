Request to continue my research in the experimental, field, and theoretical
investigations of magmatic-hydrothermal processes. The center research on the
elemental Cu, Mo, W with some extensions to Zn, Nb, Ta rather than examine a
wide range of elements in a superficial manner. 1) examining this restricted
suite of elements in depth will make it possible to model the processes of
interest more completely; 2) some subset of these elements is present in
anomalous concentrations in most magmatic- hydrothermal mineral deposits; and 3)
early data (Tacker and Candela, 1987; Candela 1989b; Candela and Bouton, 1990
and appendix) have proven fruitful in answering fundamental questions in ore
genesis
