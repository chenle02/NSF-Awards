This Small Grant for Exploratory Research, in part motivated by events of
September 11, 2001, will undertake preliminary background study of the building
code enforcement process when challenged by the need to rebuild rapidly in the
face of natural or man-made disaster. The goal is to prepare for further
research on improving the quality and efficiency of code enforcement services in
emergency situations by gathering data and documenting system flows. The
researchers will also identify opportunities to streamline the permitting and
code enforcement processes while continuing to protect the interests of the
community. A minimum of two municipalities will be used as case studies in
accomplishing the analysis.
