The International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC) is an
interdisciplinary conference devoted to the dissemination of new, unpublished
research relating to the neuroscientific, psychological, and computational bases
of music perception and cognition. Founded in 1989, ICMPC is an international
collective made up of research societies from different parts of the world,
including the Society for Music Perception and Cognition in North America, the
European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music, and the Asia-Pacific
Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.

This award will provide support for a number of graduate students to attend the
International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC), to be held
July 5-9, 2016 at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Awardees
will be enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a U.S. institution and will present their
work at the ICMPC. Awardees will be selected to enrich the diversity of the
conference in terms of geographical, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds and gender
balance. ICMPC will host a lunch for all award recipients to meet and network
with the keynote speakers and other award recipients.
