9523010 Kovacevic Abrasives in suspension in a waterjet are used for cutting,
hole making and duburring of titanium, ceramics, or other hard or difficult to
machine materials. These are one or two dimensional applications of this
process, but there are opportunities for three dimensional processing as well.
Before a 3D process can be developed, a fundamental process model including the
kinematics of the multiphase jet, the fluid-solid interaction at impact, and the
fracture mechanics of the workpiece material is needed. Before material is
removed from the workpiece by fracture, the kinetic energies of many abrasives
impact the surface. As a result, a key part of this modeling work will be
tracking the erosion history of the water jet on a section of the workpiece
surface using a computational memory cell. This process model will be able to
predict the amount of material removed by many abrasives in the jet, and the
geometry of the surface produced by the jet. Like the cutter in conventional
machining, the kinematics of the waterjet is guided by a controller. Experiments
to verify the process model, the coupling between the depth and particle
velocity, and surfaces generated are part of the research. To demonstrate 3D
abrasive waterjet machining as a process, it will be used to produce a sphere.
The impact of this research could be extremely high when fabricating complex
shapes in high strength, high performance materials. ***
