Cytokinins are thought to play a central role in controlling plant growth and
development. They are essential for cell division and organogenesis in tissue
culture, they can influence chloroplast development, delay senescence in
detached tissues, and cause outgrowth of lateral buds. Despite these impressive
effects, little is known about how cytokinins act. The long-term research goal
is to understand how the cytokinin signal is perceived and transduced in the
plant. Two approaches will be used: (1) Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin-
insensitive mutants will be identified. Because many interesting mutations might
be lethal, screening will be conducted so that lethal recessive mutations can be
retrieved as heterozygotes. Obtaining such mutants will enable future cloning of
a gene involved in the cytokinin-response pathway. (2) Regulation of gene
expression by cytokinins will be analyzed. One of the most dramatic and
accessible effects of cytokinins is their ability to overcome apical dominance
and cause outgrowth of lateral buds. Genes whose expression is induced within 6
hours of cytokinin treatment of tomato lateral buds will be cloned. Whether
cytokinins control gene transcription or post-transcriptional processes will be
determined. These experiments will produce the tools necessary for identifying
cellular factors that control gene expression in response to cytokinins.
