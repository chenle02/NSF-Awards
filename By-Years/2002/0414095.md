This award provides funding to support student and postdoc travel to participate
in the 2004 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Conference. The conference is being
held during the week of June 13, 2004, and will sponsor a broad program that
touches upon a number of research activities of interest to investigators and
students in physics, chemistry, and engineering. Some of these include high
harmonic generation, attosecond physics, coherent control, and high-field laser-
matter interactions. Students will participate through presentation of posters
and through formal and informal interactions with leading scientists in the
various fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
