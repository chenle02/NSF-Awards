Integrals play an important role in a wide variety of practical statistical
calculations. They give means, covariances, and various kinds of conditional and
unconditional probabilities. Many of these integrals are defined over regions in
multiple dimensions, and they do not have values that can be obtained from
formulas or tables. Integrals of this type must be estimated numerically, often
using computationally intensive algorithms. More efficient methods will be
developed in this research for the numerical computation of multiple integrals
that arise in statistical computations. Attention will be focused on the use of
subregion adaptive algorithms and better algorithms of this type will be
developed through the use of specialized transformation techniques and better
basic integrations rules that take account of the particular features of
statistical integration problems. The algorithms will be implemented in public
domain software which will be made available over electronic mail networks and
interfaced to the S system for statistical computation on scientific
workstations.
