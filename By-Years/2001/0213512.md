A long-term problem in bioinformatics is the need to access, analyze, and
publish information. Since both central and distributed solutions have been
tried, the problem is now how to integrate the information across different
platforms. This proposal will provide a general architecture for achieving the
integration, using a combined client/server, peer-to-peer implementation of the
web service broker model. This centralizes information about where data and
services are located while allowing distributed data acquisition and service
invocation. A core of model organism database developers already supports the
architecture. The project will deliver a graphical implementation and annotation
source as well as an application programming interface and proof of principle
for four model organisms. This integration of data can change the way research
and education occur using the Internet and the distributed expertise of the
community.
