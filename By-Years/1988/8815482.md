This is a Career Advancement award under NSF's Research Opportunities for
Women. The objective of the research is to study the role of induced oxidation
prior to biodegradation treatment of toxic chemicals. Three prominent model
toxins have been chosen for study due to their prevalence, differences in
composition, and expected response. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation is studied by
adding peroxidase enzyme and hydrogen peroxide chemical. Microbes from toxic
waste sites specific for each model compound is selected for the microbial
degradation process. Biodegradation rates for each model compound with and
without the forms of hydrogen peroxide is determined. The acceleration of
biodegradation due to pre-oxidation is determined by the difference in these
rates.
