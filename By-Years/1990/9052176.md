This project further improves undergraduate laboratory instruction for students
in food science programs through the purchase of a microcomputer-controlled,
high speed, refrigerated centrifuge and accessories which allow the program to
take full advantage of their analytical instrumentation. In the Biochemistry
course, new experiments focus on molecular biology; these include DNA isolation
and characterization, plasmid isolation and restriction endonuclease mapping,
and enzyme purification and kinetics. In food chemistry, experiments done with
the high speed centrifuge involve the isolation of proteins from treated food
samples for amino acid analysis, and purification and characterization of the
enzymes responsible for the browning of fruits and vegetables. In addition, the
instrument is available for student research in all areas of chemistry. The
university is contributing an amount equal to the award.
