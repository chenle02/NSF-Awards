This work involves investigation of the social behavior of the acorn woodpecker
(Melanerpes formicivorus), a cooperatively breeding species, using a completely
color-banded population intensively monitored since 1971. Based on behavioral
observations, groups of this species appear to consist of multiple reproductive
males and females along with apparently nonbreeding offspring from prior years.
However, complete understanding of the behavior of this species has been
compromised by previous inability to precisely determine parentage within
groups. This study will initiate efforts to address this problem using new
molecular techniques that are able to resolve uncertainties of parentage.
Determination of parentage will contribute substantially to the understanding of
social behavior by clarifying the conflicting roles of competition and
cooperation within the highly complex acorn woodpecker society. Such knowledge
has potential applications to all fields involving the study of sociality
including anthropology, sociology, and behavioral ecology.
