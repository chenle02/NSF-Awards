Improvement Research: Exposure of Riparian Trees to Coal Emissions: Does It
Produce Geographic Variation in Water Use Efficiency? The proposed research will
elucidate the effects of coal combustion on the photosynthesis and transpiration
activities of the narrow leaf willow. Both laboratory and field experiments will
be used to investigate the effects of coal combustion on plant productivity.
Most physiological studies have exposed young crop species to unrealistically
high concentrations of single atmospheric gases. It is unclear whether these
studies contribute to understanding the responses of natural vegetation to more
complex atmospheric pollutants under field conditions. This study will address
this shortcoming by providing a more realistic understanding of the roles of two
important component emissions on the gas exchange properties of the willow. The
study will also provide a modern test of past biotic responses to changes in the
concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The work is intended to fill a gap
in knowledge between studies at a micro-scale and air pollution modeling at a
macro-scale.
