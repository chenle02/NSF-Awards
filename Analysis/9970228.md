DMS-9970228 ABSTRACT

The research will attempt to establish the folowing three conjectures. (a) That
the fundamental tone of a vibrating clamped plate under lateral tension is
minimal for the circular plate, given fixed area. Mathematically, this involves
minimizing the first eigenvalue of the biLaplacian amongst plane domains of
given area, with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions imposed.
Symmetrization methods will be employed. (b) That steady states of "thin fluid
film" type partial differential equations can be linearly stable in certain
situations, but in other situations can be unstable and tend to film pinch-off
or blow-up. Trial function and differential inequality techniques will be used
to prove the in/stability results. (c) That the first moment of an equilibrium
unit charge distribution in the plane, about its electrostatic centroid, is
maximal for a line segment. A "double *-function" will be developed to attack
this problem. The methods to be applied to these problems are mathematical,
though each problem has physical meaning.

Problems of vibration, fluids and charges have been studied for hundreds of
years. Today they remain challenging and important, as scientists grapple with
new and old materials on extreme scales and under extreme conditions. The
history of 20th century science shows, though, that progress on practical
problems often depends on the methods and insights developed in basic research.
The problems addressed in this proposal have been chosen for their potential to
provide such insights. For example, the conjectured answers to problems (a) and
(c) are "obvious" - the puzzle (and challenge) is that no-one can explain
logically why these answers are correct. Finding such a logical explanation is
sure to profitably enhance our understanding of and capabilities with problems
of vibration and charge distribution. More specifically, the first problem in
the proposal deals with choosing the shape of a thin vibrating rigid plate so as
to minimize the lowest resonant frequency. Experiments performed over 100 years
ago suggest the circular plate is the one with lowest frequency, but there is
still no theoretical explanation for this. The next problem concerns the
equations that model thin lubricating films of viscous oils. These equations are
nonlinear, meaning familiar superposition principles (adding two solutions to
get another solution) do not apply. Nonlinear problems are at the forefront of
mathematical analysis, and this research aims to understand how it is that
nonlinear effects create stability, instability and pinch-off in thin fluid film
equations. The third problem considered in the proposal is a simply-stated but
still-unsolved problem arising from the theory of electrostatics, to do with how
electrons arrange themselves on a conductor under their mutual repulsion.
