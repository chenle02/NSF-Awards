9361031 Woodworth In this research project, a digital open loop servo-valve
actuator is developed. The major advantages of such valve actuator over
conventional systems include lower cost, higher performance, greater reliability
and repeatability, higher electrical and hydraulic efficiency, regenerative
energy capture and insensitivity to fluid contamination clogging. Since the
valves are operated as either fully open or fully closed, the control system
allows the valves to literally break up the fluid flow into small increments.
The high speed of the valve makes small movement control and precision possible.
Potential applications of the system include robotics, automated manufacturing,
aircraft flight controls and power generation. ***
