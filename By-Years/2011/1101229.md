The domain of research of this project is the arithmetic of p-adic automorphic
forms, their Galois representations and L-functions. Classical automorphic forms
for a group G are functions on the adelic points of a reductive group G that
satisfy nice transformation properties. Their arithmetic theory has yielded
significant advances in the past few years:a proof Fermat's Last Theorem and a
proof the Sato-Tate conjecture, to name two. The p-adic notions alluded above is
a build-in concept to study congruences between these classical objects. Urban's
proposal is a continuation on his work related to the construction and the study
of congruences between Eisenstein series and cuspidal automorphic forms of
various weights and levels and their links with p-adic L-functions and certain
arithmetically defined groups called Selmer groups. Urban proposes to continue
to build some of the foundations of the general theory of the p-adic automorphic
forms and p-adic Eisenstein series with an eye one the important applications
that will result. In particular, this theory applied to the case of unitary and
symplectic groups will have important applications to the so-called p-adic
Bloch-Kato conjecture. Here is a list of several topics that this project will
deal with: (1) Dimension of irreducible components of Eigenvarieties (2) Galois
representations for GL(n) and torsion classes for the cohomology of U(n,n), (3)
p-adic deformations of holomorphic and nearly holomorphic automorphic forms, (4)
Construction of p-adic measures attached to L-functions and Eisenstein series,
(5) p-adic Euler system and p-adic L-functions.



This project will enhance our knowledge of the deep relationships between
p-adic automorphic forms, Galois representations, and their p-adic L-functions -
a central focus of number theory - as well as have significant consequences for
our understanding of mathematics in general. Urban intends to write a book on
the general theory of p-adic automorphic representations to report on the many
developments that has known the past decade. Half of the book will be devoted to
the theory for general reductive group. In the second half, he will describe
some applications with examples and propose directions of future research. In
particular, important conjectures of the theory will be described in detail.
This book will be intended mainly to graduate student and researchers. Urban
works jointly with some PhD students and recent post-doctoral mathematicians on
some of his projects by organizing seminar and workshops. He also wants to
enhance the training of these young mathematicians and facilitate interactions
with highly qualified mathematicians he will invite on a regular basis. Such an
activity, his book project and the participation by Urban and his students in
other seminars throughout the country and in international conferences will be
very useful for the dissemination of the advances resulting from this project.
