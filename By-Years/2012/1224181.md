The proposed research focuses on developing a mixed methods approach to research
into the complex social, economic and environmental issues facing the Pribilof
Islands. The student, Lyons, proposes using a place-making approach to
understanding community instead of a more standard development approach. Lyons
is a NSF-funded Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT)
student at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and her research focuses on
integrating ecological and anthropological data into tools that can inform
fisheries and management decisions in the fishery-dependent communities of St.
Paul and St. George in the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. With the use of a social-
ecological system framework (that refers to complex interactions between the
social and ecological environments) in which she highlights the notion of
"place-making (in which a community establishes a coherent sense of place), this
dissertation research attempts to develop techniques that can integrate the
detailed ethnographic data collected by social scientists into management and
policy decision-making.
