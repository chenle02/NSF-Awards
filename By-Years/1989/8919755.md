This research is focused on the effects of nonconscious affective arousal on
the perception of others. It seeks to understand the impact of affective states
that have been induced outside of the perceiver's awareness on the perceiver's
processes of social judgment. The work promises to provide considerable
information on important noncognitive factors that affect cognition. The
research has important implications for both social and cognitive psychology,
and promises to help integrate these two important fields of research, and to
suggest important methodological innovations to be employed by both groups. In
addition, the findings are of interest and importance in their own right. The
results will help to clarify and identify the factors that impinge upon
important social/cognitive processes.
