Statistical Pattern Recognition is an established discipline which is routinely
applied in several areas. There are still unresolved issues which form the
forefront of research. This proposal focus on some of these issues, and will
employ a new class of mathematical models based on spatial point processes. The
primary tool for evaluation will be "bootstrapping" - a new statistical
technique for estimating bias and establishing confidence intervals that
resamples data by computer.
