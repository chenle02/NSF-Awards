This research program addresses the grand challenge of extracting usable energy
from small-scale aquatic systems. This program envisions establishing a
fundamental understanding of the spectrum of energy scavenging modalities in
marine environments towards the development of self-sustained multifunctional
marine microsensors. This project seeks to exploit ambient mechanical vibrations
and coherent fluid flow structures for energy harvesting. Mechanical vibrations
in aquatic environments occur in a vast array of both man-made and natural
structures, as well as in animal swimming. Coherent fluid structures, such as
Karman vortex streets and turbulent eddies, are generally present in aquatic
environments and are due to a variety of mechanisms, including flow separation
from fixed immersed bodies, thermal and pressure gradients, and momentum
transfer from swimming animals. Practicality dictates that harvesters for
underwater applications be lightweight, require small forces and low frequencies
to elicit motion, produce sufficient electrical power to run a set of
microdevices, and operate in wet conditions. Ionic Polymer Metal Composites
(IPMCs) meet all of these requirements and are thus selected for this study.
