The Milagro experiment consists of a huge tank of water. High energy gamma rays
or photons produce bursts of light in the water which are detected. The
energies, rates, and origins of these gamma rays give information on the
formation of galaxies. The experiment will also look for gamma rays associated
with the interactions between a black hole and its surroundings. This proposal
is for funds to operate the detector.
