This research will explore the reactivity and structural chemistry of tervalent
nickel in coordination environments which are thought to mimic those found for
nickel hydrogenase enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the reversible
conversion of of hydrogen--an essential conversion in anaerobic metabolism for
both chemotrophic and phototrophic bacteria. The coordination environment of the
nickel site varies with different organisms. A consensus coordination sphere has
2-4 nitrogen or oxygen donors and 1-3 sulphur or selenium donors around nickel.
Stabilization of nickel in its tervalent oxidation state will be a significant
synthetic challenge due to the propensity of these systems to degrade by
disulfide formation and concomitant metal reduction. A new class of ligands
based on triazacyclononane will be designed and synthesized to circumvent this
problem. The incorporation of other metals in this unique coordination
environment will also be investigated. %%% This award is made as the starter
grant increment of Dr. Daniel Stack's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry in support of his research at Stanford University. The thrust of Dr.
Stack's research is the design, synthesis and characterization of analogs of
nickel hydrogenases.
