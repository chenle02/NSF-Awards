Failure to adapt to prolonged isolation and extreme conditions of polar
environments can have adverse consequences for both the individual and the
organization. Despite decades of research, the identification of social and
psychological characteristics associated with successful adaptation and
performance in these settings remains problematic. Building upon the results of
preliminary work conducted both in Antarctica and in the Canadian High Arctic,
the proposed study will focus on social and psychological characteristics that
predict performance and adaptation in both polar regions. Research will be
conducted at McMurdo Station in Antarctica and four Atmospheric Environmental
Service weather stations in the Canadian High Arctic using a battery of
psychological screening instruments and a standardized debriefing protocol. This
study will add to our understanding of the social and psychological sequellae of
adaptation and adjustment in polar regions contributing to group morale and
well-being, improved safety, and performance in these regions. In addition, the
research will explicate fundamental interrelationships among environmental
stress, coping resources, personality traits, and performance, and provide a
growing data base for comparative and cross-cultural studies of adaptation and
performance in polar environments.
