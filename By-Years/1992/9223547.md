This proposal requests funds to operate the Stony Brook Relativistic Heavy Ion
Group. The group is presently engaged in experiments E814/E877 at the Brookhaven
AGS and in the Phenix experiment at RHIC. The main emphasis for the next three
years is: (a) Analysis of data for Si-Nucleus and Au-Au collisions gathered over
the last year, (b) Upgrade of E877 for Au beams, (c) Analysis of data from E877
including search for effects due to chiral symmetry restoration in the hot,
dense phase formed in Au-Au collisions by studying low transverse momentum
behavior of particle spectra, and (d) R&amp;D for photon and electron detection
within the Phenix experiment.
