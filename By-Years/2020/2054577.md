The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to collect objective data on
both pace and gait/foot strike to give a clear and detailed picture of how a
person actually moves stride-by-stride outside of a laboratory. The initial
market of college, high school and recreational runners represents a near-term
opportunity with high demand and relatively low barriers to entry. Use of this
technology in this market promises to improve runner performance by up to 20%
and reduce running injuries. This overall serviceable available market is $776
million and growing annually at rate of 29%. After proving the technology in
this near-term market, there is potential for the technology to achieve even
greater societal benefit in gait analysis, including, enabling ongoing
monitoring and prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65,
11.5 million of whom fall each year; and providing more accurate, dynamic data
to offload foot pressure in diabetic patients, 1.8 million of whom sustain
diabetic foot ulcers each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a gait analysis device
that combines a novel polymeric pressure sensing technology with an
accelerometer and electronics to collect, process and visualize pace and
gait/foot strike data. This innovative pressure sensing technology utilizes
conductive polymeric materials and hybrid fabrication techniques to produce
sensor arrays that are 100% solid state; as polymers they can be flexible,
robust, and cost effective. Under the Phase I project, a sensor array was
produced based on an optimized material formulation and sensor configuration, a
printed circuit board and software were developed for use with the system, and a
prototype was demonstrated with distance runners to prove it generates
meaningful data. This SBIR Phase II project will complete development of the
prototype and scale up hardware production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
