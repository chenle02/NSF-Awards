An evaluation of the materials that have been prepared for an e-book for use in
teaching control system engineering is being conducted. The evaluation will
examine student learning outcomes and attitudes toward an electronic textbook.
Additionally, representatives from industry are reviewing the materials and
providing an assessment from the industry viewpoint. Faculty at other
institutions who have used portions of the electronic book in their classes are
also engaged in the evaluation efforts.
