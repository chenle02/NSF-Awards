Students majoring in Structural Analysis and Design at the Department of
Engineering Technology of the University of Houston-Downtown will use laboratory
equipment built and modified specifically for soils and structural model
testing, using off-the-shelf electronic components, peripheral to existing
computers. In addition to the structural and soil analysis principles and
practices learned by the students in this laboratory there are data acquisition
and software development aspects that enhance the learning experience of the
students even further.
