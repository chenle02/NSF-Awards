The investigators will establish a Center for Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry
at the University of Arizona, in collaboration with the Universities of New
Mexico, Southern California, and Texas. The center will further the research of
the principal investigators; provide a forum for studying, extending, and
disseminating the latest results in arithmetical algebraic geometry and related
fields; and enhance the education and professional development of graduate
students and recent PhDs in mathematics. Arithmetical algebraic geometry is a
field of fundamental research which has its roots in classical problems of
arithmetic and geometry, both highly abstract (such as expressing integers as
sums of squares) and completely concrete (such as laying out fields for
agriculture). On the other hand it has experienced tremendous advances in the
twentieth century and is still vitally active today, as evidenced by such heroic
advances as Faltings' resolution of the Mordell conjecture and Wiles' proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem. Moreover, it has retained its relevance to contemporary
life through its connections with robot control, computer vision, RSA data
encryption, efficient audio and video compression algorithms, and other aspects
of information technology.
