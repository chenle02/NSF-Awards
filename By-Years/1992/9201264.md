Acoustics plays a crucial role in providing rapid surveys and long- term time
series of distributions of marine organisms. Echo sounders are typically used to
1) map the spatial distribution of volume scatterers, 2) interpolate between
data collected by nets or pumps, and 3) provide data when net or pumps are not
practical for use(such as in logistically dificult regions) and/or cost-
effective. In order that these acoustic methods be quantitative, accurate
scattering models need to be used which relate the echo levels to meaningful
biological parameters such as animal size, spatial, and temporal distributions.
The models that are currently available are not at a sufficiently advanced state
for reliable use.
