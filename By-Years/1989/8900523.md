This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site in the Department of Biology at Tufts University for nine undergraduate
students during the summer of 1989. This program is designed to provide students
with the necessary intellectual and technical skills to carry out independent
research. Through close contact between faculty and students this program will
strive to promote student interest in research careers. The program will
emphasize the experimental basis of our knowledge and will, for many students,
be their first opportunity to experience the mastery of complex material and the
in-depth learning of a specific topic. In addition to the research experience,
students will participate in a weekly seminar series that will introduce them to
a variety to topics that cut across project boundaries, formally introducing
students to topics such as laboratory safety, data analysis and the scientific
literature.
