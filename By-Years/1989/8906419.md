Several problems of a geometric nature are related by the notion of "coherence".
That is, let (P1,P2,...) be a sequence of instances of the same problem with the
property that the input data of instances Pi and Pi+1 differ only slightly.
Exploitation-of-coherence is the algorithmic simplification arising from
computing the solution Pi, rather than solving Pi+1 from scratch. In this
project a systematic study of exploitation-of-coherence is made, trying to
capitalize on existing isolated findings and aiming significant contributions to
important applied areas -- such as robotics and graphics. Both sequential and
parallel methods will be considered.
