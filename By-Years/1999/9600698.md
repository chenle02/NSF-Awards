9600698 Cox This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project is led by Ted Cox of
Syracuse University and Pablo Ferrari of Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
objective is to bring together many of the U.S. and Brazilian leaders in
probability theory, and in particular the theory of interacting particle
systems, to work together in small groups over a three-year period. Rather than
workshops, the collaborations will be achieved through a series of trips by
individuals of both countries: NSF will fund the U.S. scientists, while a
counterpart grant from CNPq in Brazil will fund the Brazilian scientists. The
main theme of investigation will be systems with many interacting components
that evolve with time, including problems in biological and spin models, spatial
point processes, metastability and quasi-stationary distributions, and
hydrodynamic behavior of particle systems. The interactions promoted through
this project will stimulate new directions in an important and active research
field. They will also promote new links in the international community and
provide opportunities for graduate students at the institutions involved. ***
