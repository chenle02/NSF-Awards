The use of transition metals in organic synthesis forms the rationale and
unifying concept for this project. The foci of this research are threefold.
First, the regioselective reactions of pi-allyl Pd complexes will be studied;
second, the template-enhanced asymmetric synthesis of the natural product
ophiobolin-C will be carried out and third, the asymmetric synthesis of
magellanine will be accomplished using Pauson-Khand cycloaddition methodology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this proposal, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Marie E. Krafft of
the Department of Chemistry at Florida State University. Professor Krafft will
focus her work on developing new organometallic reactions which can be used to
carry out selective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and to apply the
methodology towards the synthesis of natural properties having interesting
biological properties. The work has broader impact on the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries and the project provides an excellent training ground
for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral collaborators.
