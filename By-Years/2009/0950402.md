Intellectual Merit: Almost all living cells in the human body contain whip-like
appendages called primary cilia. These structures serve as cellular antennas
that sense the external environment, detect signals, and transmit this
information to the cell nucleus, which then responds appropriately according to
the signals it receives. This project uses the single celled green alga
Chlamydomonas as the model system to study how cilia are assembled and function.
The two flagella of Chlamydomonas are analogous in almost all respects to
primary cilia in humans. Cells assemble and disassemble their cilia (and
flagella) during each round of cell division. Cells that are unable to
disassemble their cilia cannot divide properly, and cells that cannot construct
cilia cannot sense the environment properly. This project is directed at
understanding the factors that are important in controlling the process of
ciliary disassembly that occurs prior to each cell division.

Broader Impact: This project will provide several educational opportunities for
students at different levels: (a) Undergraduate students will become involved in
original research, an activity that is consistent with data showing that
undergraduate research experiences increase learning and foster deeper
commitment by the participants. In addition to deriving strong growth and
development benefits, students gain a much greater understanding of the career
options open to them. (b) A graduate student will participate as part of his/her
thesis research leading to the Ph. D. (c) Advanced high school biology students
from Hartford (VT) High School will visit the lab and be exposed to these
experiments and the microscopic techniques used to observe cells with cilia.
Through collaboration with Dartmouth's Office of Outreach, this project will be
described to the local communities through a series of informal events called
"science cafes". To achieve broad dissemination of relevant findings from this
project Dartmouth's Office of Public Affairs will communicate new findings and
significant publications to the news media as appropriate.
