Tight contact structures are closely related to the topology of the underlying
3-manifold. They provide bounds on the genus of the surface representing a
homology class, are related to taut foliations on 3-manifolds and to the
topology of symplectic 4-manifolds, to Seiberg-Witten theory and Floer homology.
Matic proposes to further analyze contact manifolds using cut-and-paste
techniques developed in collaboration with Honda and Kazez. The main part of
cut-and-paste contact topology are gluing theorems. Matic proposes to keep
studying the gluing techniques and to apply them to various open questions, like
the existence of tight contact structures on Haken homology spheres. Here the
techniques from foliation theory fall short. There are in fact recent examples
of Haken homology spheres that do not carry taut foliations. As a result of her
investigations she hopes to be able to better understand a basic question: what
information about the topology of the 3-manifold can we get from existence of a
tight contact structure. Three-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the three
dimensional space we live in. Questions in symplectic and contact geometry were
originally motivated by dynamical questions in physics and contact structures
arise naturally in hydrodynamics. The proposed research has the potential to
produce new results applicable to these questions.
