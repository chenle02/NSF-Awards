9306237 Orians This workshop will address the consequences of diversity or
species loss for ecosystem processes, such as primary and secondary
productivity, soil formation, nutrient cycling, and resistance to or recovery
following disturbance, in tropical forests. Participants will explore ways in
which these processes depend on species richness in general or on the presence
of particular species. Those processes that appear to be most sensitive to
species loss will be identified as priorities for future study. %%% Current
assessment of consequences of global change has focused on species loss. Much
less attention has been directed to consideration of the consequences of species
loss for key ecosystem processes that affect regional climate, soil fertility
and ecosystem stability. Increased understanding of the ecosystem function of
biodiversity will improve assessment of the consequences of global change and
loss of species from tropical forest ecosystems. *** u ~ le on request from
