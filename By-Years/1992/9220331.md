This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
The research training group focuses its research theme on the mechanisms of
signal transduction in plants. The group will use Arabidopsis thaliana as an
experimental model system. Students and postdocs in this group will obtain in-
depth training in five diverse disciplines: electrophysiology, genetics,
biochemistry, cell biology and structural biology. Twelve faculty members will
participate in collaborative research with a common objective of filling the
large gap in our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that underlie hormone
action and other signal transduction phenomena in higher plants. The training
plan is designed to allow a more integrated approach towards preparing students
for career in research in plant biology. Undergraduate participation is also a
part of the project.
