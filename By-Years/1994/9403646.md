9403646 Akyildiz Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative
research effort between the Georgia Institute of Technology and Bilkent
University in Ankara, Turkey. The investigators are electrical engineers who
propose to solve the problems involved in end-to-end modeling and analysis for
admission control in ATM networks. The project will advance the technology so
that an appropriate admission control algorithm can be designed based on model
predictions. The investigators (Drs. Ian Akyildiz from the Georgia Institute of
Technology and Erdal Arikan from Bilkent University) will study the efficacy of
the call admission algorithms while utilizing results from the end-to-end
models. They intend to exploit the special control features that can be provided
by an ATM network. Using these control features, they can allow a higher layer
application to adapt to the state of the network. Project funding will enable
Dr. Akyildiz to work jointly with Dr. Arikan in the laboratory facilities at
Bilkent University for two months per year over the course of this three-year
study. This project in computer science and engineering fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and conduct research
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
