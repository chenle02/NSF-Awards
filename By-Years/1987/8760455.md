Monitoring the internal environment of biochemical reaction vessels is crucial
to optimizing the performance of existing bioreactors, and to aiding in the
design and evaluation of future bioreactors. This proposal seeks to non-
invasively monitor fluid flow and oxygen distribution in hollow fiber and flat
cell bioreactors by nuclear magnetic resource (NMR) imaging techniques.
Successful completion of this demonstration of principle will provide detailed
knowledge of the ultimate usefulness of the device and together with design
data, will provide needed information for the development of a prototype NMR
imaging system during Phase II.
