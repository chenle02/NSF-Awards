DMS-9500905 PI: Ding Ding will study analytic continuation of operator-valued
Bessel functions on symmetric cones and symmetric Siegel domains; in particular,
operator valued Bessel functions on boundary components of these domains. Using
analytic continuation of Bessel functions, he will study the decomposition of
the harmonic representation of automorphism groups of these domains. The theory
of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has
been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the
representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics
itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
