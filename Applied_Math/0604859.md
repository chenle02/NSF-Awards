The project addresses a number of related questions concerning the spectra of
differential operators acting on spaces of functions defined on metric graphs. A
graph equipped with such an operator is generally referred to as a "quantum
graph." The research has two central themes: investigating the correlations
between the eigenvalues of quantum graphs, and understanding the morphology of
their eigenfunctions. For generic families of graphs the eigenvalues appear to
be correlated like eigenvalues of large random matrices. For non-generic graphs,
different correlations are expected. The present project will improve the
understanding of how these correlations arise both from a mathematical and
physical point of view. The results obtained will be useful in understanding the
appearance of correlations in the eigenvalues of other differential operators
arising in mathematical physics. The second theme of the project is to
understand the statistical properties of eigenfunctions of quantum graphs. For
generic graphs, it is expected that the eigenfunctions should exhibit some
equidistribution properties similar to those already proved to exist in other
systems. A central objective of the project is to formulate an analogous theory
for eigenfunctions of quantum graphs. It is also suspected that a sparse
sequence of eigenfunctions may become localized (scarred) rather than
equidistributed. Another part of the project will be to discover whether this
can, in fact, occur, and the conditions under which it may do so.

Quantum graphs are part of a new branch of mathematics, sometimes called
``nanomathematics'', which contains within its scope areas such as transport in
nanostructures, quantum information, and superconductivity. In this context, our
study of quantum graphs is part of an effort to understand the theory of quantum
mechanics as it relates to classical Newtonian dynamics (so-called "quantum
chaology"). The wave-based theory of quantum mechanics is unavoidable on scales
of the order of magnitude of present microchip manufacturing. The shapes and
frequencies of waves appearing in complex quantum mechanical systems can be
understood by looking at similar questions for oscillations on networks. The
results of the project will be relevant to current research in many diverse
areas of mesoscopic physics and engineering. In order to draw new researchers
into the field, part of the project will be used as topics for an undergraduate
research experience program, and an introductory graduate text will be written.
