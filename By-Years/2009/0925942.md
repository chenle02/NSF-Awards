The objective of this research is to design and prototype mobile wireless
hardware that retains high energy efficiency across a broad performance range.
The approach is to systematically address the inefficiency in multiple layers of
wireless hardware. Wireless hardware is conventionally optimized for delivering
peak performance; the energy efficiency reduces drastically as the achieved
performance decreases. The key methodology is to design scalable hardware and
judiciously scale it according to the bottleneck.

With respect to intellectual merit, this project targets four engineering
contributions. First, the resource demands of wireless traffic are modeled to
design adaptive policies that jointly optimize rate adaption and power
management. Second, wireless detection architectures are developed that can
scale properly based on the data rate and power requirements, and integrate with
the higher levels in the wireless system. Third, configurable decoder
architectures are developed that dynamically adjust the decoder in a fine-grain
manner. Fourth, using the Rice WARP platform, the proposed technologies are
implemented into a complete functional wireless hardware system to evaluate the
solutions under a wide range of wireless applications.

With respect to broader impact, the multidisciplinary collaboration with health
scientists in preventive health care has the potential for contribution to
societal needs. The collected data, the research evaluation platform, and
educational content are to be made open-source and on-line. Ongoing
collaboration with industry leaders, including Texas Instruments and Nokia,
assist the transfer of technologies into future mobile wireless hardware. The
results of this research are incorporated into undergraduate courses in VLSI
design and mobile computing.
