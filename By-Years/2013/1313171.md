To study galaxies during the cosmic era of maximum star formation and
supermassive black hole growth requires observing them at great distances,
corresponding to cosmological redshifts between 1.5 and 3.0. The visible light
emitted by these galaxies carries information about their stellar and gaseous
contents; owing to the redshift, this light is observed at infrared wavelengths.
The new, NSF-funded, Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration
(MOSFIRE) on the Keck I telescope represents a major development for the study
of these galaxies, offering increases in sensitivity and survey efficiency by
factors of approximately 5 and 100, respectively. This project, the MOSFIRE Deep
Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey, will chart the evolution of the rest-frame
optical spectra for approximately 2000 galaxies between 1.5 and 3.5, more than
an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The project will make
use of 44 nights allocated on the Keck I telescope through 2016, and will survey
three well-studied regions of the sky already having extensive multi-wavelength
datasets. By combining new and existing data, the proposing team will
characterize the star formation and accreting black hole activity in distant
galaxies, their masses, contents and structures, and the manner in which
baryonic matter passes through them. In collaboration with theorists, the MOSDEF
team will use these results to test and inform forefront models of galaxy
evolution. The MOSDEF spectra will be publicly released to the astronomical
community to enable additional investigations. Graduate and undergraduate
students will be supported by the project and involved in the research, and team
members will develop pedagogical resources for K-12 teachers on the key aspects
of the science and techniques.
