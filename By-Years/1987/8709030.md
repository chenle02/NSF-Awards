This proposal is to conduct a workshop to identify the top priority topics for
innovative research relative to the technology of the system of manufacturing
which should be pursued under a proposed Strategic Manufacturing Research
Initiative. This workshop was recommended by a previous workshop held in 1986 to
explore the appropriateness of this new initiative. Eighty to one-hundred
participants are to be invited, representing industry, academia, and government.
This workshop will attempt to reach a consensus as to the top six priority
research subjects, ranked in order of priority. These research subjects will be
the focus of the proposed initiative whose goal is to move top priority
manufacturing technology frontiers ahead in large jumps through major
innovations. This proposed "Strategic Manufacturing Research Initiative" should
lead to improved competitiveness of the USA in manufacturing. The proposed
workshop is expected to provide NSF valuable information to aid in program
planning.
