9529376 Lambrecht Many of the condensed matter systems (and also devices made
from materials) with applications in the mesoscopic region, have a layered
geometry. This proposal consists of a plan to calculate the electronic structure
of these systems using a sophisticated, efficient algorithm. The computational
effort, based on a difference equation in the layer indices, within the
framework of the density functional theory using muffin-tin orbitals, scales
with the number of layers (as opposed to the number of atoms). Following
calculation of the one electron Green function for a mesoscopic system with
atomic level precision, one can derive the self-consistent charge density, total
energy, optical excitation energies and transport properties. The calculations
will be carried out for group-III nitrides, SiC polytypes and rare earth based
semimetal/semiconductor layered structures. %%% The popular man-made materials,
in a variety of applications such as solid state lasers and magnetic memory
devices, have a layered look. There is need for a calculation of their
electronic properties. The novel approach to be used is particularly efficient
and allows an atomic level understanding of the complex processes underlying the
optical and magnetic properties of these systems.
