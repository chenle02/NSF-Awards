This project is concerned with an extension of the theory of Thompson series to
elliptic modules. This is a device which relates representation theory of finite
groups with elliptic modular forms. It has consequences in various areas of
mathematics such as the theory of sporadic simple groups, topology of manifolds,
and elliptic cohomology. In particular, the role of Hecke operators as
operations in elliptic cohomology, and the existence of a conjectured elliptic
module of genus zero for the Monster simple group will be examined. This project
is in the general area of finite group theory. It will examine connections
between group theory and number theory. This work promises to have consequences
for theoretical physics, as well as, mathematics.
