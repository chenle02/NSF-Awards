Research will be conducted to investigate mixed mode fracture mechanisms of a
unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite material using the modified Iosipescu test
technique. Intralaminar fracture mechanisms in the composite will be analyzed
numerically and experimentally. The research will use finite element methods
extensively to study the mixed mode stress intensity factors and the energy
release rates associated with intralaminar cracks in the composite Iosipescu
specimens tested under biaxial stress conditions. In addition, adhesively bonded
composite systems will be tested under mixed mode loading conditions using the
newly designed Iosipescu fixture. Linear and non-linear finite element
calculations of the adhesive joints in the Iosipescu specimens will be
performed. The fundamental significance of this research is that it will
contribute to the understanding of intralaminar fracture mechanisms in carbon
fibre/epoxy composites caused by biaxial stress conditions. Moreover, the study
will provide new insights into the complex failure phenomena of advanced
adhesive joint systems. The practical significance is that after comprehensive
numerical and experimental investigations of the newly designed biaxial test
technique, the test will have great potential to become standard for mixed mode
failure and fracture analysis of many advanced composite systems.
