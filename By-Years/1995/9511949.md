Protecting and preserving our natural life-support systems requires the ability
to understand the direct and indirect effects of human activities over long
periods of time and over large areas. Computer simulations are now becoming
important tools for investigating these interactions. Spatio-temporal modeling
is essential when simulating heterogeneous environments. These models are
necessary for developing the relatively realistic description of past system
behavior that is required for making predictions of the impacts of alternative
management policies on future system behavior (Costanza, Sklar, &amp; White,
1990); Risser, Karr, &amp; Forman, 1984; Sklar &amp; Costanza, 1991). The data
and hardware barriers to building these complex models have begun to erode with
the increasing availability of remote sensing data and GIS systems to manipulate
it, and the development of parallel computer systems. However, significant
advances in modeling tools must take place in order to and in order for non-
computer scientists to take advantage of these new resources. This document
describes a proposal to develop these much-needed spatial modeling tools.
