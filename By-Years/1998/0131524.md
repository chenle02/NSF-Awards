Dr. Graham R. Fleming of the University of California at Berkeley is funded for
his research on optical studies of condensed phase dynamics by a grant in the
Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division. He will develop and apply
new ultrafast laser spectroscopic methods to the dynamics of complex condensed
phase systems. Specifically, he will develop heterodyne-detected, two-
dimensional Raman spectroscopy, and two-color resonant photon echo spectroscopy
for the study of liquid and glass dynamics, and the study of multichromophoric
molecular complexes, respectively. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
students will receive training and education in experimental design,
measurement, and theoretical analysis. Students will be prepared to lead
independent research programs at major research universities, National
Laboratories, and private industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exceedingly short
pulses of laser light with duration of a few thousandths of a trillionth of a
second will be used to follow the motions of molecules during chemical
reactions, and to study the processes involved in the collection and transfer of
solar energy in nanoscale devices designed to mimic and extend the light
harvesting function of the natural photosynthetic system of plants. The long
range goals of this research are to reveal the design principles necessary for
renewable energy sources based on solar energy, to provide new analytical
methods for the study and optimization of chemical processes, and to train the
next generation of U.S. scientists. &lt;br/&gt;
