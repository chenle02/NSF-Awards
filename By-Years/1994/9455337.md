Cellular Biophysics Software The purpose of this project is to make educational
software and methodologies for its use in teaching cellular biophysics widely
available. Software has been used for 10 years to teach cellular biophysics to
juniors majoring in engineering and science at MIT. The software is used in
lecture demonstrations, special recitation classes held in electronic
classrooms, as a basis of homework assignments, and for more intensive research
projects defined by students. Use of the software has greatly enhanced students'
interest in and comprehension of topics in cellular biophysics. All the software
has been developed by student programmers and is currently available only on
UNIX workstations at MIT. The software is written in C and XWindows. In the
current project undergraduates and graduate students are converting this
software to run under a vendor distributed computation and visualization
software package (MAT LAB) which is available on all the common computer
platforms including Macintoshes, PCs running Microsoft Windows, and UNIX
workstations running XWindows. The conversion allows students and instructors to
more readily customize the software for their own use, and greatly facilitates
software maintenance for faculty. A software textbook is being published and
distributed with floppy disks of the software. The software and software
textbook will be companions to a new textbook on cellular biophysics that is in
preparation. The combination should provide a new set of educational materials
for teaching cellular biophysics to students in engineering and science. The
approach is to provide rigorous, in-depth mathematical treatments as well as the
e mpirical basis of important biological, chemical, and physical principles of
cell biophysics. The software together with the software text allows students
and faculty to explore these principles in new ways.
