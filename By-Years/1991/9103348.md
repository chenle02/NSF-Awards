The project will involve the study of problems in "fractal spectral
asymptotics", i.e., the asymptotic behavior of spectral expansions of objects
arising in fractal geometry. This work unites two important areas of
mathematical research: harmonic analysis-spectral theory and fractal geometry.
The principal investigator has found a proto-type fractal Plancherel formula for
Fourier transforms in Euclidean space, he has given a more refined analysis for
self-similar fractals and he has generalized the results to heat equation
expansions on Riemannian manifolds. The proposal research will extend this work
in a number of directions. In particular, the principal investigator will obtain
more precise information on Fourier expansions, and he will generalize his
previous results to stratified nilpotent Lie groups, wavelet expansions and
expansions arising from boundary value problems.
