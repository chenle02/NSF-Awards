Flooding is the leading cause of natural disaster fatalities and property damage
across the United States. Mitigating water risks poses a serious challenge to
water managers, companies, and home owners. This includes risk related to
disaster response, stormwater infrastructure construction, and the management of
water quality. Successful execution of this I-Corps project will result in new
tools to address the challenges faced by the United States in the face of water
disasters. This project will result in 'smart' water tools that address the
management of water risk by investigating new methods based on data, analytics
and sensing. This will reduce the risk associated with making decision in regard
to flood forecasting, planning, and infrastructure construction. The project
will also result in new jobs and workforce training as part of an emerging
'smart' water sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will investigate
the economic value of water information. The project will engage with decision
makers, including water managers, energy producers, and agricultural managers. A
series of interviews will be conducted to improve the understanding of water
challenges and risks faced by these parties. A focus will be placed on the role
of information technologies, such as sensors, autonomous systems, and artificial
intelligence tools. By quantifying water risk and improving the understanding of
uncertainty, the project will provide new insights into the barriers that stand
in the way of technology adoption in the water sector. The outcome of the
project will transform the fundamental understanding of the role of 'smart'
technologies in managing water resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
