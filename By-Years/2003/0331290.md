&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Bates/Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometrical theory
of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems will be developed. Included here are
conditions giving the existence and persistence of invariant manifolds and
foliations. These will be used to describe global qualitative behavior of
trajectories and to establish conditions which guarantee structural stability.
Applications of this theory to topics such as lattice dynamics, cellular neural
networks, nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations and some nonlinear
hyperbolic partial differential equations will be considered. Efficient
computational approaches to simulate some of these will be sought, based upon
the geometrical theory developed.&lt;br/&gt;Since most physical systems are
highly complex, it is usually impossible to solve the equations which are
proposed to describe and predict the relevant physical phenomena. Even if it
were possible to solve one of these equations, the imprecision in measurement
and our imperfect understanding of the actual physical laws may call into
question the meaning of the solutions. This project will develop a theory
whereby, under certain conditions, one can describe the nature of solutions and
guarantee that the physical system behaves according to this description to a
reasonable degree of accuracy. Special attention will be given to equations
describing phenomena in material science, including phase transitions and
superconductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
