Recent failures of highway bridges have drawn attention to the deterioration of
the bridge structure and the inherent possibility of total collapse. As a result
of two recent bridge collapses, fatalities have occurred which have cost the
State Highway Departments considerable sums of monies to replace and compensate
victim related claims. This project will investigate the use of sophisticated
sensing devices and electronic equipment to warn motorists of an imminent or
total collapse.
