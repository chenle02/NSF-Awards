This proposal builds on an ongoing interdisciplinary effort to examine the
interrelationship between enzymatic modification of water-soluble polymers and
the resulting rheological consequences. The expanded scope of this project has
the following objectives: (1) biochemical and biophysical characterization of
promising wild-type and mutated hyperthermophilic galactomannanases and
galactosidases, with respect to polysaccharide modification; (2) investigation
of the mobility and distribution of enzymes within the biopolymer matrix during
enzymatic modification along with the concomitant changes in the aggregation
pattern of the biopolymer-enzyme system; and (3) correlation of enzyme activity
to changes in rheology and galactomannan molecular architecture. Such an effort,
based on the collective expertise of this research team, i.e., polysaccharide
systems, enzymology at elevated temperatures, and the rheology of gels and
solutions, will provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental and
technological issues governing polymer modification resulting from enzyme
action. While the focus here is on galactomannans, the long-term impact of this
work will extend to strategic biocatalytic approaches to enhance the efficacy
and use of other carbohydrate biopolymers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
