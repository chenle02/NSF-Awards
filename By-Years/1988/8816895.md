The purpose of this project is to learn more of the history of the solar nebula
by studying chondritic meteorites. The plan is to analyze chondrites to obtain
compositional data that relate to: 1) the nebular processes that led to the
formation of the chondrites, and 2) the heliocentric distances at which the
different chondrite groups formed. Approximately 30 elements will be determined
by high precision neutron activation analysis. The main current focus is on the
study of unusual ordinary chondrites, particularly those that have compositions
intermediate between those of members of the main (H, L, LL) groups. Phase
analysis will be used to locate more of these and, in collaboration with other
groups, bulk elememntal data and noble-gas isotopic data will be used to assess
whether these originated in the same parent bodies as the main groups. Rare
classes of chondrites will be analyzed, and fractionation trends among relted
chondrites interpreted in terms of nebular fractionation processes.
