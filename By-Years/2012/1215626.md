This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops a method of
lifting-off an epitaxially grown high-efficiency (> 30%) triple-junction III-V
solar cell from a Ge or GaAs wafer onto a polyimide substrate. A high-
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) polyimide wafer is used to induce a crack
that propagates parallel to the surface at the epi/wafer interface, due to the
mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion, as the wafer is cooled
down below room temperature. The lift-off happens in a fraction of a second and
no expensive ion implantation or slow chemical etching of a sacrificial layer is
needed. The epi-layer is attached to a low-cost flexible polyimide substrate
having a thickness between 25 and 100 microns which serves as the permanent
carrier of the solar cell. Inverted and non-inverted cells can be lifted off
using this technique. The base substrate can be reused to grow another epi-layer
and the cycle repeated. For these devices, the cost of substrate materials is
about 40% of the cost of the finished cell. This process will result in savings
of raw materials and grinding and etching costs, up to a total savings of 30% of
the cost of the cell.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to develop a
method to transfer epitaxially-grown device layers from semiconductor wafers to
inexpensive polymeric substrates to create high-performance flexible circuits.
The application of this technology goes beyond photovoltaics (PV). Space-grade
as well as terrestrial high-efficiency PV cells and modules can be made lighter,
flexible, and less expensive when this process is integrated into the
manufacturing sequence of established suppliers. Additionally, when the thinned
cell is transferred to a metallic substrate, the reduced thickness improves
performance of terrestrial concentrating PV systems. Once this method is
demonstrated, we will leverage our relationships with major high-efficiency
solar cell manufacturers to negotiate licensing of the technology for their
applications.
