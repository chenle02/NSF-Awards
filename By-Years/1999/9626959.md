9626959 Hoitomt Wisconsin Public Broadcasting will continue the incorporation
of a science strand into "Get Real!," their television series for children 8-12
year old. The series presents positive images of children involved in, and
succeeding in, a variety of areas. The stories are field-produced; and kids are
involved on-screen and off as hosts, reporters, subjects of stories, as interns
during production, and as sources of story ideas. The series is broadcast on
both public and commercial stations and receives multiple repeats. The science
and technology strand: connects science concepts to children's known experiences
and activities and tells stories about kids involved in science-related
activities; models and reinforces positive attitudes towards, and involvement in
science and technology and affirms the value of children's ideas, and the
importance of asking why?; and reinforces viewers' active connection to the
science content by making suggestions for projects to get involved with, and by
encouraging children to discuss and question their knowledge of science and the
world around them. In this third season of the series, the producers will expand
coverage of the series to five additional states adjoining Wisconsin. They are
convinced they can do this without losing the local interest and participation
of local institutions which has been a great factor in attracting and holding
viewers. James Steinbach, the creator, original producer, and executive producer
of "Newton's Apple," will be the co-PI with overall responsibility for the
project. The series is produced in the three Wisconsin Public Television studios
-- in Madison, Green Bay, and Menomonie -- and, therefore, can find and produce
stories which reach out into a wide geographic area.
