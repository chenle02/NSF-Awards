Until recently, regeneration of severed nerve processes in the central nervous
system (CNS) was not thought to be possible, except in lower animals such as
amphibians and fishes. However, recent studies in this country and abroad have
made it clear that, given the right local environment around the cut nerve, such
regeneration may indeed be possible. This project is designed to investigate
regrowth of axons from neurons in the eye (retinal ganglion cells) which have
been severed as they pass into the brain. Grafts of peripheral nerve will be
placed nearby in an attempt to enhance the regrowth of these axons within the
brain. Anatomical studies will be performed to determine how these axons respond
to the graft in terms of regeneration or the sprouting of new branches from the
intact portion of the axon.
