This project will complete data analyses and prepare a series of publications on
ethics and values in graduate education in four fields: chemistry, civil
engineering, microbiology, and sociology. The project, which is co-sponsored by
the AAAS Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility, the Council of
Graduate Schools, and Sigma Xi, has been underway since 1987. Major research
foci include the nature and transmission of professional values and ethical
standards held by doctoral students and their faculty and the types of ethical
problems and value conflicts that occur in the context of graduate education
programs in the four disciplines. The study's findings and recommendations will
be based on comparative and associational analyses of four sets of project data:
(1) a 1988 national survey of graduate school deans concerning university
policies and ethical issues in research and graduate education, (2) a 1990
national survey of 2,000 doctoral students enrolled in departments/programs in
the four disciplines at major research universities, (3) a 1991 survey of 2,000
graduate school faculty in the departments/programs whose students were surveyed
in 1990, and (4) a set of 78 in-depth interviews, ranging from 60 to 120
minutes, conducted during 1991-1992 with graduate students and faculty in the
four disciplines at eight departments in three major research universities.
