The research aims at technologies for integrating actual position data captured
in real time with 3-D CAD based design data, to support integration of design
and construction processes in respect to positioning of objects at a
construction site. Research on measurement of position will center on a
modulated radio frequency carrier phase-comparison technique. The resulting data
will be compared with data from a CAD model to guide the construction process. A
research team from the Departments of Civil and Electrical Engineering at
Virginia Tech will collaborate with staff of the Bechtel Eastern Power
Corporation and will use Bechtel's 3-D design system.
