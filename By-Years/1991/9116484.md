This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, to be held July 5-11, 1992 in Berkeley,
California. The co-organizers are Professor Virgil Schrock, Department of
Nuclear Engineering, University of California Berkeley, and Professor Tadashi
Sakaguchi, Department of Production Engineering, Kobe University, Japan. Two-
phase flow dynamics is a short name for the complex problems that involve the
transient and steady state motions of fluids comprised of more than one phase.
Such flows are especially challenging to analyze because the interface
separating the phases is usually moving and changing in a very complex way that
depends upon mechanical, thermodynamic, and sometimes chemical effects. This
seminar will deal with selected topics in two-phase flow dynamics that are
fundamental problems in their own right and are central to analysis of large
complex energy systems, especially the transient behavior of such systems and
their esponses in hypothetical accident scenarios. The research now underway by
the U.S. and Japanese seminar participants has begun to identify new approaches
that hold the promise of substantial improvement in the predictive capability of
two-phase flow analysis. The participants will discuss the current state of
knowledge in this field and the difficult unresolved problems, and they will
attempt to develop a vision of how the subject can be advanced and what
directions for future research will be most promising.
