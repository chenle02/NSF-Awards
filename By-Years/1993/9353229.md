SACNAS, the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in
Science, will hold it's annual Conference January 14- 18, 1993 in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. The objective of the conference is to encourage undergraduate
science students to enter graduate school in order to obtain the Ph.D. degree
necessary for careers in research and science education. The Symposia will
describe the exciting opportunities in Math, Engineering and Biology and provide
strong role models for these fields. The conference will contain workshops,
panel discussions and organized small group discussions designed to provide
students with career counseling as well as information on research
opportunities. Undergraduate students will have ample opportunity to interact
with faculty of their own ethnic and racial background; in addition, there will
be one graduate student mentor for every four undergraduate students. The
conference will have a "Community Science Lecture", a science presentation that
is aimed not only at all the conference participants, but also at the local
scientific and lay community. An outreach effort to local high school teachers
and students is planned as part of the conference on Friday January 15. The
exhibitors associated with the conferences will be graduate schools of science,
and federal agencies and corporations that offer research careers. The many
aspects of the conference are evaluated for effectiveness leading to continual
improvements that are partially responsible for the phenomenal increase in
attendance that these Conferences have had in the last three years. A summary of
the conference proceedings are published and widely disseminated through the
SACNAS Newsletter and other national publications.
