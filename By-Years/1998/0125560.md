This award supports a project to analyze samples from the Law Dome ice core for
volcanic tephra. The Law Dome ice core is the best-dated ice core from East
Antarctica and contains a detailed record of climate and atmospheric chemistry
over at least the last 700 years. Several global volcanic eruptions appear to be
recorded in the Law Dome core, including the well known Tambora 1815 and Unknown
1809 events, as well as the Huaynaputina 1600 and Ruiz 1595 events. To verify
the source eruptions responsible for these signals, as well as to differentiate
between local Antarctic and southern hemisphere eruptions, a continuous scan for
volcanic glass at an annual resolution will be done on the last 700 years of the
Law Dome ice core. Sub-annual tephra analyses will be done in the sections
containing the largest acid signals in the core. To better evaluate the climatic
impact of large equatorial eruptions from ice cores, it is necessary to isolate
local eruptions and their associated glaciochemical signal from that of these
more distant sources. The identification of local eruptions in the Law Dome core
will improve upon the existing chronology of Antarctic volcanism over the last
700 years through the presence of volcanic glass in conjunction with the results
from this same type of study on the Siple Dome ice core.
