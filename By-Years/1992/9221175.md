Meta-populations are populations which are subdivided into many ephemeral,
weakly interacting subcomponents. The genetic properties of metapopulations are
determined, in large part, by genetic processes accompanying the extinction and
recolonization of the local subcomponents. These processes have been the subject
of recent theoretical analysis but are not well studied in nature. This study
will investigate the population genetic properties of a meta-population of
Silene alba, an herbaceous plant that has been the subject of the detailed,
long-term demographic analysis required as background data for the study of
meta-populations. The basic question to be asked in this project is whether the
repeated extinction and recolonization of local demes acts to increase or to
diminish genetic differentiation, relative to a similarly subdivided population
but without extinction and recolonization. The work will include studies of the
genetic properties of the meta-population, additional demographic studies geared
towards understanding mechanisms of gene flow, and extension of the theoretical
models. Experimental studies of pollen and seed flow, and recruitment from the
seed bank, will evaluate sources of gene flow, both into established populations
and as part of the process by which new populations are established. Extension
of theory will be guided, in part, by the results of the empirical work. //
