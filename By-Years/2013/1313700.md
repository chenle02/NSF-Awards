An award is made to the National Academy of Sciences to support the Board on
Life Sciences to: 1) hold one Board meeting per year, and 2) support staff time
to develop topics for new studies and other projects and perform tasks related
to completed studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board on Life Sciences serves as
the National Academy of Sciences' focal point for a wide range of technical and
policy topics in the life sciences, including genomics, biodiversity
conservation, bioterrorism, and key topics in basic biolgical and biomedical
research, such as stem cells. The Board organizes and oversees studies that
provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological
sciences and their impact on society. The Board also oversees important studies
on the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate
level, and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. More information
