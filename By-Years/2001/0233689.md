EAR-0233689&lt;br/&gt;Sharp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this proposal will
be used to upgrade the stable isotope laboratory in the Dept. of Earth and
Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico. In order to increase the
throughput, and maximize the number of users, we will purchase an automated
autosampler for waters, carbonates and head-space gases (a CombiPAL autosampler)
and an automated continuous flow interface (Finnigan GasBench II). The
autosampler will allow us to measure head-space gas (d15N), atmospheric vapor
(?D), carbonates (d13C &amp; ?18O) and waters (?18O) automatically during off-
hours. A second part of the upgrade is to install a differential pumping unit on
our mass spectrometer so that ?17O measurements can be made in continuous flow
conditions. When fully implemented, we should be able to make in situ
measurements of meteorites as part of our collaboration with the Institute of
Meteoritics, UNM.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
