The focus of this research is the synthesis of enantiomerically pure molecules
using free radical reactions as the key synthetic step. This is based on the
observation that small, seemingly reactive ring systems can be converted into
radicals and be induced to undergo cyclization faster than rearrangement. This
forms a new strategy for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds, and
ultimately, more complex materials. Kinetics of these rapid radical
rearrangements will also be studied. Oxiranylcarbinyl and aziridinyl radicals
will be the focus of these studies. With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Fred E. Ziegler of the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor Ziegler will focus his
research on carbon-carbon- bond formation, a fundamental process in the
synthesis of organic molecules, using free radical reactions to provide
enantiomerically pure materials. These studies will provide new avenues of
synthesis that may be applicable to the preparation of important antibiotics
through pathways inaccessible by anionic and cationic methods
