The two items of equipment here requested, a source of ionizing radiation and a
computerized karyotyping system, will be shared by researchers in a program
aimed at understanding basic genetic mechanisms in the cells of animals and how
these control life processes including maintenance of correct biochemical
conditions, growth, differentiation and development, and cell-cell interactions.
The research programs are focused on understanding basic biochemical and genetic
mechanisms of mutation and DNA repair, the role of cyclic AMP in genetic
regulation, elucidation of the arrangement of genes on chromosomes and
relationships of this topography to gene expression and the regulation of
biochemical pathways. The approach is such that each of the laboratories share
many common methodologies. Each, for example, employs somatic cell genetics,
biochemistry, and recombinant DNA technologies, that require common facilities
and equipment such as those requested here.
