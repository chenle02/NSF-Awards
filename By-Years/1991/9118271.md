The principal investigator will study the generation of melts in planetary
interiors, transport within the interiors, and chemical differentiation
processes. To do so he will experimentally study both natural and synthetic
igneous systems over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, utilizing
petrologic, analytical, and modelling techniques. The aim is to reach a better
understanding of planetary differentiation through igneous processes. The
results of this work will be crucial to a geologic understanding of the
development and evolution of the Earth as a planet.
