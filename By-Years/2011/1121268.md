A key question in the field of developmental biology is what fundamental
mechanisms are responsible for specifying different cell fates during
embryogenesis? A related question in the field of evolutionary biology is how
have these mechanisms been deployed to generate the tremendous array of animal
phyla and their distinctive body plans? Large gaps in our knowledge are due to
the fact that only a small number of animal models have been chosen for such
studies. This research focuses attention on representatives of a poorly studied
group of organisms, the spiralian lophotrochozoans, which encompass nearly one-
third of all living animal phyla (including molluscs, annelids, etc.). The
proposed studies deploy a powerful combination of modern cell and molecular
biology approaches to reveal fundamental information about basic mechanisms that
ultimately control the differentiation of embryonic cell fates and axial
properties, using an ideal spiralian model system, the snail Crepidula. More
specifically, this research will uncover key embryonic cell signaling events and
the underlying molecular pathways that ultimately specify the fates of cells
during development. Other studies suggest that many of these processes have been
conserved across the animal kingdom, including in humans. The findings of this
study will be compared with those gained from other animal systems to understand
the degree to which these events have changed over the course of evolutionary
history. This research has a broader impact not only in terms of the science,
but also in education. NSF funding allows the continued training of future
generations of scientists and teachers, which include undergraduate and graduate
students, who will work on these projects.
