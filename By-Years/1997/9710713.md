Project EFFECT is a technology and curriculum based project promoting the
recruitment, retention and success of undergraduate women in the academic and
professional fields of science, engineering and mathematics. Project EFFECT will
use a multi-faceted approach, building upon existing work at Washington State
University. The project will empower women as they strive to succeed in the
existing university structure and will facilitate the process of effecting
permanent change toward equitable pedagogical techniques in SEM courses.
Empowerment will be achieved through a dual effort consisting of a Bridge
Program designed to give women a fast-start in their academic careers
complemented by either a concentrated series of technology seminars, or a course
specifically designed to equip students with critical survival skills, including
technological skills, self awareness and self-confidence. University faculty and
graduate students will be involved in Innovation Workshops designed around
pedagogically sound practices that create equitable learning environments for
all constituents. Research projects will be conducted in conjunction will all
facets of the project. All materials developed should be replicable at other
institutions.
