The fundamental crystal chemical behavior of REEs in minerals is not well
understood. Among those minerals whose atomic arrangements are unknown or poorly
characterized are the most common REE-bearing minerals, including 1)
bastnaesite, the most abundant REE-bearing ore mineral, and its associated REE
fluorcarbonates; 2) the common REE (PO4) "dimorphs", moazite and xenotime, and
3) high-Si monazite, of particular interest because substituent Si may play an
important role in controlling the REE chemistry of monazites. Preliminary to
this submission an extensive effort has been undertaken to obtain high quality
specimens of these minerals in order to undertake high-precision crystal
structure analysis of the phases. Preliminary film studies attest to the high
quality of the crystals and ultimately assure success in the crystal structure
studies. The results of these studies will help to elucidate the crystal
chemical behavior of the REEs in the most common REE-bearing minerals.
