The Materials Research Laboratory at MIT under the direction of Dr. J. David
Litster supports interactive, multidisciplinary research in five major thrust
areas, operates and maintains central experimental facilities for a wide range
of materials- related research on campus, and provides seed funding for high-
risk projects in materials research. Major research areas include phases and
phase transitions, synthesis and properties of novel polymers, innovations in
steel technology (supported at MIT through FY 1988 only), intermetallic
compounds at high temperatures, and a new thrust in transition metal oxides.
Development and use of major central facilities is shared and coordinated with
the Harvard University MRL. The MIT MRL research program involves about forty
faculty members, eight postdoctoral research associates, more than fifty
graduate students, and twenty undergraduates.
