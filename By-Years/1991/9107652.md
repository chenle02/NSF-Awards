Thermoluminescence dating (TL) is a technique that holds out great promise for
archaeology in the age determination of inorganic materials, especially in the
period beyond 50,000 years ago. Unfortunately, many complications in the use of
the technique remain to be resolved before it can be used routinely and with
precision. Drs. Hornyak and Franklin will continue their program of experimental
work aimed at development and testing of a reliable technique for dating quartz-
bearing sediments without uncertainty as to the level of zeroing of the TL
signal. Control samples of relatively recent material, well dated by radiocarbon
methods, will be dated by TL as a control. The further development of TL dating
is of extreme importance and the PI's are among the world leaders in this area
of research.
