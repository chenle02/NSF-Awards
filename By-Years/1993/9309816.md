The project requests funds for participation of 40 faculty members from
minority institutions to attend the 1993 National Educational Computing
Conference (NECC'93) in Orlando, Florida, June 27-30, 1993. This is an extremely
worthwhile endeavor which expands on support CISE has previously provided for
faculty from minority institutions to attend conferences more technically
directed to computer science and engineering. The NECC provides a broader view
of computers in education focusing on the use of computers across all
disciplines. It is critical that faculty at minority institutions attend
national conferences of this type in order to become better integrated into the
research and education communities. This project represents a strong effort in
that direction.
