9725187 Furlong Transpressional plate boundaries are zones of complicated
crustal deformation. Many transpressional boundaries show partitioning of strain
into concurrent convergent and relatively pure strike-slip deformation. While
this strain partitioning is well documented in the crust of some areas, the way
in which the lower crust and mantle deform is not well known. This collaborative
study by Furlong at Penn State and Anderson at IGNS/Otago, New Zealand, will
address this general question using the Fiordland area of SW New Zealand as a
testing area. The specific problems that will be posed arc 1) how do the Pacific
and Australian lithospheric accommodate shortening, and to what extent are the
crust and mantel mechanically coupled? The approach will be two-fold. Furlong
will undertake detailed modeling of the thermal, rheological, and deformational
evolution of the area, and Anderson will undertake a seismological analysis of
the area. The result of the analysis will reveal to what extent the crust and
mantles are mechanically linked at this local, but they will also provide a
critical context in which to generalize to other areas.
