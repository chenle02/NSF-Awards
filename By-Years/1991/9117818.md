Research will be undertaken in order to develop new theoretical and
computational techniques and software for determining the structural, electronic
and magnetic properties of bulk solids, surfaces and interfaces. Specific
projects include (1) the development of fully relativistic moment polarized thin
film Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method and software for
carrying out relativistic studies of magnetism, magnetic anisotropy and magneto-
optical studies on surfaces and interfaces; (2) methods for calculating forces
acting on atoms using the techniques developed in (1); (3) the development of
the density functional coupled channel equation approach into a sophisticated
computational method which can be used efficiently as the starting point for the
next steps in solving the many-body problem with other techniques (including the
quantum Monte Carlo method). Unique features of (3) include the ability to solve
the energy band problem in more than three-dimensions which may be useful in
describing quasi-crystals. %%% Continued research will be done on the magnetic
properties of bulk, surface and interfacial magnetism based on calculations of
the electronic structure. Additional work will be done on the development of
computational techniques which will facilitate the efficient and accurate
calculations of these properties. The group at Northwestern is one of the
international leaders doing this type of work.
