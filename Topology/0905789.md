This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The University of Chicago has long been a center of algebraic topology, broadly
understood to include homotopical algebra, category theory, and connections with
algebraic geometry and geometric topology. The group in these fields is now the
largest it has been. Mathematically it is eclectic; hence this project includes
a variety of directions in all of these areas. The grant is solely for the
support of graduate students working with the PI in these areas.

The PI has trained nearly 50 PhD's, most of whom now hold academic positions in
the United States. This grant supports the training of more mathematically
expert PhD's with broad mathematical interests and a commitment to teaching.
