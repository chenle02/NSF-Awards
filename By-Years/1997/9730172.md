PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9730172 P.I. Albers, Donald J. Institution:
Mathematical Association of America Proposal Title: Calculus: Catalyzing a
National Community for Reform Abstract: The mathematical Association of America
(MAA) is publishing and disseminating Calculus: Catalyzing a National Community
for Reform (1987-1995), The report provides a timely encapsulation of the
characteristics of the NSF Calculus Program, evidence of impact of the NSF
Calculus Program, a timeline for calculus reform, and summary abstracts of all
NSF calculus awards over the period 1987-1995. The MAA's Notes Editorial Board
believes that the report is very valuable to all teachers of calculus and that
it nicely complements several other MAA publications on calculus reform.
Dissemination includes all department heads in two-year colleges, four-year
colleges, and universities.
