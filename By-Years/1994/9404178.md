This award supports research on linear groups over some classes of division
rings and to automorphism groups of free groups and free soluble groups. The
principal investigator recently proved that the Tits alternative holds for
groups of automorphisms of finitely generated free soluble groups. He will
continue this work, as well as study groups of automorphisms of free groups of
finite rank. He will also work on extending his result on imbedding a universal
enveloping algebra into a division ring to division rings of fractions of
torsion free nilpotent groups and the universal fields of fractions of free
groups rings. A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a
multiplication defined on it. These structures arise naturally in many different
settings and are of interest in mathematics, computer science, engineering and
physics. This particular project blends the study of rings with the study of
another algebraic object called a group.
