This project proposes to continue the efforts of the Student Meeting Activities
Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee (PEEC) of the IEEE
Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest and participation in
the power engineering field by sponsoring 90-100 electrical engineering students
to attend the IEEE-PES annual Summer Meeting to be held in Chicago, Illinois
July 21-25, 2002. The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for
students to be exposed to the most recent developments in design, operation,
construction, and research in the power engineering field, to share ideas
amongst themselves, and to interact with practicing engineers. This is a
particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry undergoes
significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility
structure. It is crucial to recruit the nation's best and brightest engineering
students into this evolving field. The career opportunities for students
interested in power engineering are many and varied; opportunities exist within
utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.
