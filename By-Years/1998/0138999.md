With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Charles Campbell and his coworkers at the University of Washington are measuring
the detailed adsorption and reaction energetics of small molecules and metal
atoms adsorbed on well-characterized metal and semiconductor surfaces. Using a
unique microcalorimetric approach, adsorption energies and bond strengths of
metal-carbon and metal-oxygen bonds are determined. Adsorption and interaction
of larger, more complex organic species are also examined. This accurate data is
useful in developing an understanding of the reaction mechanisms relevant to
heterogeneous catalysis, chemical vapor deposition processes, and adhesion at
solid surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strength of a chemical bond between an
adsorbed molecule and a solid surface is a crucial piece of information for
developing an understanding of technologically important processes such as
heterogeneous catalysis and electronic device manufacture. This information is
very difficult to obtain in a direct way. Professor Campbell and coworkers at
the University of Washington have developed a unique microcalorimetric approach
to obtaining this information that has been applied to a wide range of important
surface chemical systems. With the support of the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, these important measurements will continue and be extended to
organic molecules interacting with metal and semiconductor surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;
