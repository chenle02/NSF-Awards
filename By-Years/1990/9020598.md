This proposal requests support for a 2 1/2 day Workshop on Conceptual Models of
Scientific Computing, with roughly 30 participants. The workshop will bring
together computational scientists and researchers in computer system performance
modeling, with the goal of fostering collaborative development of a set of
useful conceptual models of large-scale scientific computations. In the longer-
term, the conceptual models developed will provide a framework and a set of
parameters to be used in understanding and predicting the performance of
scientific computations and computer systems. The workshop will have two major
benefits. The first will be a set of documentation, including position papers
prepared by the attendees, and a workshop report outlining the discussions and
recommendations of the workshop participants. The second will be to foster
communication and collaboration among the groups represented there.
