BioScholars II, a program of scholarships for 20 academically talented but
financially needy students at Pine Manor College, builds on the successes of its
predecessor, BioScholars I. It supports such students not only financially, but
also academically and personally, to enable them to continue their studies of
biology, to graduate, and to enter the workforce or continue in their scientific
studies. As a small, all-women's school enrolling a majority of local, low-
income, ethnic minority students, Pine Manor targets its support in demonstrably
effective ways. In particular, all students are expected to complete a capstone
internship, and for BioScholars, this is expected to involve research at one of
the colleges, universities, or industries in the Boston area. Teaching
postdoctoral fellows from Sackler School of Biomedical Science at Tufts
University offer seminar courses in advanced biomedical subjects to BioScholars
and other interested students. Talks by visiting speakers, a Science Club, a
Sophomore Honors Colloquium, peer and faculty mentoring, and early intervention
for students experiencing difficulties round out the program.
