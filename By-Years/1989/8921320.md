This action will provide funds for a continuation of basic research in
elementary particle physics. The program consists of experiments utilizing all
four of the major high energy physics accelerator facilities in the U.S.: the
Tevatron at Fermilab; the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven; the
electron - position storage ring, CESR, at Cornell; and the linear electron -
position collider at SLAC. These experiments are in various stages of planning,
construction, data taking and analysis. An accelerator is being constructed for
the study of electron - proton collision, at DESY in Hamburg, Germany, where a
Columbia group is participating in a collaboration to build a major particle
detector, Zeus. The Columbia program is a varied group of experiments addressing
fundamental questions in elementary particle physics.
