A `Research Experiences for Undergraduates` Site will be initiated at Oregon
State University. Through a national recruitment process, 8 undergraduate
students will be selected to be involved in a 10-week summer research program in
physics. Fields of physics to be emphasized include AMO, computational, solid
state, and nuclear. Students will be housed together in campus dormitories. Each
REU student will work in a close mentoring relationship with one of the faculty
in their research labs. In addition to the research experience, the participants
will complete a special short summer course in interfacing computers to
laboratory devices, a skill that is essential in many research programs, and
they will also receive instruction in machine shop techniques. An informal
`physics literary club` will meet weekly and will feature discussion of works of
literature that have a significant physics content. A final `mini-conference`
will give the students an opportunity to describe their research to their
colleagues and to the faculty and students of the Physics Department. The
program will be evaluated through written surveys as well as through oral
interviews.
