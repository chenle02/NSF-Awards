1212540&lt;br/&gt;Seibel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new method for processing and
imaging of thin-needle core biopsy (TNCB) of resected tissue containing
pancreatic cancer (animal and human) is proposed. TNCB specimens of 0.25mm
diameter will be obtained by a custom-designed coring device, while larger
0.40mm cores will be taken with a new commercial biopsy needle. Corresponding
fine needle aspirate (FNA) specimens will be taken at or alongside the TNCB
sample sites. While maintaining TNCB tissue within a tube or microfluidic
chamber, the specimen will be fixed, stained, and optically cleared. Absorption
dyes of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) will provide transmission image contrast
for the morphological structure of cells and
tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence dye will be imaged from various
immunohistological targets, such as proteins expressed at the base epithelial
membrane to help determine invasion and protein expression. Optical projection
tomographic microscopy (OPTM) will be used to generate 3D multimodal images of
biopsy tissue. Although the length of the tissue core will be longer than the
microscope field of view (FOV), different regions of the tissue will be imaged
and stitched together by image processing. Both 2D and 3D visualization of the
entire TNCB specimen will be provided to a pathologist using a custom computer
interface to manipulate the 3D dataset. Sensitivity and specificity of cancer
diagnosis will be made using tissue-slice pathology as the gold standard.
Comparative evaluation of pancreatic cancer diagnosis will be made between TNCB
imaged with the OPTM versus conventional FNA. This new technique is expected not
only to detect the presence of neoplastic cells but detect invasion of tissue by
cancer cells.
