Thin-layered structures of both aluminum nitride on silicon carbide and silicon
carbide on aluminum nitride are developed by heteroepitaxial chemical vapor
deposition. Silicon carbide in the beta form is produced initially by converting
the surface of a silicon substrate to silicon carbide, and by chemical vapor
deposition with silane and ethene. Epitaxial aluminum nitride is produced by
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The stabilities of these structures are
evaluated with annealling studies and thermodynamic modelling. Materials
produced are characterized with X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy.
A reduction in the crystal defect density in expected for epitaxial aluminum
nitride layers on silicon carbide, while epitaxial silicon carbide layers on
aluminum nitride should be electrically isolated from the substrate. This
research will result in improved structural and electrical quality of these
semiconductors, increasing their potential for applications in electronic and
optoelectronic devices.
