Workshop: Scaling photosynthesis from the chloroplast to the landscape

Understanding the interactions of plant form and photosynthetic function among
different species will be critical to the success of future management of both
native and agricultural species, especially under current scenarios of global
change. The purpose of this workshop is to evaluate photosynthetic limitations
and adaptive solutions that emerge at the higher levels of structural
organization found in the plant kingdom. The workshop will be held in
conjunction with the 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis in Brisbane,
Australia (August 18-23, 2001) and will be divided into sessions dealing with
the chloroplast, cell, cell layers inside a leaf, the leaf, crown, canopy, and
landscape. Across this broad structural/spatial hierarchy, chloroplasts are
packaged progressively into more and more complex levels of organization (e.g.
cells, leaves, branches, and crowns), generating new limitations to light and
CO2 capture for photosynthesis.
