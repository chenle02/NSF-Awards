Abstract: This is part of the AIMS Conference Series on Dynamical Systems and
Differential Equations, a biennial event working with a different hosting
university each time, to benefit all international researchers in the broad
field. For each meeting, some world-renowned experts of the highest caliber are
invited to deliver plenary addresses. A key feature has been the active
participation by and interaction among established researchers, young scientists
and graduate students. Junior researchers are especially benefited by a round-
table panel discussion, in each meeting, led by leaders in the field.
Furthermore, a refereed high quality proceedings is published for each meeting.
The AIMS Conference Series has clearly developed into the international platform
in the field for exchange of ideas, reporting of new achievements, discussions
on new and emerging applications, and interaction and collaboration. This
platform is being highly recognized by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers
from academia and industry working in the proximity of analysis, different
equations, dynamical systems, and applications. For this meeting, the invited
plenary speakers include Alberto Bressan (USA), Odo Diekmann (Netherlands),
Pierre-Louis Lions (France), Alexander Mielke (Germany), Masayasu Mimura
(Japan), Peter Polacik (USA), Patrizia Pucci (Italy), Bjorn Sandstede (UK), and
Lan Wen (China). This list represents the authorities in multi-disciplines
ranging from theoretical aspects of differential equations and dynamical
systems, to numerical methods, to computations, to control and optimization, and
to mathematical models arising in physics, biology, medicine, and engineering.
The backbone of the meeting is the organization of the many special sessions of
top quality representing all major areas of current research. Details are at
