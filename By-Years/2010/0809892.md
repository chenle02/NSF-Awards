This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the feasibility of an accurate low cost in-situ solid-state multi-spectral
absorption meter for measurement of water properties. Current commercially
available instruments are limited in their accuracy in real world conditions due
to their design and are also expensive due to the use of costly components such
as lamps, filter wheels, spectrometers, etc. This project will explore the use
of a novel patented construction method that in combination with LEDs, optics,
and photodiodes gives scientists an accurate and low cost research tool to
measure absorption in-situ over a variety of wavelengths. The instrument will be
insensitive to interfering parameters (e.g. scattering) and easy to maintain in
the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this new method of measure water
properties will help communities determine the health of natural water
resources. Measuring the absorbance of water is a fundamental measurement for
aquatic researchers. Light penetrating water is diminished almost exponentially
with depth with an accompanying change in the energy spectrum. These changes
affect phytoplankton life directly, so an understanding of the absorption
properties for bodies of water is significant for determining the ability to
support the growth of phytoplankton. Multi-spectral absorption can also be used
to determine the constituents of water, distinguishing between water, dissolved
yellow substances, phytoplankton, etc. Most measurements of absorption have been
done on samples using a laboratory instrument, but there is an ongoing need to
measure absorbance in- situ which allows researchers to gather much more data
efficiently. A more accurate in-situ absorption meter dramatically improves the
quality of the data that scientists can generate and reduces the amount of time
they spend correcting for interfering parameters. &lt;br/&gt;
