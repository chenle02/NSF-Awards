In response to research that shows that high quality science education in the
middle grades is crucial to the national goal of increasing interest in STEM,
this Teaching Fellowship (TF) project will strengthen middle science teaching
and learning in the District of Columbia by training 20 new science teachers and
providing them with a variety of professional development opportunities. Key
project elements include (a) a twenty-week Practice of Science internship
directed by Carnegie Academy for Science Education (CASE), (b) a Master of Arts
in Teaching degree that emphasizes foundations of urban education, content area
pedagogy, and field experiences, and (c) three years of new teacher mentoring
after graduation. The project will be done in partnership with the DC Public and
Public Charter Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing that university-based
teacher preparation must be aligned with the needs of the school districts, this
project will use a constructed understanding of the high-needs K-12 teaching
environment as a context for training teachers in STEM content and pedagogy.
Thus as part of their coursework in science and science teaching, the TFs will
have training on academic science language (through the Center for Applied
Linguistics) and differential instruction for culturally and linguistically
diverse learners. Formative and summative evaluation will address the extent to
which the project has met its goals to retain and place TFs in high-needs middle
schools, align curricula and pedagogy to Next Generation Science Standards, and
lead to effective secondary science teaching practices and education of diverse
learners. The results of the project will be disseminated at the Association for
Science Teacher Education International Conference and the National STEM
Conference.
