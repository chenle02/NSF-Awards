This Track I, Phase II Noyce Scholarship project will prepare twenty New York
State (NYS)-certified middle and high school science teachers for the rigors of
teaching in both urban and rural high-need schools. Based on longitudinal
research findings from a study of the first Noyce cohort, psychometric
attributes of preservice teachers that are more likely to thrive in a rural or
in an urban high needs school have been identified. Identification of these
attributes will be used to place the Noyce II scholars in either an urban or
rural setting, a process called "data-decided" placement. The project team will
research the career trajectory effects the "data-decided" clinical teaching
placements have on Noyce Scholars' careers and student learning. Extending the
successes of the Noyce I award, the project team will also collaborate with the
SUNY-Urban Teacher Education Center in providing internship experiences in high-
need New York City schools. Moreover, graduates of the Noyce I program currently
teaching in either high-need urban or rural areas have been called to serve as
mentor-role models for the Noyce II Scholars. Additional science teaching
curriculum supports are being provided by SUNY-Oneonta's Math for America Master
STEM Teachers, the Catskill Area School Study Council, and the regional STEM
Leadership Council. Longitudinal qualitative/quantitative research designed to
understand how participation in the varied Noyce II program opportunities shape
the career trajectories of the Noyce Scholars will be conducted. In particular,
the project team is systematically analyzing reflective journal entries and
semi-structured interviews of Noyce II program scholars before and immediately
upon completion of early field experiences in the New York City Schools as a
means for tailoring their later field work and student teaching experiences
towards their individual career trajectory goals. Results of this
qualitative/quantitative research will be disseminated in appropriate venues
such as peer reviewed journals and conferences.
