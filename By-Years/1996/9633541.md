The objective of this project is to provide a flexible framework for supporting
multiple time granularities. The targeted use of the framework is for automatic
evaluation of user queries and for discovering temporal patterns (i.e., data
mining) in an environment where either the user queries or temporal patterns
involve granularities that do not match the granularity of the stored data. The
basic idea is to add the necessary functionalities so that the database system
is able to understand and reason about information involving multiple time
granularities. Algorithms for efficiently evaluating user queries and
discovering temporal patterns will also be investigated, and an experimental
prototype will be built. The impact of this research should be twofold: Firstly,
the proposed framework should provide the basic tools for database systems to
support flexible user queries, which would free users from the unnecessary tasks
of writing complex queries or changing their pattern descriptions to fit the
specific granularity used to store temporal data in the database. Secondly, the
optimization techniques explored should provide strategies and algorithms for
efficient evaluations of queries and discovery of temporal patterns. The
proposed experimental work should provide insights into the subject and into the
practicality of the proposed theory as well as methods.
