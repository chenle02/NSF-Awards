This workshop brings together a range of researchers, including graduate
students and junior faculty, from a variety of natural and social science
disciplines to understand the Human Dimensions of the Arctic System (HARC). The
close linkages between people and the environment, the great variability in both
human and natural systems, and predictions that the polar regions will
experience large impacts of global change make the Arctic a compelling region
for research in to the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems. The
workshop will include strong participation from the Arctic indigenous community.
Research partnerships between disciplines and among researchers and indigenous
representatives will be fostered by the opportunity to discuss pressing
environmental, social, and cultural concerns. This project is an award emanating
from the FY 2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment
focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
