With the advent of electrostatic micro-motors, come possibilities for small,
fast and inexpensive spatial light modulation (SLM) devices, particularly in the
areas of invasive body imaging, catheter-directed laser ablation surgery, image
scanning vector-controlled light-beam modulators. Present-day SLMs are typically
limited in their range of motion or are quite large in size. Micro electro-
mechanical system (MEMS) technology opens possibilities for compact, large-
deflection, multi-axis, high-bandwith, servo- controlled light-beam deflectors.
SRC is interested in investigating the utilization of a particular electrostatic
micromotor, the "Wobble Motor", for use as one- or two-degree-of-freedom spatial
light modulation device. This proposed research will investigate the possible
bandwith and resolution of such devices, how these parameters are affected by
device scaling, the design of rotor position sensors, and thus the suitability
of Wobble-based micro-acutators as servo-controlled SLM devices for a variety of
applications. Specifically, the Phase I research would consist of system
modelling, control development, and preliminary feasibility demonstration of a
two-degree-of- freedom laser light-beam director. Micromotor-based SLMs would
open up an important application area in the rapidly expanding MEMS field and
the rapidly growing medical laser field.
