This project provides partial funding to cover the costs for the United States
participants to attend the Fourth International Symposium on Robotics Research
to be held in Santa Cruz, California, on August 9-14, 1987. The symposium will
be jointly sponsored by the Systems Development Foundation. The goals of the
Fourth Symposium are to provide an informal forum for the open exchange of ideas
and information, to document the discussions in a well-publicized proceedings,
to continue the development of the international community of robotics
researchers, and to expand that community to include new, young researchers.
Topics to be covered by the Symposium include robot intelligence (e.g., vision,
reasoning, planning), robot programming, as well as issues in Kinemetics,
control and mobility.
