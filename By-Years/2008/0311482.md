A computer program is written in a high-level *programming*&lt;br/&gt;
*language*, but to be run, it must be translated into a *machine*&lt;br/&gt;
*language*. Each kind of machine---desktop computer, cell phone,&lt;br/&gt;
handheld computer---has a different machine language and needs a&lt;br/&gt;
different translator. At present, each translator must be written by&lt;br/&gt;
an expert who specializes *both* in translation *and* in machine&lt;br/&gt;
language. This project will develop methods by which a translator can&lt;br/&gt;
be written without such double expertise. An expert who knows only&lt;br/&gt;
about the machine will write a *declarative* description that says&lt;br/&gt;
what the machine does. The project's software will analyze this&lt;br/&gt;
description and mechanically produce components to be used by an&lt;br/&gt;
expert who knows only about translation. Because this approach relies&lt;br/&gt;
crucially on the description's being correct, the project will also&lt;br/&gt;
develop techniques for mechanically checking that the description is&lt;br/&gt;
consistent with real hardware. The descriptions and the analysis&lt;br/&gt;
thereof will enable the machine expert's work to be reused in many&lt;br/&gt;
different translators (and other applications) and the translation&lt;br/&gt;
expert's work to be readily applied to many different machines.&lt;br/&gt;
Translators for new machines will be developed more quickly, more&lt;br/&gt;
reliably, and with less effort than at present.&lt;br/&gt;
