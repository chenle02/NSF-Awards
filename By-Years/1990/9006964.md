This project supports the procurement of equipment needed to enhance research on
material and structural damping research. The goal is to improve the
understanding of the phenomenon of passive damping, one of the most poorly
understood characteristics of structural behavior. The primary research projects
address the development of finite element analysis techniques for modeling
frequency dependent dynamic behavior and high damping structural materials, and
techniques for measuring damping of individual structural elements at very low
frequencies. There is the potential for using the equipment on related projects
as well. The equipment comprises an experiment control computer, intelligent
instruments, non interfering force and motion transducers, and laboratory
apparatus for studying precision structural dynamic behavior and its dependence
on temperature, frequency, amplitude, and ambient pressure.
