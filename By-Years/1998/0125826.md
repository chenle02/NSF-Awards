EAR-0125826&lt;br/&gt;Andreas K. Kronenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose
to hold a Gordon Research Conference on Rock Deformation from May 19-24, 2002 at
the Gordon Conference site in Barga, Italy. As discussed in detail in the
proposal, the conference is being held to bring together an interdisciplinary
group of experts to discuss major unanswered questions about the deformation and
plastic flow in the Earth's crust. The issues being addressed are central to
understanding tectonic processes, the initiation of earthquakes, and the origin
of natural resources. Funds will be used to cover travel and accommodations to
enhance participation of student and early career scientists. It is expected
that a broad and interdisciplinary cross-section of researchers from academia,
government labs, and the broad international community will participate in the
conference. The PIs requested $25,000 in support, but the group of reviewing
program directors decided that $20,000 is more appropriate for the conference as
proposed.&lt;br/&gt;
