Fundamental theoretical and experimental work is to be carried out on the
generation of nearly uniform submicron droplets from a new atomization
technique. The technique involves generation of high frequency pressure was in
specific areas of the atomization nozzle, at frequencies tuned to the maximum
flow instability. The technique addresses droplet production at larger rates
than achievable by present systems of exitation. If successful, it will be
highly useful in a variety of materials processing and spray technologies.
