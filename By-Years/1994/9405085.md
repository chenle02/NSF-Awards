Akhavan 9405085 The object of this study is to develop an advanced parallel
spectral domain-decomposition package for large eddy simulation (LES) of
turbulence in complex science and engineering applications. In particular, we
propose to implement the dynamic two-component subgrid-scale model recently
developed at the University of Michigan into the parallel spectral domain
decomposition code currently under development at Brown University.
