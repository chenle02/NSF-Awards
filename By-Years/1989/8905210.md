The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory research on filtration
techniques for detection and recovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
and on the use of gene probe techniques for detection of the presence of this
virus in water that has been in contact with solid and liquid wastes that are
contaminated with this virus. In this preliminary research, recovery of the
virus will be investigated by use of positively charged depth filters, a
technique that has been shown to absorb virus particles at or nearly a neutral
pH. Positive results of detection procedures will be confirmed by use of tissue
culture when applicable or by restriction analysis and subsequent gel
electrophoresis to visualize the viral constituents or metabolic products. This
project is being supported under the NSF Program of Expedited Awards for Novel
Research. Results of this project are expected to assist in determination of the
impact that potential contamination of water by the HIV-virus can have on the
engineering design of processes and systems for disinfection and decontamination
of environmental resources.
