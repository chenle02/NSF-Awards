This award supports an international workshop on nonlinear phenomena to be held
in Santiago, Chile at the University of Chile from September 6-15, 1990. The
U.S. organizer is Jacobo Rapaport of Ohio University and in Chile there are
several organizers headed by Patricio Cordero of the University of Chile. There
is an international organizing committee which includes scientists from
Argentina and Brazil as well as from Chile. The participants will come from
Mexico and several countries in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina, Brazil and
Chile. The workshop will cover research topics in fluid dynamics near
equilibrium (theoretical and experimental), fluid dynamics far from equilibrium
(turbulence and chaos), phase transitions and critical phenomena, nonlinear
phenomena in condensed matter physics (quantum Hall effect, high temperature
superconductivity, etc.), mathematical modelling (cellular automata, neural
networks, learning machines). An objective of this workshop is to give the
opportunity for young physicists to become acquainted with current problems in
nonlinear physics. In addition, it will provide an interactive environment for
the exchange of ideas and the identification of research topics which will
promote future collaborations and scientific cooperation among the research
communities. The workshop will also bring together Latin American physicists
which is not always easy to do. These are all good examples of fulfilling the
goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
