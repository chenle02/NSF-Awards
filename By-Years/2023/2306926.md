Hyperbolic conservation laws provide basic mathematical models for continuum
physics, and are widely used by scientists and engineers, for instance, in the
study of traffic flows and flame propagation fronts. There is a general
expectation that these equations should be deterministic: knowing an initial
configuration one should be able to uniquely predict the future evolution.
However, recent mathematical advances point to the fact that this is not always
true. A major goal of this project is to better understand in which situations
the uniqueness of solutions can be guaranteed, compared with examples where
multiple solutions occur, in one or more space dimensions. Based on these
theoretical advances, the investigator will then provide new error bounds for a
wide class of computational schemes, which are used in applications as
predictive tools. A further research direction will be the accurate description
of how solutions can lose regularity. In other words: what happens at the first
instant of time when a new shock wave, such as a sudden alteration in pressure,
is formed. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral associates.

The project will address some fundamental issues at the frontier of the current
theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. New uniqueness or non-uniqueness results
will be sought, in a wider class of weak solutions, possibly with unbounded
variation. For one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws endowed with a
strictly convex entropy, the investigator aims at establishing universal error
estimates, valid for all approximation schemes which are compatible with the
conservation equations and the entropy conditions. In addition, for various
classes of nonlinear wave equations, a local asymptotic description of generic
solutions will be provided, in a neighborhood of a point where a new singularity
emerges.
