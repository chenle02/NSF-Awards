Millard Alexander of the University of Maryland, College Park is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the
Division of Chemistry for the development of theoretical tools to investigate,
with high accuracy, reactions occurring on multiple coupled potential energy
surfaces. Fully-quantum reactive scattering calculations are used to study the
effects of spin-orbit branching in the products of elementary reactions. Among
the reactions studied are several of atmospheric interest: the reactions of
atomic oxygen and atomic fluorine with hydrogen chloride. This work is crucial
to interpreting and challenging a large number of existing, detailed
experimental investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has a broad
impact through application to atmospheric, combustion and interstellar chemistry
and involves international collaborations with leading theoretical and
experimental chemists from Europe and Asia. Alexander also freely distributes
several computer codes developed in his research group.
