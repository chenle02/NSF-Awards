The Marine Science Consortium will initiate a four-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Marine Biology for 20 hearing-impaired students entering
grades 10,11. The project is located at the Marine Science Consortium at Wallops
Island, Virginia, and is designed to expose outstanding precollege hearing-
impaired students to the study and experience of marine science. Twenty hearing-
impaired students receive a four-week educational program involving lecture,
hands-on field, shipboard, laboratory, and research experiences in the marine
sciences.
