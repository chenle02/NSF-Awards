9418277 Storm This Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Chemistry will
bring together solid state chemists and materials research and development
scientists from around the world with the express purpose of improving contact
and communication among industrial, government, and academic researchers. The
topics and speakers that have been selected are at the forefront of the field of
solid-state chemistry and range from solid state synthesis and characterization
to topics of high technological impact such as microporous solids and nonlinear
optical materials for communications. This award will provide for the support of
graduate students and young faculty to give them an opportunity to participate
in discussions with leaders in the field of solid-state chemistry. ***
