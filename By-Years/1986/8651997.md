The California Museum of Science and Industry will create a 3,000 square foot
permanent exhibition of hands-on participatory exhibits on chemistry and
chemical phenomena that will allow visitors to manipulate the variables of
chemical systems. Forty exhibit units will be organized in clusters in that
represent the basic concepts of properties of atoms and molecules, molecular
structure and chemical reactions, stability of molecules and rates of reactions,
forces between atoms and molecules and energy of atoms and molecules. The
exhibition will use state-of-the-art technology to present chemical experiments
previously left to the lab bench or the demonstration table. Interactive
computers and videodiscs will be used where danger or complexity prevents the
visitor from using "the real thing." Exhibit content will be proved in prototype
form and tested on museum staff, visitors, and school groups prior to final
design and construction. NSF support will be used in the design and prototype
phases, and an "exhibit cookbook" of exhibit technologies for use by other
museums will be created. The project has already attracted more than $175,000 of
matching funds towards a total of $800,000 in non-NSF matching funds to support
its $1,100,000 budget.
