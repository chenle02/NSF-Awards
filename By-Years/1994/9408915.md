9408915 Lichtenberg This two-year award supports an empirical investigation of
R&amp;D exchange and collaboration, and specialization, within the European
Union, using a number of large electronic databases on research and development
activities within European Union countries. This project will estimate measures
of the structure of international technological cooperation, such as the
relative frequency of collaboration between different countries; and measures of
the distribution of each industry's "knowledge base" by detailed research field.
In addition, the project will reexamine several important hypotheses about
R&amp;D specialization and collaboration, e.g., the relationships between the
characteristics of organizations, the nature of the R&amp;D they conduct and the
R&amp;D results they produce, and their demand for collaboration. This study of
these European data will provide important comparative findings to the US
research community engaged in the analysis of the conduct of research and
development in the public and private sectors. * * *
