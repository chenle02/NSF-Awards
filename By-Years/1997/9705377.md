9705377 Dusenbery The Space Science Institute is developing a 5,000 s.f. hands-
on traveling exhibitions called MarsQuest that will be the centerpiece of a
wide-ranging planetary science education program. The exhibition will feature
engaging, aesthetically designed, hands-on displays that offer experiences with
science concepts relevant to Mars exploration, and will address the common
misconceptions about Mars and its relationship to Earth. The most exciting
aspect of the exhibition is its up-to-date connection to the progress and
discoveries of 8-10 spacecraft that will be launched by NASA from 1996-2005. The
exhibition will be supported by educational programs, including comprehensive
teacher workshops, public programs on Mars themes, a 30-minute planetarium show
emphasizing exploration and discovery, visits to schools and the dissemination
of comprehensive field- tested educational materials developed by Arizona State
University, the Planetary Society, NASA, the Pacific Science Center, and others.
All educational materials will be aligned with the National Science Education
Standards and will be available on the World Wide Web.
