Noiseless (or reversible) methods are preferred over noisy (or irreversible)
methods for the compression of grayscale images in situations where the quality
of the images is critical and/or where postprocessing of the images is involved.
Two significant application areas for such methods are in the storage and
transmission of medical images and industrial radiographic images used for
nondestructive evaluation (NDE). The main objective of the proposed research is
to improve existing and develop new methods for the noiseless compression of
grayscale images. Sophisticated source modeling techniques and the powerful
arithmetic coding technique are used for this purpose. It is expected that some
of the new methods to be developed will perform 30% to 40% better than the
existing methods. Extensive statistical analyses of images and digital computer
simulation experiments will be the primary tools in implementing the project. In
addition to providing new, improved methods for the compression of grayscale
images, the research project will also help shed some light on certain important
aspects of the noiseless data compression area as a whole.
