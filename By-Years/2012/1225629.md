The project funds extended research visits of U.S-based graduate students to
selected Asian research groups working in speech and language processing. These
students are selected from those attending the annual meeting of Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL), which will be held in Jeju, Korea, July 8-14,
2012. The selected students will work on a research project with researchers in
the hosting group they are visiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
provide opportunities for students to be exposed to different culture and new
research paradigm in other countries, broaden their horizon and help generate
new research ideas, and help make them more competitive in the global market and
develop into the scientists that are needed globally in the future. The extended
visit also helps build bridges between the Asian hosts and the student's home
research group in the U.S. This will facilitate long term collaboration between
U.S. and other countries, and advance science and technology in the whole world.
