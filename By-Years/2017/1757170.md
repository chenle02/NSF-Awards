This REU site award to the Wadsworth Center, located in Albany, NY, will support
the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. The
primary objective of the program is to provide cutting-edge research experiences
in fundamental cell and molecular biosciences, and includes projects in which
undergraduate students work with each other and/or with pairs of mentor(s) on
collaborative projects. Projects encompass a wide spectrum in cutting edge
research in molecular genetics, cell biology, and structural and computational
biology. Students will attend weekly seminars on topics including current
faculty research, career options and strategies, and ethics and the responsible
conduct of research. Program outcomes will be assessed based on student surveys
and using the CIMER REU tool as a common assessment tool. Applications are
completed online (https://www.wadsworth.org/education/undergraduate/reu), and
are especially encouraged from students attending small colleges or
universities, and from underrepresented minority populations. Selection of
participants is made from all applications received by a committee of Wadsworth
Center scientists based on personal statements from the applicant, letters of
support, and transcripts of grades and courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited
research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Applicants from
community colleges and small colleges in New York with limited research
opportunities, as well as NYS-CSTEP institutions, are encouraged to apply.
Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results
of their work at scientific conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-
based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of
Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the
training program. For purposes of data analysis with past records, students will
also be asked to complete a second web-based assessment tool for which data has
been collected for several years. Students will be tracked after the program in
order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an
automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the
program is available by visiting https://www.wadsworth.org/reu, or by contacting
the PI, Dr. Randall Morse, or the Program Director, Dr. Matthew Kohn, at
reu@health.ny.gov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
