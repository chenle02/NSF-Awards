The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project include tunable
blocks that would allow a range of spectrally- and spatially-agile devices.
These may include high-gain directional antennas that can improve performance
while reducing power consumption. The fundamental MEMS varactor technology also
offers solutions for critical efficiency and linearity problems as wireless
devices employ more complex waveforms. Furthermore, the fundamental switching
element in the varactor addresses a significant market need in the $200+ million
automated test equipment (ATE) market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop tunable power
amplifiers for handset applications based on an enabling microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) varactor technology. The successful completion of the proposed
effort will allow the team to address significant market needs for reducing the
cost and part count of smart phones and wireless devices, and high bandwidth
testing needed for automated test equipment (ATE). The methods to be employed
include optimizing the MEMS varactor and integrating the varactor into a tunable
power amplifier. The proposed tunable approach addresses the high degree of
redundancy in wireless designs today. In many cases, a complete front end and
antenna, hardwired for a specific frequency, must be replicated for each band.
The proposed approach enables tuning a single channel to cover the spectrum,
drastically reducing the bill of material and footprints.
