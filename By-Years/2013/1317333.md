This award funds shipboard scientific support equipment on the RV Blue Heron,
which is owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes
Observatory and operated as a UNOLS vessel. Funds will be used to develop
maximum capacity documentation (MCDs) for our A-frame, crane, deck sockets and
01 deck, fishing gallows, and winches as per UNOLS RVSS Appendix B, and to
purchase a fire detection system, and a replacement Automated Information
System. All of this equipment and documentation will help ensure safer working
conditions on board the Blue Heron thereby improving operations for all users of
the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts result from the funded
MCDs, fire detection system, AIS and chemical storage locker, which will enhance
the University of Minnesota?s infrastructure for research and education. The
items and documentation will increase the level of safety on board the vessel,
ensuring that projects supported by NSF will be completed in a safe and timely
manner. The equipment will be installed on the vessel and therefore will be
available to all of the Blue Heron?s users.
