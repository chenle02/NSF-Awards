9523815 Camp Flush communication channels generalize the more conventional
asynchronous one-to-one communication paradigms. A flush channel offers the
implementor of a distributed application the flexibility of specifying a message
delivery order apropos of the demands of the application. This stands in marked
contrast to the rigid FIFO (first-in-first-out) delivery order of communication
specified by a virtual circuit in TCP/IP or specified by a virtual channel in
ATM communication. The more restrictive the delivery order, the less concurrency
possible to exploit in message transmissions over a multi-path system. Flush
channels allow the user to define the delivery of a message to be after the
delivery of all messages previously transmitted, or before the delivery of all
messages subsequently transmitted, or both. The delivery order between the
sending site and the destination site, created by the user, is a partial order.
The results from previous work are encouraging. Flush communication channels can
reduce the mean delivery time of messages substantially, regardless of the
underlying physical structure of the network. That is, an implementor of a
distributed application that uses an F-channel can reduce communication costs
whether the communication occurs on routes established for virtual circuit or
datagram in TCP/IP or UDP/IP or on routes established for the connectionless
service class D provided by the ATM Adaptation Layer. This possible reduction in
mean delivery time of messages may be critical in meeting real-time requirements
of the application. However, all previous results only consider interprocess
communication (IPC) for one-to-one communication. The goal of this research is
to investigate the implications of implementation and performance when we extend
F-channel communication to many-to-many communication. ***
