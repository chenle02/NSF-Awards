Twenty videotaped instructional units, each about fifteen minutes, with
accompanying print materials will be designed and produced to introduce general
middle and secondary school students to important topics in statistics and
probability. These video units will draw on footage from the new television
series "Against All Odds: Inside Statistics." Students will profit from viewing
instruction that makes use of specific applications shot on location. The many
and varied applications will demonstrate the wide usefulness of statistics and
probability. The animated computer graphics will capture student attention and
convey concepts in a manner hard to duplicate in the classroom. COMAP will
distribute the package at cost to insure widespread distribution. Both Woodrow
Wilson and Quantitative Literacy workshops have agreed to pilot materials under
development and to use final materials to assist in dissemination.
