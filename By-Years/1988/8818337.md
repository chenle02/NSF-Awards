The wear of monolithic carbon electrical brushes will be studied. Analytical
modeling of the particle ejection theory of brush wear will be compared with
experimentally obtained results. The experimental apparatus will make it
possible to observe the development and movement of hot spots in the contact
area, generated due to both frictional heating and heating from the electrical
current passing from the brush surface to the matching surface. The effect of a
number of test parameneters will be determined and the results used to validate
and improve the model.
