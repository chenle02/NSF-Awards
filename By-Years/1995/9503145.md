This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in the
purchase of a modern single-crystal diffraction system. This new instrumentation
will enhance greatly research in a number of areas, including the following: (1)
The Structure of Reactive Intermediates of Synthetic Utility; (2) Homogeneous
Models of Ziegler-Natta Catalysts; (3) Structural Studies on Metal Sulfides; and
(4) Rationally Designed Channel Clathrates. The X-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three- dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
