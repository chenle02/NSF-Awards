Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, being conducted by a
team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the Colorado School of
Mines, investigates the feasibility of a web-based system for assessing an
engineering student's ability to recognize and resolve ethical dilemmas similar
to those encountered in practice. The investigators are testing a "pencil-and-
paper" version with carefully constructed scenarios and well developed scoring
rubrics on 100 students. Finally, they are evaluating the use of a neural
network to predict student classification. In order to evaluate their tool, they
will compare their results to those derived from follow-up interviews and a
"triangulation" process that combines many measures to estimate the true
outcome. They plan to describe their results at major engineering education
meetings and, if warranted, they will publish in archived journals.
