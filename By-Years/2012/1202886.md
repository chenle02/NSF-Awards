Spotting paths and planning maneuvers: How birds fly through a complex cluttered
world

Flying animals regularly navigate through forests, urban settings, and other
very complex environments at high speeds. These flights require, 1) rapid visual
recognition of the surrounding environment, 2) quick and accurate planning of
unobstructed paths, and 3) accurate maneuvers. These three behaviors are
interdependent: vision informs path planning which defines the maneuvers to be
performed whose execution presents a new scene. Despite a long history of work
seeking to understand how birds process visual information, plan paths, and the
aerodynamics of their maneuvers, little work has explored how these aspects work
together in the real world. This work is investigating the feedback between
vision, path planning, and aerodynamic maneuvering in the real world.

The fellow is developing instrumentation which pigeons (Columba livia) can carry
in backpack-harnesses during free flight. This instrumentation, consisting of
video devices and inertial sensors (IMUs), will allow researchers to record wing
kinematic data, visual environment data, and flight paths over long outdoor
flights through natural environments. As part of this work, the fellow will
offer lectures on recent advances to high school biology teachers through
Harvard Life Sciences? Outreach Program, and develop exhibit material for the
Harvard Museum of Natural History focusing on the mechanisms required for
successful biological flight. Additionally, increased understanding of these
natural processes will inform future engineering efforts to produce fully or
partially autonomous micro aerial vehicles.
