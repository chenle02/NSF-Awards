Professor Stuart Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical research involving
dynamical selectivity of molecular processes, particularly those which are
related to product formation in chemical reactions. Such studies will help in
the development of experimental techniques which influence the course of a
chemical reaction through the use of pulsed laser excitation. Professor Rice
will continue to refine and extend the Tannor-Rice scheme for controlling the
selectivity of product formation in chemical reactions. He will also extend the
recently developed Davis-Gray-Rice version of unimolecular reaction rate theory
to systems with many degrees of freedom and the formulation of a quantum
mechanical version of the theory. Finally, Rice will also continue his research
examining the signatures of chaos in quantum mechanical systems.
