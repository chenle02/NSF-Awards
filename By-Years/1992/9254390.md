This four-year project improves middle and secondary school physical science,
biology, chemistry and earth science instruction through training in
microcomputer-based tools and modern pedagogies. Forty-nine master teachers from
eight geographical areas in New York, Pennsylvania and Georgia are trained
through two four-week summer institutes. The first institute emphasizes
materials development, the second conducting workshops. The teachers have access
to previously developed materials and ongoing curriculum development efforts
supported during the summers. The teacher leaders, in turn, conduct area
workshops for 400 additional teachers. they support and train between six and
ten teachers in their area for each of the two years. Moreover, they are
available to offer ongoing assistance to the teachers. Matching funds of 35% are
provided by the grantee.
