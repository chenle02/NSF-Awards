This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I objective of this project is to
develop an integrated wafer-scale, high-speed tunable filter technology for
high-bit-rate fiber optic networks. Specifically, the feasibility of developing
a wafer-scale array of innovative Fabry-Perot tunable filters for use in either
the transmitter or the receiver of a communications system is explored. The
operating voltage of the filters is designed to be in the range of 0 - 40 volts,
the scanning times are less than 0.1 milliseconds and the filtering wavelength
region between 2.5 and 5 m. In Phase I, the innovative tunable filter will first
be prototyped in a small array (88 pixels), and in Phase II it will be scaled to
a 3232 module that will be driven by an active matrix high voltage VLSI chip. In
the Phase II work these filter arrays will be integrated directly onto the
surface of VCSEL arrays and detector arrays (to be supplied by one of our
corporate partners) to form a pre-aligned rugged and compact package. This novel
MEMS-based tunable filter array will find applications in fiber-optic
telecommunication systems, and in low-cost, high-performance remote sensing
instruments and spectrometers
