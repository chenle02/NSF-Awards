This research project deals with the identification of discrete event system
(DES) dynamics for synthesis of supervisory intelligent controllers. Such
systems represent a complex plant's behavior by modeling it as a sequence of
logical events, e.g., a computer disk control system. The supervisory controller
is a DES controlling a hybrid system. Investigation of efficient methods for
obtaining DES plant models are carried out in this project. Specific techniques
used include the optimal designs of state space partitions defining the observed
events using inductive inference procedures, with an emphasis on relatively low
computational burden and reduced sample complexity.*** //
