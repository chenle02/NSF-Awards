This grant supports continued studies of the earth's ionosphere and
plasmasphere. The proposed tasks for the next three years again concentrate on
the subauroral and high latitude ionospheres and are a natural continuation and
extension of past work. It is planned to expand the studies of the subauroral
ionosphere with investigations into (1) the evolution of high altitude
subauroral ion and electron heat flows during magnetic storms, (2) the
aeronomical effects of observed soft electron and soft ion precipitation peaks,
(3) processes responsible for ion and electron precipitation in this region, and
(4) magnetospheric emissions triggered by ionospheric coupling. Planned studies
of ion outflows, encompassing both high- and mid-latitude regions, include: (1)
physical processes responsible for He+-dominated ion outflows, and (2) mid-
latitude heavy ion upwelling events.
