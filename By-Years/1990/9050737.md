Computer-assisted three-dimensional modeling is being developed for analysis of
complex biological events. A computer system capable of producing three
dimensional simulations of various developmental processes that would be student
interactive, has been designed. Once data are obtained and simulated, students
can view the event from various perspectives, shade or color any class of
tissue, follow specific highlighted areas during the developmental process, and
make video movies of any of these. An advanced course is being developed in
which a specific problem or system, for example the mechanics of amphibian
gastrulation, eye development, patterns of homeobox containing gene expression
during early Drosophila development and how they change in various mutants,
neurulation, or heart formation, is studied in detail and simulated. The same
equipment will be used to teach intermediate level courses in development or
cell biology; this would allow students to interact with the simulations as a
visual aid in understanding complex spatial relationships. Third, videos are
being made to assist in teaching introductory level courses and these videos
will be made available to other colleges. The college will contribute an amount
equal to the award.
