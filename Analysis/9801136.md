ABSTRACT Witte

One focus of this project is the study of tessellations of homogeneous spaces.
Namely, if G/H is a non-compact, simply connected homogeneous space of a
connected Lie group G, the question is whether there is a properly discontinuous
subgroup D of G such that the orbit space D\G/H is compact. Some special cases
have been studied by L. Auslander, Y. Benoist, G. A. Margulis, R. J. Zimmer, H.
Oh, and others. If there is a compact subset C of G with CHC = G, then we say
that H is a Cartan-decomposition subgroup, and it is easy to see that G/H does
not have a tessellation. The project will use Cartan-decomposition subgroups as
a starting point in a study of tessellations of homogeneous spaces of semisimple
groups of real rank two. The other main focus of this project is generalizing
the PI's theorem that arithmetic groups of Q-rank at least two have no
interesting continuous actions on connected one-manifolds. (In algebraic terms,
the theorem asserts that no central extension of any such arithmetic group is
right orderable.) The PI conjectured that the assumption on Q-rank can be
replaced by the same assumption on the real rank, and this leads to interesting
questions about the algebraic structure of arithmetic groups. Many important
materials are crystals. The atomic structure of such a material is very
symmetric, and a first step toward understanding the physical properties of the
material is to study the group formed by all the symmetries of the structure.
This project investigates the symmetry groups that arise from crystals in
mathematical spaces other than the 3-dimensional universe we live in. A basic
problem addressed by this project is to understand which spaces do contain
crystals. Also, this project will study the structure of the symmetry group of
the crystals that do exist. For example, the PI and others have shown, in many
cases, that crystals in two different spaces cannot have the same group of
symmetries. However, it is often still not known whether the group of symmetries
can be the same as the symmetries of a one-dimensional non-rigid (and, hence,
non-crystalline) structure.
