Although genetic algorithms (GAs) have often provided solutions in situations
where there are few applicable techniques, they are not well understood and
remain primarily an art rather than a science. This work is directed at
deepening theoretical understanding of GA performance with particular emphasis
on representational issues. The representational change operators underlying the
research are directed at overcoming schemata deceptiveness. Research goals
include: 1. The development of a theory schemata analysis which encompasses
representational transformations to characterize and analyze the difficulty of
GA problems without involving Walsh transforms. 2. The derivation of theoretical
and empirical estimates of the density of representations that enable successful
genetic search of various classes of functions. 3. The development and
demonstration of guidelines for using invertible linear transformations to
induce representational changes likely to make difficult GA functional
optimization easier while not confounding already easy problems. 4. The
development and demonstration of a fast parallel algorithm which exploits
alternate problem formulations while simultaneously involving them in an
evolutionary process of directed search through a space of representations. This
work should lead to the solution of problems which previously did not yield to
the genetic paradigm, and should increase understanding of representational
issues in search.
