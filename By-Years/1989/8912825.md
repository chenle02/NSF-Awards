Helium films on sintered ceramic alumina powders will be studied using the
torsional oscillator technique to measure superfluid fraction and other
properties. Core structure of the vortices in thin films will be studied as a
function of temperature, film thickness, and helium-three impurity
concentration. A second experimental program will study third and fourth sound
propagation in helium-four contained in ceramic materials of very low porosity.
The predicted divergent index of refraction will be studied near the percolation
threshold for pores in the ceramic. The surface index of refraction will also be
studied in situations with low helium concentration in the ceramic.
