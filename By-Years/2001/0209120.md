This project will create a comprehensive test-bed facility to support research
in video database management. Real-world video applications demand database
technology that is capable of providing real-time content-based query and
retrieval for stored digital video. However, video is a complex data type that
requires a significant amount of preprocessing for content representation before
research issues in database management for real-time video data can be
addressed. This project will facilitate video database research by abstracting
video as a fundamental and fully functional database data type. Tools for video
content analysis, feature extraction and high-dimensional indexing will be
integrated into the test-bed facility, which will then be used to address
several research challenges in the management of real-time streamed video data,
including multi-feature nearest neighbor queries, feature-based query
processing, video operators, buffer management for streaming video, and
continuous video streaming with real-time constraints. The system will provide
standardized methods for integrating components and measuring their performance,
and will be furnished with a large collection of indexed videos. The underlying
database management system, video-processing tools, and video data will form a
complete environment for the video database research community, providing an
effective platform for implementation, validation and evaluation of new video
database technology.
