The principal investigator will develop and improve methods for understanding
bifurcation from invariant tori, semi-linear elliptic problems in unbounded
domains, and singularly perturbed differentiable systems. The underlying
technique is the theory of invariant manifolds. Dynamical systems encompass both
ordinary and partial differential equations, expressing a geometric approach to
the study of such equations. An understanding of invariant manifolds is
extremely critical as it gives a great deal of information about behavior of
solutions in a neighborhood of special solutions.
