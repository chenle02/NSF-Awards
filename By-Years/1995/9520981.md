ABSTRACT: NCR-9520981, Cornell University, "Information Coding Technology for
Multimedia and the Information Superhighwa", PI-Chris Heegard: This research
deals with three topic areas: trellis coding and symbolic systems, algebraic and
algebraic geometry coding and Gr=F6bner bases, and data compression theory and
applications. In the first area the research will treat the symmetries of
trellis codes, rotationally invariant trellis codes, punctured trellis codes,
and broadcast trellis coding. In the second, the work explores the algebraic
structure of codes, decoding via the key equation, and systematic encoding of
algebraic geometry codes. The last area focuses on audio data compression,
fractional octave filters, and variable length/rate compression; the overall
goal of the third area is high fidelity perceptual (transform or sub-band)
coding at lower bit rates.
