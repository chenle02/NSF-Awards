This is a request for a Liquid Scintillation Counter and a Luminometer in
support of research at the University of South Florida. The instrumentation will
be used in studies of (1) nucleolar 2'-0-methyltrnasferase, (2) regulation of
assimilatory nitrate reductase, (3) expression of protein kinase CB, and (4)
molecular mechanisms regulating HMG-CoA reductase gene expression.
