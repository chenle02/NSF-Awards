Probabilistic reasoning is now routinely used in many fields of science and
engineering, where it underlies systems that perform tasks such as text
classification, social network analysis, medical diagnosis, information
extraction, probabilistic planning, vision and robotics. This project aims to
develop an anytime and generalized probabilistic inference engine that targets a
wide range of probabilistic representations, including classical, propositional
representations --- such as Bayesian and Markov networks --- in addition to more
expressive representations based on first order logic. The project will also
investigate probabilistic queries in complexity classes that have not received
much attention in the literature, yet can be used to study the robustness of
inferences and decisions based on probabilistic reasoning systems. The targeted
inference engine is planned to put the state of the art in exact inference at
the service of approximate inference, allowing it to resign to approximations
only when exact inference yields. Moreover, the engine is planned to smoothly
and incrementally improve its approximations over time. A key emphasis of the
project is to accomplish these objectives while using the most general
probabilistic representation as an input, to allow for the widest possible
adoption of the developed inference engine. Our anticipated results will impact
many fields by allowing users to perform more accurate probabilistic inference,
on larger models and in different contexts. Through scientific articles,
research seminars, conference presentations, and graduate teaching, we expect
the obtained results to be widely disseminated so as to maximize the attained
benefits by various communities. Moreover, we plan to publicly release software
systems that embed our results, continuing with a long tradition of publicly
releasing award-winning software systems for probabilistic reasoning.
