This is a study of the extensional mechanisms in the Woodlark basin where
westward propagation of seafloor spreading is accompanied by active continental
extension in the D'Entrecasteaux islands and flanking basins immediately
landward of the propagator. A suite of deep seismic images will be constructed.
The aid of the project is to determine: (1) whether intra-continental extension
is occurring along low-angle detachment faults or normal faults, (2) whether
seismogenic faults can be correlated with faults observed in the seismic
sections, (3) the whole crustal geometry of structures that bound the core
complexed of Goodenough and Fergusson islands, and (4) whether the transition
from intra-continental extension through to continental breadup reflect an
evolution of extensional mechanisms.
