This project relates to the application of expert system theory and methodology
to electric power flow techniques. One of the focus points of the work relates
to the optimal power flow study problem. In this area, the subjects to be
considered are data preparation, bad data identification, on-line applications,
operating constraints, contingency constraints, and other issues of this large
scale optimal dispatch problem. The time window to be studied is in the range of
15 to 30 minutes for repeated optimal dispatch calculations. Expert system
methodologies as studied in this work are not expected to replace existing
software, but to be an added tool for operators.
