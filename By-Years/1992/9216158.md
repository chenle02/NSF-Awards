Markov chain Monte Carlo methods will be applied to problems in statistical
inference with particular emphasis on spatial statistics and Bayesian
computation. This project is highly interdisciplinary with target areas that
include image analysis, whether from medical imaging, remote sensing or surface
reconstruction and mapping, the analysis of data from agricultural experiments
and from geographical epidemiology. There are general mathematical and
computational implications for difficult issues such as multi-modality and
robustness in Bayesian posterior distributions. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
have a long history in statistical physics and subsequently in spatial
statistics. Now these are being applied with spectacular success to a vast range
of mainstream statistical problems that have remained numerically intractable
otherwise. This project, which is highly interdisciplinary because of the nature
of spatial data and mapping problems, focuses on the solutions to some of the
hardest problems in the analysis of data which carry spatial connotations.
