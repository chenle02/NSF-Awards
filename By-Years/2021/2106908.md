The past several years have witnessed major efforts to collect genetic data from
patients in large health systems to enable research aimed at improving patient
health. This data can potentially identify risk factors that cause disease and
improve treatment. However, the observational nature of these datasets makes
such inferences challenging due, in part, to the difficulty of differentiating
between correlation and causation which can obscure true relationships. This
project will utilize and extend recently developed techniques in causal
inference to allow for the identification of causal relationships within the
medical data and overcome this difficulty. Advancing this research is critical
for improving the outlook for individuals who suffer from todayâ€™s most prevalent
common, complex disorders and will also provide general insights into the
analysis of observational data. The project leverages efforts at UCLA to broaden
participation in computing and will incorporate graduate and undergraduate
students from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to leverage
modern techniques for causal inference coupled with the unique characteristics
of genetic data collected in Biobanks to solve three key problems in biomedicine
and epidemiology: the identification of risk factors for disease, predicting
likely responders to a potential treatment, and identifying latent disease
subtypes. The advance in causal inference that is directly relevant to our
problem is the development in theory on causal graphs as a unifying framework to
represent and reason about causal effects. We will use these graphs to test and
estimate causal relationships between relevant exposures measured in the biobank
and diseases (for example, LDL cholesterol and heart
attack).&lt;br/&gt;Crucially, we will leverage the availability of genetic data
to serve as causal anchors (or instrumental variables) that can enable the
estimation of causal effects even in the presence of confounders expanding the
technique of mendelian randomization that is widely used in
epidemiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
