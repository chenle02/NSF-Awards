The proposal deals with some new classes of codes applicable to computer and
VLSI system. New design methods for balanced codes, where each codeword contains
equal number of 1's and 0's, and low weight codes are investigated. These codes
find broad applications - reducing noise and conserving power in VLSI systems,
maintaining data integrity in write-once memories, obtaining delay insensitive
communications in asynchronous systems, data encoding in fiber optics, etc. New
classes of higher radix and binary Gray codes are also investigated. In Gray
code sequence, two consecutive codewords differ in one digit position by 1. Gray
codes find applications in wide areas - analog to digital converters, data
compression, graphics and image processing, hashing, efficient combinatorial
algorithm design, processor allocation in the hypercube, solving puzzles such as
towers of Hanoi, etc. Our goal is to find new methods for designing these codes.
Some preliminary results and the future research efforts related to these topics
are described.
