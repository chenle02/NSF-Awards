Abstract for Ytterbium Parity Nonconservation Experiment

Much of fundamental physics can be understood through considering underlying
symmetries that interactions possess. One such symmetry is that of mirror
reflection. Does a mirror reflection change the interaction, or, equivalently,
do left-handed and right-handed particles interact in the same way? Most
fundamental interactions, such as gravity, electromagnetic, and nuclear strong
interactions, are the same under mirror reflection. This symmetry allows one to
make predictions on what kind of physics processes are possible. However, there
is a fundamental interaction due to the weak force, the force responsible for
certain kinds of nuclear radioactive decay, which is not the same for left-
handed and right-handed particles. The fact that it is the only force that does
not possess mirror-reflection symmetry allows one to distinguish it from other,
stronger interactions. Our work is focused on using high-precision laser
spectroscopy techniques to study mirror-reflection symmetry of atoms. This
understanding will allow us to learn about the fundamental processes inside the
nucleus and between the nucleus and atomic electrons due to the weak
interaction. This improved knowledge will provide a stringent test of our
understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature and help to clarify
our understanding of nuclear and particle physics.
