9417097 Bernhard Dissolved oxygen is deplaced to zero within the biological zone
of most marine sediments. Benthic foraminifera (Protista: Sarcodina), the most
abundant meiofaunal group in many marine sediments, are one of few eukaryotic
taxa which successfully inhabits anoxic environments. Unfortunately, little is
known about the physiological ecology of these foraminifera. The broad objective
of this project to examine how certain foraminifera, classically defined as
aerobes, survive episodes of anoxia and to determine their behavioral response
to anoxia. Foraminiferal communities will be studies from two types of sediments
of the Southern California Basin. Studies of the physiological ecology of
benthic foraminifera inhabiting anoxic environments are significant to a variety
of disciplines, including benthic ecology, evolutionary biology, ecotoxicology,
and paleoceanography. The fossil presence of facultative anaerobic foraminifera
in geologic deposits can indicate where petroleum depostis exist, since oil
source deposits generally form during organic-enriched, anaerobic conditions.
