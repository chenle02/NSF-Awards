The study of helium-3 through electron scattering attempts to
expose&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics and its underlying forces by breaking apart one
of the&lt;br/&gt;simplest nuclei, a bound state of one neutron and two protons,
also&lt;br/&gt;known as helium-3. The lowest bound nuclei are hydrogen,
deuterium (&lt;br/&gt;a bound neutron and proton), tritium (one proton and two
neutrons) and&lt;br/&gt;then helium-3. Because deuterium has only two nucleons,
it is an odd&lt;br/&gt;nucleus and does not represent standard nuclear material
well. Tritium&lt;br/&gt;is a difficult to work with, leaving helium-3 as the
simplest nucleus&lt;br/&gt;that has sufficiently interesting dynamics that are
believed to exist in&lt;br/&gt;larger nuclei. By breaking apart these nuclei
using an electron beam,&lt;br/&gt;the nucleus can be reconstructed from data
taken and then tested against&lt;br/&gt;leading theories in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By working in two locations, the United States Naval
Academy (USNA)&lt;br/&gt;and MIT, students can be trained in the handling of the
helium-3 nuclei&lt;br/&gt;at USNA, and then later complete their education by
working at the&lt;br/&gt;MIT-Bates laboratory during the Summer months. The
BLAST&lt;br/&gt;(Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid) experiment provides
these&lt;br/&gt;students the chance to participate on a world-class experiment
while&lt;br/&gt;exposing them to new concepts and instrumentation. The
facilities to&lt;br/&gt;perform experiements of this caliber are unique and only
a handful are&lt;br/&gt;in operation around the world. The specialized features
of the&lt;br/&gt;experiment BLAST are that the electron beam and helium-3
targets are&lt;br/&gt;both polarized in a magnetic field such that new
information about the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus is revealed. One particular quantity
sought after is the&lt;br/&gt;electric moment of the neutron, dubbed G_E_n,
which describes how the&lt;br/&gt;neutron begins to appear as an electric moment
as higher and higher&lt;br/&gt;energies come to bear on the neutron. For this
purpose, the BLAST&lt;br/&gt;experiment will use both deuterium as well as
helium-3 as &lt;br/&gt;targets for the electrons to strike the neutrons held
within &lt;br/&gt;the nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
