The UNLV Physics Department will host a 10-week undergraduate research
participation project, Undergraduate Research in Physics, during the summers of
2002-2004, with followup during each academic year. Research in the department
is in the areas of atomic, molecular, chemical and optical physics, condensed
matter physics, high pressure physics, and materials science. Students will
obtain hands-on laboratory experience in our well-equipped laser laboratories,
and use major condensed-matter research facilities: the Scanning Electron
Microscope, an Electron Probe Micro Analyzer, an X-ray Photoelectron
Spectrometer, and an X- Ray Diffractometer. A series of group activities
includes seminars on an introduction to research, research ethics, giving a
scientific presentation, and getting into graduate school, as well as social
functions. Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from other
colleges and universities, with special attention paid to selected schools in
the West and Mid-West. Applicants from institutions where research opportunities
are limited will be given higher priority over those from major research
universities. The program ends by students creating a poster presenting their
research results, which they display at a special poster session that attracts a
large university-wide audience. &lt;br/&gt;
