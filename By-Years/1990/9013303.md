This award supports the research of Professor V. Klee to work in combinatorics,
optimization, and computational geometry. He intends to work on higher
dimensional computational geometry, the d-step conjecture in linear programming
and qualitative analysis of linear systems. The research falls cross lines
between the areas of combinatorics, optimization theory and computational
geometry. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to
modern communications. Optimization theory, first came to prominence in World
War II, when the theory of linear programming was used so successfully.
Computational geometry is fundamental to areas as diverse as CAD/CAM modelling
and Robotics.
