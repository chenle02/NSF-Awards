The principal investigator will continue her study of extremal functions and
extremal Sobolev inequalities in the context of problems in Fourier analysis,
nonlinear partial differential equations and spectral analysis. In the past
three years she has applied Sobolev inequalities to problems involving
prescribing the Gaussian curvature on the 2-sphere and the scalar curvature on
the n-sphere and to isospectral problems on compact manifolds. In this project
the principal investigator will study the following four problems using extremal
Sobolev inequalities: Szego's projection theorem, the logarithm determinant
formula for the conformal Laplacian on the n-sphere, further work on prescribing
curvature and the Uniformization Theorem for compact 2-manifolds.
