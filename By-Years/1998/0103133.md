This award to Ohio State University by the Chemistry Division is part of the
Nanoscale Exploratory Research in the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program.
Under this project, Jonathan Parquette will develop novel enantioselective
catalysts based on the active transition metals, such as ruthenium and copper,
incorporated in chiral dendrimers. Monodendrons up to three generations will be
prepared using aminopyridine dicarboxamide as the branching units, and chiral
nonracemic anthranilamide as the terminal units. Dendrimers with transition
metals will be evaluated for enhanced catalytic Diels-Alder and aldol
condensation reactions. In addition, the research program will provide education
and training opportunities in material chemistry to graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the award, novel enantioselective catalysts
based on the active transition metals in chiral dendrimers will be studied.
Dendrimers, with up to three generations, will be synthesized and their
conformationally based chiral changes in different solvents will be evaluated
using circular dichroism. In addition, different metals selectively placed at
the periphery of dendrimers will be evaluated for enhanced catalytic activities
for the organic synthesis of chiral materials. The research program will provide
education and training opportunities in materials chemistry to graduate and
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
