This Small Business Innovative Research SBIR Phase I project will use
statistical analysis of historical medical records to create families of
language models for each section of the traditional medical note and switch
lexicons in and out of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real time based
on the contextual position within the narrative note. Current speech recognition
methods use a single, general-purpose medical lexicon to train a recognizer when
identifying words. Medical context-specific probabilities are ignored. Because
the DocTalk engine incorporates real time integrated ASR with natural language
processing (NLP), there is an opportunity to utilize NLP contextual data to
actually change the ongoing ASR process. This innovative text structuring method
will exploit the statistical variability of language used in each section of the
medical record. It is a unique opportunity to address delay in workflow; the
largest barrier to a national electronic healthcare infrastructure, by using a
cloud-based, open source leveraged solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project includes the ability of physicians
to increase usable information, avoid third party transcription errors, and
mitigate workflow delays. The majority of workflow delay in electronic medical
records (EMR) is the need to perform manual operations to fill structured forms
within the record, as opposed to simple unstructured narratives used in
traditional written notes and transcriptions. Successful completion of this
innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR will provide the
accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data
entry system for small practice primary care physicians, and help overcome the
largest obstacle to a national electronic healthcare infrastructure.
