In this project laboratory experiments on the OH radical pertinent to three
major needs for monitoring particular trace species in the atmosphere will be
carried out. The study of polarization of laser-induced fluorescence in the A-X
electronic system of OH, and the modeling of state-to-state rotational energy
transfer in the A-state, concern detection of OH itself in the troposphere.
Transition probabilities for weak vibrational bands of the A-X system impact OH
detection as well as studies of OH kinetics for atmospheric purposes.
Collisional quenching of high rotational levels in the A-State, and the
temperature dependence of this process, govern quantum yields in the measurement
of stratospheric H2O with a Lyman-a hygrometer. HNO3 is a molecule difficult to
detect at the low levels present in the relatively clean troposphere. SRI
scientists study the nascent distribution of OH over vibrational and rotational
levels, following the photodissociation of HNO3, and the relaxation of this
distribution to a thermal one. These data are necessary for the design of a
photoframentation/laser-induced fluorescence method for nitric acid monitoring.
