ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9705678 Principal Investigator: Yeung The
objectives of this project are to study fundamental aspects of enhanced mixing
and dispersion in turbulent flows. It is widely recognized that the modeling of
molecular mixing is a problematic area in probability-density-function methods
which otherwise hold great advantages for reacting flows, and in Lagrangian
stochastic models that are used to predict pollutant dispersion in the
atmosphere. The approach is to use direct numerical simulations based on exact
transport equations to extract Lagrangian statistics of single and multiple
passive scalars (such as chemical species or contaminants) and molecular
displacements, and to compare model predictions directly with the simulation
results. The data to be examined are novel to the literature, and virtually
beyond experimental measurement. The latest advances in massively parallel
computing will be exploited to provide high-resolution simulation data over a
range of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers, which would allow a careful study of
issues of similarity scaling important to the fundamental description of scalar
transport in turbulence.
