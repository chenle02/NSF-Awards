The objective of this laboratory is to introduce laser doppler anemometry to
students taking a laser engineering course and courses in fluid dynamics. Two
laser doppler anemometer systems will be acquired, one operating in the tracker
signal processing mode, the other operating in the counter signal processing
mode. In addition, optics will be purchased to operate the anemometer in either
the forward or back scatter mode. Experiments can thus be conducted in both air
and water.
