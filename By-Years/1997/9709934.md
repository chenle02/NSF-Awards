This research investigates the processes people would like to see in their
government. Much handwringing has taken place lately, both in academic and in
popular circles, about the public's negativity toward politics. This negativity
cannot be understood without investigating attitudes toward how the government
goes about its business. The public is less upset with what the government does
than with how it does it. This part of the public mood has not been accorded
serious attention by those interested in public opinion. This project relies on
focus groups and a national survey to tap citizen attitudes toward government
processes. This project explores the extent to which people want political
institutions to give power back to the people; explains why some people have
more of a `populist` bent than others; and ascertains whether people's
dissatisfaction with how government operates has consequences in terms of their
approval of government, their support for the political system, their tendency
to comply with laws produced by the system, and their enthusiasm for various
proposals to reform political processes.
