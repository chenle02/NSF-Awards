0118536&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ocean sciences technology development project
will develop, and make available to the oceanographic community, an inexpensive
next-generation RAFOS float using a modern, energy-efficient microprocessor and
a robust operating system. The RAFOS-specific functions will be built around a
commercially available microprocessor system adapted for our application. The
technology will be made available to the community either through a bidding
process or via a vendor committed to providing service at a reasonable price.
The goal is to achieve a material cost per float of about $1200 when produced in
volume. The work addresses a need for an inexpensive float that can be deployed
in large numbers in order to properly sample the wide range of variability
inherent to ocean currents and in order to obtain statistically significant
estimates of mean flow. Work entails development of a surface mount electronics
board and operating system that will make it much easier for present and new
users to undertake a wide variety of Lagrangian studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
