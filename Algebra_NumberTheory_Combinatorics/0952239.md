This project, involving the work of Kobi Kremnizer, is devoted to the
application of methods from noncommutative algebraic geometry, to the study of
representation theory. The first aim is the study of the representation theory
of the real quantum group. The quantization of the theory of real (algebraic)
reductive groups is a new and important subject. The project proposes using
quantum D-modules to study quantum Harish-Chandra modules thus making the
classification an accessible task. The classical theory of Harish-Chandra
modules might benefit from this study of its deformations. The second aim is to
give a geometric proof of Lusztig`s conjectures concerning characters of
nonrestricted representations of reductive Lie algebras in positive
characteristic. The proof will use quantum differential operators on the quantum
flag variety at a root of unity. Lusztig`s conjectures are only proven for the
restricted case by a very computational method. The project proposes to give a
proof for the general case of these conjectures using the geometry of the
Springer resolution. The project also suggests showing the equivalence of the
category of representations of the nonrestricted quantum group at a root of
unity and the category of representations of the affine Lie algebra at the
critical level by connecting both categories to the Springer resolution. The
third aim is to give a geometric construction of the double affine Hecke algebra
and to prove a quantum version of the twisted Harish-Chandra homomorphism. This
should help study the representation theory of this algebra at a root of unity
and connect it to the representation theory of the trigonometric Cherednik
algebra in positive characteristic.

This project lies in the meeting point of representation theory, noncommutative
algebraic geometry, geometry in positive characteristic, infinite dimensional
geometry and conformal field theory. It will hopefully help clarify the close
relations between loop space geometry and noncommutative geometry that is
observed in string theory and will open new pathways for research. The methods
it offers to use should be useful in other cases as well, making noncommutative
geometry an important tool in representation theory and in algebraic geometry.
