Precipitation will be sampled on a daily basis at three sites in the marine
boundary layer of the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) as part of the Atmosphere/Ocean
Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE). Samples will be analyzed for major chemical
constituents and resulting data will be interpreted in conjunction with other
chemical and meteorological data sets generated as part of, or in collaboration
with, the program to address the following scientific objectives: 1) determine
the wet and dry deposition fluxes of major S and N species to the NAO; 2)
differentiate natural from anthropogenic sources for major S and N species as a
function of season, year and synoptic situation; 3) assess the relative
importance of particulate- versus vapor-phase scavenging by precipitation; and
4) investigate the impact of atmospheric deposition on marine productivity.
Results of this study will contribute to the development of a predictive
capability for the biogeochemical cycling of major and trace chemical species
through the NAO troposphere.
