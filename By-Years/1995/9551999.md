This project establishes a microcomputer lab that will be used primarily for
enhancing the understanding of calculus for preservice secondary math teachers
and math science majors. The lab, which is an integral component of the calculus
segments, will be used in Calculus I, II, III, IV, A, and, B with plans to
expand its use to both precalculus and in-service courses for secondary math
teachers to become familiar with the integration of technology into the math
classroom. The lab will be equipped with 21 IBM PC 486 DX/66 mhz computers
running Derive math software and Gryographic graphing software packages and
linked with Daedalus. The goal is to integrate computer technology into the math
curriculum and to allow prospective teachers to develop skills in using and
applying computer technology in a math problem-solving environment.
