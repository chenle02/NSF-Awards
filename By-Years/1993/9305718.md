9305718 Bilham This award provides one-half the funding required for the
purchase of new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that will be used in a
time-sharing mode by the Principal Investigator's research group in the
Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University
of Colorado and the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) in Boulder, Colorado.
The University of Colorado is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for this acquisition. The receivers will be used mainly in field
research projects aimed at detecting crustal motion and requiring accurate
determination of position by GPS (centimeter range over 100 kilometer baseline).
