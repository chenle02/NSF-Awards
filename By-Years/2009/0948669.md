Geminiviruses are plant pathogens that seriously threaten agricultural crops
worldwide. Obtaining new information about interactions between geminiviruses
and plants will advance our understanding of normal physiological processes in
plants, and how viruses exploit the host to induce infection. The investigators
will identify and characterize host genes involved in geminivirus pathogenesis.
Tomato golden mosaic and Cabbage leaf curl viruses produce a protein, AL2, which
interacts with a host protein, PPD2. The overriding goal of this proposal is to
therefore characterize the interaction between AL2 and PPD2 and define its role
in suppressing host defenses, which is currently unknown. This project will use
molecular, biochemical, genomic and genetic approaches to achieve this
objective. We expect to characterize the role of the AL2::PPD2 complex in
activating host defenses, and to identify host genes activated by this complex.
The broader impacts of this research include providing information leading to
the identification of networks of genes involved in host defense. This is
expected to provide a basis for new resistance strategies, based on disrupting
interactions critical for viral pathogenesis, which could translate into
developing crops resistant to geminivirus disease. This would have a direct
economic benefit to the local farmer, and will be important for decreasing the
use of harmful pesticides and increasing the food production needed to sustain a
growing human population. This project will provide training opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students, and a post-doctoral scientist, to gain
knowledge in current topics related to plant molecular virology. UTSA
demographics suggest one or more of these will be members of historically
underrepresented groups. Opportunities for collaborations with scientists in
Mexico and Central America may arise, where geminivirus diseases are devastating
to local economies, and help facilitate exchange opportunities for both faculty
and students.
