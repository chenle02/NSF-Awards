This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Elizabeth Klerman of
the Harvard Medical School to conduct collaborative research for 12 months with
Dr. K. Aihara of Tokyo Denki University, Japan. They will investigate the
significance of chaos in neural information processing by analyzing the
characteristics of artificial neural networks composed of neurons with chaotic
dynamics. The nonlinear phenomena of deterministic chaos is now recognized as
ubiquitous in fields such as feedback systems, optics, ecology and biological
systems. This project will attempt to demonstrate the effects of chaotic
fluctuations in applications of network and neurocomputing. For example, since
chaotic neurons can produce macroscopic fluctuations spontaneously, they may
provide a means of escaping from undesirable local minima in problems of
optimiza- tion, learning and self organization. Dr. Aihara's background in
mathematical modeling of chaotic neurons will complement Dr. Klerman's research
experience in the area of circadian rhythms.
