The use of neutron scattering is particularly suited for the analysis of
protein-nucleic acid complexes and membranes because of the relatively large
difference in neutron scattering between hydrogen and deuterium. This difference
makes it easy to distinguish deuterium labeled proteins from unlabeled proteins,
lipids and nucleic acids. In protein crystallography, neutrons reveal the
presence of hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms with their intricate hydrogen
bonding. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies provide information on dynamic
properties of protein structures and provide detailed description of specific
charge transfer mechanisms. The Brookhaven Neutron Scattering Facilities
provides three automatic data acquisition systems with 2D detectors for protein
crystallography, membrane diffraction and small angle scattering for the use of
biologists through the U.S. The facility also provides technical and scientific
staff for efficient running and maintenance of the facilities, as well as
provision of "biological neutron" expertise for users unfamiliar with neutron
scattering techniques.
