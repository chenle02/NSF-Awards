This award supports work on groups, algorithms and geometries. Probabilistic and
asymptotic properties of finite groups will be studied: the nature of random
elements, or of random subgroups, of a given permutation group. Some results
obtained will be applied to algorithmic questions concerning permutation groups.
The study of polynomial-time and parallel (complexity class NC) group-theoretic
algorithms will be continued. Additional new practical group-theoretic
algorithms will be obtained, in some cases based on methods developed in
polynomial-time situations. All of this work will make detailed use of the
classification and properties of finite groups. Some of these algorithms depend
on geometric methods. Other geometric projects will be continued including
investigations into the number of planes, designs, generalized quadrangles, or
other geometries, based upon special properties of their automorphism groups.
This project is in the general area of finite group theory and the computer-
aided computational aspects of this field. There is a growing interest in using
computers to answer theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is
quite useful for the development of algorithms. This project makes serious use
of both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve real problems
in group theory.
