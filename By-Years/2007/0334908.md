The University of Wyoming (UW) will maintain and operate a King Air aircraft as
a NSF national facility. UW has operated the King Air as a NSF facility since
1987. During the period of this Cooperative Agreement, pending availability of
funds, UW will also operate and maintain the Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) as part
of the King Air (KA) research aircraft system. The combined KA/WCR system will
greatly expand the scientific capability of the facility.

The KA has had considerable upgrades made to it during the period of performance
of the last Cooperative Agreement. These upgrades have been funded by NSF, NASA
and the Office of Naval Research. The facility is state-of-the art, and new
instrumentation is continually being integrated into the research platform.

A large number of upcoming NSF funded science programs will depend upon the
KA/WCR system, greatly enabling new science. The program will also have broader
impacts due to the broad participation of students from universities throughout
the country. In addition, K-12 students have been introduced to the types of
research that the aircraft enables, and this effort will be expanded during the
time period of the new Cooperative Agreement.
