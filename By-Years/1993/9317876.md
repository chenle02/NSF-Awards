9317876 9412905 Reinhold Tieleman The project will develop improved methods for
the simulation and analysis of extreme wind loads on low-rise structures and
will examine the safety factors for these structures when subject to upwind
roughness fields of random height and fetch. The work includes the following
tasks: develop turbulence simulation and turbulence augmentation techniques with
assessment of the effects on peak suctions; simultaneous measurements of
incident velocity fluctuations and surface pressures; analysis of data using
eigenvector techniques and conditional sampling; develop criteria for modeling
wind loads including extreme suctions; measure incident velocities; velocities
of vortices and surface pressures for various building shapes and flows; conduct
similar tests including abrupt changes in roughness; and test a group of
buildings including random variations of surrounding roughness and buildings.
The results from this work will help in the development of methods for
mitigating the effect of intense surface pressures fluctuations due to flow
separation and vortex generation in low-raise buildings along roof-wall
intersections. ***
