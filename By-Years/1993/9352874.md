9352874 Beatrous A technology enhanced calculus courses is being established at
two campuses of the University of Pittsburgh. The approach adopted in the
University courses is based on the Calculus &amp; Mathematica (C&amp;M) project
developed at the University of Illinois by H. Porta and J. Uhl and at Ohio State
University by W. Davis. Pilot courses using C&amp;U have been taught at the
University of Pittsburgh since the Spring of 1991. The CALC- TECH project will
facilitate large scale implementation of the C&amp;M project on the two
University campuses. This will require workshops for faculty and graduate
teaching assistants, development of materials, and evaluation.
