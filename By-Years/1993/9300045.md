9300045 Bliss Research outlined here is a continuation of a study initiated in
1991 on the barren, upland plateau on Devon Island, Canada. This research
focuses upon the interactive roles of soil development, and cryptogamic crust
and vascular plant establishment and function in the formation of polar deserts.
Research on the macroscale landscape features of crusted and non-crusted sites
will continue. This study will be expanded to include the mesoscale features of
stone nets and stripes and the role these features play in soil weathering
processes, the establishment and nitrogen fixation of cryptogamic crusts, and
the transfer of nitrogen from crusts to soils and vascular plants. The the
physiological and biomechanical adaptations of root systems to cold, nutrient-
poor, frosty disturbed soils, and the role of carbon accumulation and water
rleations of seedlings and adults will be studied as these aspects relate to the
limited role of vascular plants within vast areas of polar desert. The large
year to year variability provides clues on how this highly stressful system may
respond to longer term climate change. Better understanding the response to
climate change of extensive, but little understood polar desert systems will
contribute significantly to program goals related to the effect of global
changes in the arctic polar environment. ***
