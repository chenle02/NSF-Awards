This project involves continued research on finite element methods for
constrained and ill-posed variational problems. This includes research on a new
mixed finite element method for the equations of anisotropic elasticity
developed by the investigator and Professor Douglas Arnold of the University of
Maryland. The focus is mainly on the computational effectivness of the method
for pure traction and mixed boundary conditions. The investigator has developed
some a priori error estimates for this difficult problem and now wants to check
the effectiveness of the method on a computer for various choices of boundary
conditions. The most likely procedure that will be followed is a simplified
variational equation which reduces to a system of linear algebraic equations
with a positive definite matrix. To solve the system efficiently, a
preconditioned conjugate gradient method will be used. Another project to be
pursued involves finite element methods for the first order scalar hyperbolic
problem. The proposed research consists of continued investigations on the use
of nonconforming finite elements of order higher than one (piecewise polynomials
which are continuous at the midpoints of triangles) including the derivation of
a priori error estimates and computational verification. The ideas of this
research will also be applied to the problem of identifying unknown functional
coefficients in a parabolic system of partial differential equations. The work
on this problem is relevant to underground oil reservoir identification. This
research falls into the general area of numerical analysis and computational
mathematics. Its ultimate goal is to develop efficient computational methods to
be used in scientific problems involving spatially distributed masses, energies,
stresses and flows.
