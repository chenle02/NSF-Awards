This award will continue the successful Astronomy in Chile Educator Ambassadors
Program, with the goal of increasing awareness of U.S. observatory facilities in
Chile among the general public. The project will recruit Ambassadors from K-12
teachers, community college personnel, amateur astronomers, and planetaria.
Ambassadors will conduct a large number public outreach events and public
literacy programs, helping to connect the American public to our overseas
scientific investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will carefully select a
range of Ambassadors and provide them with training in science communication and
public outreach. The Ambassadors will then be engaged with hands-on, in-depth
experiences at three major U.S. observatories: the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Gemini Observatory, and the Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Each Ambassador will commit to
conducting at least seven outreach events following their trip to Chile.
