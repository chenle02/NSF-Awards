The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program support Martin F. Jarrold in his
continuing studies to determine the structure of medium-sized clusters using gas
phase ion mobility measurements. The speed with which a gas phase ion moves
through a buffer gas under the influence of a weak electric field depends on its
geometry. Although some information about the geometries can be deduced from the
mobilities, more than one geometry can have the same mobility. Thus, Jarrold
proposes to couple a recently-constructed high resolution apparatus with a
magnetic-bottle anion photoelectron spectrometer. Using this approach,
photoelectron spectra will be measured as a function of geometry and cluster
size for carbon, silicon, and germanium clusters of up to hundreds of atoms.
Atomic clusters are small pieces of material containing from a few to several
thousand atoms. For a variety of reasons, the physical and chemical properties
of these species are different than those of the bulk material. Examining the
properties and determining how they change as a function of cluster size has
been the object of a major research effort for the last ten years. Structure
generally controls the physical and chemical properties of any material. Thus
information about the geometric structure of atomic clusters is critical for
understanding their size-dependent properties. These studies will substantially
increase our understanding of the structure and bonding in clusters of the Group
4 (carbon, silicon and germanium) elements.
