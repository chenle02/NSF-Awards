Computer integration of design and construction activities can dramatically
increase efficiency, by eliminating duplication of data and effort, reducing
errors, decreasing design-construction time, improving scheduling, providing
better management information, etc. However, before true computer integration
can become a reality, many theoretical and practical problems must be resolved.
There are two types of integration to be considered, and two sides to the
problem. The two types of integration are: a) vertical, across the planning,
design, construction and operation phases, and b) horizontal, across disciplines
in each of the phases (e.g. in the design phase, across architectural, civil,
structural, mechanical and electrical disciplines). Two specific research
activities will be executed, one quite narrow and specific, and the other
broader. The narrower topic is concerned with the design of a database to
support integration of structural design and construction, and specifically with
the key role that connections play in this database. The broader topic,
concerned with representation and processing of facts, rules, and procedures
will be limited to clarifying basic concepts and identifying needs and
techniques. The research is expected to make the following contributions: 1) The
state of the art of design- and construction-related database design will be
advanced. 2) The state of the art of knowledge processing for integrated
software systems will be advanced. The techniques which have been developed only
in theory, or only for problems not related to construction, will be explored,
and their appropriateness for construction applications will be assessed. This
will help form a foundation for efficient development of Computer Integrated
Construction systems. 3) Closer collaboration and communication will be
developed between researchers who have similar broad interests but are in widely
different disciplines. Collaboration and communication will also be cemented
between industry and the university.
