107764&lt;br/&gt;Malin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund travel and
related expenses for a group of US chemistry researchers to participate in a
workshop on supra-molecular chemistry. The workshop will be part of the Fourth
International Chemical Congress that will take place April 16-20, 2001 in
Havana, Cuba. The Congress this year is co-sponsored by several agencies within
Cuba and by the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry, and the
International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supra-molecular workshop, organized by Dr.
John Malin and Dr. Luis Echegoyen for the American Chemical Society, will be
coordinated with Professors Luis Montero and Robert Cao, of the University of
Havana. The immediate objective is to improve communication among chemical
scientists in the Americas, with the ultimate goal of strengthening ties and
developing collaborations in the area of supra-molecular chemistry among
chemists in the hemisphere. The workshop will feature internationally renowned
scientists who will present cutting-edge results, ranging from very basic
developments to more applied topics in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
