Despite over twenty years of educational reform, student achievement in science,
along with reading comprehension, has remained a systemic problem for both
regular and at-risk student populations. As the national school reform trend
reduces time for science instruction in favor of reading across grades K-5, this
research and development project, alternatively, is focused on accelerating both
student science understanding and reading comprehension proficiency at the
primary level (grades 1-2). The project is being implemented in diverse
classrooms and addresses age-appropriate content from the areas of the physical,
earth/environmental, and life sciences. The project is following a Cluster
Randomized Trial (CRT) design with 16 experimental and 16 control schools and a
total of 256 teachers/classrooms. Both groups are using the same District-
adopted Reading/Language Arts program and are teaching the same District-adopted
Science standards that are consistent with frameworks for state and national
standards.
