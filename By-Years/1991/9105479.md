Detritus shed from a collisional orogen potentially originates from both
continental blocks involved and materials formed during the collision. This
project will apply that concept to the Ouachita-Marathon system that formed
during Paleozoic time and will attempt to characterize the sources for the thick
sedimentary units present. The sediments will be assigned to North American
sources or an inferred tectonic land (Llanoria) lying south of the north
American continent, based on chemical (REE, Cr, Ni, Hf, Ta, Zr) and isotopic
(Nd-Sr) data. Results should help understand sediment sources and dispersal
patterns as well as help define and characterized the southern inferred
continental block of this origin.
