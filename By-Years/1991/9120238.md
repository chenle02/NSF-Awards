The extraordinary resistance of bacterial spores, the diversity of sporeforming
species, and the importance (good and bad) of sporeformers to medicine, to food
processing and to agriculture were major stimuli for early research on spore
formation. Increasingly, spore formation has been seen and studied as a
primitive form of cell differentiation. The emphasis of the present conference
is regulation of expression of genes that control sporulation. The program is
designed to convey a picture of the whole process of differentiation for a
vegetative bacterium into a spore, and to relate spore formation to other post-
exponential stress responses. One session will be devoted to the related process
of vegetative cell division. The conference which will convene in Woods Hole,
Massachusetts on May 9-13, 1992, will bring together leading scientists from
around the world, and will highlight exciting recent developments. The formats
of the conference is designed to maximize interaction among participants.
