Professors Harrell and Loss will conduct research on spectral and variational
analysis in several areas originating in theoretical physics. Three of their
projects involve (i) direct and inverse spectral questions about Schroedinger
and Laplace- Beltrami operators, (ii) proofs of inequalities using the method of
competing symmetries, and (iii) continuous spectra and their gaps. The research
program is a balance between pure and applied mathematics with a twofold
purpose. First, Harrell and Loss wish to create formulae and theorems of real
use to physicists, especially those working in quantum theory and statistical
physics. Secondly, the investigation may only be distantly related to physical
calculation, but can cast light on structural questions, such as what role
symmetries and geometry play in the spectral and inverse spectral theory of
Schroedinger operators and their generalizations.
