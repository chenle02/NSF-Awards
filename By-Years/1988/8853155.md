Lightwave engineering encompasses a rapidly expanding technology which has
engendered an intense global competition in research, industrial, commercial and
military arenas. Because of its importance, a major effort to develop a
curriculum and supporting instructional laboratory was undertaken of (Phase I).
Further resources will be used to expand the laboratory and to meet the
unprecedented demand by students. Equipment will be used in several experiments
related to the following areas of the curriculum: sources, detectors, passive
media, sensors, integrated optics, holography, optical information processing,
and optical system analysis and design. Phase II will use the highly successful
methodology of Phase I. Experimental configurations will be designed,
established and tested by ten teams involving 39 seniors under the direction of
an engineering review board of faculty and engineers and scientist from
government and industry.
