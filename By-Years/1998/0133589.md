Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: An In-Kernel Runtime Execution Environment
for User-Level Programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to develop a system that
will simplify operating system code development while improving performance.
Developing operating system kernel code is difficult for three reasons. First,
the kernel is an unforgiving environment to work in, where any small bug can
result in large-scale data corruption; debugging tools for kernels are not as
flexible as their user-level counterparts and are not used often. Second, kernel
developers must write codes that takes into account many unusual conditions such
as resource contention, locks, reference counts, being interrupted or re-
entrant, and more. Third, before programmers can become proficient kernel
developers, they must read and understand large amounts of complex kernel code.
However, one major advantage to developing kernel code is that it runs very
fast; the kernel has direct access to all the system
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this research will include the
creation of a novel system that allows anyone who can write user-level code to
develop and test their code in the user level where it is easier to do so, and
then to execute that code inside the kernel to gain significant performance
benefits. This research will enable us to learn about the security and
scalability of running many kernel applications and develop methods to optimize
the performance of in-kernel applications further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
