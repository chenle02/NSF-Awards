With the steady increase of discovery of new anthropogenically generated
nanomaterials with novel properties and the increase in their use in consumer
products and manufacturing, it is critical that the public be informed of
possible impacts to their environment, lives, and health, both good and bad that
are related to nanotechnology and the use of nanomaterials. This workshop
responds to this need by bringing together stakeholders and experts from
academia, industry, the government, and non-profit consumer advocate groups to
discuss public perceptions of nanotechnology, risks and rewards of the field,
possible regulatory concerns, risk mitigation, and communication with the
public. The workshop also focuses on identifying gaps in our present knowledge
and looming challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade. Broader
impacts of the workshop include engaging in dialog a diverse group of
stakeholders that do not generally communicate with each other. Broad
dissemination is enabled by publication of conference proceedings. Conveners
have also been sensitive to diversity in terms of selecting steering committee
members and forum speakers.
