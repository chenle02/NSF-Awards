This is a two-year collaborative research project between Drs. Yanching Jean and
Wai-Yim Ching, University of Missouri, and Dr. Professor Tseng Poh-Kun, National
Taiwan University supported by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science Program. This
proposal plans to study electronic properties of high temperature
superconductors, specifically the electron momentum densities in the high
transition temperature superconductors. This project can provide critical data
for understanding the relationship between superconductivity and the electronic
states of high temperature materials. Dr. Jean is a leader in the study of low
temperature superconductivity and was the first person to report the changes in
the positron lifetime spectra. The research proposed here is one of the hottest
fields in science and is important to continuing U.S. leadership in this field.
This research is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science
Council, which provides much of the funds needed for equipment and facilities.
