This award will support a research program in the areas of Markov processes,
stochastic analysis, spatial point processes, chains with infinite memory, large
deviation theory, branching processes, and stochastic control. Work on Markov
processes will focus on processes constrained to a subset of their natural state
space, measure-valued processes related to population genetics, and models of
stochastic networks. A study of simulation and approximation methods for
stochastic differential equations will emphasize asymptotics for the error in
approximation. Work on large deviations will include both further theoretical
developments and applications to simulation and hypothesis testing. Applications
of branching processes to problems arising in fiber optic communication systems
will be explored. Theoretical development for general stochastic control
problems will include approximation methodology and existence theorems for
Markov controls and optimal singular controls. Applications of stochastic
control will focus on consumption models in the presence of mark imperfections.
This award will support a research program in the areas of Markov processes,
stochastic analysis, spatial point processes, and stochastic control. This
research falls within the area of probability theory, but is motivated and will
be applied to problems in a variety of fields: population genetics, engineering,
and finance.
