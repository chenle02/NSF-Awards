DMS-9424508 Shen The proposed research project will concentrate on the
development of asymptotics, rigorous analysis and numerical methods for the
investigation of surface wave resonance, internal waves in a density-stratified
fluid over an obstacle, biological fluid flow in elastic tubes, surface waves on
a ferromagnetic fluid, and WKB approximation without a small parameter. The
research results to be obtained will have possible applications to the following
areas: design of control devices in space science, atmospheric waves with
oscillatory tails past a mountain range, blood flow in blood vessels, and
solutions of physical problems without a parameter in nuclear engineering,
geophysics, theoretical chemistry and others.
