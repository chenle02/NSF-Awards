The Science and Mathematics Scholars Program is providing support for promising
but financially needy students pursuing degree programs in biology, chemistry,
and mathematics. A total of 52 scholarships (up to $10,000 per year) over the
four-year course of the program will be awarded to full-time students. The
College is working with the Rochester City School District, local community
colleges, and local and regional high schools to identify and recruit students
with an interest in mathematics and science. The Scholars program is increasing
educational opportunities for students, especially students from groups
traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Students are benefiting from
small class sizes and personal attention, opportunities to engage in
undergraduate research and industrial internships, faculty dedicated to
research-based educational pedagogies, and a collaborative student support
network comprised of faculty, academic, and student development personnel. This
program is building upon the established relationships with local schools,
industry, and professional STEM organizations to address the local and national
shortage of STEM workers. The strategies developed to recruit, financially
support, and nurture students to graduation are allowing Nazareth College to
institutionalize a comprehensive retention program that can be utilized beyond
the grant period and can serve as a model of best practices for other
institutions of higher education.
