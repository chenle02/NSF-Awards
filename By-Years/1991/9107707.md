This project is concerned with research on Witt rings and quadratic forms. The
principal investigator will focus on the computation of Witt kernels for
algebraic and transcendental field extensions. He will also continue his work on
the theory of semidefinite polynomials and sums of even powers in rational
function fields over a real-closed field, with particular attention to
quantitative questions on the higher pythagoras numbers of such fields. In
another direction, he will carry out further investigations on Ore extensions
over division rings, in the hope that this will shed some light on the structure
of division rings themselves. The research supported involves the theory of
quadratic forms. This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial forms of
degree two. Equivalently, it is an analysis of the types of inner products that
can define the metric geometry of an n-dimensional vector space.
