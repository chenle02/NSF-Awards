9622647 Ehrhardt This research deals with finished goods management models for
just-in-time (JIT) production. Several different formulations of the dynamic
decision making environment will be considered, eventually emphasizing the
infinite-horizon version of each model. In each case the general objectives will
be essentially the same: (a) understand how optimal policies and costs depend on
order size and schedule stability (using theoretical analysis of dynamic
programming models), (b) develop effective heuristic policies that have modest
requirements for demand information and computational effort (using theoretical
and computational studies of dynamic programming models) and (c) investigate
system behavior when demand parameters are estimated by periodically revised
statistical estimates (using discrete-event digital simulation models). This
research should result in mathematical models sufficiently developed so that
implementation tactics can be developed for facilitating the management of the
interface between a JIT manufacturing process and unpredictable external demand
for finished goods. Implementable computer software, ready for field testing,
should be in place.
