9314616 Frederick This project will develop a multi-year climatology of solar
ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface for the high latitudes of the
Southern Hemisphere, poleward of 55os, and the country of Argentina. The
spectral region of interest is 290 to 400 nm plus convolutions with action
spectra of relevance to marine biology and human health. The time period
addressed will be 1979 through at least 1992, and later as new data become
available. The approach will be based on a numerical model of solar radiation
transfer using measured absorption and scattering properties of the atmosphere
as inputs. Specifically, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer carried on the
Nimbus 7 satellite provides information on both column ozone and cloud albedos
in the near ultraviolet. Solar irradiance measurements from NSF
spectroradiometer at Ushuaia, Argentina and from the planned Argentine radiation
network will be used to evaluate and, if needed, to improve the treatment of
cloudiness developed from the satellite data. Special attention will focus on
the time period after the breakup of each year's Antarctic ozone depletion. ***
