The Several mathematical sciences associations represented (namely, American
Mathematical Society, American Statistical Association, Society for Industrial
and Applied Mathematics, and Mathematical Association of America) are devoted to
the advancement of mathematical sciences. The combined societies will promote
the programs and goals of the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)
programs by hosting a meeting of mathematical sciences department
representatives. The conference will have plenary sessions that provide
overviews of DMS programs, expectation and directions, as well as concurrent
sessions on various aspects of the DMS opportunities, such as VIGRE, FRG,
individual subdisciplinary programs, and joint solicitations with other groups
within the NSF and other federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically,
the conference will be in Arlington, Virginia, near Reagan Washington National
Airport beginning on May 9-10, 2003. We anticipate that approximately 200
interested mathematical scientists will attend this meeting. Faculty
representatives from mathematical sciences research departments and from other
institutions that will be seeking further NSF funding will be invited. In
addition, representatives from institutions of historically underrepresented
groups and minorities will be invited. The NSF/DMS e-mail list serves to
mathematics and statistics department heads will be used to disseminate
information concerning this conference. In addition, various association
publications (such as AMSTAT News and AMSTAT Online, AMS Notices, MAA Focus,
etc.) will publish articles concerning the conference. Local expense
reimbursement from this project will be afforded to eligible faculty
representatives.
