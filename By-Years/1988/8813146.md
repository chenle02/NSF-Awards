This is an evaluation of the possibility of developing semiconductor- based
photocatalysts for multielectron reductions. The hypothesis is that conduction-
band electrons produced by band-gap irradiation of semiconductor (titania)
colloids may be transmitted to catalytic molybdenum sites on the colloidal
surface. The ability of reduced monomeric (from molybdate), dimeric (from
molybdenum(V)), and trimeric (from molybdenum(VI)) forms of molybdenum to
perform multielectron reduction of substrates is investigated by product
analysis. Acetylene reduction is used as a test reaction; reductions of
dinitrogen and of carbon dioxide may also be investigated. The effect of
derivatization of the colloidal titania surface with molybdocenium dicarboxylate
on the efficiency of electron transfer is studied using flash photolysts and
luminescence techniques. Time permitting, the work will be extended to zinc
oxide and cadmium sulfide colloidal semiconductors. A successful photocatalytic
multielectron reduction system could be applied in many areas including
synthetic fuels production, fertilizer production, pollution control, polymers,
and specialty chemicals.
