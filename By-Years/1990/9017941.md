This proposal seeks to establish a Digital Design Center at North Carolina
State University to support the teaching of digital design to undergraduate
students. The cooperation of industry will be sought both to provide real design
projects and to help fund the Center. The proposal requests funds to purchase
workstations, software and XILINX logic boards as well as faculty support to
develop laboratory and course materials. Workshops and other means of
dissemination will be used to allow other institutions to replicate the Center
elsewhere.
