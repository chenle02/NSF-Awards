A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) will be a central feature of an
instrument facility being constructed for the organic laboratory course. It will
give sophomores first-hand experience with instrumentation for determination of
molecular structure that will enhance their lecture learning of structure. Much
of the utilization will involve hands-on use by students to verify product
structure and to determine structures of unknowns. This experience and the
instrument capability will enrich the pursuit of research projects of
undergraduates with individual faculty.
