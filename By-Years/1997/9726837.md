ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : 9726837 INVESTIGATOR(S) : DRISCOLL INSTITUTION: SYRACUSE
UNIVERSITY Long-term studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New
Hampshire and elsewhere in eastern North America have shown the depletion of
large quantities of calcium from base-poor soil by acid rain. Calcium is an
important nutrient of forest ecosystems. The supply of calcium controls the
acidity of soil and waters, and influences important characteristics of northern
forests and streams. This research will investigate the role of calcium in the
ecology of forests and streams. The supply of calcium to an experimental
watershed at Hubbard Brook will be enhanced by the experimental addition of a
highly-weatherable calcium-silicate mineral, wollastonite. The wollastonite will
be applied by helicopter. The added wollastonite will dissolve in approximately
seven years, replacing the calcium that has been depleted from the watershed
over the last 50 years. The wollastonite has a distinct stable isotope signature
that will enable the transport and fate of added calcium to be traced with high
sensitivity. Changes in the chemical characteristics of soil and water, the
activity of soil microbes, soil invertebrate communities, forest vegetation and
stream biota will be determined. Continued monitoring will attempt to quantify
the cause-effect relationship between the soil calcium content and the
ecological characteristics of northern forests and streams over very long time
scales (i.e. 50 yr).
