High speed computer networks support shared databases and new modes of
collaboration in several scientific areas. These capabilities have yet to be
widely applied to materials science and engineering, a large, geographically
scattered, innately multidisciplinary area of national importance. The
Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) request support for a
workshop to determine ho the materials community could best benefit from high
speed computer networks. Network capabilities and database and conferencing
technology such as dial-up video service would demonstrated in this tow day
workshop. This conference will bring together many academic and government
representatives from the numerous materials science and engineering
constituencies and from the networking technology community who are essential
for the design, development, deployment, and operation of a robust, high
performance computer network. This effort is in step with federal initiatives in
high performance computing and its plans to meet pressing needs for improved
research collaboration and productivity in the United States.***
