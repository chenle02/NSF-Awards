A general chemistry lecture and laboratory course will be developed that is more
meaningful, useful, exciting, enjoyable and relevant to today's college
students. These goals will be accomplished by introducing significant amounts of
organic and polymer chemistry, environmental and descriptive chemistry, and
lecture demonstrations. Several modern educational methodologies and
technologies involving use of computers will also be employed. The major effort
of the project will be the design, integration, collection, testing, and writing
of the materials that will comprise new texts for lecture and laboratory.
