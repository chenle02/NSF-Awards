This is an Accomplishment Based Renewal of the work Weisberg has been doing on
the seasonal response of the equatorial Atlantic (SEQUAL) to the varying winds.
Weisberg is one of the most active participants in SEQUAL. He collected good
velocity and temperature datasets and is going to continue the analysis of these
data. The overall objective is to improve the understanding of the physical
mechanisms that control the balance of momentum, mass, and heat in the upper
layers of the equatorial Atlantic.
