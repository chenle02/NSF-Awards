Mathematical Sciences: Nonlinear Geometric
Optics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0104096&lt;br/&gt;Rauch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project concerns the development and analysis of new &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic
methods to study short wavelength solutions of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear hyperbolic
partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;Short wavelength asymptotics, also
known as geometric &lt;br/&gt;optics, is one of the most penetrating and widely
&lt;br/&gt;applicable methods for analyzing partial differential
&lt;br/&gt;equations. Traditionally applied to linear problems, the
&lt;br/&gt;method has recently been employed to furnish rigorous
&lt;br/&gt;results in the nonlinear context. This project continues
&lt;br/&gt;the development of the method for treatment of nonlinear
&lt;br/&gt;problems. Special emphasis is placed on analysis of
&lt;br/&gt;solutions that model ultrashort laser pulses and on the
&lt;br/&gt;behavior of both wave trains and pulses upon crossing
&lt;br/&gt;focal points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new
mathematical tools to describe &lt;br/&gt;the propagation of waves whose form is
that of short &lt;br/&gt;pulses. The technique, called asymptotic analysis,
&lt;br/&gt;studies such pulses in the limit as the wavelength of the
&lt;br/&gt;pulse becomes shorter and shorter. In such limiting
&lt;br/&gt;situations, much can be learned about solutions of the
&lt;br/&gt;underlying equations, which express physical laws such as
&lt;br/&gt;Newton's second law for fluids or the laws of
&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetism. This project develops the technique to
&lt;br/&gt;analyze important nonlinear equations that arise in a
&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications. Special attention is given to
&lt;br/&gt;diffractive effects that occur when rays of geometric
&lt;br/&gt;optics stay close together for long times, and to the
&lt;br/&gt;effects that occur when pulses focus in a nonlinear
&lt;br/&gt;regime. Promising preliminary results show that standard
&lt;br/&gt;numerical techniques can be improved in both accuracy and
&lt;br/&gt;simplicity. The results of this project will yield
&lt;br/&gt;reliable procedures for numerical simulations of &lt;br/&gt;important
physical systems, including lasers that produce &lt;br/&gt;ultrashort
pulses.&lt;br/&gt;
