The aim of this research program is the establishment of the physical
mechanisms underlying the magnetically dominated energy- conversion processes
that drive solar-terrestrial activity. Significant progress in developing two
new computer codes for the treatment of MHD instabilities in sheared magnetic
fields has been made. This grant will extend both the physical accuracy and
solar applications of the computer experiments. It is intended to add more
realistic boundaries, dissipative and gravitational effects, and a full third
dimension. These powerful simulation instruments will be used to detail the
saturation process for flare reconnection, the final equilibrium state of a
filament and its stable magnetic-support mechanism, the efficiency of Alfven
wave heating, and the acceleration dynamics of coronal mass ejections. These
studies are motivated by the desire to understand related phenomena in the wider
universe of astrophysics, and by the need to predict their consequences in the
solar-terrestrial system.
