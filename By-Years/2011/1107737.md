The Austin Post aerial photo collection (dating from 1960-1995) contains over
100,000 images of North American valley glaciers. There is no other
comprehensive photographic archive documenting the state of glaciers in western
North America from 1960-1995 and the community no longer has access to these
photos, because they exist largely in roll-film negative form at an archive
center with no capability for scanning or printing them; this also poses a long-
term archival risk. This proposal has one overarching goal; rescue the Austin
Post aerial photo collection. This consists of high resolution photogrammetric
scanning of approximately 30% of the roll-film, metadata generation, flight-line
reconstruction, photo geolocation, and digital archival at both national archive
centers and consumer photo sharing sites. The digital forms of these photos will
be archived at several sites and there is also a great potential for a wide and
spectacular dissemination and broader impact, simply by the planned distribution
of selected pictures and what scientific message they may be conveying in an
unusual visual clear and convincing way to the broad public, including decision-
makers.
