they are increasingly threatened by parasites and disease. The news is not all
bad, however. Scientific advances as well as the growing awareness of their
place in the food chain have coalesced to produce an explosion of new
information about honeybees. Key to addressing the problems of honeybees is an
understanding of their behavior. With their rich repertoire of sensory abilities
along with an insatiable motivation to seek food, honeybees have shown a
capacity to learn that is beyond anyone's expectations. This project includes
studies of honeybee memory, taste, and perception with behavioral measures of
both free-flying foragers as well as restrained bees. The work on short-term
memory will focus on what they remember, how long they remember it, and how they
use it. The results will provide a better understanding of honeybee foraging
strategies. The work on taste will determine the range of tastes they can detect
and also will determine which are aversive. The results will provide practical
insights about honeybee flower preferences and their ability to avoid toxic or
pesticide-treated plants. The work on perception will analyze how honeybees use
visual relationships in their choices of flowers or patches of flowers. Overall
findings will expand our knowledge of honeybee foraging behavior, and specific
findings are expected to directly influence strategies for improving the health
and productivity of honeybees, the critical link in the world's food industry.
The research training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students also
is a major part of this project. The honeybee work easily captivates students'
interest, and the techniques are accessible to aspiring researchers. Additional
educational activities will include interactions with beekeepers, agricultural
specialists, science teachers, elementary school children, and the media as well
as others interested in honeybees.
