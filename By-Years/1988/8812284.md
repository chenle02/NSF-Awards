This is a minority Research Inititation (MRI) planning grant proposal. The
proposed research is psychological in nature. The influence by which the quality
of infant attachment to mothers affects subsequent development, will be studied
among low income hispanic families. Standard measurments will be administered to
children at age 15 months and again at age 27 months to ascertain aspects of
attachment to include the infant's security versus anxiety and displays of
mastery. The planning grant funds will support activities of the investigator in
the development of a competitive research proposal for submission to the MRI
research initiation component. Funds will be used to secure release time, during
which time the investigator plans to conduct a full literature survey, establish
consultative and collaborative relationships, conduct a small pilot study and
write a proposal.
