The project is designed to provide scholarships plus academic support services
and career placement support to students in mathematics and computer science at
the university who are both academically talented and financially needy.

Intellectual Merit: The University is committed to offering a high-quality,
affordable undergraduate education comparable to that of the most prestigious
liberal arts colleges in the nation and currently awards the largest number of
undergraduate mathematics degrees in the state. The overarching goal of this
project is to improve the recruitment, retention, and career placement of
mathematics and computer science students. This is being achieved through
academic support services and activities such as personal tutoring, guest
speakers, field trips, and discussion panels, and by utilizing strong ties with
regional industry partners to provide career placement opportunities. Six
faculty members are coordinating and overseeing all activities relating to the
program. Of the 51 scholarships per year, 15 are targeted toward incoming
freshmen and 22 toward upperclassmen with 14 available as incentive scholarships
for potential majors taking mathematics or computer science courses. Emphasis is
placed on increasing the number of women who major in computer science and
mathematics and on improving retention for first-generation college students.

Broader Impacts: This program is attracting more students to mathematics and
computer science by recruiting more first-year students and by encouraging other
students to consider mathematics or computer science as a first or second major.
It is keeping these same students committed to the discipline, increasing the
number of students who graduate with degrees in mathematics or computer science,
and easing the transition of these students to graduate programs or to industry.
In particular, graduation rates for women in computer science and first-
generation college students in both disciplines are being improved. Results are
being disseminated through relevant conference presentations and journal article
submissions.
