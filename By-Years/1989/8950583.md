In order to improve the quality of the Physics Advanced Instrumentation
Laboratory, San Jose State will add several important instrumentation concepts
(and the techniques necessary for implementation) such as: signal processing,
including fast Fourier transforms and digital filtering in both time and
frequency domains; data sampling and aliasing; and signal-to- noise enhancements
using multichannel averaging and auto- and cross-correlations. A laboratory
manual for these experiments will be produced. The instrumentation necessary to
introduce these laboratory improvements consists essentially of IBM PC/XT clone
computers with A/D-D/A boards installed and appropriate data analysis software.
The computerized control of instrumentation with data acquisition and analysis
is a common technique. Its addition will substantially improve the quality of
Physics undergraduate instruction at San Jose State University. The University
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
