This award will allow acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
to be used in on-going studies of the tribology of magnetic information storage
systems. In particular, the instrumentation will be used to study the thickness
and wear of the thin lubricant films which cover the hard disk media and to
follow any chemical interactions which may occur at the interface.
