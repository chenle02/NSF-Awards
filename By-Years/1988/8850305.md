This Young Scholars Project at Long Island University revolves around a course -
Techniques in Molecular Biology - which is designed to expose high school
students (11th and 12th graders) to the methodology used in Molecular Biology.
The summer commuter class will emphasize student participation in basis
experiments in Molecular Biology including isolation of chromosomal and plasmid
DNA, enzymatic modification of DNA, screening of recombinant DNA clones,
electrophoresis, microcomputer assisted analysis of data and electron microscopy
of DNA. Laboratory experiments will be supplemented with lectures and
discussions about the methodology employed, alternate techniques, data analysis,
and application of the techniques to other disciplines. The course will also
include discussions of the ethical aspects of research in Molecular Biology as
well as career opportunities and academic requirements for careers in Molecular
Biology. The class will visit other research institutions to discuss career
opportunities with members of the Personnel Department. Follow-up activities
include several after school meetings per month during the academic year to
discuss assigned research papers and lectures by faculty on their research.
