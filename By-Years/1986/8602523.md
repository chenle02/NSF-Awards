Several studies on cast product quality have indicated that fluid flow through
the tundishes influences steel cleanliness. This project is addressing this
problem with the aim of designing tundishes. The researcvh includes both
experimental (water modeling) and theoretical studies (three-dimensional Navier
Stokes equation of fluid flow), and melt cleanliness dimensional to control
composition and inclusion flotation/removal in tundishes.
