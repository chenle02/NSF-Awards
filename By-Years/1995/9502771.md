9502771 Taylor Through examining and evaluating how successful lifeline seismic
risk reduction programs evolve, this project takes a new direction in seismic
policy analysis. Previous investigations have given more attention to barriers
to seismic policy implementation. Case studies of nine successful seismic risk
reduction programs will be conducted. Data will be collected through detailed
interviews with knowledgeable parties representing pertinent internal and
external organizations. These examinations will clarify internal and external
factors related to program success. A project advisory panel will review interim
procedures and results. Project findings will be published in a monograph aimed
at two audiences: (1) policy makers who need to understand seismic risk and
decision techniques used in these programs, and (2) engineers who wish to
understand the policy making process. ***
