This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support undergraduate research on the interaction of porphyrins with DNA.
Porphyrins are the metal binding moieties which hold the iron in hemoglobin and
myoglobin and the magnesium in chlorophyll. A major goal of the project is the
direct visualization of porphyrin/DNA aggregates using the recently-developed
scanning tunneling microscope. Visible-ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescence,
circular dichroism and scanning tunneling microscopy will be used to investigate
the structures and the nature of the interactions in long-range, highly-
organized aggregates of porphyrins with DNA, using metalloporphyrins as well as
the free-base porphyrins for which such aggregates were observed previously. The
kinetics of these interactions will be investigated using a combination of
classical and relaxation techniques. In addition to providing information about
the structures, mechanism of formation and chemical reactivities of the
aggregates, the experimental results are expected to provide the basis for the
construction of reaction centers for catalysis of oxidation processes in
solution.
