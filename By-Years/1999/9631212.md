Quang Vuong University of Southern California SBR-9631212 This research will
attempt to develop a less restrictive theoretical and empirical approach to the
analysis of auctions. The research consists of three parts: nonparametric
identification in an auction model, estimation using multi-step nonparametric
indirect procedures and testing game theoretic restrictions imposed by an
auction model. The new approaches to be developed will be applied to the
analysis of the following data: eggplant auctions in Marmande, timber auctions
in Mazamet, ONF Timber auctions, CNES procurement auctions and U.S. outer
continental shelf auctions. The output of this research may allow private and
governmental groups to improve the design of future auctions.
