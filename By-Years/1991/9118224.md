Dr. Fenn will use a relatively new technique of Electrospray Mass spectrometry
to study the conformation of macromolecules. Specifically, he will: (1) obtain
experimental data on the non- covalent forces between amino acid molecules by
using tandem mass spectrometry methods to measure the energies required to
dissociate small clusters produced by ES ionization; (2) obtain experimental
information on the surface area of a protein conformer ion and to investigate
the hydrophobic and hydrophilic heterogeneity of that surface. Although emphasis
will be placed on proteins in solution, other kinds of polymers will be
considered because they may provide useful perspectives. %%% The conformation or
"tertiary structure" of protein molecules determines their biological activity
and so is a governing factor in many if not most of the chemical processes in
living systems. Consequently, it is of vital importance to understand for any
protein molecule what its active configuration is along with why and how it
comes about. A hoped-for byproduct of these studies will be some insight on
mechanisms by which solute ions are formed from charged droplets.
