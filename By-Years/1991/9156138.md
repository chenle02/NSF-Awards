The project engages students in learning through the use of writing groups, in
which small groups of students work together throughout the course to: 1)
develop their oral and written communication skills; 2) incorporate small-group
experiences into large courses; and 3) expand the students' understanding of the
nature and methods of geology. Innovative writing assignments and associated
small group activities supplement lectures in Physical and Historical Geology
courses. The writing assignments develop observational and critical-thinking
skills, introduce students to the practice of geology today, and foster
awareness of the role of geology in society. As students meet to review each
others' papers, they develop their oral and written communication skills, learn
to use technical language precisely, discuss interpretations, and evaluate
arguments. Teaching assistants, trained undergraduate geology majors, monitor
the group work, respond to and evaluate the short papers and participate in
small-group activities.
