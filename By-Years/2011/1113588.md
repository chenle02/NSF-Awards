This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the
development of a fluidic processor capable of performing complex fluidic
processes. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the utility of this device in two-
dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC), where existing valve technologies
currently severely limit the performance of 2DLC. This project seeks to
radically change the way fluids are moved, switched, processed, stored, and
detected within a fluidics system. Current state-of-the-art fluid switching
devices, such as rotary and solenoid valves, actuate in a single dimension
thereby severely limiting the fluidic calculations and permutations that can be
derived from single or even multiple concatenated devices. Furthermore, because
they are one-dimensional devices, they have problems with analyte carry over,
channel cross talk, and are generally design limited. This novel concept breaks
down the traditional design barriers that constrain the implementation of
current fluidics. To accomplish this, the concept transcends the single
dimension and embraces two- and three-dimensional fluid processing in the
context of a valve. The project will result in a random access, multi-
dimensional, multi-purpose valve platform with specific application to
metabolomics and proteomics separations.

The broader impacts of this activity include application of the device to
greatly expand research and analytical capabilities of instruments for
2-dimensional separations, food testing, drug discovery, GMO testing, and other
critical analytical and bioprocessing applications. The device addresses the
most vexing problem of interfacing of micro and macro fluidics and enables
massively parallel manipulation of fluids. The project also will train and
provide research experience for undergraduates. If successful, this project will
contribute and enable new frontiers of systems biology research aimed at driving
greater knowledge of biochemical interactions, mechanisms and biomarker
discovery.
