0227967&lt;br/&gt;Cavin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, mixed-signal
technologies have had a back seat to high-performance digital technologies. The
ITRS has in the past focused on high-speed digital, which drove technology
scaling with little thought to the research needs for mixed-signal. Mixed-signal
SoCs are being developed now at a rapid pace but with most being developed on
technologies optimized for only high performance digital. As an example, a
wireless&lt;br/&gt;LAN or cell phone depends on an efficient radio receiver
optimized for performance and cost to manufacture. With a mainstream bulk CMOS
process, these radio receivers cannot be optimized as direct conversion
receivers due to the noise and linearity issues with bulk CMOS. As a result, the
radio section must be made much more complex by adding external filtering and
many more components in the form of an IF section. A few companies have learned
to make direct conversion receivers in SiGe process, however cost is higher. So
one key question is, how can we influence research driven by the ITRS that will
not only provide technologies that are optimum for high performance digital, but
also for mixed signal? This workshop will bring together a great many experts
from both industry and academia to discuss and formulate research needs for
mixed-signal especially as relates to technologies (wafer fab processes,
packaging, test, CAD, etc.). These needs will serve to guide the research
funding efforts for both industry&lt;br/&gt;(SRC) and NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
