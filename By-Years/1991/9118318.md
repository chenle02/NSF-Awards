Previous investigation of the garnet granulite-eclogite facies transition
exposed on Holsnoy Island, southwest Norway, suggests that seismic velocity and
density increases across a sharp (<1 m thick) transition. The magnitude of the
changes are postulated to be related to compositional changes (silica depletion
and relative enrichment of Fe2O3, MgO, and CaO) caused by fluid transport during
metamorphism plus fabric development during deformation. Detailed sampling,
using paleomag drills, across the exposed reaction fronts will be carried out to
test this idea. Resultant mineralogical and chemical compositional
determinations will be compared to seismic velocity measurements at high
confining pressure in order to understand the factors controlling the variations
in velocity. Detailed petrofabric analysis of major mineral phases in eclogites
and granulites will be made with standard U-stage methods. Seismic velocity will
be calculated from the preferred orientation data and tested against velocities
determined in the laboratory at high confining pressure.
