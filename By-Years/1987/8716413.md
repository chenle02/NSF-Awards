The goal of the proposed research is to describe the molecular mechanisms of
calcium regulation of muscle contraction. The experimental approach will be to
investigate and compare the structural and functional consequences of chemical
and genetic modifications of troponin subunits and myosin light chains from
vertebrate and invertebrate muscles. The homology of troponin C (TnC) and both
classes of myosin light chains (MLCs) is a key feature for this comparison,
since we hope to identify similarities and differences in the structures and
interactions of these Ca-binding proteins which will help in understanding the
mechanism of the two regulatory systems. TnC and MLCs will be investigated using
the complementary techniques of group-specific chemical modification,
crosslinking, labeling of Ca-binding sites and hydrophobic pockets, site-
directed mutagenesis and comparative sequence analysis. Modern techniques of
preparative and analytical HPLC, gas-phase protein and peptide sequencing, and
computer-assisted structure prediction will be used for purifying and
characterizing peptides and identifying chemically modified amino acids. The
central hypothesis of the research is that comparative analyses of structurally
related but functionally distinct proteins will reveal fundamental common
mechanism as well as key specific differences which have led to functional
specialization.
