The Alexander terrane has the longest and most complete Paleozoic stratigraphy
of the Alaskan suspect terranes, with a stratigraphic and fossil record
extending back to the early Ordovician. It lies outboard of several younger
terranes and it is one of the key sections in understanding the accretionary
history of northwestern North America. Many workers believe it began its long
history in the western "Protopacific" and only arrived in the vicinity of North
America in late Mesozoic time. Faunal evidence gained from ongoing studies does
not support this view but suggests that the Alexander terrane was more closely
associated with the continent of North America than with Australia or Asia. The
faunas belong to the Old World Realm and show mainly Cordilleran Region
affinities that contrast with the affinities of faunas in eastern Australia and
China. However, the affinities are not wholly Cordilleran and there are some
Siberian aspects that need further explanation. P.I. will collect and describe
brachiopods of Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian age to see if these
also show a North American affinity or if they indicate a continuing Siberian
influence. The gaps in knowledge of Asiatic faunas are being rapidly filled by
workers in China and the USSR so that comparisons are possible once we have
collected adequate material in our own sections. The work will concentrate on
brachiopods, because these are benthic and sensitive to biogeographic factors,
but will make use of our recent work on donodonts from southeastern Alaska
because these provide the best available age control in these calcareous
sections.
