III-9321942 Wu Consultare Group Incorporated "A New Sequence Method for Low Cost
Multiple Access Communications" This project is funded under the National
Science Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program,
which is designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the
small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR
program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the
firm can do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project.
Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial
applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture
capital or other non-federal financing. This Phase II project involves research
in three areas related to new sequence generation in multiple access
applications: theoretical, practical and complementary. The theoretical research
plan consists of the generalization of the {D}-sequence minimum distance
properties, the availability of mutually orthogonal Latin squares, derivation of
sequence length with respect to {D}-set parameters, and the applicability of
general symbol matrix size. The practical research plan addresses the computer
programs to be established for simulation and evaluations of Phase I tasks. The
complementary research plan proposes the derivation and evaluation criteria of
{D}-sequence detection in interference environments, the compatibility of
sequence transmission through ATM cells, and the error coding and ciphering
problems and solutions for {D}-sequences to be used with multimedia
applications. ***
