The research objective of this award is to formulate, calibrate and solve
operating room (OR) scheduling models that can adapt to unexpected events, such
as unusually long procedures or patient ?no shows.? These models will produce
initial schedules that will facilitate flexible reactions after the surgical day
has begun, including moving procedures to different operating rooms and/or time
slots. Unfortunately, the increased flexibility of such mathematical models
comes at a cost: such models are very difficult to solve and existing techniques
are sure to fail on even small examples. Deliverables will include generalizable
insights into what aspects of OR schedules make them flexible, and a variety of
widely applicable techniques for solving these difficult problems, as well as
closely related planning problems under uncertainty arising in different
domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Healthcare costs in the US continue to rise
significantly, and surgery accounts for a large portion of these costs. If
successful, the results of this research will provide approaches for the design
of OR schedules that are adaptable and flexible in response to unexpected
events. We anticipate that there are large opportunities for optimizing surgical
procedures, resulting in significant savings. The educational impacts of this
proposal will benefit multiple groups. We will incorporate results of this
research into courses aimed at a variety of levels. Students and medical
researchers will be also trained through mentoring and their direct involvement
in the research work, including the participation of undergraduate students via
the REU program.
