This project will deploy 64 wide-band ocean-bottom seismometers and ten portable
broad-band seismic island stations in a 15-month-long investigation. The
objectives are to: locate and image the plume conduit beneath the Hawaiian
hotspot, image the roots of the Hawaiian swell over a sufficient area and with a
sufficient resolution to distinguish among competing hypotheses for plume-
lithosphere interaction, and relate the findings from the seismic imaging
experiments to geodynamical and geochemical, models for mantle
plumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
