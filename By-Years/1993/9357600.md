9357600 Pennington This is a New Young Investigator Award for research on so-
called exotic superconductors. These include organic superconductors, heavy
fermion superconductors, high temperature superconductors, and the newly
discovered fullerene or buckyball superconductors. The primary experimental
technique to be used is nuclear magnetic resonance. The experimental program
will involve collaborations for the synthesis of new doped superconductors.
Theoretical interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance signals from various
species in the superconductors is part of this project. %%% This is a New Young
