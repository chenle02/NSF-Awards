9627782 Zuckerman The proposed research lies in the general area of mathematical
physics. Previously, the investigator worked on two-dimensional quantum field
theory, clarifying various aspects of the algebraic structure in quantum
cohomology theory. The investigator plans to further pursue this, incorporating
also the more geometric aspects such as mirror manifolds and Calabi-Yau theory.
Another subproject deals with four-dimensional generalizations of quantum field
theory using double loop cocycles. Finally, the investigator intends to consider
possible links between conformal field theories and ideal hydrodynamics via the
geometry of diffeomorphism groups. Quantum field theory arises in the context of
attempting to give a unified formulation of basic forces of nature. Two-
dimensional 'conformal' formulation of this theory is relatively well-
understood, at least from a purely mathematical standpoint, and the present
proposal seeks to further study the two-dimensional model with a view towards
applying string theory to the phenomenology of elementary particles.
