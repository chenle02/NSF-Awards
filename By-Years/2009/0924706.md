This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses an
iterative design research method to investigate the technical and curricular
innovations need to maximize the algebra learning value of educational robotics.
The research objectives of this project address: 1) software tools to make core
algebra concepts accessible and useful in a robotics context; 2) activity
design; 3) curricular architecture; and 4) evaluation, including summative
evaluation of learning outcomes.

If successful, this SBIR Phase II project will lead to products enabling over a
million young people to gain confidence and conceptual grounding in algebra. The
project will help to break down the artificial and detrimental wall between
school mathematics and the tools and concepts that underlie the information
economy. Finally, this research will demonstrate advances in the structure of
learning environments, showing how rigorous learning can be more portable, more
individualized, and more interwoven with creativity and play.
