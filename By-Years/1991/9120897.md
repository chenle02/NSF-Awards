Bacteria are currently being evaluated as agents of bioremediation in improving
the environment. If bacteria bearing genes which can detoxify toxic elements in
the environment can survive in contaminated environments, these human hazardous
elements can be eliminated efficiently and economically. There is considerable
concern, however, about the fate of organisms used for the purpose. This project
focuses on identifying genes and their products which are linked to the survival
and persistence of microbial organisms. The model is soil pseudomonades in a
soil environment, since pseudomonades are currently being considered for release
in to the environment and because genetics and genetic techniques are not well
established and feasible in this organism. The work aims to identify important
traits which can be manipulated (increased, decreased or inactivated) so as to
control bacterial survival. Besides the practical applications of this work, the
knowledge of those traits needed for bacterial survival and persistence will be
of tremendous insight to bacterial ecologic systems elsewhere.
