9631151 Winicov This award supports an international collaboration with Latvia
(former USSR) to study genes/enzymes that are important in forest trees with
respect to acid rain and ozone protection. The Pis in this collaboration will
characterize genes/transcripts/enzymes for a radical detoxifying enzyme,
ascorbate peroxidase. They will use PCR, gene cloning and DNA sequencing
technologies. The work will be conducted with pine trees (pinus strobus) which
are of ecological and economical importance for Latvia. The data will be
relevant also for US forestry interests.
