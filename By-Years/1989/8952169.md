Most of our nations's graduating electrical engineering seniors have not been
challenged to integrate their knowledge obtained from a diverse range of course
work. This critical problem is addressed by a pilot project for the
establishment of a new capstone laboratory course and its associated Laboratory
for Dynamic System Integration for teachings seniors system integration
concepts. The new laboratory consists of a network of six modularized lab
stations. Each lab station consist of a SUN 3/140 workstation, a 6-axis PUMA
260-series robot arm, and CCD camera with a vision processing unit. The Ethernet
connection ties all the equipment together, to the file server and the
engineering-wide computer network as well. The objectives and salient features
of this laboratory course are: o To provide a capstone experience for
undergraduate students in electrical engineering. o To utilize the state-of-the-
art computer-controlled robotic systems with integrated vision sensors (CCD
cameras) as an instructional vehicle for educating undergraduate students in
systems integration concepts. o To provide a system facility for some
undergraduate independent projects and future course development. Since all the
equipment is commercially available, this experience can be shared with other
universities. The results of this pilot project will be reported in professional
journals.
