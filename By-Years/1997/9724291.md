9724291 DiSalvo An electron microprobe system will be acquired by Cornell
University. The instrument will perform elemental analysis on the micron length
scale for research programs in the Applied Physics, Chemistry, Geology,
Materials Science and Engineering, and Physics departments at Cornell. The
instrument will be part of an Electron and Optical Microscope facility that is
managed by the Cornell Materials Science Center, where it will be accessible to
all on-campus researchers and to researchers and students from local colleges.
The microprobe will also be part of several courses in various departments that
include its utilization for the study of materials. %%% The instrument will
impact a large number of interdisciplinary research programs and the education
and research training activities of undergraduate and graduate students. * * *
