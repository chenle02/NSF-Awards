Czochralski silicon (CZ) with high resistivity and improved dopant homogeneity
can be grown using magnetic field during crystal growth and neutron
transmutation doping (NTD). In this work, the processing and characterization of
100 mm NTD- Magnetic Czochralski (MCZ) Si is proposed for high voltage
semiconductor power devices (6000 volts). Device and material evaluation
including crystal growth, NTD, Thermal annealing, resistivity uniformity, life-
time and device characteristics will be investigated. Effect of magnetic field
and crucible on impurity concentration and uniformity of high resistivity Si
will be examined with emphasis on studies of oxygen impurities, precipitation of
oxygen and formation of donor impurities associated with it, as well as
electrically active impurities e.g. C, B and Al. Processing of 2000 Amps
thyristors and rectifiers with blocking voltages of 6000 volts will be used as
the final and ultimate test of material evaluation.
