This project involves the development of interactive visualization and data
management techniques for the exploration of very large multivariate data sets.
The approach consists of extending several multivariate data visualization
techniques currently implemented in an existing visualization tool (XmdvTool,
developed at WPI) to support hierarchical views of the data, with support for
focusing and drill-down using N-dimensional brushes. The stages of the project
are as follows: (1) identify, design, and implement algorithms for hierarchical
partitioning and/or clustering large multivariate data sets; (2) design and
implement extended versions of existing multivariate visualization techniques to
convey statistical summarizations of selected subtrees; (3) design and implement
strategies for managing and querying large, hierarchical, dynamic data sets and
efficiently computing summarizations of subtrees of the hierarchy; (4) design
and implement interactive tools to allow focus, drill-down, consolidation, and
other exploratory operations through direct and indirect manipulation; (5)
evaluate and refine the visualization, data management, and interactive
exploration tools using both real and synthetic data sets; and (6) assess system
performance in terms of functionality, usability, and limitations on data which
can be effectively explored. This project will result in the development of
techniques for the qualitative mining of multivariate data sets one or two
orders of magnitude larger than possible with existing visual exploration tools,
providing application domains such as global change studies, space science, and
decision support systems the technology to uncover trends, patterns, and
anomalies within their data sets. http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/research/XmdvTool/
