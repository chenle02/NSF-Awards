A team of faculty and students from Michigan Technological University's
Industrial Archaeology Program will make a ten-day visit to the archipelago of
Svalbard in August 2004. In coordination with students and scientists from the
Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, and
similar teams from Russia, Holland, Great Britain, and Norway, we will undertake
a research and training exercise focused on the remains of early twentieth
century coal mining operations in the Icefjord region. This initial effort will
serve as a pilot project for future collaborative undertakings in the emerging
discipline of industrial archaeology, and will be particularly crucial in
expanding the scope of this field into the industrial heritage of the Arctic.
