This integrative project trains students and postdoctoral scholars to perform
research at the forefront of an emerging interdisciplinary field of
microbiology, which seeks to describe how bacteria use large mechanical forces
to control important cellular processes such as cell growth and communication
between cells. This effort stands to revolutionize our understanding of
bacteria, a keystone of biological research and whose many capabilities underlie
agricultural and industrial productivity. Additionally, this project integrates
fundamental microbiological research into the curriculum for a new “Inside-Out”
microbiology course offered jointly to undergraduate students and New York City
prison inmates, which will break down stereotypes between these groups and
contribute to their career trajectories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central
hypothesis that this research will test is that bacteria precisely tune
mechanical forces in their cell envelope in order to actively control
subcellular physiology, using release of envelope-derived vesicles and cell
surface expansion as the two major processes to explore this mechanism. State-
of-the-art microfluidic technology will be combined with novel microscopy
methods, and molecular microbiological techniques will be used to precisely
alter the mechanical properties and forces within the bacterial envelope while
measuring the dynamics of these processes at the single-cell level.
Sophisticated biophysical modeling techniques will be employed to interpret data
and guide experiments. The results of these experiments will be directly
integrated into the novel “Inside-Out” course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
