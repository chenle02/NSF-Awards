With the funds conveyed in this award, the Biology and Chemistry Departments of
Grinnell College are purchasing a liquid scintillation spectrometer to permit
the use of radioisotopes and liquid scintillation spectrometry in the
laboratories of the Cell Biology, Microbiology, Genetics, Plant Physiology and
Biochemistry courses. Liquid scintillation spectrometry is a powerful analytical
tool for the characterization of proteins and other complex compounds of
biological interest through its ability to detect very low levels of beta
radiation. The technique has numerous applications in cellular/ molecular
biology and biochemistry--synthesis of cell products, metabolic pathways, etc.
The new instrument also will enhance significantly the ability of advanced
students in the two departments to conduct independent research in cellular
biology and biochemistry.
