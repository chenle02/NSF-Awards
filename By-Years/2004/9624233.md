9624233 Akinwande The CAREER proposal is in the area of field emission studies
on vacuum microelectronic devices. The research is concerned with scaling the
operating voltages from 100V to 10V through the use of nanostructure technology
to control the gate aperture, gate-to-emitter capacitance and emission beam
spreading thpough the addition of a focus electrode. In addition, studies will
focus on the reduction of emitter workfunction and surface conditioning to
provide current uniformity in the field emission arrays (FEAs). The achievement
of lower voltages will permit the integration of vacuum microelectronic devices
with silicon-based CMOS or MMIC technologies. Bandgap and surface engineering of
semiconductors are explored to study the physical electronics of electron
emission. The research will impact the area of flat-panel displays (FPDs) as
well as RF sources for microwave power amplifiers. The education plan is to
develop courses and a laboratory which emphasizes electronic display technology
through the study of material, devices, circuits, optics and fabrication
techniques. ***
