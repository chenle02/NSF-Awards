The conference, "Topological Data Analysis: Theory and Applications," will take
place at Macalaster College (St. Paul, MN) from June 12-16, 2017. Topological
Data Analysis (TDA) is a relatively recent and quickly-developing area of
research at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
The goal of the conference is to encourage research in TDA by faculty and
students, especially at primarily undergraduate institutions, who might not have
prior experience with TDA. As such, this conference will attract faculty,
graduate students, and advanced undergraduates from colleges and universities
across the upper Midwestern states. The conference is designed to equip
attendees with not only the theoretical framework of TDA, but also practical
computational tools, providing points of entry so that faculty and students from
diverse settings can begin research in topological data analysis and incorporate
this work into their teaching. The conference will spur new research
collaborations between institutions and across disciplines. The resulting
monograph, prepared by principal lecturer Dr. Vin de Silva, Associate Professor
of Mathematics at Pomona College, should be of interest to mathematicians,
scientists and students.

In recent years, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has attracted widespread
interest from mathematicians and scientists looking for new tools to analyze
ever increasing amounts of complex data arising from neuroscience, digital
imaging, genetics, biological aggregations, sensor networks, cancer research,
and other areas. The intellectual appeal of TDA arises from its combination of
advanced mathematics, cutting-edge algorithms, and practical applications. Yet,
despite its mathematical sophistication, TDA methodology is surprisingly
intuitive and lends itself well to research with students, even at the
undergraduate level. The principal lecturer at this conference will be Dr. Vin
de Silva who has been a key contributor to the development of TDA. Lecture
topics will include winding numbers, simplicial homology and cohomology, the
persistence algorithm, stability theorems, zigzag persistence, category theory
and generalized persistence, and Reeb cosheaves. In addition to lectures, the
conference will feature lab sessions that will offer participants hands-on
experience analyzing real data using state-of-the-art TDA software, as well as a
poster session highlighting TDA research involving students. This conference
will focus on mathematics and computation rather than statistics, and it will
emphasize research in the setting of primarily undergraduate institutions.
