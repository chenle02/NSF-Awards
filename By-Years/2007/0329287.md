The goal of this project is to develop systems that autonomously
learn&lt;br/&gt;to detect and track objects in video images. Current
approaches&lt;br/&gt;require large training datasets for which the object of
interest has&lt;br/&gt;been manually segmented by human operators. This process
is very&lt;br/&gt;laborious and time consuming, greatly limiting progress in
the&lt;br/&gt;field. This is arguably the main reason why computer vision
technology&lt;br/&gt;has not found a niche yet in every-day life applications.
In this&lt;br/&gt;project new machine learning and machine perception systems
are being&lt;br/&gt;explored that avoid the manual segmentation step. The
training input&lt;br/&gt;to these systems is a video dataset of unlabeled,
naturally moving&lt;br/&gt;faces in various background conditions. The target
output is a state&lt;br/&gt;of the art face detection system. The approach being
explored is&lt;br/&gt;based on the idea that one can develop sophisticated
object detectors&lt;br/&gt;in an unsupervised manner by biasing the training
process using an&lt;br/&gt;ensemble of low-level interest operators (motion,
color, contrast).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to provide a new
class of machine learning&lt;br/&gt;and machine perception algorithms that train
themselves by observation&lt;br/&gt;of vast image datasets. The use of large
datasets is expected to make&lt;br/&gt;a critical difference on the robustness
of the systems and to allow&lt;br/&gt;them to handle realistic every-day life
environments. Such systems&lt;br/&gt;would have significant applications in
education, security, and&lt;br/&gt;personal robots. Besides its practical
applications, this project has&lt;br/&gt;the potential for broad scientific
implications in machine learning,&lt;br/&gt;machine perception, and
developmental psychology.&lt;br/&gt;
