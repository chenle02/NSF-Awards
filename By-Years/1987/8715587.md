This research program will make use of the recently developed femtosecond lasers
and optical techniques to study the ultrafast processes in optical materials
that have device implications. The objectives are: (1) To measure the intraband
relaxation rates of nonequilibrium carriers in compound semiconductors using
femtosecond optical correlation spectroscopy, (2) To make a similar study of the
relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in multiple quantum well and superlattice
structures, (3) To determine the relaxation dynamics of dye molecules that might
be suitable for use in femtosecond dye lasers, (4) To extend the wavelenght
range of femtosecond optical correlation spectroscopy by including the hot
luminescence in the measurements.
