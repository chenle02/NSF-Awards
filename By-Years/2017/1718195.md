The goal of this project is to devise an efficient framework for achieving radio
frequency (RF) spectrum awareness through generating reliable and dynamic radio
environment maps (REMs). This is a notable step towards the proliferation of
realistic cognitive radio networks (CRNs), which enable spectrum sharing to
alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity. This efficient use of spectrum
empowers ever-increasing applications and services with a great impact on
national health, welfare, public safety, and economic growth. In addition, the
developed data analysis tools provide a distinctive solution to high-dimensional
signal sampling and processing, enabling further development in a wide range of
applications, such as big data, Internet of Things, and wireless sensor
networks, which can promote social and economic progress. This project
integrates research and education through new course development and revisions,
and involving underrepresented minorities, graduate, and undergraduate students
in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research bridges the gap between the
theoretical research in tensor data analysis and wireless communications and
networking to facilitate spectrum awareness. The investigators will develop a
tensor-based framework to generate dynamic and reliable REMs that include RF
signal power distribution over space, time and frequency. Tensor-based analysis
facilitates the integration of the inherent properties and data structures that
exist in CRNs as well as the prior knowledge of the behavior of the primary
network. Bayesian and structure-based tensor decomposition is investigated, for
which existence and uniqueness conditions are studied. The outcome of the
decomposition is employed to obtain a model-based interpolation of sensor
readings and to generate the REM. Corresponding to an REM, a reliability map
will be created and utilized for optimal joint spectrum sensor and channel
selection.
