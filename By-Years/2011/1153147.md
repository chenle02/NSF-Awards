With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor
Victoria DeRose of the University of Oregon for collaborative studies with
Professor Michael Haley to develop and use Pt(II) reagents for RNA-crosslinking
to aid in the determination of RNA tertiary structure. The researchers will
employ a combination of transition metal complex synthesis, RNA adduction
studies, and more global, chemically directed RNA-tagging. Elements of post-
adduction, second-stage tagging are also envisioned. A combination of chemical,
molecular biological and spectroscopic techniques will be used to tease out
tertiary structural information from the tagged RNAs generated through this
chemical biology approach.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this approach
may grow into a more broadly applicable chemical biology tool for the field of
nucleic acid structural biology, a potentially important scientific broader
impact. The project also offers the opportunity for co-mentorship of students,
under both a synthetic inorganic/organic chemist and an RNA chemical biologist
with a strong record in metal-nucleic acid interactions and spectroscopy. The
educational broader impacts also comprise a notable undergraduate research
component and continued efforts to expose women and members of traditionally
underrepresented groups to modern research science.
