AST-9619552 Probing with Radio Pulsars. Dr. Wolszczan will continue his research
using radio pulsars as probes to study extrasolar planetary systems,
relativistic gravitation, galactic populations of neutron stars, and the physics
of neutron star interiors. Most of the observational data will be collected with
the two specialized pulsar receivers constructed at Penn State University and
mounted on radio telescopes at Arecibo, Puerto Rico and Torun, Poland. ========
