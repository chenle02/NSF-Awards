This three-year award supports U.S.- Western European collaboration in logic
programming. The investigators are Evan Tick, University of Oregon, Andrew King,
University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, Peter Van Roy, Max Planck
Society, and Manual Hermenegildo, Technical University of Madrid. They propose
research on three topics in the analysis and implementation of concurrent logic
programming: design of common intermediate language for high-level concurrent
language compilers; design of partitioning algorithms for high-level concurrent
languages; and design of execution models for concurrent logic languages.
Practical engineering solutions to problems in compilation, optimization, and
runtime execution will be emphasized. The U.S. and European investigators bring
to this collaboration complementary expertise in the implementation of logic
programming languages. The project takes advantage of European resources and
investment in studies on techniques for abstract interpretation and its
application to problems of parallel execution of logic programming. Their
collaboration will advance understanding of the application of logic programming
to parallel programming.
