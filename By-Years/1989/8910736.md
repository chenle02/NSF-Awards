The "Conference of Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Virus" will be held at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratories Sept 25-28, 1989. Two hundred senior scientists,
postdoctoral fellows and students from the U.S., Europe and Asia are expected to
attend. This annual meeting on this unique DNA virus which has aspects related
to RNA viruses has served the community well in bringing together scientists at
different stages in their careers for interaction and communication.
