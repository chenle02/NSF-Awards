9419165 Miller This award by the Advanced Materials Programs in the Divisions of
Chemistry and Materials Research provides partial participant support for the
Fourth International Conference on Molecule-based Magnets to be held in Salt
Lake City, Utah, October 16-21, 1994. This conference will facilitate
communication and development of new ideas in the highly interdisciplinary area
of molecular magnetism. Up to 150 chemists, physicists and materials scientists
from academia, industry and Federal agencies will be represented. Participation
will be international in scope. The proceedings of the conference will be
published. Molecule/polymer-based magnets are a new class of materials of wide
technological application. This conference will provide a forum for experts to
describe recent results and provide a mechanism for students and faculty new to
the research area to learn from world-class experts.
