This award will help support a workshop at the Georgia Institute of Technology
in January 2008 whose objective is to dramatically alter the landscape of
quantitative viral modeling. Scientists will discuss and develop new theoretical
and computational tools to bridge multiple spatiotemporal scales in the study of
viral dynamics from phage to human pathogens. The intersection of disease
ecology and evolution is an emerging field of study, one that until now has
occurred in mostly seperate realms. Appreciation has been growing that
ecological dynamics can be strongly influenced by viral evolution occurring on
the same time scale. A better understanding of viral ecology and evolution may
lead to better understanding and control of infectious diseases. The specific
biological topic areas of interest include: (i) within-host models of viral
dynamics; (ii) constraints of viral exploitation; (iii) immunoepidemiology; (iv)
viral inferences via (meta)genomics; (v) ecology and evolution of
bacteriophages; and (vi) multi-scale perspectives: from models to data. Invited
speakers represent leaders in the fields of experimental biology, mathematical
biology, computer science, physics, and mathematics-most of whom have a long
track record of viral research. Also participating in the workshop will be
junior scientists so as to ensure the visibility of new views and to facilitate
the training of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.
