Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a proof-of- concept experiment is
to be conducted. The concept is that unexpected phenomena can occur under
certain conditions in the interaction between a body and a vortex convected from
upstream past that body. In particular, it has been predicted theoretically that
a vortex may become trapped briefly near the body by large transient forces
induced in the interaction. An experimental search is planned for such trapping,
for the case of a cylindrical obstacle. Verification of the physical reality of
the predictions would open a variety of opportunities for flow control.
