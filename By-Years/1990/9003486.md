This project will develop a series of numerical simulations to determine the
influence of basement topography and an uneven sedimemt layer on off-axis,
hydrothermal circulation through oceanic seciments and crust in a variety of
settings. The investigators will cast the general problem in curvilinear
coordinates and use the intergrated finite difference approach to problems of
coupled heat and fluid flow. They will establish the relative importance of
bathymetric amplitude and wavelength, crustal permeability structure, sediment
thickness and uniformity, background heat flow, and the presence of
discontinuous, impermeable sediment layers in determining the depth, geometry,
and intensity of fluid fluxes away from the ridge axis.
