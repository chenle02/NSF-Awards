Numerous optical systems for optical processing and optical memories and other
widespread applications such as optical neural networks, optical communications,
pattern recognition, laser printing and scanning, and visual displays, have been
designed, but require and presently lack high-performance, easily usable
addressable arrays of light sources. We propose to fulfill this need by
constructing arrays of individually electronically addressable vertical-cavity
surface-emitting laser. Their implementation into such systems will
straightforwardly simplify such systems and dramatically improve performance
compare to alternative input light sources based on spatial light modulators or
fixed-mask inputs. For optical processing systems such as those mentioned above,
simplification occurs through elimination of many unnecessary optical
components. Higher speed, more versatility and greater tolerance to varying
device characteristics are the main forms of improved performance. Optical
memories like compact disk or optical type would increase their speeds many-fold
by reading, for example, 64 bits at a time rather than only one. VCSEL's are
fundamentally much better suited for these applications than the more mature
edge-emitting diode laser technology, mainly because they emit circular, low-
divergence beams, and they can be fabricated in arbitrary one- or two-
dimensional patterns. The utility for such general-purpose arrays (e.g. linear
1x64) is likely to range far beyond what we can presently imagine.
