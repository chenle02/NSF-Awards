This proposed project addresses a very important educational issue and a major
NSF concern (minorities in the science and mathematics pipeline). The topic of
non-traditional paths to science and mathematics doctorates needs to be studied
systematically, and the proposed project represents a good first step in that
direction. The national data base analysis and interviews with minority
doctorate recipients should be illuminating. Ideally, they will spawn hypotheses
that will serve as the foundation for more non-doctoral minority personnel who
work in science/mathematics areas in corporations or the military also have
potential to yield some important findings.//
