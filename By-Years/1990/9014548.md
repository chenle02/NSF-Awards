The aim of this project is to increase the relatively low usage of computers in
the entire range of upper level courses taken by physics undergraduates at
schools across the nation and abroad. A group of 27 physicists will be assembled
to write and test computer software and associated texts for use in nine
advanced undergraduate physics courses. The 27 physicists will work in teams of
three, one for each course, at their own institutions. The software is intended
for use by students as homework assignments and special projects, and also by
instructors during in-class demonstrations. It will be disseminated in the form
of a series of text modules and accompanying diskettes to be published by a
commercial or university publisher.
