This award is Career Advancement Award in the Organic Dynamics Program of the
Chemistry Division. With these funds, Dr. Loraine Deck of the University of New
Mexico will synthesize haloenol lactones, potential inhibitors of pancreatic
cholesterol esterase, which are expected to bind covalently to the active site
and cause permament inactivation of the enzyme. Bioassays will be conducted to
verify the expected inhibition. The understanding of intermolecular interactions
in biochemical processes is necessary before any clinical utility based upon
them can rationally be developed. This work will study ways to understand,
predict, and control enzyme-inhibitor interaction of a series of potential
inhibitors of activity of a particular enzyme.
