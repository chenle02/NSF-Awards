The investigator and his colleagues are going to study operations on deformation
&lt;br/&gt;complexes of various algebraic structures: in particular, operations
on Hochschild &lt;br/&gt;cochains and chains of an associative algebra, and the
deformation complex of &lt;br/&gt;d-algebras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
knowledge of operations on Hochschild (co) chains should be useful for
&lt;br/&gt;Index theory on a (degenerate) Poisson manifold, which is of great
importance &lt;br/&gt;for Poisson geometry. Also, the investigator is trying to
find a general simple &lt;br/&gt;construction of an operad acting on a
deformation complex of a general algebraic &lt;br/&gt;structure. This can be
helpful in studying deformations of such objects as &lt;br/&gt;Hopf algebras.
