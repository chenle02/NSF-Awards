This proposal is a request to explore the use of electrospray mass
spectrometry&lt;br/&gt;(ES/MS/MS) to the analysis of polar ice cores. This
technique is capable of rapid,&lt;br/&gt;sensitive detection and speciation of a
wide range of organic and inorganic analytes in&lt;br/&gt;aqueous solution. The
technique has the potential to 1) expand ice core analysis to a&lt;br/&gt;wide
range of ionic and polar organic analytes, which can potentially provide new
tracers&lt;br/&gt;for air mass origin, atmospheric reactivity, and
biogeochemical activity, and 2) greatly&lt;br/&gt;improve the speed,
sensitivity, and accuracy of existing analyses of major and minor
ions.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this effort is to identify new chemicals in
ice cores that are sensitive&lt;br/&gt;to environmental change, such as products
of biomass burning, soil types, and marine&lt;br/&gt;organics. The ES/MS/MS
instrument will be housed in the Department of Earth System&lt;br/&gt;Science.
It will be utilized in research, in graduate education, and in
undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education as part of the Earth and Environmental
Sciences program.&lt;br/&gt;
