9405242 Slominski Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor of the
biologically active neuropeptides adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), endorphins,
melanotropins (MSH) and lipotropins (LPH). Although the gene coding for POMC is
transcribed predominantly in the pituitary gland, its expression has also been
detected in the central nervous system and in a variety of peripheral tissues
including skin. The PI, therefore, hypothesizes that local (cutaneous)
production of POMC peptides is a part of a system involved in the regulation of
physiological responses of the skin. The main objective of the current research
is to identify cutaneous cells expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC), to
correlate POMC expression and processing with the cyclic activity of hair
follicles, to test whether corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and
glucocorticoids regulate production of POMC peptides and to detect and
characterize CRH receptors. To realize this goal, molecular, biochemical,
immunocytochenical and cell biology techniques will be utilized. The realization
of the project will support the concept that peripheral POMC activity may be an
integral part of the biological clock regulating cyclic activity of hair
follicles and periodic changes of skin physiology. It is already accepted that
residential cells of the skin respond phenotypically to ACTH and MSH, that there
is a skin associated immune system and the beta-endorphin, MSH and ACTH can act
as immunomodulators. Therefore, it appears that local production of POMC
peptides may be a part of signals regulating physiological responses of the
skin. ***
