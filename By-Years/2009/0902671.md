Although pronouns, proper names and definite descriptions are some of the most
basic of linguistic expressions, it is only in the last thirty years that the
rules that govern their behavior have been described in formal detail. For
example, in "He likes the director's mother" the pronoun "he" and the
description "the director" cannot refer to the same individual (Condition C);
but no such constraint holds in "His mother likes the director". While
sophisticated rules have been developed in recent linguistics to describe these
constraints, their very existence has never been satisfactorily explained. The
present project seeks to develop a novel account in which these constraints are
the by-product of the very procedure by which meaning is computed. The basic
observation is that a general principle of economy prohibits definite
descriptions from containing more material than is necessary to single out their
intended referent - which explains why it is odd to speak of "John's blond
father", since "blond" is semantically idle (since one generally has but one
father). In simple cases, this economy principle relates a description to its
extra-linguistic context. It is suggested, however, that meaning is computed by
literally extending the extra-linguistic context with the denotation of the
pronouns, proper names and descriptions that are found within a sentence. When
the same economy principle is applied to this extended context, the classical
examples of the constraints (especially Condition C) can be explained, as well
as some new data that had not hitherto been described. The project will thus add
to the depth of existing theories and offer a more fine-grained description of
the relevant facts, which will be studied by comparing data from English and
from Romance and Slavic languages.
