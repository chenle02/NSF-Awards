Dr. Lowen is working under this postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins
University with Professors Stuart W. Leslie and Robert Kargon on "Postwar
Funders of Academic Science and Engineering: The Relationship between the
Federal Government, Industry, Universities and Developments in Science and
Technology." As part of the training component of this postdoctoral fellowship,
Dr. Lowen will study the development of technologically-oriented regions,
focussing on the interaction between universities,local and state
governments,and industry. For the research component of this fellowship, she
will extend her previous work on the relationship between academic science and
engineering and government funding agencies, particularly the Office of Naval
Research and the Atomic Energy Committee. Her dissertation study on "Defense,
Industry and the University: The Origins of the Relationship and its Impact on
Academia, 1938-64," focussed on the academic side of this relationship. With
this fellowship, she will concentrate on using the wealth of governmental
sources available in the Washington, D. C. area to examine the government
viewpoint of these developments. These studies promise to greatly enhance our
understanding of the intricate and critically important relationships among
science and technology, universities, and governmental and industrial research
sponsors.
