9711899 Papadimitrakopoulos A symposium, co-supported by the
Electronic/Photonic Materials and Solid State Chemistry programs, will be held
April 13-15, 1997 on Organic Materials and Devices for Display Technology
covering the synthesis, processing, and characterization of organic, polymeric,
and liquid crystalline materials. The symposium is being held to focus on recent
progress in a research area rapidly evolving toward achievement of better
understanding and practical device realization. Organic photonic materials have
significant projected advantages in reduced cost and large area display
capability, for a variety of communication and display device applications. NSF
funds will be used to support participation by graduate students and young
faculty. There will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties
between universities, research institutions, and industry. It is expected that
top scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an
effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in this
rapidly developing research area. %%% An evaluation of the progress and status
of Organic Materials and Devices for Displays and related materials processing
and characterization issues, especially critical materials research areas of
materials processing, and the relationship of materials research to device
fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments in
this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization
of organic and polymeric materials in the field of electronics and photonics.
