The research is to study the implementation of design methodologies used for an
innovative material handling process to be built by a forest products company.
It is an opportunity to interact with an actual industrial design process as it
occurs in industry, and to document that process. Design criteria include
quality, cost, and functional requirements. New design tools are being used in
this process. Tools used in the design process include, among others, a new
approach under development by the principal investigator called "Design for
Fragmented Groups." Development of more accurate, tested quality and cost
models, especially at the preliminary or conceptual design stages, is essential
to support effective concurrent design.
