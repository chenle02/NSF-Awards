The project involves research on conditional moments of random fields, random
matrices, noncommutative probability, and large deviations. The PI will explore
connections between classical and free probability from several inter-related
angles. To reconcile the classical and free central limit theorems, he will
study a noncommutative central limit theorem that was suggested by examples in
his previous work. He will study similarities between the exponential families
of statistics and the Cauchy-Stieltjes kernel families as a way to relate the
normal, binomial, gamma and Poisson laws to their counterparts in free
probability. He will investigate matrix ensembles that share similarities with
such laws, and may lead to new matrix models for the corresponding free
probability laws. The PI will use the orthogonality measures of the Askey-Wilson
polynomials as a replacement for the above mentioned classical laws to construct
Markov processes with linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances on
an interval. He will also analyze large deviations of Markov chains that
describe the behavior of geometric quantities like the number of vertexes of
prescribed degree as they vary during the evolution of a random tree.

This research originated from the study of random processes that have linear
regressions and quadratic conditional variances. These processes model phenomena
that evolve at random when the initial and final endpoints are given by
following a straight line on average. The randomness occurs as deviations from
that line with variance that is a quadratic function of the endpoints. Such
processes, not surprisingly, turn out to be Markov; but surprisingly they
exhibit intimate connections to noncommutative probability, and in particular to
free probability that usually arises as approximation to spectra of large random
matrices. Thus the PI will also investigate random matrices, quadratic
regression problems, and the centrial limit theorem in a noncommutative setting.
A separate topic to be investigated are rare phenomena arising in random tree
models that evolve in time. Random trees serve as models in biology, psychology,
and computer science. Rare events of interest consist of unusually large
deviations from the equilibrium, and they model a rare but influential behavior
of the system.
