The National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and
the Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of Post-secondary
Education, entered into an agreement to jointly fund Leadership Opportunities in
Science and the Humanities Education. The nature of this agreement is described
in detail in a Memorandum of Understanding among the three agencies, and
includes the provision that NSF transfer its share of the cost, $600,000 to NEH
"within 60 calendar days of the date of the last signature to this agreement"
through an interagency transfer. Dr. Luther Williams, AD/EHR/NSF, was the last
signature to the agreement on December 5, 1992. This award reflects the
authorization to make such a transfer.
