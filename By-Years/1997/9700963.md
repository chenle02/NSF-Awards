This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the decomposition reaction of methanol on platinum electrode
surfaces and on modified platinum electrode surfaces. Professor Wieckowski and
his students at the University of Illinois at Urbana will use electrochemical
methods combined with core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy, x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and a new radiochemical method to characterize the
reaction mechanisms associated with these reactions. The goal of this work is to
understand, and thereby prevent, those reactions that foul the electrode surface
during methanol decomposition so that these sytsems can be used as practical
fuel cells. This work has enormous technological potential. Studies of the
decomposition reaction of the simplest alcohol, methanol, on platinum and
modified platinum electrodes will be studied in this work. Over time, this
reaction fouls the electrode and the reaction ceases to occur. This prevents use
of methanol, an inexpensive source of energy, in fuel cells that could otherwise
be used in many practical applications.
