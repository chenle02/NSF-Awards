Center for Research Inc &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This community resource
project builds on the CiteSeer project that provides access to over 700,000
academic articles in computer science with search methods that access
authorship, citations, and other structural aspects of the articles. CiteSeer is
currently freely available to the public for use, getting over one million hits
per day. This project will support a Next Generation CiteSeer that will address
performance and reliability in the existing system and support research and
education in the national research community interested in search, citation
studies, user studies, and related areas. Specific strategies for the project
include increased server capacity, redesigning CiteSeer software, developing a
Web Services architecture, expanding the collection, learning from user and
search patterns, supporting collaborative usage, evaluation, and addressing
sustainability. In broader impacts, this community resource will provide a
realistic scale model for researchers and students across the nation to use in
research and education. The project will also improve CiteSeer's core
capabilities for use in bibliographic tasks in research.&lt;br/&gt;
