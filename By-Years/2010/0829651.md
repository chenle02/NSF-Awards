This CPATH Community Building project develops a unique computing education
community within the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Faculty
members from small, teaching-oriented institutions plan to work collaboratively
to build The Northwest Distributed Computer Science Department (NW-DSCD).
Computing educators plan to share knowledge, resources, and expertise to
transform computing education across the region. The NW-DISC creates a means of
enabling and fostering innovative educational change, sharing knowledge and
resources as innovation takes place, enabling heightened outreach to K-12
schools, integrating computational thinking into a variety of disciplines, and
providing a platform for evaluating new educational strategies. The goal is to
change the face of computing education in the Pacific Northwest.

The intellectual merit of the project lies in the strong project team and the
commitment of the institutions in the region to the important goals of the
project. The NW-DCSD offers a means to turn institution-specific successes into
regional innovations. The project has the potential for national impact and to
provide new models for computing education of the future.

The broader impacts of the project include the development of a distributed
educational community to share resources such as new courses and curricula. The
community is to be increased significantly each year, thus widening the impact
and opening new innovative computing pathways to a diverse student population in
a range of academic disciplines.
