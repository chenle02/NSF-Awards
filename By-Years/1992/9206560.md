The island of Taiwan is undergoing active deformation and uplift as a result of
subduction of the Philippine Sea plate under the Eurasian plate, and provides a
natural laboratory to study the kinematics of collision. This project will focus
on the kinematic history of the hinterland region of central Taiwan, taking
advantage of the southward propagation of the arc-continent collision to proxy
sequential development of deformation features. A variety of strain and
kinematic indicators will be studied and the results will be applied to several
major hypotheses of collision tectonics including whether the hinterland is
shortening with a consistent transport direction or involves two oppositely
verging transport directions and the relative importance of tectonic denudation
and erosion during unroofing of the hinterland.
