In recent years there is a very intensive research activity in areas of
Mathematics related to the so called Grothendieck's anabelian program, where
some of the outstanding open problems are the section conjecture and its
implications in arithmetic geometry, the description of the Galois structure of
number fields via the arithmetic action on (geometric) fundamental groups, and
the profinite Teichmueller theory and its relation to Arithmetic and Number
Theory. Naturally, one of the major effort in this area of mathematics is to
understand the bigger picture of Grothendieck's anabelian program in the context
of Algebra and Number Theory. The half year long NAG Programme at the Isaac
Newton Institute in Cambridge, UK, in July-December 2009, was dedicated to this
circle of questions and turned out to be a very successful activity.

Through the present conference funding Proposal, the PI facilitates the
participation of American scientists (grad students and junior/senior
researchers) to a two part mathematical research activity in Kyoto, Japan,
during October 20-30, 2010, which could be viewed as a continuation of the NAG
Programme. The wide majority of the participants to the Kyoto activity come from
Europe and Japan. The first part of the activity is of introductory nature and
will host several talks and special activities for graduate students and young
researchers, thus enhancing training and technological understanding, whereas
the second part of the activity will do both: First, present of wide picture of
the state of the art of Grothendieck's anabelian program through a series of
survey talks by world leading experts in respective related areas of research.
Second, give junior and senior scientists the opportunity to present their
newest findings and ideas in this area of research. Thus the activity will
contribute to creating a broad basis for international cooperation, training,
and scientific exchange at all levels. The outcomes of the activity will be
disseminated to the mathematical community via the Internet and a proceedings
volume to be published by the Mathematical Society of Japan.
