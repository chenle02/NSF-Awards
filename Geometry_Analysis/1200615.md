This award provides support for participants in a workshop on Geometric Analysis
on Euclidean and Homogeneous Spaces at Tufts University, January 8-9, 2012. The
workshop will encompass the related fields of integral geometry, harmonic
analysis, differential geometry, representation theory, microlocal analysis and
partial differential equations. These subjects find applications in areas as
diverse as inverse problems, tomography, and signal and data analysis, all of
which will be represented at the workshop. The workshop will be organized so
that researchers and graduate students in the different fields will have ample
opportunities to interact with the hope of developing collaborations. This range
of fields is not typically represented together at workshops, and cross-
fertilization between these fields is an important goal of the workshop. The
workshop is preceded by the annual Joint Mathematics Meeting in Boston and uses
the momentum of this national event to bring together well-known experts, young
researchers, and graduate students. Women, graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and young faculty will have the highest priority for support. The PIs
plan to disseminate the research through proceedings that will include works by
researchers from both the special session and the workshop.

The interface between the topics of this conference has lead to fruitful
research and applications to medicine, industry, and science in the past. This
meeting will provide the opportunity to push this positive development forward
by bringing together, engaging, and motivating graduate students and young
emerging researchers as well as more established experts. In particular graduate
students are involved in the workshop through participation in a poster session.
This allows the students to present their work and interact with each other and
established experts in an informal setting. Supporting a diverse group of
graduate students and beginning researchers is the highest funding priority.
