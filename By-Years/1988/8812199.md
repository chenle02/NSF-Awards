What does cognitive science have to tell us about the role of evidence and
argumentation in science? Over the past twenty or more years, cognitive science
has been analyzing belief and persuasion. Dr. Margolis has taken what he has
learned in cognitive science and applied it to an analysis of belief change --
i.e. "scientific revolutions" -- in science. He is specifically applying his
understanding of cognitive science to the paradigm case of change in belief in
science: the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Such analyses of these well-studied areas promise to have important and
provocative implications for history and philosophy of science as well as for
cognitive science. Under this grant, Dr. Margolis will examine three different
aspects of the Scientific Revolution: 1) how persuasive was the status of the
Copernican argument as it stood in 1633; 2) why astronomers were unlikely to
accept the authority of non- astronomers on cosmology; and 3) how other kinds of
evidence such as the discovery of America affected arguments for Copernicanism.
These points go directly to the level of evidence needed for scientists to
become persuaded of the accuracy of a new theory. According to Dr. Margolis,
this level of evidence is much less than we have earlier supposed. If his
research bears out his theory, our understanding of the processes of persuasion,
using both qualitative and quantitative evidence, and theory change in science
should be greatly improved.
