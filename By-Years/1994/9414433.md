This Research Collections project will address the difficult job of assisting
and facilitating the salvage and preservation of a valuable Russian collection
of natural sounds. These irreplaceable recordings currently exist on archaic and
rapidly degrading media and reside in a physical facility that dose little to
augment their state of preservation and availability for use by other
scientists. The project is a first-class collaboration between the Library of
Natural Sounds (LNS) at Cornell University and Russian Phonoteka of Animal
Voices, (PAV). Original recordings will be transcribed to more modern media with
duplicate recordings being made and housed at different sites. Through the LNS,
availability to other user scientists will be greatly enhanced and the latest
technologies for natural sound preservation will be employed. Collections such
as these will continue to increase in both basic and applied value as reference
materials for basic research in animal vocalization and communication, as
sources for identifying species for environmental assessments, and as
contributors to the increasing array of commercial products that utilize natural
sounds in their production.
