This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
unique diamond based cold cathode electron source that contains a randomly
distributed high density of emission sites, fast response time, low energy
spread, and high thermal conductivity. Due to the novel structure proposed and
use of diamond as the cathode material, this electron source should not be
subject to built-in wear-out mechanisms of Spindt-type field emission cathodes
and should be relatively impervious to substrate poisoning by residual
contamination. In Phase I this firm will construct this novel diamond-based
electron source and test the properties of this source by comparing performance
with more traditional Spindt-type field emission cathodes. The anticipated
benefits of the proposed material include reduced production costs and increased
performance of field emission electron sources used in vacuum electronic
devices, electron sources for electron microscopes, and electron sources for
field emission flat panel display devices.
