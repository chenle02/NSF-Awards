The field of Combinatorial Optimization has applications throughout nearly every
field of scientific and engineering interest. Progress towards faster and more
robust ways of solving such problems has been steadily increasing, with
occasional breakthroughs, often generated by Professors Balas and Cornuejols.
New results on polyhedral and graph theoretic methods have recently been
obtained. This proposal is to continue to seek ramifications of the new results,
especially as they relate to packing and routing problems.
