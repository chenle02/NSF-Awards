Project MERIT is a three year effort to enhance middle school teachers'
knowledge of mathematics in content and pedagogy. The project targets teams of
teachers consisting of two to four underprepared teachers and a master/mentor
teacher. Teams will participate in a four week-summer institute, substantial
academic year followup, and a second summer institute. A first cohort of
teachers will begin in the summer of 1991, and a second cohort in the summer of
1992. The program will include mathematics content, instructional strategies,
and leadership training. MERIT is a cooperative effort of CSU-Dominquez Hills,
the Los Angeles Unified school district, and The Achievement Council. Cost
sharing is provided by CSU-Dominguez Hills, the Los Angeles Unified School
District, the Achievement Council, and participating schools, as 20% of the NSF
award.
