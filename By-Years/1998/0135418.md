During extreme events such as earthquakes and explosions, it is quite possible
that a critical element of a building structure, such as a column, collapses.
When a column in a building collapses the columns above this column, not being
supported anymore, can collapse resulting in a catastrophic and "progressive
collapse" of all floors above. Such a progressive collapse can result in tragic
loss of many lives such as the 1995 Murrah Building tragedy in Oklahoma City. In
order to avoid such tragedies, the structure should have mechanisms that loss of
one column does not result in a "domino" effect and progressive collapse of
columns above or a large portion of the structure. Dr. Astaneh has just
completed successful testing of a steel cable-based mechanism to prevent such
progressive collapses. In the system, steel cables are placed inside the floor
slabs and when a column is removed, the cables act in a "catenary" action
similar to a suspension bridge cable and prevent collapse of the floor and
progressive collapse of the structure. The tests just completed have been for
new construction where it is possible to place the steel cables inside the floor
slabs. Realizing the success of this system in preventing collapse of new
buildings, we are proposing to test the system as a measure of retrofit for
existing vulnerable buildings. Fortunately, we have the specimen from the just
completed tests in a state of minor damage and plan to use the specimen one more
time for this proposed exploratory investigation. The main objective of this
Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to take the existing specimen which is a
one story 60ft by 20 feet building and add the cable-based system to it (under
the existing slab) as a measure of retrofit and explore potential of this system
in preventing progressive collapse of the existing building structures.
