1236577&lt;br/&gt;Streator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is motivated by the
quest to understand the tensile stresses exerted by liquids within small
channels and to help mitigate the problem of "stiction" that is prevalent in
micro and nano scale devices. Measurements of flow rate, tensile force, surface
deformation and friction force will be performed for interfaces involving liquid
interposed between solid bodies of prescribed surface roughness. In parallel
with the experiments, a mathematical model will be developed that considers
elastic deformation and capillary effects to describe the flow of a thin liquid
film at the interface between contacting rough, elastic surfaces. This work will
assess the validity of the notion of interface collapse as predicted by recently
published mathematical models in the literature. This investigation will also
serve to establish new lower bounds on the magnitude of negative capillary
pressures generated in narrow interfaces. Results of the work are anticipated to
have relevance to several technical areas, including those related to flow in
porous media, the stability of wet soils, MEMS, magnetic recording, adhesives,
and seals. Additionally, the project will provide enriched educational
experiences for undergraduate and pre-college students. Undergraduate
researchers will be involved in developing a video entitled "Capillary
Connections" that features several physical demonstrations of capillarity,
touching on several disparate areas, such as the stick-slip behavior of wiper
blades, the ascent of water in plants, the function of adhesives, and mechanisms
of absorption in porous bodies (like common sponges). It is planned to make the
video publicly accessible by posting at YouTube. Leveraging the NSF-sponsored
STEP program at Georgia Tech, undergraduate and graduate students supported by
the proposed project will visit STEP partner high schools to show and discuss
the Capillary Connections video.
