Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of
smooth spaces, known as manifolds, and it has profound applications throughout
mathematics, physics, and other scientific disciplines. In general, those
quantities that measure the shape of the manifold are called curvature. The
study of one particular kind of curvature -- Ricci curvature -- is one of
central topics in differential geometry and has significant connections to
general relativity. This project seeks to study the geometry and topology of
spaces whose Ricci curvature can't be too low, i.e., where this curvature has a
lower bound. The notion of Ricci curvature lower bounds can also be extended to
singular spaces (e.g., spaces with cone tips) which may not have manifold
structures. Investigating these singular spaces can in turn advance the
understanding of Ricci curvature on smooth manifolds. The broader impacts of
this project include raising awareness of the importance of singular spaces
through seminar and conference presentations, bringing modern concepts and ideas
in geometry to students in an accessible way, as well as mentoring
undergraduates in these areas.

In one direction, the project will study the fundamental groups of complete and
non-compact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Specifically, this will
investigate the relation between the structure of fundamental groups (for
example, finite generation and virtual nilpotency) and the equivariant
asymptotic geometry. The project will also aim to understand the geometry of
Ricci limit spaces, especially that of singular sets with large Hausdorff
dimension. Lastly, the project will explore the fundamental groups of closed
manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below, including their stability under
the Gromov-Hausdorff topology and uniform control on the group structure.
