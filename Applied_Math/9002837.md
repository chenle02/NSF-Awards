The principal investigator will show how the inverse problem in underwater
acoustics can be solved for the case of finite oceans with a depth-varying index
of refraction. There are two difficulties. The first involves the interaction of
th> ocean and the bottom. The second involves the fact that the index of
refraction of the water varies with depth. The problem with the ocean bottom can
be taken care of by postulating an appropriate far-field boundary condition,
while the problem with the variable refractivity is solved by replacing the
original set of equations with a set of averaged equations that are more
tractable. The analytical work will be complemented with numerical simulations.
One reason that people are interested in underwater acoustics is that it is
important to be able to locate and track submarines using a satellite.
Essentially a satellite sends a signal to a part of the ocean to look for a
submarine and interprets the return signal. This is a difficult problem because
the ocean is a complicated medium and the return signal can be distorted easily.
The principal investigator will study ways of improving the interpretation of
signals from the ocean by using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations.
