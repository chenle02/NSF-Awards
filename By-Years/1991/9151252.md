The purpose of this project is to integrate speech science laboratory
experiences with basic speech science course-work to promote active learning of
the physiological processes of speech production and their relation to the
acoustic speech signal. Laboratory activities have been designed to encourage
investigation of speech processes and to involve undergraduate students in the
method of scientific inquiry. A computerized speech lab is requested to enable
students to examine the acoustic speech signal. Additional scientific equipment
is requested to afford students the opportunity to objectively measure and
quantify the various speech processes including respiration, phonation, and
articulation. Through the proposed speech laboratory investigations, students
will be able to enhance their understanding of the intricate relationships
between speech physiological processes, to develop their skills in scientific
methodology, and to increase their level of preparation for future graduate
study.
