Normalization, i.e., the simplification of expressions with respect to a set of
rules called a rewrite system, is a fundamental computational step found in
virtually all symbolic computation and computer algebra systems. Applications of
this operation include functional, equational and logic programming languages,
abstract data type specification and verification, automated deduction, code
generation, type inferencing, and computer algebra. This proposal addresses both
algorithmic and foundational aspects of this important problem in symbolic
computing and computer algebra. The project involves the development of
algorithms which use preprocessing and static analysis for matching and
normalization with respect to static rules, and incremental algorithms for
matching and normalization with respect to dynamic rule sets. Algorithms which
learn efficiently from their history will be designed for normalization with
respect to several important and useful classes of rewrite systems. The
practical performance of our algorithms will be investigated. Techniques and
sufficient conditions for the important unique normal form property for
nonlinear rewrite systems and conditional rewrite systems will be devised.
Abstract Church-Rosser properties will be investigated for hierarchical
combinations of rewriting modulo equational theories. Existing sufficient
conditions for the Church-Rosser property of nonlinear hierarchical combinations
of ordinary and conditional rewrite systems will be generalized. Hierarchical
combinations are the way in which most specifications and software are written.
The project is expected to: (i) be useful in enhancing the efficiency and power
of symbolic computation and computer algebra systems, (ii) provide understanding
of the inherent/complexities of the involved operations, and (iii) yield new
results, techniques and insight into two fundamental issues of rewrite systems,
viz., uniqueness of normal forms and the Church-Rosser property.
