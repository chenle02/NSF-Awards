This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Predicting the response of grassland
plant community composition to expected future environmental conditions." Human
activities are altering global environments in several interrelated ways.
Ecosystem-scale experiments using simulated future environments have documented
the responses of some of the world's natural systems to a number of potential
global changes. Several have demonstrated that changes in plant community
composition (i.e. changes in the plant species or groups of species present at a
particular location) can drive whole-ecosystem responses to environmental
modification, but effective frameworks for predicting changes in the prevalence
of species or functional groups are largely absent. This research is developing
predictive vegetation models that incorporate "bottom-up" (i.e. resource
availability) and "top-down" (i.e. herbivore mediated) controls on community
composition and production.
