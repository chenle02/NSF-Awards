In this project PI Henry Wilbur continues his studies of population dynamics and
life history evolution in variable environments by monitoring 18 species of
amphibians breeding in 32 natural ponds. All individuals of two species are
followed in three ponds to explicitly measure vital rates, such as the
probabilities of survival, reproduction, and movement between ponds. This study
employs software developed for the project to recognize individuals from digital
photographs taken as they move in and out of the pond, and new statistical
techniques to estimate vital rates from these data. A second approach monitors
breeding attempts and successful metamorphosis of all species in all ponds. The
primary source of environmental variation is the local weather that is being
linked explicitly to the hydrology of each pond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural
populations are influenced by many sources of variation from regional weather
systems to random effects on individuals in small populations, such as
opportunities to reproduce or exposure to mortality risks. It is important to
understand the impact of this variation on population dynamics to make wise
decisions about the management and conservation of natural populations, to
decide how to protect species of conservation concern, to exploit populations
for economic gain, or to control pests. This project also serves to train
students in field biology and population modeling.&lt;br/&gt;
