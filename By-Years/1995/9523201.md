9523201 Schoen Research into a method of molecular detection and identification
for separation science that will provide high sensitivity, selectivity, and
compatibility with all column separation methods will be conducted under this
award. A prototype SupraMolecular Assembly for Raman Transduction (SMART)
detector with a chromatographic cell will be designed and constructed to be used
with Gas Chromatography (GC) and High Pressure Liquid chromatography (HPLC).
This detector will be designed for optimal sensitivity and will be universal
with respect to the class of analytes. The results of this research will fill
the pressing need for a universal, sensitive, and selective on-line molecular
detector. The product will also be easily retrofitted into the already installed
base of GC, HPLC, Capillary Electrophoresis, and Supercritical Fluid
Chromatography instruments, increasing its applicability in industry.
