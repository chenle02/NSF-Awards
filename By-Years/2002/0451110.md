This proposal requests funding to renew the support for the Central Coordinating
Office (CCO) for the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE)
currently based at the Consortium of Oceanographic Research and Education
(CORE). Central Coordinating Office activities supported by this award will
include planning and coordinating annual PI conferences, National Advisory Board
meeting and specialty workshops focused on the interests and needs of the
network. In addition, the CCO will expand its role dramatically to include
marketing and outreach activities designed to raise the national profile of both
COSEE and ocean sciences education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other partners in this
effort are the National Sea Grant Program (NSGO) office, the Virginia Institute
of Marine Science (VIMS) and the Office of Program Evaluation (OPE) at the
University of South Carolina. VIMS will expedite internal network communications
and design a comprehensive, nationally recognized web portal integrated with
NSF's Digital Library for Earth Systems Education (DLESE) and the Bridge website
for educators. Evaluation of the effectiveness of network activities will be
handled by the OPE. As the lead institution, CORE will manage the office and its
activity and oversee website and evaluation activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very nature of
the COSEE program is about broader impacts. The potential impact of the CCO
could be unprecedented if successful as it will start putting the ocean on the
learning map of Americans and their government. CCO and COSEE has enormous
potential to enhance the infrastructure for both research and education. As
researchers start to realize the enormous pool of expertise and support that
COSEE provides, we will start to see more and more collaborations. This will
enhance the educational content and experience for teachers and
students.&lt;br/&gt;
