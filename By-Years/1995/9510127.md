This is an award through the Collaborative Research in Undergraduate
Institutions Program for support of a research center under the leadership of
Robert F. Pasternack of Swarthmore College for the study of synthetic and
biological light-harvesting systems, with emphasis on the technique of resonance
light scattering. Supported through the Special Projects Office of the Division
of Chemistry, the center is a collaboration of faculty and students from
Swarthmore, Haverford, and Goucher Colleges. The interdisciplinary research
seeks to determine the molecular parameters that are necessary for resonance
light scattering from aggregrated chromophores and to formulate a general
theoretical description of the process. Further, the research will develop
techniques of dynamic resonance light scattering to study the dimensions of
chromophore aggregrates and the mechanisms of aggregation and of time-resolved
resonance light scattering to probe photochemical processes involving energy and
electron transfer. A central facility, to be located at Swarthmore, will house a
versatile laser light scattering apparatus capable of both static and dynamic
light scattering experiments, angle-dependent scans, and polarization-dependent
measurements. Center research into the interactions of light with synthetic and
biological systems contributes to the new NSF initiative in optical sciences and
engineering. In addition to generating new knowledge on light-harvesting
systems, the center provides undergraduate students from three colleges with an
interdisciplinary, collaborative research experience. The center is a premier
example of the integration of research and education.
