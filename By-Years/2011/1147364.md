This award will help to support student attendance at the 52nd IEEE Annual
Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Palm Springs,
California, on October 22 through October 25, 2011, as well as to support
attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources
of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the
premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of
strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves
as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the
talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent
years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred
students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will
provide partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms
and travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)
