0115851 Field The objective of this research project is to develop a
denitrification bioreactor using H2S as the main electron donor for the
simultaneous removal of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur from refinery condensates.
The denitrifying bioreactor will be the first stage of a two-stage biological
process followed by a nitrification reactor, supplying nitrate via effluent
recirculation. Under the joint NSF-CONACyT program, this project forms part of
an international collaboration with the Mexican Institute of Petroleum (IMP) and
the scientific research funded by this grant will provide a basis for the IMP to
develop the proposed technology. This research is needed due to the complex
microbial ecology of the system. This research will characterize the microbial
consortium in the condensate-fed denitrifying bioreactor. Subsequently, the
strategies of controlling the reactor to maximize the removal of sulfide,
phenols and nitrogen will be identified. The effect of phenols on the
autotrophic denitrification process will be studied. An important aspect of the
research will be to control the oxidation of sulfide to form insoluble elemental
sulfur, instead of complete oxidation to sulfate, so that it can be physically
separated for reuse. ***
