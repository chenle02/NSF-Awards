Today's smartphones carry various built-in sensors such as GPS, accelerometers,
and cameras to acquire information. These sensors also enable smartphones to
collectively accomplish various sensing services on demand, for example
environmental monitoring and traffic measurement and control over certain
geographical areas. This type of mobile phone sensing allows ubiquitous coverage
due to mobility of smartphones. It is also cost effective, as it does not need a
dedicated sensing infrastructure and can adapt more flexibly to different
sensing demands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major design issue for mobile phone
sensing systems is to minimize battery usage/energy consumption and reduce
interference with primary voice and data services of smartphones while
maintaining the desired quality of sensing services. This requires activating
only a subset of smartphones that best serve the sensing task. Such sensor
selection problems are very challenging for large-scale networks, as they are
combinatorial in nature and intractable in general. The goal of this project is
to design a comprehensive sparse learning based methodology, which converts
challenging combinatorial sensor selection problems to sparsity-encouraged
convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. The research agenda
will include development of sparse learning approaches in view of sensor
collaboration structures, design of incentive-based mechanisms to fulfill
sensing demands as well as individual sensors profits, and design of dynamic
management policies that adapt to time-varying environments and incentives of
sensors. Success of this project will greatly advance sensor management designs
and potentially significantly improve efficiency of practical mobile phone
sensing systems. This project will offer hands-on training opportunities to
students from diverse backgrounds.
