Project is a two-year biostratigraphic analysis of three stratigraphic sections
of mid-Carboniferous strata, each a potential international boundary stratotype,
in the western U.S. The study will determine which of the sections is the best
candidate for a boundary stratotype and how each compares to previously proposed
sections. Significant new information on the chronostratigraphy,
biostratigraphy, community structure, evolution of mid-Carboniferous boundary
faunas, and the extent of the mid-Carboniferous eustatic event in the Great
Basin will be generated.
