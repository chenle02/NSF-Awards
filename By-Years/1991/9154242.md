This regional workshop for faculty from small four-year colleges in New York and
New England focuses on advanced NMR techniques and the introducion of this topic
into undergraduate teaching programs. The formal instruction and hands-on
instrument use includes such topics as Fourier transform techniques, relaxation
measurements, C-13 multiple pulse techniques, solvent suppression, two
dimensional NMR, NMR of solids, and integration of NMR techniques into course
work. There will be an opportunity for five participants to join host
institution's faculty in various research projects for an additional six weeks.
Participants will be able to return during the academic year with their students
for undergraduate oriented weekend NMR workshops.
