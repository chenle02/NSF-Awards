We are further developing and disseminating a remarkably simple and effective
instructional technique -- ConcepTests coupled with Peer Instruction -- which
has shown to be very effective in revitalizing instruction and improving student
learning in science courses. The technique has two primary goals: 1. to expose
students' common misconceptions about fundamental principles via the use of
ConcepTests, and 2. to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of basic
concepts, through Peer Instruction. Greater understanding, in turn, leads to a
greater appreciation of the material, and is ultimately expected to result in an
increased interest in the sciences. Initial application of this method in
introductory physics classes indicates that our program achieves both of these
objectives. We are extending our initial research to other disciplines, fine-
tuning our procedure, and systematizing its application so it can be widely
applied in undergraduate science, mathematics and engineering education.
