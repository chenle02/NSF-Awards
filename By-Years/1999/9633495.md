The interactions between multi-bodies (particles) will be investigated when the
interstitial fluid is at a such low pressure that the continuity equation does
not hold. Analytical solutions to the gas kinetic equations ware proposed to
describe the interaction of two spheres by considering the entire range of the
Knudsen number. Molecular dynamics methods, including the time correlation
formalism and generalized Brownian dynamics, are used for more complex systems
of particles moving in gases. The work has relevance to aerosol science and
technology.
