This project is supporting over 50 academically talented students with
demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in Engineering at
Northern New Mexico College (NNMC). Cohort-building and academic-support
activities for scholars include faculty mentoring, peer tutoring, participation
in engineering-focused first-year experiences and community service, career- and
graduate-school awareness events, and opportunities to participate in
undergraduate research related to the Solar Energy Research Park and Academy,
Northern New Mexico Cisco Networking Academy, and partnerships with the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its
comprehensive approach to recruitment and support of scholars in a young,
vibrant engineering department that has built strong connections to industry and
other educational institutions in the region. Broader impacts include promotion
of student success in this impoverished, rural region. 80% of NNMC students are
first-generation-in-college, 83% are Hispanic, and 9% Native American. This
program is thus expanding and diversifying the engineering workforce in the
region, as well as providing a model approach for consideration by similar
institutions.
