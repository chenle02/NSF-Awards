Developing more highly qualified science teachers to serve in high needs schools
is a national challenge. The University of Virginia in partnership with Hampton,
Alexandria, and Culpeper School Districts will implement Phase 1 of the Robert
Noyce Scholarship and Stipend Program which will recruit, educate and retain
academically talented science and engineering undergraduates and STEM
professionals who will become certified high school science teachers in the
partner school districts and other high-need schools in Virginia. The
educational experience for Noyce Scholarship and Stipend recipients will include
preparing them to become effective science teachers, and Teacher-Leaders in
engineering design integration in K-12 science instruction. Robert Noyce
Scholarship and Stipend recipients will be supported through a number of proven
strategies, including mentoring, targeted advising, and induction support. Data
will be collected to provide insights into the integration of engineering design
in pre-service science teacher education courses, which may lead to programmatic
changes in teacher education program. The project will be rigorously evaluated
to determine the effectiveness of the recruitment and retention strategies and
to determine the impact of the program on Robert Noyce Scholarship and Stipend
recipients' content knowledge, instructional practices, and skills for
integrating engineering design in science instruction. Overall, this project
will contribute to the number of certified secondary science teachers in high-
need schools in Virginia, and stands to increase student achievement in science.
