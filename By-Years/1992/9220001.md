Hormone-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol bis- phosphate is
followed by conversion of phosphatidyl inositol to phosphatidyl inositol bis-
phosphate. Studies indicate that lipid from subcellular organelles in addition
to the plasma membrane must be accessible in order to account for the large
amount of PtdIns that is often involved in the cycling response. To date, two
mechanisms have been proposed to explain this: (1) A PtdIns transfer protein
facilitates the transfer of intracellular PtdIns to the plasma membrane, and (2)
The bulk of the PtdIns metabolized is hydrolyzed directly, perhaps as a result
of the rise in intracellular free calcium, and is not involved in the generation
of inositol tris phosphate second messengers or directly associated with a
hormone-receptor complex. A third possibility is suggested: (3) Internal
membrane PtdIns is accessed as a result of receptor sequestration and recycling
through the interior of the cell. A series of experiments have been devised to
test this third possibility. They involve inhibition of internalization by
potassium depletion as well as by receptor mutation. As a corollary to this
hypothesis, compensatory resynthesis of PtdIns need not take place at the plasma
membrane. The subcellular location of the PtdIns synthetase enzyme will be
determined by immunocytochemistry. %%% One important signaling pathway in the
response of cells to hormones involves the breakdown of a membrane component
known as phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate to produce further signal molecules.
To maintain a cell's ability to respond to hormone, this material must be
resynthesized. The goal of this research is to determine where within the cell
resynthesis takes place and how it is controlled in coordination with hormonal
stimulation of the cell. The results of this research will contribute important
new information on how cells respond to hormones and other external signals.
