This award will provide one-half of the funds required to purchase an
inductively-coupled mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and to develop the analytical
procedures for the analysis of geological samples in the department of
geological sciences at Cornell University. Cornell University is committed to
providing the remaining one-half of the funds necessary. The ICP-MS technique
uniquely combines an ability to measure concentration of an extremely wide range
of elements, excellent sensitivity for trace quantities, and a high throughput
for large numbers of samples. The instrument will be used for analysis of a
broad suite of geological samples in research aimed at questions of mantle
evolution, oceanic island and mid-ocean ridge magma genesis, fluxes of dissolved
matter to seawater, island arc petrogenesis and ore mineral deposition.
