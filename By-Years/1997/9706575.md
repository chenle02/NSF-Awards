9706575 Holzwarth This grant will support research on computational techniques
and their application to various materials systems. The computational tools are
based on first principles techniques integrating algorithms established in the
literature with various innovations. They are based on the Car-Parinello
technique. The density functional portion of the algorithm uses a modified
version of the projector augmented-wave method, introduced by Blochl, which
incorporates the numerical efficiency of the pseudopotential approach while
retaining the important physical effects of an all-electron calculation. The
completed code will be shared with other researchers. The simulations will
include: a study of structural relaxation in the (001) surface of cubic SiC; a
study of two interacting surfaces with a view toward an idealized model of
tunneling and force microscopes; a study of static and dynamic point defects in
calcium fluoride and related materials which affect their use as radiation
detectors and optical windows; and, a longer term project to study the
interaction of water with metal surfaces. %%% The award will support research on
both computer code development and its application to various problems in
materials physics. The code development will benefit all researchers by being
made readily available. The computational research will focus on problems having
to do with electronic and structural properties of defects in solids and on the
properties of surfaces. ***
