The goal of this project is to investigate a variety of problems in stochastic
analysis, which is a part of probability theory that studies dynamical systems
under the action of random impulses. A central objective is the analysis of
stochastic partial differential equations, such as the heat and wave equations,
perturbed by random noises. These equations provide mathematical models in a
wide range of areas, such as growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid
dynamics and polymer models. The proposed research will focus on the ergodicity
and random fluctuations of spatial averages, which are related to observed
characteristics in particular physical models. A second objective of the project
is to broaden the range of applications of the stochastic calculus of
variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a
mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from
functions to stochastic processes. It has proven to be a powerful tool in
deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems, which are of great
relevance in statistical inference. Particular emphasis will be put in the
analysis of random processes with long memory which are useful to handle data
coming from finance, telecommunications and other areas. The project provides
research training opportunities for graduate students. A first working block of
the project consists in establishing quantitative central limit theorems for
spatial averages of a wide class of stochastic partial differential equations
driven by a Gaussian noise which has homogeneous covariance. Challenging
problems are the case of the three dimensional wave equation driven by a noise
which is white in time and it has a Riesz covariance in space, and also the case
of noises which are rougher that the white noise. Establishing the rate for
probability densities using techniques of Malliavin calculus is a central goal
of the project. A second working block deals with deriving the asymptotic
behavior of functionals of the fractional Brownian motion related to local
times. An innovative methodology based on the Clark-Ocone formula will be
developed. In a third working block we plan to address several open problems in
the applications of the stochastic calculus of variation in limit problems
including local asymptotic expansions of densities and rates of convergence for
Euler approximations in stochastic Volterra equations.
