Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries via
linear algebra. It is a major mathematical area and is also a very powerful tool
in the study of other areas, such as physics and number theory. Weyl groups are
special groups of symmetries that consist of product of reflections. The
structure and the representations of Weyl groups plays a fundamental role in
understanding the structure and the representations of many larger groups, for
example the groups of all invertible matrices over finite, real, and complex
fields. An underlying goal of this project is to use some recent discoveries
about Weyl groups to study the structure and representations of reductive p-adic
groups, that is matrix groups over p-adic fields. Roughly speaking, the category
of representations of a reductive p-adic group is dual to the cocenter of its
Hecke algebra. The PI has established the Newton decomposition of the cocenter
of this Hecke algebra, based on some recent discoveries about Weyl groups. This
research will systematically develop consequences of this decomposition. Results
will have applications in many directions in the theory of representations of
reductive p-adic groups. More precisely, the PI plans to describe the
relationship between the cocenter and the orbital integrals; the relationships
between cocenters of different groups arising from base change and inner forms;
and the relationships between the cocenter and the mod-l representations.
