ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Neeman, Itay Proposal Number: DMS - 0833743 Institution:
University of California-Los Angeles Title: Very Informal Gathering of Logicians

The Very Informal Gatherings of Logicians at UCLA (VIGs) have been among the
most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast for several
decades. The 2009 VIG will emphasize inner model theory, descriptive set theory,
computability theory, and philosophy of mathematics. It will honor Professor
John Steel of UC-Berkeley, who contributed greatly to these areas, and continues
to do so, on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday. The conference will be a key
opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in
research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. Travel
grants will allow graduate students and young researchers to come to the
conference. Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and
university teachers. What they learn at the conference will have a positive
impact on their research and teaching.
