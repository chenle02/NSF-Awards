A contact center is a collection of resources providing an interface between a
service provider and its customers. The classical contact center is a call
center, containing a collection of service representatives (reps) who talk to
customers over the telephone. In a call center, the service reps are supported
by quite elaborate information-and-communication- technology (ICT) equipment,
such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an interactive voice response (IVR)
unit, an automatic call distributor (ACD), a personal computer (PC) and assorted
databases. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, contact between the service
provider and its customers is often made via e-mail or the Internet instead of
by telephone.

The design and management of contact centers is important, and worthy of
research, because contact centers comprise a large, growing part of the economy
and because they are quite complicated. Classic call centers are complicated
because there are often many types of calls, requiring different service skills,
such as knowledge of different languages and knowledge of different special
promotions. The ACD is able to respond through skill-based routing, but there
remains an opportunity to determine better routing algorithms and more effective
methods for staffing. The difficulties are largely due to uncertainty about
future arrivals of service requests of various kinds and the time and resources
that will be required to respond to those requests.

Given that contact with customers no longer need be by telephone, it is
necessary to consider the other media. When service reps perform several
different kinds of work, there is a need to allocate effort to the different
tasks, which presents opportunities for improved efficiency if some of the work
can be postponed. Multimedia also lead to more complicated contact experiences.
For example, customers might alternate between periods of interaction with
service reps and periods of browsing on the Internet.

This project aims to respond to these challenges by conducting exploratory
research on stochastic (probability) models of contact centers, aiming to
uncover fundamental principles and develop performance-analysis tools that will
make it possible to improve the design and management of contact centers. Effort
will be made to find conditions for resource pooling in contact centers, where
the efficiency of a large single-skill center is achieved in a multi-skilled
center with minimal flexibility. Staffing will be studied in each of three
important time scales: real-time, short-term and long-term. Effort will be made
to understand the contribution of different sources of uncertainty: model
uncertainty, parameter uncertainty and process uncertainty.
