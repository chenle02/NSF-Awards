This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
electron transfer methods for the recovery of the giant, insoluble fullerenes
that comprise about half of the fullerenes made by the hydrocarbon combustion
route. Of the fullerenes produced by the combustion process developed at TDA,
and practiced at the tons/year scale, ca. 20 % of the raw soot weight is
recovered as fullerenes (C60, C70, etc.). It was shown in this project that
another ca. 15 - 20% of the soot could be recovered as giant fullerenes using
electron transfer methods. This Phase II project will further research the
chemistry of the insoluble fullerenes and develop the recovery technique using
xylene-extracted soot as a feedstock. We will also implement the process at 100
times the scale performed during the Phase I project, to 100g insoluble
fullerenes recovered per shift, to better identify and address issues in the
chemistry and engineering of the process. Following the Phase II project, the
process will be installed at a plant producing ~32 tons/year of insoluble
fullerenes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process being developed in this project
will be commercialized by fullerene soot producers, giving them the ability to
effectively double the yield of the synthesis process. The recovered fullerenes
will be useful for applications demanding a more robust, but still fullerenic
material or coating, such as carbon coatings for artificial biomaterials,
optical limiters, or as scaffolds for nanotechnological devices. &lt;br/&gt;
