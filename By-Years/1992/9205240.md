This project has four main objectives: i) to identify efficient multiplier
update implementations for large scale discrete-time control problems with state
and control variable constraints, and for finite-difference approximations to
analogous continuous-time problems; ii) to extend existing convergence analyses
to problems with inequality constraints that have infinite-dimensional range
spaces; iii) to develop infinite-dimensional extensions of the Kuhn-Tucker
sufficient conditions needed in convergence analyses for the subject algorithms
and other constrained minimization methods as well; iv) to investigate quasi-
Newton recursions that produce scaling operators which automatically possess
well-behaved global and asymptotic properties. The algorithms investigated in
this project are related to significant applications in the operation of
aircraft and spacecraft, electrical power networks, chemical and nuclear
reactors, robot manipulators, and ecosystems.
