Underneath the cortex of the mammalian brain lies the thalamus, a structure
that has traditionally been considered a 'relay' area for passing practically
all sensory information (except olfaction) to the cortex, where sensations are
processed and perceived. However, some recent evidence suggests that thalamic
functions are dynamically linked to behavioral states such as attention, and
that massive connections descend to the thalamus from the cortex, far
outnumbering the ascending sensory connections. This project combines visual
behavior with electrophysiological recordings from a visual thalamic center
called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The experiments test whether the
neuronal activity in LGN is modulated in relation to intended eye movements, and
whether neuronal activity in LGN is also modulated by the behavioral demands
that may be independent of visual signals themselves. Both these features would
lead to a major revision in our understanding of how sensory input reaches the
cortex. Results have the potential for a revolutionary change in understanding
how crucial the feedback circuits to thalamus are for sensory and cognitive
processing, and so will have an impact beyond simply visual neuroscience. This
project also provides training opportunities in the sophisticated linking of
behavioral and electrophysiological techniques, for students at various levels
and including minority students.
