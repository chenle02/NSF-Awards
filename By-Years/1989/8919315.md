Skeletal muscle is not only important in animal locomotion, but also
constitutes a major metabolic store of protein that can be quickly mobilized
when dietary intake is insufficient to meet an animal's nutritional needs.
During starvation-induced atrophy, muscle protein is degraded to amino acids,
which are then used by other tissues for the synthesis of proteins essential for
life. In addition, muscle atrophy can be induced by disuse, nerve injury, and
disease. In some diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, wasting is so severe that
the individual dies. The intracellular regulation of protein breakdown in any
animal is poorly understood. The crustacean claw muscle provides a favorable
model system for elucidating proteolytic mechanisms. During each intermolt
cycle, the claw muscle undergoes a sequential atrophy and restoration, in which
protein content decreases 40% during the premolt period and is resynthesized
following molt. Atrophy apparently facilitates withdrawal of the pair of large
claws at the time the shell is shed. Protein degradation appears to be mediated
by five enzymes: four calcium- dependent proteinases (CDPs) and a multicatalytic
proteinase (MCP). These enzymes are active at neutral pH and degrade the
contractile proteins of muscle. This proposal examines the regulation of
intracellular proteolysis in a muscle that resembles, both morphologically and
biochemically, vertebrate skeletal muscle. Since atrophy coincides with elevated
levels of a steroid molting hormone, experiments will investigate the hormonal
control of protein turnover (synthesis and degradation) in claw muscles in
culture. Other experiments will identify the major steps in the signal pathway
controlling proteolysis. The CDPs and endogenous regulatory factors will be
purified for further characterization and production of antibodies. Molt-induced
changes in the expression, content, and intracellular distribution of the MCP
will be quantified. In addition to defining the function of these enzymes in
protein breakdown, these studies will yield new and fundamental information on
the regulation of proteolytic processes common to all animal cells.
