The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the studies of
Professor Richard Weiss on the effects of structural and/or electronic
anisotropy imposed by liquid crystals, polymers, and gels on guest molecules.
Molecules with well-established spectral and photochemical properties in fluid
solution will be incorporated into these media, and their reactivity in the
different media compared to elucidate structural and electronic influences
imposed by the media. Conversely, well defined anisotropic environments will be
employed to impose specific influences on the guest thereby providing insights
into the fundamental factors affecting specific transformations within these
constrictive environments. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this
research will be exposed to a variety of photochemical, fast reaction and
spectroscopic techniques, and their application to materials characterization.
With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports the research and educational activities of Professor Richard Weiss of
Georgetown University. Professor Weiss will focus his research on elucidating
the structural and electronic effects imposed by liquid crystals, polymers, and
gels on the photochemical reactivity of incorporated molecules, called guests.
The local microenvironment imposed by these materials influences the reactivity
of the guest, and changes in the reactivity of the guest, when compared to that
in fluid solution, offer unique insights into materials processing at the
molecular level. The educational activities of Professor Weiss include the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in spectroscopy, fast reaction
techniques and materials characterization.
