This project will enhance significantly the undergraduate chemistry curriculum
at Roanoke College by incorporating state-of-the-art UV- visible spectroscopy
into laboratory courses in physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and
biochemistry. The computer-controlled UV- visible spectrophotometer acquired for
this project affords capabilities not previously available to students at
Roanoke College: determining absorbance as a function of time, measuring spectra
at various temperatures, and obtaining spectra with very high resolution.
Current experiments will be improved substantially, and new experiments will be
added to the curriculum. Examples include a study of a Co (II) equilibrium
system, determination of thermodynamic functions from spectroscopic data, and
investigations of enzyme kinetics. The project will give students at Roanoke
College experience with modern technology in UV-visible spectroscopy.
