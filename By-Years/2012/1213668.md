With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professors T. Kwaku Dayie and Herman O. Sintim of the University of
Maryland at College Park. Professors Dayie and Sintim will examine the
structural and dynamic basis of riboswitch RNA regulation, i.e. turning on and
off gene regulatory circuits in bacteria. While X-ray crystallography has become
a powerful tool to unravel the nature of the riboswitch RNA bound to its ligand,
it usually fails to characterize the unbound state. This proposal aims to
develop tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small
angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to provide complementary approaches to better
understand the nature of riboswitch transitions from the unbound state to a
competently folded and functional state. A critical component of these efforts
will be to develop techniques to more efficiently generate isotopically enriched
RNAs for NMR studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project
include deepening our understanding of RNA signaling at the heart of gene
regulation. Perhaps most important is the education and training of students who
work on this project, Undergraduate and graduate student researchers on the team
will be exposed to a multi-disciplinary training environment, including the use
of NMR and computational modeling, synthetic organic chemistry and enzymology,
with the goal of understanding how RNA biomolecules control important cellular
processes of catalysis and gene regulation at the molecular level.
