In all animal cells, the rise and fall of cyclin controls the entry into and
exit out of mitosis. The objective of this investigation is to link gene
products that regulate the cell cycle in the nucleus with the dynamic regulation
of the cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm. Changes in the cytoskeleton cause
chromatids to segregate and cells to cleave. But the cytoskeleton is also
responsible for movements of the nuclei within the cell and for cell shape
changes. To study the role of cyclin in shaping the cytoskeleton, the PI will
use the early Drosophila embryo because the first divisions are nuclear and take
place within a single cell, the cycle is synchronous, and the regulation of the
divisions depends entirely on maternal contributions. By increasing and
decreasing cyclin gene dose in the mother, the PI can define the role that
cyclin has in microtubule and microfilament dynamics. The PI has found that
increased cyclin results in faster and more complete microtubule breakdown. To
identify other genes, which collaborate with cyclin and affect the microtubule
dynamics, the PI has proposed a genetic screen. During the early stages of
embryogenesis in Drosophila, nuclei move in a specific phase of the cell cycle.
This movement depends on the specific breakdown of the microfilament network.
The dynamics of the microfilaments depend on several specific, known proteins,
and we will characterize their role by changing their gene dose in the mother.
Several characterized proteins are known to regulate microfilament dynamics. The
PI will define their role by changing their gene dose in the mother.
