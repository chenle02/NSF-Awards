The use of globular cluster stars to study early chemical enrichment in the
galaxy is rendered uncertain by the existence of stars in the same cluster with
different surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and possibly other
elements. To clarify the causes of this, a systematic survey of the chemical
abundances of stars in different evolutionary states in various clusters will be
made. This investigation is possible for the first time due to the capabilities
of new instrumentation at Lick Observatory and the Keck Telescope in Hawaii.
