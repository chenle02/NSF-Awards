Sedimentary basins of the United States Midcontinent contain significant
petroleum reservoirs and ore deposits of lead, zinc, barite, and fluorite which
appear to have origins related to the migration of deep groundwater and
hydrocarbons over 100's of kilometers. Geological and geochemical data are
abundant for these sedimentary basins and so they are nearly perfect candidates
for constraining theoretical models for deep groundwater flow and petroleum
migration over geological time and distances. A new three-dimensional finite-
element model will be constructed to quantify coupled deep groundwater flow and
heat transport as a function of time. This model will then be applied to studies
of two specific regional problems: (1) Ore formation on the Ozark Dome of
southeast Missouri and (2) Oil migration in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and
Kansas. The effects of three-dimensional flow and transport on ore formation a t
the district-scale will also be investigated with detailed models of the
Viburnum Trend and Old Lead Belt in southeast Missouri. Geochemical theories for
ore- solution transport and deposition will be tested with reaction-path
calculations which are coupled to the groundwater flow system. The work
represents the first effort in characterizing true three- dimensional effects of
groundwater plaeoflow at the basin scale and as such it ought to pioneer a new
generation of ideas and applications in studies of the role of groundwater in
geologic processes.
