The purpose of this project is to promote student participation in the long-
running ER conference series, to be held in Belgium in Oct-Nov 2011. This will
be the thirtieth ER, which is promised to continue the tradition of promoting
collaboration among multiple areas. ER is a leading international forum for
conceptual modeling, which is an important issue for information management and
integration. ER provides a unique forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary
research and education in Conceptual Modeling. The proposed activities include
recruiting a diverse group of US students to participate in ER, and will use the
grant to help cover the cost of travel, subsistence, and registration to the ER
2011 conference for the students. Students participation of international
scientific discussion forums is always an important part of their education and
a great way to build a mature work force in scientific research. The project
will also emphasize on recruiting under-represented groups of students in this
effort.
