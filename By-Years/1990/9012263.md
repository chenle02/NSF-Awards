This project is the continuation of Boyd and Schultz's ongoing development and
application of spectral methods. This effort has produced one book and thirty-
three papers over the past two years, ranging form theoretical analyses of
asymptotic Chebyshev coefficients to practical applications to geophysical and
engineering flows. In the proposed work, we will continue to mix numerically-
oriented with application-oriented studies. Spectral domain decomposition and
special handling of singularities will be major themes. We will apply multi-
element Legendre spectral methods to two problems: lubrication in an elliptical
journal bering, and a tree-dimensional ocean general circulation model. In these
engineering studies, we will compare explicit and implicit time- marching
schemes, multigrid with various smoothers (notably GMRES), and different
strategies for coping with corner singularities and fronts. In addition, we will
perform theoretical investigations on several topics: sum-accelerated
pseudospectral methods and their relationship to finite differences, comparison
of pseudospectral residuals and errors, reduced basis and Delves-Freeman
iterations for solving strongly nonlinear boundary value problems, and spectral
methods for fronts and shocks.
