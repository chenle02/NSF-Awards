This project constitutes the lead and coordination effort for a study involving
four US institutions, and institutions from Australia and France. A joint field
program will be carried out to study the water mass distributions, current
structures and transport of the low-latitude western boundary currents in the
western Equatorial Pacific. Focus will be on the confluence of northern and
southern hemisphere waters, which arrive at the entrance to the Indonesian Seas
via the South Equatorial Current, the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent, and the
Mindanao Current. Water mass tracers and direct current measurements will be
employed. Lukas and Firing will carry out hydrographic, moored current meter,
and shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements, while
coordinating the work of Fine (Miami) and Gammon (UW), who propose, via
subcontracts, to carry out tracer studies (freons and tritium/helium). The
hydrography will be done by the Scripps data acquisition facility, under a
separate award. Richardson (WHOI) will deploy an array of surface drifters, to
directly observe surface flows in the region. This experiment is a major process
study contributing to the objectives of the US TOGA (Tropical Ocean and Global
Atmosphere) Program.
