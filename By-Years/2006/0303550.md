The goal of this project is to extend and further develop some newly discovered
computational techniques in quantum field theory and to apply these to problems
in elementary particle physics. Some of the application will be to string theory
and quantum membranes but also to topological theories with boundaries. The PI
also intends to extend his approach for formulating quantum processes in terms
of Wigner functionals, which contain both momentum and coordinate dependence.
The time evolution of quantum fields and membranes will be studied in the
context of the time evolution of the quantum Wigner functional. It is hoped that
Duality will be more transparent in this formalism. The PI also plans to study
Membrane theory with the use of Moyal brackets.&lt;br/&gt;
