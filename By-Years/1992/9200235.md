This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a one-year period beginning April 1992, ten (10) undergraduate
students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under the direction
of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. The goal is to provide ten
talented undergraduate students, four from Tufts and six from other colleges,
with the opportunity to participate in chemical research. The Tufts program will
focus on those students who have maintained their interest in science through
the sophomore year, both declared majors, as well as students who are non-majors
or undecided as to their specific area of science concentration.
