This research and education program is directed at devising theoretical
frameworks and methodological strategies for designing and employing learning
objects in scalable online learning environments that are rich with human-to-
human interaction. To develop these new frameworks and strategies, empirical
program based on qualitative analyses of existing online learning communities
will be done. Rather than viewing learning objects as decontextualized artifacts
existing independent of learners interactions with them, Wertsch's (1991)
analytic method will allow the research to focus on the ways in which resources
mediate the achievement of online learners' goals in the context of existing
online learning communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be
integrated into several educational activities. Three full graduate
assistantships are provided for the five years of the grant, which will engage
students in Utah State University's Instructional Technology graduate program in
real-world application of skills they are learning, as well as prepare them for
future research projects of their own. Additionally, the grant will serve as a
real-world context for assignments in a variety of courses such as qualitative
methods courses and a Learning Objects Seminar. Thirdly, as portions of the
framework become available courses will be designed around the framework, giving
both myself and the students the opportunity to engage reflectively in their own
integrated learning and research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is co-funded by Division of Undergraduate Education.
