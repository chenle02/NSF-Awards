This research will be supported by field, geologic and scientific advice from
Dr. G. V. Nesterenko of the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry in Moscow, who
has already provided approximately 50 samples of Siberian Flood Basalt Province
(SFBP) which are fresh, and well-controlled in terms of their volcano-
stratigraphic positions. The plan of this initial study is to characterize the
overall temporal and spatial variations in the SFBP by analyzing the rest of the
samples for Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr, and U-Th-Pb systematics. Some of these samples are
also selected for grain-picking to do a laser-heating 40Ar/39Ar age
determinations, to be done at the Institute for Human Origins. The proposed
research on the SFBP will provide new information through which to study and
interpret the origin of other flood basalt provinces.
