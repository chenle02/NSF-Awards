The structure and stability of combustion processes in real mixtures is analyzed
using mathematical methods for partial differential equations. Diffusion flames,
premixed flames, and detonations are addressed. Through nondimensionalization of
the conservation equations, appropriate parameters are identified, typically
activation energies or ratios of reaction rates. Asymptotic analysis identifies
limiting values and simplifies the conservation equations, enabling solution
analytically without resort to numerical integration. Formulas are derived for
quantities of interest such as burning velocities, ignition or extinction strain
rates, autoignition delay times, and critical conditions for stability. Systems
addressed include combustion of higher hydrocarbons and higher alcohols
including production of nitrogen oxides, intrinsic detonation stability, and
influences of strain on flames. Reduced kinetic schemes are derived and their
influences on flame and detonation behaviors are analyzed.
