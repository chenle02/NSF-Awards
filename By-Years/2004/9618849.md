Abstract BERSHADY, M. A. AST-9618849 Funds will be used to design, build and
install two- dimensional fiber-optical arrays into the 9m Hobby-Eberly
Telescope's Medium Resolution Spectrograph. Two arrays will be built to optimize
integral-field spectroscopy for kinematic studies of individual nearby and
moderately distant galaxies. One array spans over 30 arcsec using 1 arcsec
fibers to densely sample slits at 4 position angles (R &lt; 10,900). The second
array spans 15 arcsec using 0.5 arcsec fibers to densely sample a core area of
~60 square arcsecs (R &lt; 21,800).
