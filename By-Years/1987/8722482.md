The bombardment of the upper layers of the earth's atmosphere by ultraviolet
and X-Ray photons from the sun breaks apart molecules there such as N2, O2, and
CO2 into atomic fragments (photodissociation). Some of these fragments lose or
gain an electron in the process and emerge electrically charged (dissociative
ionization), and they all possess varying amounts of kinetic energy that affect
their subsequent chemical reactions. In some cases the speed of the atom is
sufficient to allow it to escape from the earth. This award is for laboratory
measurements of the energies and other details of the products of such molecular
disintegration, with the aim of improving our understanding of the chemistry of
the upper atmosphere.
