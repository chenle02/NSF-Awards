This Research Initiation Award funds a study of the modeling, simulation and
control aspects on inherently nonlinear electromechanical systems which exhibit
chaos. The research has both experimental and analytical components and
emphasizes control strategies. Both active and passive control strategies will
be developed to delineate regions of safe operation. Periodic excitations will
be used as inputs to lock the system into an unstable periodic orbit
representing chaotic response. Control schemes will then be used to stabilize
the motion. The results should be applicable to dynamic systems such as printers
and gear mechanisms with backlash.*** //
