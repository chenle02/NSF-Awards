With National Science Foundation support, the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign will host the 9th Conference on Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon 9) on
June 24-26, 2004. The main goal of this international conference is to promote
interdisciplinary research on the sound structure of languages, overcoming the
traditional boundaries that separate phonology, as a branch of theoretical
linguistics, from the study of speech production, speech perception, spoken
language acquisition, and other disciplines concerned with human speech from
different perspectives. The central theme of LabPhon 9 will be Change in
Phonology. In keeping with the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, we
include subthemes on change in child phonology acquisition, social factors that
condition phonetic variation, mechanisms of sound change, phonological change in
bilinguals and language learners, and phonological models of variation in
computer speech processing. These topics address many important areas of broad
social interest, including child language development, language pedagogy, and
technologies for human-computer interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LabPhon
conference is a major forum for interdisciplinary interaction between linguists
and scholars in other fields. Invited speakers and other conference participants
are affiliated with diverse academic departments, such as Psychology, Computer
Science, Electrical Engineering, and Speech and Hearing Sciences, among others,
as well as departments of Linguistics and foreign languages. The conference will
support the participation of students and scholars from underrepresented
minorities, including African-Americans and Latinos. Selected papers from the
conference will be published in an edited volume, the 9th in the influential
LabPhon series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
