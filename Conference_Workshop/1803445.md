This award supports the participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting
2018, to be held at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville on February
24-25, 2018. This conference will encourage professional networking and
interactions between students and faculty with interests in ring theory, broadly
interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest region. The meeting will provide
an effective environment for scientific interaction, thanks to inspiring talks
from established experts, ample time dedicated to graduate students poster
presentations and opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and
exploring new research directions. About 50 participants are expected, including
students and both junior and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and
South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups,
women, untenured faculty and faculty at non-PhD granting institutions is
particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics
within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate
students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which
the participating students will present and discuss their research with the
participants. More information can be found at the conference webpage
http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2018.html. The study of rings, in the
broadest sense, is essential in many branches of mathematics, including
commutative and non-commutative geometry, number theory, coding theory, group
representations and cryptography. The speakers are specialists in differential
graded algebras, intersection multiplicities, Rees algebras, Lie theory,
representations of finite and algebraic groups, algebraic combinatorics,
complexity theory, homological methods. This variety of interests among our
speakers should provide directions for new algebraic interactions between all
participants and expand their potential research horizons.
