Three problems are being studied for numerical solution using supercomputing.
The first is to determine the flow and base pressure at the rear of a rocket-
propelled missile or vehicle in transonic flight. Contradictory prior results,
both numerical and experimental, would be resolved for this important problem by
the analysis.
