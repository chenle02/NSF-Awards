This project is an investigation into the radiative properties of ice crystals
in the polar atmosphere, and an assessment how these crystals affect radiative
fluxes, local heating rates, and visibility. Ice crystals have not generally
been considered important in the polar atmosphere, primarily because attention
was focussed on anthropogenic pollutants, and few optical effects such as those
associated with mid- latitude cirrus clouds have been observed. However in the
antarctic atmosphere, clear-sky ice crystal precipitation has consistently been
observed, and at interior stations can account for more than 80 percent of the
annual precipitation. Optical effects, including some quite rare ones, due to
ice crystals are observed frequently at South Pole Station. The climatology of
arctic ice crystal is much less certain. Observations of ice crystals in the
arctic from both the surface and from satellites is difficult, particularly
during the polar night. The occurrence of ice crystals may be noted in the
synoptic present weather code, but more likely will not be noted at all.
Satellite observation of ice crystals, particularly over a snow or ice surface,
or in the polar night, remains an unsolved problem. Recently however this
question has become more prominent as evidence is accumulating that the
horizontal visibility in arctic haze events is significantly less than would be
expected from the scattering characteristics of the haze particles alone, and a
significant ice crystal concentrations seem to be indicated. This project will
develop a cloud microphysics parameterization scheme, based on observations of
ice crystals, chemistry, and meteorological conditions to be made in March and
April 1989. The model output of the radiative flux divergences and heating rates
will be coupled to a thermodynamic sea ice model which will in turn provide
equilibrium sea ice thickness values. This will provide a unique and innovative
look at how ice crystals interact with the chemical, dynamical and radiative
processes in the polar atmosphere.
