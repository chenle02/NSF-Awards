This proposal seeks funding to examine the question of whether women in public
office in the United States have had an impact on the direction of public policy
during the past 25 years. Previous work comparing the behavior of male and
female state representatives has established that women legislators are
different than their male counterparts but it has not determined whether women
make a difference. To demonstrate such an impact this study examines whether (1)
policy change has occurred over time and (2) that change would not have occurred
but for the increasing presence and/or efforts of women in state government.
Trends over time and across states in the introduction, consideration, and
passage of legislation devoted to "women's issues" will be the focus of
attention. Data on all representatives and their legislative activities in 25
state legislatures between 1973 and 1993 will be collected. A simultaneous
equation system is used to model state legislative policy making and will be
tested against the pooled-cross-sectional time series data set of state policy
activity. The study hopes to resolve differences between the effects of
descriptive representation of women and substantive representation of women, The
model on which the project will draw such conclusions should also be easily
applied to the study of political representation of other social, political and
economic groups.
