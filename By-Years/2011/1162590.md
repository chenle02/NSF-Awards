The proposed research lies on the interaction between algebraic geometry and
mathematical physics. Specifically, it concerns the Gromov-Witten (GW) theory
and variation of Hodge structures (VHS) on one side and birational geometry,
algebraic cobordism, and mirror symmetry on the other. The main themes of the
proposal are the functoriality of GW theory under crepant transformations and
the extended functoriality of GW and VHS under extremal transitions (also known
as space-time topology change in the physics literature). &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory lies in the intersection of many exciting
research areas in mathematics and physics. On the one hand, the theory itself
has remarkable structures, both established and conjectural. Investigating these
structures requires some new insights and technical tools and input from other
areas. This provides a lot of interesting problems for classical subjects in
mathematics. On the other hand, these new insights and technical tools help to
discover deep relations and connections between existing mathematics and
theoretical physics, especially the topological string theory.
