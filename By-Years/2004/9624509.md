9624509 Singh This project provides support for an official Chinese Earthquake
engineering delegation to visit several U.S. research institutions during the
summer of 1996. The delegation is made of members from the Chinese Ministry of
Construction and the Earthquake Resistant Office, Yunnan Province where many
damaging earthquakes have occurred in recent years. This project is an important
international cooperative research activity which has been recognized as a cost-
effective means of advancing knowledge base and obtain important data in the
scientific field of earthquake engineering research. Such efforts are effective
because they utilize the complementary strengths of two countries to collect
relevant data, disseminate information and carry out research of mutual interest
with joint human and material resources. This activity is a part of US-PRC
Earthquake Protocol for Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III program which
is jointly administered by ENG/NSF and Ministry of Construction, China. ***
