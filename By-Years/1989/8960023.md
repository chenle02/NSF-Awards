The objective of this program is to synthesize a thin film multilayer composite
material with a magnetoresistive effect up to ten times the magneto-resistance
ratio of permalloy material. A composite iron-chromium multilayer with 25% room
temperature magnetoresistive ratio has been made by molecular beam epitaxy
techniques. This program will build on that work, but will provide a soft
magnetic composite material with low magnetostriction and temperature
coefficient of resistance, which are essential for practical applications. The
multilayers will be sputtered for fast turnaround, alloy composition control,
and may result in rapid commercialization.
