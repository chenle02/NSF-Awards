The object of this proposal is to investigate the effect of gravel-sized
particles on the liquefaction resistance of gravelly-sand specimens. The goal is
to show quantitatively how the liquefaction potential of sand is effected by
inclusion of gravel particles. Since sand is readily accepted as liquefiable bu
most engineers, the liquefaction potential of several gravelly soils will be
compared to that of sand. Case histories and dynamic laboratory testing will be
used to show that gravelly soil is liquefiable.
