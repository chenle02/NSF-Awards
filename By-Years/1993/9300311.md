The purpose of this research is to contribute to our understanding of how
precipitation distributions are established over Africa and South America. The
investigation will be conducted by comparisons among climate models of various
degrees of complexity. Analysis will focus on understanding how the tropical
atmospheric dynamics responds to specified land surface conditions and sea
surface temperature (SST) anomalies, and how this response modifies
precipitation patterns over land. The focus is on using climate models to
illuminate physical mechanisms, not to generate the most realistic simulation
possible. Experiments with a general circulation model (GCM) will be used to
isolate the effects of SST distributions and land surface attributes, such as
soil wetness, surface albedo and roughness, on the continental precipitation
field in the tropics. A linearized version on the GCM will be used to further
diagnose the GCM's response. Comparisons with more complex GCM simulations and
with observations will be used to relate results to the real climate. This
research is important because it attempts to enhance knowledge about how land
surface properties affect climate.
