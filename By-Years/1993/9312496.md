9312496 Eaton Research on the interaction between fluid turbulence and particles
embedded in the flow will be carried out, based on experiments and numerical
modeling. It is a continuation of prior work in which turbulent channel flow was
investigated. Now, a sharp area enlargement will induce separation. Correlations
between turbulence structures and patterns of particle concentration will be
obtained, focusing on the separated region. Flows with engineering relevance
often contain regions of separation. In two phase particulate laden flows,
particle-turbulence interaction in such regions is known to be important but
essentially unexplored. ***
