The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop tools of Molecular
Systems Bioengineering (MSB) and apply them to understand and control gene
regulatory events involved in hepatocyte (primary liver cell) differentiation.
In the first stage of the project, individual binding sites on the albumin gene
promoter will be assessed for liver-enriched transcription factor binding
affinity and their ability to effect transcription of the albumin gene. In
particular, context-dependent effects such as cooperativity and competition
among binding sites will be evaluated quantitatively. Second, a molecular
systems model will be developed to describe the gene network of regulatory
interactions among liver-enriched transcription factor genes and corresponding
proteins. Information on cooperativity and competition will be obtained from the
experiments in the first stage, and the effect of genetic perturbations will be
simulated. In the third stage, perturbations predicted to be fruitful will be
effected using antisense oligonucleotides. Genes predicted to be most inhibitory
to albumin transcription will be inhibited and the effects evaluated at the
level of the gene target, albumin production and complementary hepatocyte
differentiated functions. Concurrently, initiatives will be undertaken to create
an educational path in Molecular Systems Bioengineering at Rutgers University.
An undergraduate track in MSB will be developed in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering, and interactive tutorials will be developed in the undergraduate
core classes, which will be refined for use as translational materials in
introducing high school student and Rutgers freshmen to opportunities in
MSB.&lt;br/&gt;
