This renewal proposal is aimed at a structural study of suspended thin-films of
thermotropic liquid crystals exhibiting a variety of phases intermediate between
isotropic liquid and crystalline solid. The transition from two- to three-
dimensional behavior will be studied in films ranging in thickness from two to
tens-of-thousands of molecules. The study will include an investigation of
interfacial structure in microemulsions, and the transition of some phases to
the long range order of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases.
