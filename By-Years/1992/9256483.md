This project will support five graduate research traineeships over a five year
period in the Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics (SCCM) program
at Stanford University. The program is to provide training and development of
new knowledge in scientific computing. The focus is on the computer as an
integral part of research into either basic theoretical science and engineering
or into significant advances of a practical technological nature. The program
will provide a perspective which incorporates many aspects of scientific
computing through formulation of a model, including mathematical and numerical
analysis, to practical computational aspects such as appropriate computer
architecture.
