This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled,
"Nanotechnology, An Active Learning Experience for Undergraduates," at the
University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM), under the direction of Dr. Miguel E.
Castro, is co-funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers in the
Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). This will be the first course focused
on nanoscale science and engineering at the undergraduate level at UPRM. This
proposed course will have the following five features: 1)introduction of
nanotechnology concepts early in the academic development of sophomore level
science and engineering majors; 2) development and implementation of active
learning activities to assist in the introduction of basic concepts related to
NSE; 3) participation of scientists and engineers from local industries
including Dupont Microelectronics; 4)conducting research in nanotechnology early
in the academic development of undergraduate students, and; 5) interaction of
students early in their undergraduate development with faculty involved in
nanotechnology research at the UPRM Chemical Imaging Center.
