Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, equipment will be
purchased for use in a diverse set of computational research thrusts which model
details important to: chemical vapor deposition, polymer processing, liquid
crystal mixture behavior, and enzyme catalysis. The equipment is a high
performance graphics workstation. The research is relevant to a variety of
engineering systems, ranging over chemical, mechanical, and bio-engineering.
