The growing human population and increasing pressures for development have led
to a variety of challenges for life on our planet, in particular whether current
patterns of human activity are sustainable. Human activity is closely tied to
the natural environment and there is a two-way interconnection between human
activity and environmental processes. Increasingly, we are noting how human
activities affect the systems that sustain life, including climate, healthy air
and water, availability of food. The earth has finite resources that we need to
sustain our life style: sources of energy, clean water, arable land. As
environmental conditions change, there are possibilities for new diseases,
species can move into areas to which they are non-native and crowd out the
species to which we are accustomed, and the human condition can be threatened by
environmental change. Fundamental societal structures such as national
boundaries and the health of our economic systems can be affected by competition
for changing natural resources, shortages and in some cases surpluses. These
problems are complex, multi-disciplinary, and intertwined. They call for a
"science of sustainability."

Recognizing the challenges to life on our planet as we know it, NSF has
initiated a major new initiative on sustainability (SEES) that involves all
directorates in the Foundation. However, to date, the mathematical sciences have
been involved only in a limited way. Yet, there are many mathematical problems
of great complexity, interest, and importance in a wide variety of areas that it
would be important to get the mathematical sciences community to work on. This
project supports a workshop that will describe these mathematical challenges and
that will lead to a report to be circulated widely to the mathematical sciences
community as well as NSF and also its counterpart in Canada, NSERC. The problems
of sustainability cross many disciplines. The mathematical challenges the
project identifies can be expected to lead to research on a wide variety of
topics of great societal importance such as climate change, environmental
health, management of limited natural resources, and the interconnections of
these topics with healthy economic systems and enduring social structures.
