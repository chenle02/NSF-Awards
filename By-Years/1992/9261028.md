This research concerns the development of an advanced computational model for
electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation. The model allows the user to
efficiently and reliably calculate the interaction between a probe and a flaw
within a workpiece. The work will integrate recent research in the areas of
volume-integral and boundary-integral equations in computational
electromagnetics.
