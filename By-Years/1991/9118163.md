This award provides funds to continue COCORP's program of deep seismic
reflection investigation of the continental basement within the United States.
Specifically, during this award period the main activity will involve the
acquisition of an experimental explosive CMP profile within the Williston basin,
the specific goal being to characterize Moho and upper mantle reflectivity in
the region, as part of an ongoing effort to understand the origin of
intracratonic basins. The broader goal is to test whether low-fold explosive
profiling with "super multi-channel" receiver arrays can provide a practical,
and cost-effective means of imaging the lower crust and upper mantle over wide
regions of the cratons. The project will involve Cornell personnel as well as
key outside investigators. The program will continue to take advantage of the
advanced capabilities of Amoco's SGR (Seismic Group Recorder) - equipped
research seismic reflection crew, and for the first time will involve
collaboration with the U.S.G.S. for the collection of explosive data.
