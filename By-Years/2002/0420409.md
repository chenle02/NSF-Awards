With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Physics at SUNY College at Old Westbury will acquire
a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) androgen and glucocorticoid
receptor ligands; b) synthetic analogs of metalloproteins possessing Lewis acid
metallo-cysteinate centers; c) solid state NMR studies on water dynamics in
metal-containing biological crystals; and d) analysis of chemical constituents
in over-the-counter nutraceuticals . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
