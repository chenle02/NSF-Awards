This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research involves
collaboration on problems of singularities and minimal models among several U.S.
and French mathematicians. The program is organized by Vyacheslav Shokurov of
Johns Hopkins University and Arnaud Beauville of the Ecole Normale Superieure in
Paris, France. The awards provides travel and living expenses to ten U.S.
university-based mathematicians for short-term visits to France. The project
addresses problems in classification of higher- dimensional algebraic varieties,
theory of singularities and integrable systems. It takes advantage of
complementary expertise of the U.S. and French mathematicians.
