Gallium Arsenide and related compound semiconductors have progressed from the
R&D to the production stage where manufacturing efforts are being planned and
carried out. The processing of these materials is very different from the
processing of Silicon for integrated circuits. This proposal covers a request
for support of the First U.S. Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology
(USCO/GAMT). A substantial group of leaders in the field, representing U.S.
industry, universities and government, have met and organized for this
conference. Officers have been elected, bylaws have been drawn up, and the time
and place have been set (Orlando, Florida, October 30-31, 1986).
