9410144 Wilson In this project, an analytical modeling methodology and automated
modeling tool is developed for electromechanical systems. The methodology
acknowledges and incorporates the inherent uncertainty involved in models. The
tool accepts a component- based description of an electromechanical systems as
input. These component descriptions, including tolerances, are mapped in to
models whose perameters have tolerances, uncertainty bounds are determined for
both component and system models, and optimal order of system models in
determined. In conventional models, component dimensions and material constants
are approximate, whereas model coefficients are assumed constant. ***
