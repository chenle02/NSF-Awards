Dr. David J. Burkey has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Burkey received his doctoral degree from Vanderbilt University
under the supervision of Professor Timothy Hanusa. Dr. Burkey will continue
research at the University of British Columbia under the sponsorship of
Professor Peter Legzdins. His postdoctoral research will target the
investigation of organometallic transition-metal complexes that contain nitrosyl
ligands. The research explores the effect of having two different neutral
ligands with different bonding characteristics present in the complexes, as well
as the influence of the neutral ligands on stability. The research will
strengthen our fundamental understanding of the observed stability and
reactivity trends of these complexes and will eventually lead to the development
of useful applications. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
