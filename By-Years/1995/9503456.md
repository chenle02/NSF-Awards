An analytical and numerical study to examine the role of shear and irrotational
waves on the formation of Langmuir cells will be conducted. The instability
mechanism giving rise to the vortices has as its basis the Craik-Leibovich type
2 mechanism, because oceanographic observations bring to light limitations with
these equations, they will not be used to describe the flow. Instead the
generalized Lagrangian mean equations of Andrews and McIntyre will employed to
define when the C-L equation is not applicable to the ocean surface mixed layer.
Actual mean currents from ocean and laboratory observations will be used to
estimate heat mass and momentum transport within the mixed layer. This work is
important because Langmuir circulations appear to be an important mixing
mechanism at the air-sea interface.
