The aging of crystals--i.e., the structural changes which occur in crystals
after nucleation and growth have occurred--will be studied. During aging,
recrystallization occurs rapidly in imperfect crystals of sparingly soluble
materials resulting in significant changes in crystal habit and purity. In this
study, the aging of terephthalic acid crystals in water, acetic acid, and DMSO
will be experimentally examined. Theoretical studies to attempt to predict the
aging rate, mechanism, and final crystal shape and purity also will be
conducted.
