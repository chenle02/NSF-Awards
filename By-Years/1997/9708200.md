Form 10 Abstract Proposal AST 97-08200 PI: J. Robert Buchler Institution:
University of Florida, Gainsville This award is to support the attendance of six
graduate students at a Workshop on Long Range Correlations in Astrophysical and
Other Systems, to be held at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, on
20-22 February 1997. The workshop will bring together experts from astrophysics,
plasma physics, condensed matter physics, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
and mathematics to discuss the mechanisms responsible for large scale structure
and long range correlations. Such mechanisms include long range forces (e.g.
Coulomb and gravitational forces), bifurcation in nonlinear dynamics (pattern
formation), self-organized criticality, and violation of detailed balance.
