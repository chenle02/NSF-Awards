The physics department at Luther College will update microcomputer equipment
and improve its contribution to physics instruction throughout the physics
curriculum. First generation KIM and PET microcomputers were introduced
beginning 9 years ago in lower division laboratories and course work. These are
now obsolete, and they will be replaced with PC- XT type computer stations in
order to keep students abreast of important current technology and introduce new
capabilities in the courses. The upper division curriculum will be strengthened
by purchase of new advanced microcomputers: the PC-AT 16-bit microcomputer, and
a 32 bit accelerator board for a Mac-Plus. These will be used to expand
instruction in techniques important to the forefront of physics: modeling of
complex systems, and the numerical solution of problems by computer. The
excellent graphics, very large memory, and high computational speed will permit
a new class of problems to be attacked by our students, and also enable new
student/faculty research opportunities. In addition, a new telescope mount will
be purchased to permit completion of a student-originated research project which
involves the computer control of a 14-inch telescope.
