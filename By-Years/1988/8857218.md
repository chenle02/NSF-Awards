This project is directed at various topics in theoretical high energy
astrophysics, dealing primarily with phenomena in the vicinity of astronomical
compact objects such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, and active galactic nuclei.
It includes models of cosmic gamma-ray burst sources toward understanding the
origin of the optical flashes that are occasionally detected from these systems;
models of the class of cosmic X- ray burst sources whose spectra may be used to
infer the properties of accretion disks in these systems; studying the evolution
of compact binary stars, such as magnetic cataclysmic variables, in which the
coupling of the white dwarf's magnetic field to the companion star affects the
binary's evolutionary history; and studying the nuclei of active galaxies. This
work should increase our understanding of the basic physical processes that
govern the dynamics of the exotic astrophysical objects cited. While no specific
applicability to terrestrial systems is anticipated, some of these processes are
of interest in other areas as well.
