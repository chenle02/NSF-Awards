Selectivity in supercritical fluid extraction will be investigated
experimentally. Solid samples will be placed in a small fixed-bed saturator
through which a mixture of a supercritical solvent and a cosolvent are
circulated. Analysis is by direct injection of the circulating supercritical
fluid into a supercritical-fluid chromatograph. Several approaches to
development of an adequate model will also be explored. Supercritical fluid
extraction is a promising technology for the processing of various foods and
pharmaceuticals since solvent residue is easily removed. This project will
examine complications which arise when more than one component of a mixture
exhibit significant solubility in the supercritical fluid and how the use of a
cosolvent might modify the selectivity.
