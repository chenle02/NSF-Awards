This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
Physics at the University of Texas Brownsville. The site includes a Research
Experience for Teachers (RET) component. The REU and RET site will focus on
research in frontier areas of phenomenological, experimental and applied physics
at state of the art facilities. In gravitational wave astronomy students will be
given a coherent unified view of the field and learn the scientific value of
both the potential wealth of astrophysical information to be obtained from this
new astronomical window and of the challenges posed in developing the
technological expertise necessary at the instrumental level in opening this new
window. In photonics they will learn of the challenges and promises that this
fast evolving discipline holds for new electronics. In biophysics participants
will be exposed to state of the art techniques in one molecule spectroscopy and
in investigations in the role of amino acids in protein structure and function.
In materials science they will learn about thermoelectric materials and their
potential use for renewable energy. In addition, this summer research experience
for undergraduates will have a close mentoring and guidance system from the
faculty in place during the entire duration, fostering interaction and active
participation by students through seminars, lunch meetings, colloquia and
presentations. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in
partnership with the NSF REU program.
