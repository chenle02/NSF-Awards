This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on producing
novel cellulosic aerogels insulation materials for new construction. This
project will focus on producing ultra-lightweight cellulose aerogels with
exceptional high thermal insulation and mechanical performance. In the project
new cellulosic aerogels will be designed and fabricated. Samples will be
characterized by scanning electron microscopy and surface area/ pore size
measurements and then optimized for thermal insulation, mechanical performance
and hydrophobicity.

Commercially, ultra-lightweight and hard cellulose aerogel will be useful not
only as thermal insulator material for building construction but also as a shock
absorbent (military helmet, automobile, etc), in clothing and in space suit
applications. Thermal insulation is a major industry serving a wide range of
residential and industrial application needs. Development of a new super-
insulation material will maximize fuel efficiency in process industries and
reduce heating and utility bills in residential markets.
