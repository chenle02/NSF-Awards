9303152 Ehrich This award provides infrastructure for the support of
laboratories for research in interactive computing, especially as it relates to
human/computer interface studies. The principal investigators are drawn from the
department of Computer Science and the department of Industrial and Systems
Engineering. In addition, there are substantial collaborations with the Naval
Research Laboratory and the Blacksburg Electronic Village. The laboratories are
a Usability Methods Research Laboratory, an Interaction Technology Laboratory,
and an Information Access Laboratory. This award is being jointly funded by the
Cross Disciplinary Activities (CDA) Office and the Information, Robotics, and
Intelligent Systems (IRIS) Division. The Instrumentation for the laboratories is
being supported by CDA while the research is being supported by IRIS. The
specific research performed in the laboratories includes identifying and over
coming usability and conceptional barriers to computing, the development of
evaluation methodologies for determining the effectiveness of human/computer
interfaces, development of environments for performing human/computer interface
experiments, the development of expert-based information systems, the
development of systems for access to computers for disabled users, and
development of systems for access to computers for disabled users, and
development of several domain based interfaces for large data base systems.
