High resolution dental casts can be used to document the pattern of dental
microwear in museum specimens. The primary objective of this proposal is to
document not only the pattern of wear, but its changes and rates over time in a
live primate in the wild. Populations of a New World monkey, Alouatta palliata,
which have been subject to behavioral observation for an extended period will be
trapped and dental impressions taken. The resulting casts will be studied via
scanning electronmicroscope for wear patterns and tooth morphology. Each animal
will be re-cast several times during the course of the study, allowing for
analysis of intra- individual change as a function of changing diet. This work
will allow new insights into the association between diet and toothwear.
