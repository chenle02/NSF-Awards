CDA-9703090 Paul Franzon North Carolina State University CISE Research
Infrastructure: Experimental High Performance Computing and Communications
Systems This award is for the North Carolina State University to establish two
facilities for test and verification of complex digital systems. The first,
larger, facility, to establish as part of the Electronics Research Laboratory,
will include wide bandwidth logic oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and signal
sources, as well as technician support. This facility will support our ongoing
research in Experimental Systems building including Multi-Chip Modules (MCM)
based systems, complex ICs, VLIW and other processors, DSP processors and
communications system building. The second facility will become the ECE Graduate
Design Center. In this center, graduate students will build and test systems in
tight synergy with the ongoing research projects. These students will work on
these projects as part of a year long graduate design courses.
