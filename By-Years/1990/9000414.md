Funding is requested to support the Ninth Dissertations Symposium on Chemical
Oceanography (DISCO) to be held February 198-23, 1990 at the East-West Center,
University of Hawaii campus, Honolulu, Hawaii. Twenty-six chemical oceanography
Ph.D candidates and new doctorates will meet for five days in formal and
informal sessions to present their theses dissertations, contribute to
discussions, participate in working groups, and meet with other attendees and
sponsors to discuss their work and future activities. The sponsors, NSF, ONR and
NOAA, will delineate the federal government programs in chemical oceanography
and present avenues of potential support. The proceedings will be published.
This will be the ninth in a series of symposia jointly supported by the National
Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
