Utah Valley State College requests support from NSF to connect three Native
American Community Colleges institutions of higher education and one museum to
the Internet. These include: Provo College, Provo, UT, Northwest Indian college,
Washington, Institute of American Indian Arts, Santa Fe, NM, and Fort Peck
Community College, Poplar, Montana. This grant will be used to help the
institutions get access to the Internet. Utah Valley State College will be using
Digital Wave Modulation and V+Chip Advanced Television Decoding as a method of
providing lower cost access to the Internet and delivery of educational courses
and programs. These rural Native American institutions needs the Internet
connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
these institutions as well as the community in general.
