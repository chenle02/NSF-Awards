The PI's will delineate the involvement of intermediate water circulation
changes in relation to the initiation of northern hemisphere glaciation by
monitoring "middle" Pliocene circulation in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans with
benthic foraminifera C-13 comparisons. Three depth transect will be used to
reconstruct intermediate water during the middle Pliocene: the Rio Grande Rise
(DSDP Leg 72), the Queensland Plateau (Leg 133) and the Bahamas.
