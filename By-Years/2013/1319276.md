Many problems involve multiply-connected moving interfaces, including liquid and
solid foams, coarsening in materials, complex mixing in fluids, and evolving
cell structures in biology. These problems have multiple domains which share
common walls meeting in multiple junctions. Boundaries move under forces which
depend on both local and global geometric properties, such as surface tension
and volume constraints, as well long-range physical forces, including
incompressible flow, membrane permeability, and elastic
forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed toward developing,
implementing, and applying new numerical methods for propagating multiphase
interfaces in a complex physical settings. One of the central computational
tools will be the recently developed Voronoi Implicit Interface Methods, which
is a mathematical perspective and associated numerical methodology for tracking
interfaces in general multiphase problems. These methods offer accurate,
consistent, and efficient schemes for multi-dimensional coupled multiphase,
which handle complex triple joints/junction, topological change, and naturally
couple to complex physics. The investigator and his colleagues will develop new
algorithmic tools for multiphase coupled transport problems, and will apply
these techniques to computing solid and liquid foams, as well as manufacturing
techniques for new materials, providing new methods to compute, refine, and
optimize the design and performance cf complex materials.
