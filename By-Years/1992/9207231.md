One of the strongest generalizations in ornithology is that birds that lay
later in the season tend to lay fewer eggs per clutch. There is considerable
disagreement over the causes of this pattern. One school maintains that the
seasonal decline is a nonadaptive consequences of variation in female condition,
which has an overriding effect both on timing of laying and clutch size. The
other school sees seasonal clutch size declines as an adaptive response to
variation in food availability for the laying female or seasonally declining
prospects for rearing offspring. It is proposed to distinguish between these
possibilities in three ways. One experiment will test for the effect of food
supply for the laying female by decreasing the foraging profitability and the
condition of the female prior to laying and looking for predicted shifts in
timing of laying and clutch size. A second experiment will alter the timing of
chick-rearing. If condition has the overwhelming effect on chick-rearing
success, then the manipulation will have no effect on offspring production
across groups. If, on the other hand, the breeding environment has a predominant
effect, offspring production will vary across groups. A statistical test will
take data on condition, clutch size, and laying date, and, through partial
regression analysis, look for a significant effect of laying date on clutch size
once condition is controlled for. In all these tests, condition will be measured
in terms of fat and protein stores with the aid of newly developed
nondestructive techniques. These results should be of interest not only to
physiological ecologists interested in the interaction between body condition
and avian histories, but also to population biologists interested in life
history variation.
