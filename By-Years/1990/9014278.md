This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Mathematical Behavioral Sciences. The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding
senior and junior investigators who come from a diverse set of disciplinary
backgrounds, but who share a common interest in the use of mathematical models
in the study of cognition and related phenomena. The research programs in which
trainees will participate are aimed at investigation of axiomatic and
foundational issues, and at modeling behavioral phenomena from psychophysics,
decision making, cognition processes and social networks. The funds will provide
stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will defray part of the
cost of the trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend scientific
meetings. In addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research
equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring visiting faculty from other
research and academic institutions to provide specialized seminars and
coursework. Traditionally, the study of behavior has been undertaken by
investigators in a number of distinct disciplines, often defined by the subjects
with which the behavior deals. Thus there are important behavioral aspects to
the study of economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, risk
management and decision science, among others. Because of the considerable
specialized knowledge required by each discipline and the differing arenas in
which the behavior may occur, it has been difficult for investigators to
identify underlying commonalities in behavior patterns. Increasingly, the use of
mathematical models is providing an important approach for identifying such
commonalities and for providing a means for applying principles recognized in
one discipline to the problems of another. The training program funded by this
award will produce researchers able to bridge disciplines and to bring the full
power of mathematics to bear on a large variety of problems in the social and
cognitive sciences.
