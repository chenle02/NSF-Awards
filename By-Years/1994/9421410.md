This project aims at describing and explaining the morpho- syntactic changes of
Chinese from the third century A.D. to the present. The investigators have
examined a large number of texts, selecting at least one appropriate item best
representing the vernacular language for each century from the third century
A.D. to the present, and have carried out preliminary investigation into the
diachronic change of a number of morpho-syntactic structures. A total of twenty-
three texts have been chosen, and they constitute the source of empirical data
for the project. On the basis of the empirical data from the selected vernacular
texts, the PIs will describe the diachronic development of a dozen morpho-
syntactic structures in Chinese over the three-year course of this project. The
ultimate goal of the project is to prepare a historical grammar of Chinese
covering seventeen centuries of morpho-syntactic change. On the one hand, the
grammar will serve as a reference tool for linguists as well as sinologists
specializing in Chinese literature, history and cultural studies, on the other
hand it will provide the first overall view of the diachronic drift of an
isolating language which has endured two thousand years without changing its
prototypical isolating status.
