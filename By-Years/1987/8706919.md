The objective of this project is temperature measurement in grinding using
infrared sensors. Precision machining of ceramic and other hard materials is
predominantly carried out by Diamond and Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) grinding. The
high temperatures produced in the grinding wheel and workpiece is a topic of
considerable interest because of its significant influence on the surface
integrity, the mechanical and physical properties of the finished surface and
wheel wear. A critical need is shown to exist for precise measurement of these
temperatures. This project is directed towards measurement of wheel and
workpiece temperatures in fine grinding and creep feed grinding using a new
Indium-Antimonide infrared sensor. This sensor is of the non-contact type and
has an excellent frequency response that is uniquely suited to measure even
transient temperatures. By sensing the temperature of cutting points around the
wheel, novel methods for adaptive control of thermal grinding damage in the
workpiece and detection of wheel wear (wheel geometric errors) are proposed. The
latter will enable in-process compensation of wheel errors in automated grinding
systems. Besides, by studying the effect of various grinding fluids on wheel
temperature, this sensor can be used to quantitatively and rapidly evaluate the
performance of grinding fluids. The infrared sensor also offers enormous
potential for temperature measurements in other machining and tribological
situations.
