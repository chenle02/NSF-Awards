Indiana University of Pennsylvania requests support from NSF for connection of
its campus network to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Indiana University of Pennsylvania
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The university needs greater functionality and
network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
