This research concerns the development and analysis of numerical algorithms for
the solution of eigenvalue and singular value problems, with applications to
least squares and total least squares problems. Much of the work grows out of
perturbation theory for generalized singular value problems. This theory is also
applicable to certain generalized eigenvalue problems. The theory will thus be
applied to algorithm development for various singular value and least squares
problems. Specific problems to be addressed are 1. Development and analysis of
methods for computing the sparse generalized singular value decomposition. 2. A
more accurate procedure for computing a bidiagonal reduction of a matrix. This
is the first step in the most efficient stable methods for computing the
singular value decomposition. 3. An algorithm for the eigenvectors of symmetric
arrow matrices that requires less communication on distributed architectures. 4.
An algorithm for the solution of recursive total least squares problems using
rank--revealing decompositions.
