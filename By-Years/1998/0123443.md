Chanover, Nancy J.&lt;br/&gt;AST-0087111&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced
Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force
will be used with an Acousto-Optics Tunable Filter (AOTF) instrument provided by
the principal investigator to study in detail, the dynamics, vertical structure
and thermal balance of the atmospheres of the gaseous outer planets Jupiter and
Saturn. Graduate students and undergraduate students will participate in all
aspects of the project. Hyperspectral images at the high spatial resolution (20
milliarcseconds) provided by the adaptive optics of the AEOS will be used to
create data at different elevations in the planetary atmosphere and for
different interacting molecular species of gas and for atmosperic aerosols.
These data will be analyzed to determine the origins of the colors observed on
the planetary disk and to understand physical and chemical aspects of the
atmospheres of these planets. &lt;br/&gt;***
