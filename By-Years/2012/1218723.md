Pseudorandomness and randomness extraction are motivated by the amazing utility
of randomness in computing. When simulating complex phenomena, such as the
weather or the economy, it is standard to include random components. Computer
security is impossible without randomness. In practice, however, it is expensive
to get truly random numbers, if it is possible at all. What can we do with a
small amount of high-quality randomness, or a large amount of low-quality
randomness? Pseudorandom generators are designed to attack the first question,
and randomness extractors the second. The PI proposes to strengthen
constructions of these fundamental objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only will
this help advance computer science, but it could enable progress in other fields
of science which use randomized simulations. Moreover, constructions of such
pseudorandom objects often have unexpected applications. For example, the PI
recently showed how related pseudorandom objects -- ``expander graphs" -- can be
used to construct financial derivatives that cannot be significantly
manipulated. A more common application area is cryptography, the mathematical
foundation of computer security.
