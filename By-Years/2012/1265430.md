This planning grant at Virginia Union University seeks to develop a strategy to
establish a major program in Physics and Pre-Engineering in the School of
Mathematics, Science and Technology. This project is in support of the
institution's strategic plan and focuses on an assessment for long-term plans.
Implementation plans will be developed through meetings, workshops and
consultations with both internal and external evaluators. The planning process
will include a self-study of the science, technology, and mathematics
undergraduate programs, survey students and alumni, visit institutions with
successful Physics and Pre-Engineering programs, and establish relationships
with institutions who offer advanced degrees in engineering to examine
reinstatement of a dual-degree engineering program at Virginia Union University.

The project has great potential to positively impact the number of
underrepresented minority students pursuing both undergraduate and advanced
degrees in Physics and Engineering. The project also proposes to engage the
private sector and national labs to ensure that workforce needs are
appropriately addressed.
