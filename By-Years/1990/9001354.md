The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of modifying
Bacillus expression systems which will allow vegetative cells to continuously
produce and secrete proteins. Very little is known about the capabilities of
vegetative cells to synthesize and secrete proteins. The modified expression
systems could serve as a basis for new recombinant DNA technology for efficient
production of commercially important Bacillus exoenzymes and heterologous
foreign proteins.
