Studies in Dr. Little; laboratory strongly suggest that laminin plays a
fundamental role in the mesenchymal cell migrations during cardiac development.
Based on this work, he hypothesizes that laminin is one of the components to
which mesenchymal cells adhere during their migration through cell-free regions
of the early embryonic heart. The general goal of this proposal is to
investigate this possibility using stage 6-12 chicken embryos. Specifically, Dr.
Little proposes: 1) To purify chicken laminin for immunogen, then to isolate
antibodies which recognize the various laminin chains (A, B1, B2). 2) to
partially characterize chicken laminin. 3) to use recombinant DNA probes,
derived from the mouse laminin gene, as a means of isolating hybridization
probes to the chicken laminin gene. 4) To use the immunological and
hybridization probes a means of determining the spatial and temporal
distribution of laminin and its mRNA in early chicken hearts. 5) To investigate
the cell biological effects of perturbing cell surface:laminin adhesion by use
of the Tyr-Ile- Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) laminin-derived peptide. and 6) To monitor
cell surface interactions by immunolabeling specific cell adhesion molecules
(N-CAM, A-CAM and the 67 kDa laminin receptor molecule) in untreated embryonic
hearts, and hearts after injection with YIGSR. %%% The developing chicken heart
is an excellent model system for studying the control of cell migration and
adhesion. Cell migration and adhesion are driving influences in the embryonic
development of animals. This study will provide valuable insights into these
processes.
