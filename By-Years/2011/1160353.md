This engineering education research project seeks to better understand how
faculty can provide meaningful and effective feedback to engineering students
who are engaged in complex design projects. Providing good and timely feedback
can have a significant impact on learning, yet little is known about how to
structure or provide effective feedback during team based engineering design
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project will be to help instructors more effectively provide feedback to student
engineering teams. This feedback will broadly support learning, and by targeting
instructors can have a disproportionate impact on the number of students
affected. The project also aligns with national priorities in engineering
education. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the
frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities
and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
