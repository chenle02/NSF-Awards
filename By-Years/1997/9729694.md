Project Abstract In many economic situations, bilateral contracting imposes
external effects on third parties. For example: A shareholder tendering his
shares to a corporate raider who is superior to the firm's incumbent management
increasing the probability of takeover, thereby benefiting the firm's other
shareholders. A creditor exchanging debt for equity in a distressed firm reduces
the probability of bankruptcy, thereby benefiting the firm's other creditors. A
buyer of a VCR increases the market for video rentals, thereby benefiting the
owners of compatible VCRs. A merger of competing firms increases the market
price, thereby benefiting other firms in the market. A private contributor to a
public good benefits other consumers of the good. A buyer signing an exclusive
dealing contract reduces the potential for future competition in the market,
thereby hurting other buyers. A manufacturer selling his output to a retailer
reduces the price in the downstream market, thus hurting competing retailers. In
all these instances, the contracting parties' failure to take external effects
into account may give rise to socially inefficient outcomes. This project
develops a general model of contracting with externalities which unifies the
examples listed above, and illuminates the general nature of arising
inefficiencies. In particular, the dependence of the arising distortions depend
on various assumptions, including the number of parties involved, the nature
bargaining among them, their ability to make discriminatory offers, and the set
of contracts available to them. This analysis has numerous implications for the
optimal design of property rights and contracting procedures in environments
with externalities. Applications include those from finance (bankruptcies and
takeovers), industrial organization (vertical and horizontal contracting and
mergers), and property law (the design of legal entitlements).
