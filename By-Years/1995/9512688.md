Laser cooling and trapping experiments with ultracold samples of Li atoms are
undertaken to study 1) quantum statistical effects in a weakly interacting,
degenerate gas and 2) photoassociation into bound molecular states. Li is well
suited to these studies since it possesses stable isotopes obeying both Bose-
Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics.
