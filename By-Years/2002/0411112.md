Although research shows that law officers benefit from higher education, the
educational barriers they face are persistent, and, in comparison to other
professionals, they are much less likely to seek postsecondary education. To
reduce these barriers and increase the numbers of law officers pursuing higher
education, this work is undertaking a 12-month process to plan the Vollmer
project. Its main tasks are to: 1) identify curriculum, programs, and learning
modules demonstrating alternative pedagogies that could reduce barriers; 2)
design a comprehensive learning environment that will meet the needs of
undergraduates who also are criminal justice professionals; 3) develop an action
plan to implement the curriculum reform; and 4) design a database to collect
information regarding the learners' experience in the Vollmer project. The
project has the potential to increase the number of police officers continuing
their careers with stronger skills. It is also providing a replicable model for
other community colleges and law enforcement agencies as they work together to
build a workforce that will meet heightened security challenges across the
country.
