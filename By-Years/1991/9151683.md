This project proposes to educate undergraduate students in the selection,
installation and use of mechanical sensors and transducers interfaced with a
microcomputer, accomplished through the modernization and enhancement of an
existing sophomore Manufacturing Processes Laboratory. The project focuses on
the fundamental mechanical quantities of importance to the manufacturing
processes of milling, turning, drilling and grinding. Through a series of four
new experiments, students learn about mechanical transducers and specifically
the use of force and torque transducers with computerized data acquisition for
the monitoring of forces, torques and vibrations. They visualize the difference
between static and dynamic loading and are able to corroborate the related
lecture material on cutting forces, energy and chatter. The major equipment
includes two piezoelectric load rings for experiments on static and dynamic
force measurements, a piezoelectric dynamometer suitable for milling, turning
and grinding for applied experiments on cutting forces and energy, a
piezoelectric dynamometer suitable for drilling for applied experiments on
cutting torques and energy, four charge amplifiers to support the piezoelectric
transducers, a microcomputer-based data acquisition system and software for
real-time monitoring of the data.
