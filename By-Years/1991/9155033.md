The Oklahoma State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics for 36 students
entering grades 9 and 10. The program will consist of morning lectures in
mathematics, statistics and the philosophy and ethics of science with afternoon
laboratory experiences in biology, chemistry and physics. Participants will be
divided into three groups of twelve to rotate through the afternoon laboratory
sciences, and all 36 students will spend the first 2 weeks of the camp attending
the sessions on mathematics, statistics and philosophy. During Week 3 the
students will cover career exploration and visits to various laboratories on the
campus of the Oklahoma State University. Evening programs to include astronomic
observations as well as time to visit the library and to work on class
assignments will be arranged. In addition, a trip to the Omniplex -- a science
museum and planetarium in Oklahoma City -- is planned for one of the Saturdays
during the project.
