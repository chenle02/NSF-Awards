This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site award to Michigan
State Universityâ€™s Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), located in Hickory Corners,
MI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of
2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools
with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be
trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted,
professional development and leadership skills, and many will present the
results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will
be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the
program in order to determine their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU
students at KBS will conduct research to understand how organisms and ecosystems
respond to global changes, in a time when this knowledge is more essential than
ever. In a close knit community of researchers and other STEM professionals at a
beautiful field station on Gull Lake, REU students will benefit from regular
interactions with scholars and summer program participants, participation in
professional development workshops, and leadership, inclusion, and research
ethics trainings. They will also practice communicating their science to a wide
variety of audiences and participate in an end-of-summer research symposium.
Applications for summer sessions are reviewed by the Academic Programs
Coordinator and primary mentors on a rolling basis between January and March.
Mentors come from departments of Integrative Biology, Plant Biology, Fisheries
and Wildlife, and Plant, Soil, and Microbial Sciences. Research projects range
from examining how different agricultural practices change greenhouse gases
emitted from soil, to long-term population dynamics of painted turtles under a
warming climate. Students leave with an understanding of how science is
conducted, and how it informs pressing issues like those we face in the
Anthropocene. More information is available by visiting:

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
