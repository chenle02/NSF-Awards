The reaction of hydrogen atoms with ozone generates hydroxyl radicals (OH) in
vibrational levels between v=5 and 9. This reaction occurs naturally in the
upper region of the mesophere, generating strong infrared flourescence from the
vibrationally excited OH. In this altitude region, the intensity and spectrum of
the emission depend on both the radiative and the collisional properties of the
vibrationally excited OH. Under a previous grant the PI developed new laser-
based methods of measuring the rate constants and relaxation pathways of these
highly vibrationally excited radicals. In the work supported by this grant the
new technique will be applied to determining OH rate constants that are at
atmospheric importance and directly applicable to the conditions encountered by
the excited OH in the mesosphere. These experiments are technically challenging,
but the experimental technique has been shown to be feasible, and important
quantitative measurements can be extracted.
