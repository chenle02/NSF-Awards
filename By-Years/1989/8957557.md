Dr. Robert Hanson is being given the Presidential Young Investigator Award from
the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program to support his research into the
development of stereochemical control from both experimental and theoretical
viewpoints. This work will provide the information required to synthesize the
new generation of molecules needed by agriculture and industry. Dr. Hanson is
the first chemistry Presidential Young Investigator from an undergraduate
institution (RUI). The research will include: (1) the development of highly
stereoselectice reagents for synthesis, (2) the development of directly
predictive as well as descriptive measures of "reagent selectivity", "substrate
selectivity", and "reagent control", (3) the development of a rational approach
to the design of reagents for the kinetic resolution of enantiomers, (4) the
extension of "multiplicative" reaction models to situations involving more than
two chiral components, (5) the development and use of enantiomerically enriched
reagents to impart regioselectivity in the reactions of enantiomerically pure
substrates, and (6) the development of conformational analogues of
stereoselective reactions.
