This grant provides partial support for graduate students to attend the 1991
Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics. The theme of the
conference is "Ceramics with Super Electrical and Super Mechanical Properties"
and the goal is to bring together members of the electronic and structural
ceramics community to discuss advanced scientific topics of mutual interest. The
students will benefit from the opportunity to associate with some of the most
respected members of their field.
