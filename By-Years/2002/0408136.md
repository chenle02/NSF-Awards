This SGER proposal seeks to develop and simulate heuristic scheduling algorithms
to efficiently map tasks to heterogeneous cluster systems in grid environments.
Two approaches will be taken to the algorithm development and investigation:
list scheduling and clustering. The list scheduling approach involves
intelligent matching of tasks to cluster components, prioritizing critical tasks
in the list, and duplicating task duplication where appropriate. Task
duplication will be the subject of specific study, in analyzing tradeoffs in the
cost of duplication against overall performance gains. Performance bounds will
be calculated for developed schedules, and the schedules will be evaluated using
random Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
