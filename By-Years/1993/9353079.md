9353079 Edwards The Dallas Independent School District, in partnership with the
City of Dallas and its diverse communities, seeks to implement a one year self
study/planning grant which will result in a plan for systemic change in science,
mathematics and technology education. Ten site-based School Centered Education
(SCE) planning groups will meet by area to conduct area self studies. Concurrent
meetings of identified stakeholders will assess the needs of higher education,
technical education and the workforce. The groups will meet to identify and
develop strategies that will result in an increase in student enrollment and
achievement in mathematics and science classes and successfully impact those
entering college and the workforce. Recommendations from these groups will form
the basis of a comprehensive plan for systemic reform in the Dallas Independent
School District. ***
