9301666 Sanchez This Americas Program award will support a workshop on
magnetism, magnetic alloys, and their applications. The workshop, organized by
Prof. Juan M. Sanchez of the University of Texas at Austin, and Prof. Jose L.
Moran-Lopez of the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi, Mexico, has as
primary objectives to provide an up-to-date and in-depth review of the subject;
foster the direct interaction between U.S., European, and Latin American
scientists; and explore areas of common interest in magnetic materials between
the common interest in magnetic materials between the Latin American and U.S.
communities. The workshop will involve the participation of approximately 30
leading authorities in magnetic materials and magnetism from the U.S., Europe
and Latin America. The workshop addresses an area of significant current
interest in terms of fundamental aspects and technological issues. The advent of
new materials, advanced processing and synthesis techniques, and new
characterization methodologies have set a brisk pace of development in this
area. All participants are likely to benefit from the interaction with
researchers having a broad range in the subject of magnetism and magnetic
materials. ***
