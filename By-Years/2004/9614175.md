9614175 Papitashvili This project is the continuation of a joint U.S.-Russian
program to operate an array of high latitude automated magnetometers in
Antarctica. These instruments will be used to investigate polar cap current
systems in the Earth's magnetosphere. The antarctic continent is uniquely suited
to these investigations because it is the only land mass at very high latitudes,
and is therefore an excellent and stable location for an array of magnetometers.
These investigations are particularly important to the understanding of the
coupling of energy and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere,
ionosphere, and upper atmosphere. The data will also prove extremely useful for
analyses coordinated with a number of satellite-based experiments that are
currently in progress, or are planned for the near future. The specific tasks to
be undertaken include design improvements in the digital geomagnetic data
acquisition systems at Vostok and Mirny, and the continued operation and
maintenance of autonomous stations along the Russian traverse route to Vostok.
One improvement will be to add a satellite data transmission capability at the
Vostok so that a polar cap magnetic index will be available in near real-time
for space weather and research applications. ***
