9322123 Hunten The impacts of the pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 should
generate strong waves and fronts and produce chemical changes in Jupiter's
stratosphere. Wave propagation is highly diagnostic of the thermal and
compositional structure of the atmosphere and interior. Dr. Hunten and a group
of colleagues will use mid-infrared wavelength spectroscopy and imaging to
characterize the waves due to changes in the stratospheric heating and cooling
and in chemical compounds.
