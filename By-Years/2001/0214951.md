This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a miniaturized fast-response oxygen sensor. Fuel efficiency
of automotive engines and power generating systems improve when operated under
lean-burn conditions. Oxygen monitoring in industrial processes promise higher
productivity while effective fire fighting requires information regarding local
combustion conditions. These applications all require in-situ oxygen sensors
that combine rapid response, sensitivity, selectivity, resistance to fouling,
and thermal and chemical robustness. The firm proposes to develop an Oxygen
Sensor by combining key innovations including (1) unique thin-film
semiconducting metal-oxides (SMO) sensitive to oxygen concentration in the
0.001-21 percent range, with rapid (10-100 ms) response time, and temperature
insensitivity in the 700-1000....C range, and (2) refractory SiC microhotplate
gas sensor platform capable of operating to 1000....C, with only 20 mW power
consumption.

Commercial application of the proposed oxygen sensors includes automotive and
aeronautic propulsion systems, power generation, incineration, food packaging
technology, and fire fighting.
