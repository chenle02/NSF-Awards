*** 9660037 Ayres This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
eliminate the hazards of silane cylinders by investigating the feasibility of
producing silane with an on-site gas generator. The generator will produce
silane on-demand at low pressure ( 20-40 psig), and with low hold-up volume (2
liters). The generator will be much safer than cylinder silane (1250 psig, 3500
liters storage volume per cylinder) and eliminate the need for storage of large
numbers of cylinders. Semiconductor manufacturing requires the deposition of
silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride layers. These steps are applied to
products as diverse VLSI circuits, memory chips, flat panel active matrix
displays, photocopier drums, and large area solar cells. All of these processes
require silane gas (SiH4). Silane is spontaneously flammable in air, has a
toxicity exposure limit of 0.5 ppm, and explosively reacts with halogens such as
chlorine. Silane is the largest volume pyrophoric gas used by the semiconductor
industry. These factors make silane use dangerous in semiconductor fabrication
facilities where large quantities are stored in hundreds of high pressure
compressed gas cylinders. These cylinders are inherent sources of danger because
of the possibility of gas release during transportation, storage, and handling.
Evacuating a semiconductor facility due to a silane cylinder leak disrupts
production and is very expensive. Semiconductor companies expend significant
amounts on preventing and containing possible leaks from silane cylinders. These
expenditures add to manufacturing costs, and decrease the competitive position
of U.S. semiconductor companies. An on-site, point-of-use silane gas generator
would be widely purchased by major semiconductor manufacturing companies to
eliminate the environmental liability of transporting and using silane gas
cylinders. ***
