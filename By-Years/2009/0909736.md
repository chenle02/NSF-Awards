"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Carol Korzeniewski of Texas
Tech University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
the Division of Chemistry to investigate the processes that limit charge
transfer during the conversion of chemical bond energy into electricity in
electrocatalytic reactions. The proposed research is focused on two areas:
catalysis of reactions relevant to fuel cells, and the impact of Nafion on
catalysis as it adsorbs to noble metal catalyst sites. SEIRAS will be used to
characterize the species at and near the surface; voltammetry will be used to
examine the kinetics of the reactions of interest; and modeling will integrate
this information to develop detailed and fundamental understanding of the
dynamics of the surface reactions. The new knowledge gained on interfacial
charge transfer processes would have broad applications in energy conversion
processes such as fuel cells, corrosion, adhesion and signal transduction in
electrical sensors. The educational activities involve the training of graduate
and undergraduate students, and outreach plans towards women and girls at K-12
through the Texas Tech University sponsored science and engineering outreach
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
