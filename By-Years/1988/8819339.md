This award provides support for planning a Technology Transfer Center (TTC) at
The Williamsport Area Community College (W.A.C.C.) The four main functions of
W.A.C.S.'s Technology Transfer Center will be: 1. to provide assistance to
industry to help them develop midrange (1-5 year) technology strategies. 2.
address the proactive training needs of industries attempting to implement
emerging/enabling CIM technologies. 3. provide a site where customized
hard/software can be implemented and where CIM hard/software can be studied. 4.
provide a sustaining support system that ensures the continued enhancement of
long-term technology strategies and training needs. To accomplish these
objectives close cooperation between W.A.C.C. and research universities,
industry, and vendors of both hard and software must be developed.
