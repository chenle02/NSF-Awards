This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a
software system for performing uncertainty analysis of manufacturing process
models. When the models are large, or when there are many parameters, even the
best Monte Carlo, or importance based sampling methods for uncertainty analysis
can be prohibitively expensive. One consequence is that systematic uncertainty
analyses are often never carried out. This project will implement a new method
for uncertainty analysis, based on polynomial chaos expansions, that can
determine the probability density functions of the response and can identify
which of the parameters contribute most to uncertainties in outcomes.

The commercial potential of this project has broad application to such fields as
circuit design, risk management, allocation of experimental resources, chemical
plant design and operation of production systems.
