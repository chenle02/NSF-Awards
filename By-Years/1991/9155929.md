An Active-Learning Curriculum for Computer Science This project is producing a
series of learning modules designed to help students to develop the problem
solving skills central to doing computer science. Each module is a collection of
interactive visualizations and related materials centered around a fundamental
concept in computer science. Typical materials include a student guide and a
teacher's guide, the code for the visualization programs, manipulative materials
such as games or puzzles, a collection of exercises, suggested closed labs and
programming projects, and a Hypercard stack containing an explanation of the
module's central topic and an annotated bibliography. The code portion of the
modules is carefully designed to teach basic software engineering principles,
both directly and by example. Manipulative materials allow the students to gain
an intuitive feeling for the problem to be solved. Visualizations illustrate the
central topic, a programming construct, a data structure, or an algorithm. Each
program is designed individually, so that the graphic animation best represents
the desired concept, and the user interface allows for interactive user
experimentation. The visualizations can also be used to demonstrate concepts in
lectures. The Hypercard stacks give background information and in-depth
explanations that students can explore at their own pace. All software is being
developed on Macintosh computers in THINK Pascal using QuickDraw. Students have
access to the source code, for reading and for reuse in their own projects.
