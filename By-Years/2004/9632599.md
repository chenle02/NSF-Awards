9632599 Davidovits, This project is a laboratory investigation of heterogeneous
reactions important to the chemistry of the atmosphere. In collaboration with
Aerodyne Research, Inc., the investigators have developed two techniques for
studying gas uptake processes and measuring mass accommodation coefficients of
trace atmospheric species on water and other liquids. In the first method,
suitable for measuring relatively large gas uptakes, the gas phase species
interacts with a controllable stream of small monodispersed droplets of known
size, temperature, and chemical composition. In the second method, used to study
gases with relatively smaller uptakes, the trace gas is contained in controlled
bubbles entrained in a flow of the liquid of interest. In this project, gas
uptake and co-deposition studies for nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrate
radical, dinitrogen pentoxide, nitric acid, nitrous acid, ammonia, sulfur
dioxide, formaldehyde, and hydroxyl radical will be carried out as a function of
temperature with aqueous solutions, sulfuric acid and nitrosyl sulfuric acid
solutions. The effect of photochemistry, surface charge, and atmospherically
relevant additives will be examined. These data will eventually lead to a
general, predictive understanding of chemistry at the gas-liquid interface. ***
