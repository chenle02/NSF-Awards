Research activities in Antarctica of the Division of Polar Programs of the
National Science Foundation (NSF) are provided logistics support from NSF
facilities in Christchurch, New Zealand. Components of this logistics support
are the U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica and its subordinate commands, an
NSF civilian U.S. contractor, and smaller contractors and vendors in New
Zealand. In order to ensure that all required resources are in place and
operational when needed, NSF is seeking a study to review and analyze the
current support arrangements and costs and to determine the optimal mix of
resources and the probable costs of that mix. In addition, the study will
recommend feasible trade-offs between various means or sources of logistics
support. This action provides the first incremental funding for this study.
