Melting of the mantle can be investigated through experiments that simulate the
conditions and the composition of the mantle. The basalts that erupt on the sea
floor and the melts produced in experiments can be compared to imply the depth
of melting, the amount of melting of the mantle and temperatures in the mantle.
The principal investigator proposes to continue experiments with a new and
innovative technique that has already been used successfully. These experiments
will lead to a better understanding of melt generation in the mantle.
