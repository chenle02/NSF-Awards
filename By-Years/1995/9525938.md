9525938 Crosby The moss flora of China, with over 2500 species (about 25% of all
the mosses in the world) is the richest and the most diverse in the Northern
Temperate zone. Despite its size and diversity, there is little information Abu
this flora outside of China. This project is collaborative and international,
and involves the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Cooperative planning and participation of American bryologists and Chinese
authors are major features of the research. The aim of the project is to publish
basic, authoritative and up to date information, in English, on the names,
relationships, characteristics and geographical distributions of all mosses that
grow in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The entire project will result in
eight printed volumes, a Hypertext version on CD-ROM, and a variety of on-line
computerized information services, including WWW and gopher servers at the
Missouri Botanical Garden. This particular award covers the first four of the
eight volumes of information.
