This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at developing novel
adaptive signal processing techniques to be used in the design of hands-free
telecommunication systems. Many of the telecommunication systems like car
phones, desktop teleconferencing systems, videoconferencing applications depend
heavily on the use of hands-free technology, that is, the ability to communicate
without having to continuously hold a device. However, the elimination of the
handset introduces some technical difficulties. The acoustic environment in
which the hands-free system is placed is in general, much more complex than the
line environment that the present technology is capable of handling. Two of the
most important artifacts that accompany hands-free systems are acoustic echoes
(which are more complicated than the line echoes, due to the complexity of the
environment) and noise (which is a common problem in almost all kinds of
communication systems, but is even more pronounced for hands-free systems). The
techniques that will be developed in Phase I aim at solving the acoustic echo
cancellation problem. The adaptive techniques developed are also expected to be
applicable, with appropriate modifications, to noise cancellation. The main
objective of the Phase I effort is to determine the feasibility of using the
wavelet transform in adaptive echo cancellation. Better performance and a
reduction in the complexity of the overall system is expected, together with a
reduced cost.
