The International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO)
will provide continued support for some international activities which generally
benefit physical oceanography and U.S. physical oceanography in particular.
These activities include the convening of a General Assembly every four years in
conjunction with the International Union of Geology and Geophysics (IUGG). The
IAPSO President and Secretary, both of whom are presently U.S. oceanographers,
will be the primary planners for the next IAPSO General Assembly in 1991. IAPSO
will also co-sponsor other physical oceanographic meetings of mutual interst to
other international proffessional geosciences associations as well.
