9352275 Lester A new laboratory course in cellular and molecular neuroscience
has been established that is specifically tailored to undergraduate instruction,
and uses the latest techniques and concepts in the molecular biology of
excitable cells. The course emphasizes (1) the molecular biological and fine-
structure function of the "excitability proteins" of neuronal and other
membranes, (2) the nature of the intracellular signaling pathways that are
activated by cell-surface receptors, and (3) the nature of the intracellular
signaling pathways that are activated by cell-surface receptors. Most
experiments take place in 2 sessions. In the first session, students begin with
a cDNA clone encoding an ion channel or receptor. The students use PCR to
generate an optimal DNA, suitable for in vitro cRNA synthesis, and carry out the
cRNA synthesis reaction. The students inject the cRNA into Xenopus oocytes. In
the second session, the students perform electrophysiological and
pharmacological measurements on the injected oocytes. The initial sessions
concentrate on relatively simple manipulations such as intracellular recording;
then advance to 2-electrode voltage clamp and, finally, to patch-clamp
experiments. Provisions are made for maximal utilization of the requested
equipment in undergraduate research projects during the terms when the course is
not offered formally. ***
