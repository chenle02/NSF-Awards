This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 120 exemplary mathematics teachers from the western
Massachusetts and northwestern Connecticut area. Both elementary and secondary
mathematics teachers will be involved. The overall goals of the multiyear
project involve the updating and deepening of the participants' mathematical
backgrounds and teaching methodologies with emphasis upon problematic and
constructivist perspectives, the networking of the staff and participants
through regular school visitations and group workshops, the conduct of frequent
in-service helping and sharing sessions by the participants in their schools,
the dissemination of the project materials and results, and the investigation of
the modelistic approach within a carefully planned documentation, assessment and
evaluation effort. The teacher enhancement model is organized into five stages
of leadership development. In the first stage (a two-week summer workshop)
teachers intensely study mathematical problem solving and constructive teacher
practices. In stage two (academic year follow-up) teachers apply and practice
new techniques and receive coaching guidance in weekly classroom visits by the
ELM Project staff. Stage three involves a second two-week summer advanced
workshop which deepens and reinforces their experiences and begins their
training for conducting in-service work with their peers. In stage four (second
academic year follow-up) the advanced leadership teachers and ELM Project staff
plan and conduct in-service workshops for school colleagues. At stage five the
leadership teachers conduct workshops with minimal guidance from project staff.
