The objective is to develop a lightweight, adjustable, maintenance-free as well
as economical structural system for use in the construction industry. To be
studied is a prestressed structural system of kevlar 49 and E-glass polyester
resin, which have excellent corrosion resistance as well as being lightweight.
The objective of the research will focus on the time-dependent characteristics
of the beam elements of the proposed system and the feasibility of developing a
computer model which can predict the behavior of these elements. The Phase I
effort will involve an investigation into 3 major areas; materials, geometry,
and construction. The time-dependent studies will involve full-scale testing of
the proposed beam elements at the Center for Advanced Technology for Large
Structural Systems (ATLSS) under Dr. John W. Fisher, Director, at Lehigh
University. Phase II will involve full-scale dynamic tests at the ATLASS Center.
