9412765 Ballance This grant supports the "Better Ceramics through Chemistry"
Conference to be held at San Francisco, CA, April 4-8, 1994. This conference
brings together materials scientists, chemists and ceramists to address a wide
range of chemical approached to the synthesis of ceramics or ceramics precursors
and their associated processing to form films, fibers, powders etc. with
precisely controlled compositions &amp; microstructures. The technical program
will cover over 250 papers in these areas. The requested funds are $5000 to
support graduate student participation. %%% "Better Ceramics through Chemistry"
is a vital issue for high quality, reliable and reproducible ceramics &amp;
ceramics based electrical and structural components. The conference provides an
opportunity to graduate students to get familiarized with this important area of
materials science of the future high tech. ceramics. ***
