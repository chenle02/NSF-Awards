This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. The research project will focus on integrated research that
explores interactions between arctic terrestrial ecosystems and climate. Field
research will be related to measurements of tundra to determine the
environmental and vegetation correlates of fluxes of water, energy and trace
gases especially carbon dioxide and methane. Field studies will measure the
movement of carbon dioxide and methane to and from the soil and vegetation in
the Arctic. This project is a component of a larger interdisciplinary program
known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
