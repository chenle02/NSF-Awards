Marker will continue his investigations in model theory. He will work primarily
on problems connected with definability in algebraically closed and real fields.
He will also deal with some questions in recursive model theory. Model theory as
a topic in the foundations of mathematics deals with axiomatic systems. Whether
a given set of axioms admit of any realization (called a model for these axioms)
or possibly only finitely many different realizations, or infinitely many, are a
few of the types of questions treated.
