This project addresses the need for improved undergraduate education in digital
signal processing through the integration of practical DSP laboratory experience
into the curriculum. Student learning of digital signal processing concepts at
the undergraduate level is enhanced by introducing the theoretical and practical
considerations together. The DSP Laboratory consists of ten microcomputer-based
DSP "Labstations" assembled using off-the-shelf computers, plug-in DSP
coprocessor boards, analog audio input/output systems, and a mix of commercial
and custom software. Beginning students use pre-existing software for
experiments and homework assignments, while intermediate and advanced students
actually write programs for the DSP microprocessor. Unlike the present situation
in undergraduate engineering education, the students trained in this manner are
directly exposed to the capabilities and limitations of current DSP chips and
other hardware, thereby allowing them to design and implement future DSP
applications in the communications and electronics industries in this country.
