The current departmentally focussed control systems design and analysis
curriculum is being redesigned to emphasize the commonality of 1) the basic
control theory, 2) modeling, simulation and optimization issues, 3) computer-
aided control system design methodology, 4) laboratory techniques, 5) computer-
aided isualization, and 6) the communication requirements for engineers with
differing backgrounds. The integration of a new course and aboratory with
existing departmental discipline-specific design and laboratory courses and the
revisions of such courses as a consequence of common preparatory courses is a
part of the long term goal of this project. This project is being matched by
funds greater than the award from the grantee.
