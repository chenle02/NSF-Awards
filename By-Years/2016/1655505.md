The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to deliver a
price-competitive source of alternative jet fuel that will help meet growing
worldwide demand while allowing the airline industry to achieve carbon-neutral
growth. Demand for jet fuel is increasing rapidly driven by global economic
growth. Usage is expected to rise from the current 80 billion gallons a year
worldwide to more than 100 billion gallons by 2040. At the same time, prices are
expected to increase and constraints in supply are likely to cause pricing
volatility. Finally, concerns over greenhouse gas emissions could drive adoption
of alternative fuels. All of these factors are creating a need for new fuel
sources, for both commercial and military applications. This I-Corps project
will focus on using waste lignin, the second most plentiful renewable carbon
source behind cellulose, in a proprietary process to make jet fuel range
hydrocarbons and chemicals to increase the flexibility of existing applications.

This I-Corps project aims to commercialize a process for biojet that converts
waste lignin from cellulosic biomass refineries using a combination of catalyst
and acidic zeolite to make relatively long-chain hydrocarbons. The current
version of biorefineries undervalues lignin's potential to address the world's
high quality liquid fuel requirements. Despite the potential, selective
conversion of lignin has proven to be challenging. Processes that have been
successful at breaking the lignin bonds have typically resulted in shorter chain
monomers as opposed to the longer chain hydrocarbons needed for fuel. The
surprising outcome of the process used here is a mix of hydrocarbons that are
long-chain and can be made into nearly the right mix for jet fuel. Scaling this
process and putting it into production alongside current biorefinery production
facilities would significantly improve biomass conversion and improve the
economics of biofuels and chemicals production.
