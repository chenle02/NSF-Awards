9521930 SCHELTEMA Members of the class Aplacophora are a group of worm-like,
marine Mollusks living at great depths in association with deep-sea thermal
vents. There are about 300 described species and an estimate of possibly another
600 species to be described as part of this study. These organisms have been
little studied, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining specimens. Dr.
Amelie Scheltema has assembled some 20,000 specimens obtained from about 60
surveys and expeditions. She is one of only three taxonomic specialists, all of
whom are nearing retirement, who study these organisms, and she is the only one
in the western hemisphere. She will contribute to the need for training a next
generation of systematists by advising and working with both undergraduate and
graduate students as well as a postdoctoral associate(s). The efforts of Dr.
Scheltema and her trainees will result in both published monographic treatment
of the class Aplacophora and information available in electronic form. She will
be assisted by malacological colleagues who are developing standards for
databasing of taxonomic information for the Phylum Mollusca. This study will
contribute to our very limited knowledge of the biological diversity of marine
invertebrate organisms. Recent pharmacological prospecting efforts suggest that
these little studied marine creatures may be rich resources for natural product
chemicals that may be turned to utilities for human life ranging from
anesthetics to antibiotic, antiviral and antitumor drugs. In addition to
providing knowledge of the relationships among aplacophoran taxa, the results of
this study should shed light on ancient relationships of diverse groups of
multicellular animals and provide a basis for further studies involving the
population biology, ecology, biogeography, etc. of these animals.
