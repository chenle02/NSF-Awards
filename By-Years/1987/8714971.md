Techniques for the use of real-time measurements of the state of the bulk power
system in control of the system are proposed. The measurements which will be
possible when digital protection systems are installed can be used to form
dynamic estimates of the system state. It is proposed that these estimates or
measurements can be used to improve the transient performance of the system
after a disturbance or used to predict instability when a transient event is
underway. Research is proposed on algorithms and strategies to most efficiently
use this new source of information in the control of the bulk power system. This
is a cooperating proposal with ECS-8715315 from Virginia Polytechnic and State
University.
