The evolution of social behavior in nonhuman species is a fascinating subject
in itself and also important for understanding the nature of human social
behavior. Among insects, studies of social behavior have focused on the highly
social ants, bees, wasps and termites, to the neglect of other groups. The PI
will study a group of beetles (Silphidae, Nicrophorus) that are facultative
communal breeders; small resources are monopolized by a single male and female
while large resources are shared by two or more individuals of each sex.
Ecological conditions that favor communal breeding, the social behaviors that
cause beetles to facultatively tolerate other breeding individuals, and the
genetic consequences of communal breeding will be explored with a combination of
field and laboratory experiments.
