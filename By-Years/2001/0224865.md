This grant supports research on the nucleation, habit, and growth of ice
crystals under the low temperature and pressure conditions characteristic of
high cirrus clouds and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). It is a continuation
of work on the physics of ice crystals that Dr. Hallett and his colleagues have
done for many years for less extreme conditions. The static diffusion chamber
used in previous work will be modified to operate down to temperatures as cold
as -100C and pressures less than 100 mb. In the chamber crystals are grown on
thin (5-10 microns) glass filaments under controlled conditions of temperature,
pressure, and supersaturation. Crystal nucleation and growth are examined by
optical microscopy from outside the chamber and video recorded. Likely nucleants
will be added to the filament prior to insertion in the chamber. These include
nonvolatile soluble particles, such a sulfuric acid, as well as insoluble
mineral, meteoritic, and aircraft exhaust material. Cold, high-altitude clouds
have important effects on the transfer of solar and infrared radiation, and
hence global climate. They also play a part in the production and destruction of
ozone. In spite of their importance, the physical properties of these clouds are
not well known because of the difficulty of in situ measurements at heights
above the ceiling of most aircraft. The laboratory experiments on this project
will simulate the extreme atmospheric conditions and provide needed information
on the microphysical characteristics of clouds which are nearly inaccessible by
other means.
