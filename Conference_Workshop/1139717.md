This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the Ninth East
Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS) on the campus of the Purdue
University, October 15-16, 2011. The focus of the meeting is on operator
algebras and noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas
from number theory to quantum physics. In addition to facilitating interaction
between researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are
forums in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
the eastern region of the United States can acquaint themselves with current
issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with
senior mathematicians in the field. It is expected that the conference will host
60-80 participants, including 40-50 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

Operator algebra theory traces its beginnings to the papers of Murray and von
Neumann in the 1930's on rings of operators, and the work Gelfand and Neumark in
the 1940's on norm-closed, self-adjoint algebras of operators on Hilbert space.
From the start, applications to other fields of mathematics and physics have
influenced and even dictated the subject's development. Moreover, even though
operator algebra theory has broadened considerably over the past thirty years or
so, unexpected connections between different areas within the subject regularly
arise. Based on the tradition of past successful ECOAS meetings, there is every
expectation that this conference will be an event with significant research and
training impact. Scientifically, there is potential for advances in the theory
of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry including applications of
operator algebras to other disciplines.
