0300592&lt;br/&gt;Chakrabarti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI
and graduate students from Stanford University in a collaboration with Eila
Jarvenpaa of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at the
Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. The combined efforts of the German
and US groups will focus on how different external and internal forces are
changing the role of the universities in developing new entrepreneurial firms.
Implications for this dynamic relationship are to be found in many aspects of
business development and entrepreneurship in Finland as well as the US. The
study will investigate companies that are in the start-up phase as well as in
the later stages of development. Scrutiny will be directed to the role of the
universities in developing and nurturing these firms and thus contributing to
regional development. The collaboration will also examine the creation of social
capital conducive to entrepreneurship in Finland and the
US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective. The
project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing
research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the
world around them while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
