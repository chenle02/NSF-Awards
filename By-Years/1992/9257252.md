Science information systems is the construction and study of complete computer
systems to support scientific research. This project is building a model
"electronic community system", a digital library containing all the knowledge of
a community of molecular biologists and a software environment to manipulate
this library across the NSFNET, with the first release currently running in 20
biology laboratories. Several studies are being pursued in collaboration to
investigate technology and sociology issues in constructing electronic
communities. An "information space" is the representation used to support
uniform transparent retrieval from many distributed data sources; it consists of
uniform objects which package items from the sources and interconnect them to
form a relationship graph. There are data model issues in providing uniformity
across multiple data types and network caching issues in providing transparency
of interaction across wide-area networks. There are also information retrieval
issues in supporting semantic-based retrieval from an automatically generated
representation which includes a domain-specific thesaurus. Finally, there are
sociological issues in how the communication patterns of the community change
with significant electronic support.
