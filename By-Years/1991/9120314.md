In 1986 pond construction on the Burnham farm, located in northwestern Oklahoma,
uncovered three buried alluvial deposits which contained large numbers of faunal
remains. These included a large-horned bison skull which resembled Bison
latifrons a species believed to be present more than 20,000 years ago.
Excavation by Dr. Wyckoff and his colleagues revealed the presence of small
shattered stone flakes in association with the bison and subsequent radiocarbon
determinations have suggested a date of between 26,000 -31,000 years ago. If
this, in fact, is an archaeological site, it documents the presence of humans in
the New World well before the accepted date of ca. 12,000 years. Dr. Wyckoff has
spent several seasons excavating the Burnham site but has not conclusively
demonstrated that the materials are associated either with each other or an
early date. The problem is that both stone and bone are in a derived context and
have been carried into the area. With National Science Foundation support, he
will conduct the necessary geological work to answer this question. Mechanical
equipment will be used to cut trenches to clarify the stratigraphy. Relevant
areas with then be cleared and careful hand excavation conducted. It is hoped
that cultural materials in primary context and clear stratigraphic position will
be found. Archaeologists agree that humans entered the New World from Asia and
that by 12,000 years ago they were widely distributed. However, it is unclear
how much before this time original migration took place. Some argue for much
earlier dates while the majority believe that the archaeological evidence for
this is unconvincing. The Burnham site is important within this context and the
work which Dr. Wyckoff will conduct should help to resolve this issue.
