This project involves a year of planning for the development of an ATE regional
center for information technology. It includes forming regional partnerships
including the key stakeholders having a vested interest in the economic and
workforce development for information technology capacity. It also includes
three symposia to raise awareness of the need for academic program reform and
professional development for college faculty and K-12 teachers as well as to
stimulate regionwide capacity building activities. Research activities identify
IT gaps and establish benchmarks for IT development in the region. Finally, a
facilities plan for the regional center is developed. All of these activities
lay the foundation for the development of a project for a regional center for
information technology in the next year.
