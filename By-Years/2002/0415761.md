This project develops and implements a Security Assured Information Systems
(SAIS) track in the Information Science (BS, MS, Ph.D.) and Telecommunications
degrees (M.S. and Ph.D.) offered by the University of Pittsburgh. This track
provides a unique education in the development, design and deployment of secure
information systems with an emphasis on networked information systems. The goal
is to produce IT professionals with the knowledge to cope with the special
security challenges (e.g., intrusion detection) posed by conventional and
emerging network information systems (e.g., wireless local area networks) and
their applications and services. The SAIS tracks consist of a set of required
and elective coursework together with a practicum/capstone course. A core
component of the coursework is a set of innovative laboratory exercises and
classroom experiments that illustrate theoretical concepts and technologies and
provide students hands on experience.
