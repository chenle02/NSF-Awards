OCE-9617795 ABSTRACT OCE-9617795 The Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS)
was established as one of two oceanic time-series observatories under the
U.S.Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (the other being the Hawaii Ocean Time-
Series) to determine and understand the processes controlling the time-varying
flux or carbon and associated biogenic elements in the ocean. With this award,
the activities of BATS will continue for another three years. As BATS
investigators have done since the mid-1980's, these efforts will include studies
of seasonal, interannual, and decadal variations in ocean physics, biology, and
chemistry. In particular studies will focus on carbon biogeochemistry and the
sea-air flux of carbon dioxide. The overall activity will continue to be a
mixture of time-series measurements of critical parameters of oceanic
functioning as well as process studies.
