Observations using some of the world's most modern radio telescopes will be used
to help scientists understand how stars like our sun are formed. Stars form as
gas and dust from interstellar space spirals down onto a central object (much
like water flowing down a bath tub drain). However, at the same time, these baby
stars drive supersonic jets of gas back out into space. Astronomers are only now
beginning to understand this complex process. The Principal Investigator (PI) on
this proposal will use advanced computer models to show how this process
actually works, focusing in particular on regions very close to the central
young star. He will test his models using observations from two large arrays of
radio dishes, one in Chile, the other in Hawaii. The PI will do much of this
work with a graduate student. Together, the PI and student also aim to expand
programs and exhibitions for the public at Yale's Leitner Family Observatory and
Planetarium. Images and videos will be used to educate the public about how
astronomical observations from large radio arrays help us better understand how
stars, like our Sun, are created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a
study of the environment surrounding protostars (on 10-1000 AU scales) using
high resolution ALMA and SMA observations. The goal is to address key questions
about the mass-assembling process and the impact of protostellar feedback on
star formation. Molecular line observations will be combined with radiative
transfer models to determine how the velocity, temperature, and density
structure of the gas surrounding protostars evolves and how the infall and
outflow processes change over time. The models include mechanical feedback but
also radiative feedback and heating from ultraviolet photons produced in shocks
close to the protostar. The results will inform our understanding of star
formation efficiency in molecular cloud cores and the origin of stellar masses.
A graduate student will be involved in this research effort throughout its
3-year duration.
