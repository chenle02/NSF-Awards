The proposal is for a planning project that will hold a monthly series of two-
day conferences and workshops on calculus to be attended by universities,
community colleges, and high school calculus instructors -- as well as
industrial representatives. The effort will be headed by Professor Shair Ahmad,
an extremely able and accomplished mathematician. It will include mathematics
faculty members from the University of Miami, Dade County Community College and
the Dade County Public Schools. The seminars will concentrate on the role of
computers and calculators, textbooks, relevance to other disciplines, conceptual
understanding, and developing exercises that stress current day technology. The
discussions will be led by small groups of well- prepared individuals familiar
with the existing literature on the subjects. The participants will be
encouraged to carry on similar discussions in their own institutions.
