The project will support the Twelfth Northern Libraries Colloquy to be organized
and conducted in Boulder, Colorado, June 5-9, 1988, by the Institute of Arctic
and Alpine Research of the University of Colorado. The Colloquy brings together,
every two years at various international locations, specialists involved in
locating, cataloging, and disseminating data and information on all topics of
interest to northern Nations and users, with particular emphasis on the Arctic.
This Colloquy has as its theme "International Networking of Northern
Information". Most northern countries are developing approaches to data and
information retrieval, storage, and dissemination. This meeting, through a
carefully structured program, will result in an analysis of the international
potentials, problems, and solutions for international networking of this diverse
body of ever increasing data and information. Sessions on non-bibliographic data
banks, end users, archiving, and policy issues are among topics to be addressed.
A formal proceedings volume will be produced and be available widely. The
Colloquy comes at an extremely advantageous time, as it will address man;y of
the data and information requirements contained in the Arctic Research and
Policy Act of 1984. Both the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and the Interagency
Arctic Research Policy Committee are addressing these needs and the results of
this Colloquy will provide invaluable insight and information required to
fulfill the intent of the Act.
