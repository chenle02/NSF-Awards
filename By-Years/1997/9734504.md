This research examines telepresence, "the sense of being present at a remote
site," which has been identified as a design ideal for teleoperators and virtual
environments. It is intended to resolve extant confusion as to the origins of
telepresence and to develop a plausible and parsimonious telepresence model.
This is to be accomplished by empirical investigations of teleoperation system
and human factor effects on subjective measures of telepresence along with
studies of physiological variables and mental constructs, including attention
and situation awareness, for objectively representing telepresence. The research
involves developing a descriptive model of telepresence in attention for
understanding the phenomenon and predicting its effect on teleoperation
performance. Design guidelines for synthetic environment configuration are also
to be formulated based on the model. The effort is expected to serve as a
vehicle for promoting the effective transport of human perceptuo-cognitive
capabilities into remote environments through unique teleoperator applications,
such as the exploration of Mars, by encouraging in operators a sense of being at
the remote site. Outcomes of the work are anticipated to be applicable to design
of the spectrum of teleoperators and virtual environments and will be integrated
in graduate student education in cognitive engineering for the 21st Century.
