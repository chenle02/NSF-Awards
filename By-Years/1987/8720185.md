This project is a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant
EAR 84-16254, involving experimental studies of the phase equilibria of common
rock-forming minerals. Reversed phase equilibrium experiments, coupled with
thermodynamic modelling of the experimental results, will provide the basis for
determination of the temperature, pressure, and oxidation conditions during the
formation of rocks containing these minerals. Specific objectives of the project
include (1) continued experiments on ternary feldspars, (2) examination of the
effects of barium on two- feldspar equilibria, (3) continued experiments on the
effects of minor components on iron-titanium oxide equilibria, and (4) study of
the stability of titanium-bearing biotite. The results of these studies will
increase our understanding of the behavior of common rock-forming minerals under
diverse conditions of pressure and temperature, and will provide improved
methods for determining the conditions of formation of geological materials.
