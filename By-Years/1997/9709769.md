Abstract ATM-9709769 Prell, Warren L. Brown University Title: Development of the
Modern Analog Technique and the Planktonic Foraminifera Data Base for
Reconstructing Sea Surface Temperature This award supports a project designed to
finalize, document and provide the best possible, internally consistent, global
data base of modern planktonic foraminiferal calibration data for reconstructing
past ocean environments and reassessing the original CLIMAP SST results.
Investigators will also complete and disseminate and taxonomic users guide for
the data base and the software and user's manual for the series of MAT programs
and their environmental data and complete the reconstruction of the seasonal SST
and the thermocline structure of the LGM Indian Ocean.
