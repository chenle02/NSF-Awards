The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of inexpensive and reliable sensors to monitor multiple water
quality parameters - pH, phosphate levels, and the heavy metals dissolved in
water. These sensors are easy to use, portable, and can provide rapid test
results. Most of the current technologies require water sample collection from
sites, followed by tests in external labs. This technology can be used for
residential and industrial applications. It can be used for monitoring water
quality in swimming pools, residential and commercial aquariums, agricultural
water run-off, water body with algae bloom, houses known to have lead service
lines, industrial effluent, and breweries. Additionally, longer term development
of the technology may enable integration with a plumbing system/water filtration
system for automated monitoring and added reliability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project has developed an electrochemical
sensor using a screen-printed electrode modified with different functional
nanomaterials to detect concentrations of dissolved heavy metals, phosphate and
pH in water. In addition to graphene, functionalized nanomaterials and
conducting polymer nanocomposites deposited on the electrode surface are a
reliable approach to enhance the selectivity and affinity of target molecules of
analysis. The nanocomposite materials include reduced graphene oxide and
polypyrrole to increase the electron transfer and electrodeâ€™s surface area. The
functional materials for the target molecules of pH, phosphate, and heavy metals
are iridium oxide, molybdate, and cysteine, respectively. By observing the
potentiometric and amperometric change occurring in the electrochemical reaction
at the electrode-solution interface, quantitative and qualitative evaluations of
the relevant substance in water are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
