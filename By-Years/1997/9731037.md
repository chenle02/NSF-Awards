The objective of this project is to provide tools for Bayesian inference that
will be used by social scientists and their students - not just specialists in
statistics or methodology, but anyone who does quantitative work with data,
including undergraduates. This is an extension of a previous project that
developed tools for Bayesian communication. These tools allow the user to
approximate posterior moments, modify prior distributions, combine models, and
approximate posterior density functions, given the output of a posterior
simulator, which can be made available by the investigator at an ftp or web
site. The proposed project extends this work by placing posterior simulators
themselves at the disposal of social scientists, in an environment that meets
current standards for user orientation. Ongoing research will support the
following steps to meet this objective: 1) Develop redundant algorithms for the
models that form the analytic core of empirical work in the social sciences. In
large part, a generic Hastings-Metropolis algorithm will provide this
redundancy. 2) Provide windowing interfaces for all procedures including
posterior simulators, the Bayesian communication tools developed in the previous
project, and new procedures to be developed in this project. Make these
interfaces available for all common operating systems, using the scripting
language and windowing toolkit Tcl/Tk. 3) Facilitate incorporation of new models
and methods in the software. The proposed system is designed to incorporate
simulators developed by third parties, with no modification of their code. All
the software developed in this project will be freely available and fully
documented for anyone with an internet connection.
