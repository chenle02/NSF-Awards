The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San
Diego has requested several sea-going data management systems and items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the four research
vessels operated by the institution. A substantial part of the ships' operating
schedules during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The
instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -Shipboard data management systems and components for real- time
acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large environmental and
geophysical data sets, -Mercury reversing thermometers for precision calibration
of temperature data collected at sea, -Water purification system to provide
reagent grade pure water for chemical analyses at sea, -Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler system for remote and continuous measurements of subsurface circulation
features while the ship is underway, -12-kHz echosounder system for collecting
data on seafloor bathymetry and sedimentary profiles, -Replacement Niskin
bottles, thermometer racks, and acoustic altimeter for collecting discrete
seawater samples at various depths in the water column, -Installation of a sea
chest on R/V NEW HORIZON to accommodate acoustic Doppler current profiler,
transducers, -Calibration equipment to assure the accuracy of measurements made
at sea. The University of California is cost sharing in the acquisition of this
equipment. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of
the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
