9529554 Fernandez This award provides funds to purchase a CODAR SeaSonde ocean
surface current radar system that will be used in conjunction with existing
components of a larger radar network at UCSC. The existing network of CODAR
sensors consists of three radars located at Point Pinos, Moss Landing, and the
Long Marine Laboratory. A three-point system allows thePI's to resolve errors
and uncertainties in the data that are impossible to resolve wtih a one or two
radar system. The radar located at Moss Landing isan older model that generates
data more slowly than the newer versions. (Subsequent to submission of this
proposal, the older radar malfunctioned beyond repair and is no longer
available.) The PI's proposes to replace the older model of the radar with the
newer CODAROcean Sensor (COS) radar. This equipmentwill be used to support
research projects that are focused on improving measurements of coastal
circulation in Monterey Bay. The University of California, Santa Cruz has
offered cost-sharing of $30,000 for this award. ***
