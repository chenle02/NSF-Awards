Abstract

Award: DMS-0805925 Principal Investigator: P. Robert Kotiuga

This award provides partial support of the conference on the heritage of Raoul
Bott planned for the Centre de Recherche Mathematique in Montreal, Quebec during
June 2008. Topics of conference presentations include: operator algebraic
methods and K-theory, supersymmetry and quantum field theory, Morse theory,
string topology, pseudoholomorphic curves, Floer homology, equivariant
cohomology and localization, generalized cohomology theories and physics, and
networks; applications and modular forms.

This conference, cosponsored by the Clay Mathematics Institute, focuses on the
mathematical legacy of Raoul Bott and the extraordinary impact he had on both
topology and interactions between mathematics, physics and technology. Bott?s
students, coauthors, and intellectual descendents will talk on forward-looking
research topics, addressing a broad audience. Montreal was chosen as the
conference venue because Bott obtained two degrees in Electrical Engineering at
McGill University in the 1940s, an Honorary Doctorate from McGill in 1987 and
the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) is the focal point of mathematics
in Montreal where one can find three generations of mathematicians with close
connections to Bott. The week-long conference features 26 hour long slots for
technical talks or panel discussions. See http://www.crm.math.ca/Bott08 for
details.
