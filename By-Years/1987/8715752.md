This is an investigation of how to fix the major problem with object- oriented
programming languages: efficiency. A polymorphic type system will be used
information that the compiler will need to perform code optimization. The type
system and the optimization are both antithetical to the interactive,
incremental programming style supported so well by object-oriented programming,
so that type-safe debugging and incremental compilation in the presence of
global code optimization must be investigated. Interest is mostly in language
implementation issues rather in language design issues, the work is based on
Smalltalk-80 with intention, to reuse as much of the class library and
programming environment as possible. By reusing an existing language, instead of
inventing a new one, the problems we solve will be ones shared by many object-
oriented languages, and thus the solutions will be generally applicable.^R
