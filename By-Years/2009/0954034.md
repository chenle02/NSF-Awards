This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
CAREER award to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will advance
fundamental knowledge of how professional engineering practices have changed due
to globalization and how this has impacted engineers in the field. The research
is very innovative because it will contribute to theoretical development in the
area of global engineering education and provide an intellectual foundation to
develop pedagogical resources to prepare globally competent engineers. The
results will impact engineering education widely through a guide on working on
global teams which will be produced and disseminated to students, faculty, and
study abroad offices. Also the online repository of case studies and supporting
curriculum will be published in academic journals and through online platforms
such as NSDL.org and GlobalHUB.org. The project includes a strong evaluation and
the commitment to share best practices with other engineering schools. It will
enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to
fill engineering jobs or start new high tech businesses.
