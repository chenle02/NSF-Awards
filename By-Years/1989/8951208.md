Three data loggers, a CO2 analyzer-logger, and sensing equipment will modernize
and expand field exercises in courses in plant physiology, aquatic ecology, and
terrestrial ecology. The portable data loggers and sensors monitor 4-8 channels
of input at selected intervals, store 32K of data, and transfer these data for
computer analysis. The portable CO2 analyzer system permits undisturbed field
study and recording of photosynthesis rates, transpiration rates, and stomatal
conductance, also with computer interface. This package will allow environmental
monitoring over ecologically relevant time intervals, providing students with a
realistic context for their brief lab experiences. The computer linkage
facilitates class exercises and student research projects involving data
analysis. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
