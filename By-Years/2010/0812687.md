The discovery that synaptic plasticity is mediated by processes sensitive to the
precise relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic events overturned models of
synaptic change based on average activity levels (so-called rate-dependent
models). This experimental discovery contradicted the conceptual framework that
has dominated since the work of Donald Hebb (1949), and requires different
theoretical and computational tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual synaptic
events have inherent random variability, so computational synaptic dynamics in
the new paradigm must be based in the theory of stochastic processes. Previous
work modeling the stochastic dynamics of neural systems uses approximation tools
-- the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) -- known to be deeply flawed and
potentially misleading. The situation recalls the use of the FPE by machine
learning theorists in the early to mid 1990s; indeed the dynamics of spike-
timing-dependent plasticity in neural systems and those of stochastic
approximation algorithms in the machine learning literature are very
similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes rigorous tools for
treating the stochastic dynamics of learning systems based on spike-timing-
dependent synaptic plasticity. It develops well-grounded approximation
techniques (and exact solutions where available) and applies them to synaptic
dynamics in natural and artificial learning systems. The new methods are
compared to those employed in the recent literature to provide insight into the
accuracy and appropriateness of the various methods. The project is relevant to
both computational neuroscience and machine learning, and will also provide
interdisciplinary research training for graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
