The primary objective of this global climate project by Dr. Stephen Cox,
Colorado State University and Dr. George S. Golitsyn, Institute of Atmospheric
Physics, Academy of Sciences, Moscow, is to develop a joint US- Russia cloud-
radiation research study with a three-fold purpose: 1) to plan and accomplish
phases of the FIRE experiment investigating cloud and radiation problems; 2) to
use observing systems/platforms to study cirrus cloud systems and marine
stratocumulus systems; and 3) to follow up field research by working to improve
boundary layer modeling expertise. The Russian researchers propose to have
several US scientists participate in the FIRE ASTEX (Atlantic Stratocumulus
Experiment) via the research vessel Academician Kurchatov. This project fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and
capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of
basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality
of benefit.
