9521483 Steinberg This award will fund a short term planning visit by Dr. Stanly
Steinberg, University of New Mexico to Lima, Peru, to organize a joint research
project with Dr. Pedro C. Espinoza, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.
The research project involves the creation of new discrete methods for studying
nonlinear steady-state-porous-media flow problems. Such algorithms are critical
to the study of groundwater flows, contaminant transport and waste remediation,
problems very important to both countries. The researchers plan to combine their
knowledge and expertise to devise algorithms needed for solving nonlinear
elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients and subsequently try to apply
these ideas to time-dependent problems. ***
