The mechanisms of sedimentation from the Amazon river onto the adjacent
continental shelf will be examined. The research program will involve sampling
nearshore sediments, determining the sedimentation rates, observing patterns on
seismic profiles, and interpreting the causes of regional patterns in
sedimentation. The overall goals are to determine the controlling factors for
the formation of sedimentary strata in fine-grained sediments, learn how to
recognize those controlling factors in the geologic record, and interpret the
regional sedimentation patterns. The Amazon River system provides one of the
largest sediment loads to the ocean of any in the world; therefore, this project
will be important for interpreting data from other large river systems. The
project involves a collaborative effort with Brazilian scientists.
