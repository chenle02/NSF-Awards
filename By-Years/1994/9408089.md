9408089 ROSENBERG This project will utilize information from internal anatomy
and allozyme electrophoresis to determine relationships among approximately 25
species of land snails in a genus which occurs on major islands in the West
Indies. These very interesting snails are terrestrial but their closest
relatives have an amphibian existence. The project will investigate whether this
transition to land-dwelling has been made once, with the snails then dispersing
to other islands, or whether there have been, instead, multiple land invasions
with each island having been colonized separately from an amphibious ancestor.
%%% This project will contribute to our knowledge of biodiversity in these
restricted island faunas. The snails are an excellent model system for
investigating the transition to an existence on land and the marked changes,
especially in the respiratory system, that must occur with such a major habitat
shift. Information about the geologic history of the islands should also emerge
as patterns in relationships of the snails should reflect relationships or
relative times of origin for the islands. ***
