A eight week program of mathematical research involving eight undergraduate
students working with nine faculty members will be supported by this Research
Experiences for Undergraduates award. The work will center on problems of matrix
theory and discrete structures. Participants will attack a progressive series of
problems of increasing difficulty and generality. Several will benefit from
exploration using sophisticated mathematical software packages for symbolic and
matrix calculations. Typical problem areas include studies of isometries of G-
invariant matrix norms, computer generation of generalized numerical ranges,
unitary factors in polar decomposition and robust Lyapunov matrices. Students
will also visit research facilities at NASA (Langley Research Center), ICASE,
VIMS, CEBAF and NIST where faculty advisors have established working
relationships. Reports will be completed by each student at the end of the
program. Students will be encouraged to present results of their work at
professional meetings during the following academic year.
