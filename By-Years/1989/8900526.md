This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is for research
activities in all the subfields (organic, physical, analytical, inorganic, and
biochemistry) of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in April 1989,
eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research
under the supervision of their faculty , graduate student, or postdoctoral
fellow advisor. A unique feature in this REU activity is use of a graduate
student or postdoctoral fellow as a "peer" mentor to help the student get
started in the laboratory.
