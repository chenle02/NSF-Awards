The research objective of this proposal is to investigate an ultra-low power,
miniaturized, spintronic nanowire strain sensing device with an ultra-high
sensitivity. This concept leverages two different physical phenomena: (i) stress
induced magnetization rotation in nanoscale magnetostrictive materials; and (ii)
change in the magneto-resistance of a "spin-valve" heterostructure nanowire
consisting of magnetically-hard/spacer/magnetically-soft layers, which is
induced by a rotation of the magnetization orientation of the soft
layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this could lead to a miniature strain
sensor with an active area of 0.1mm x 0.1mm and with a sensitivity exceeding
state-of-the-art, while consuming 2-3 orders of magnitude less power. Such a
device could strongly impact several areas such as structural health monitoring,
pressure, flow, acoustic and seismic sensing. This project will provide a strong
multidisciplinary experience and mentorship for PhD students and will be
leveraged to enhance innovative workshops on sensing and energy harvesting for
high school students through the Math-Science Innovation Center. Under-
represented K-12 students will be hosted for a month in summer under VCU's
Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering (RAPME) program and trained
in nanofabrication under this project.
