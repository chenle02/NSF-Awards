The investigators organize the Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical
Biology and Biomathematics. The conference has nine formal sessions, each
consisting of 2-3 oral presentations with an introduction by a leading scientist
in the area, and two afternoon poster sessions. A wide variety of topics,
ranging from global environmental models to mathematical neuroscience to genetic
regulation networks, are represented. The unifying theme of the conference is
quantitative modeling of complex biological networks. Invited speakers are
selected on the basis of their expertise in the respective areas, at the same
time emphasizing gender balance, minority representation, and incorporating
promising junior researchers. The primary goal of this conference is to bring
together established and young investigators from the field of quantitative
biology to share their approaches and progress and to discuss the perspectives.
Such a multidisciplinary conference is very important for identifying challenges
in biology, biotechnology, and medicine that require quantitative modeling and
computational approach. Moreover, the participation of students and postdocs
helps to increase the number of people working in areas of quantitative biology.
