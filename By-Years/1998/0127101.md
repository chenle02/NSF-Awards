Physics (13) In order to better attract and retain students, the physics
department is beginning a new research and teaching emphasis in optics. About
half of a new 4-credit-hour research preparation course is devoted to optics.
For the research preparation course, the project is adapting and implementing
optics experiments that were developed at Boston University and New Jersey
Institute of Technology with funding from NSF. Experiments are chosen to both to
prepare students to carry out independent research projects in holographic
interferometry and to give them exposure to the rapidly developing field of
fiber optics. The project is supporting laser beam characterizing equipment,
modal analysis, a fiber optics kit, optical table, and hardware. The project is
adapting the experiments to the smaller institutional size and to focus on
holography. In the first implementation of the course, students choose one of
these experiments as a special project. Using the existing materials and the new
equipment, they set it up and demonstrate it to their classmates. Their work is
then the basis for use by future students.
