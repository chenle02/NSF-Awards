This research is to deploy 20 three-component broadband seismometers, most of
which will come from the PASSCAL program, to study variation in the physical
properties of the crust and upper mantle beneath the eastern Snake River Plain
region. This region shows the results of a mantle hot spot crossing the
continent with associated volcanic and earthquake activity. Tomographic imaging
of the P- and S-wave velocities and attenuation will be used to outline the
thermal and partial melt structure of the hot spot plume in the crust and upper
mantle. Shear-wave splitting will be used to study anisotropy and implied mantle
flow structure. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
