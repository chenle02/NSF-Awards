The papers of the Tenth International Colloquium on Gasdynamics of Explosions
and Reactive Systems, to be held at the University of California, Berkeley,
California, August 4-9, 1985, will be published. The subject matter of
gasdynamics of explosions is concerned principally with the interrelationship
between rate process of energy transfer in a compressible medium and
itsconcurrent non-steady flow as it occurs typically in explosion phenomena.
Gasdynamics of reactive systems is associated with processes of coupling between
the flow system and chemical reactions or molecular transformations
inheterogeneous media as they occur, typically in combustion systems. Besides
contributions to the usual topics of explosions, detonations, shock phenomena,
and reactive flow, other papers deal especially with gasdynamic aspects of non-
steady flow in combustion systems and gasdynamic processes occurring in rock
fragmentation. Some papers deal with effects of radiative energy transfer on
fluid dynamic features of reactive systems as in the case of luminous flames,
intense fires, and gasdynamic lasers.
