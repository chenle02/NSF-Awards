9700492 Groisser The proposed workshop and special semester are in the area of
mathematical physics with an interdisciplinary theme. Planned talks of the
workshop cover several topics of current interest centering around Seiberg-
Witten theory and symplectic geometry. The proposed activities are to be hosted
jointly by the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Fundamental
Theory (IFT) at the University of Florida. The IFT is a research center designed
to promote interdisciplinary research and communication among specialists in
high energy physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics, and mathematical
physics. The 1990s can be seen as a period of remarkable interface and
unification between theoretical physics and mathematics. For example, the recent
discovery of N. Seiberg and E. Witten on electric-magnetic duality has had an
enormous impact in low-dimensional geometry and topology; conversely, cutting-
edge mathematical ideas are providing a new language for string theory.
