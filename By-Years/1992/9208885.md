This is a study of the vibrational modes of zeolitic frameworks, specifically
those of zeolites of the faujasite group. The vibrations of a framework
aluminosilicate can be divided into two general classes: "internal" modes of the
MO4 tetrahedra, and "external" modes associated with structures built from the
tetrahedral units; examples of the latter include vibrations of the pore
openings and the cages of zeolites. High-pressure studies of Raman spectroscopy,
infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction are used to separate external and
internal modes; this is possible because external modes are altered dramatically
by compression, while internal modes are unperturbed. The assignments made in
this study are very useful for determining the structures of unknown zeolites
and for studying the energetics and steric effects of adsorbates in zeolites.
They also offer a convenient validity check for computer simulations of zeolite
sorption and structure.
