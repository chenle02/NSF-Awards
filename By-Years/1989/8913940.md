How does government regulate the flow of international commerce? Standard
models explain American trade policy as the result of either politically
influential pressure groups demanding protection, or as the result of elected
officials and bureaucrats supplying protection. These models provide only part
of the picture. Conventional models, for example, cannot explain such diverse
policy outcomes as long term quotas to protect sugar (1934), dairy products
(1953), meat (1965), and petroleum (1959-73); nor can they explain shifts in
negotiating authority away from the president and to the USTR in the 1988
Omnibus Trade Bill. In this Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project, the
argument is presented that, contrary to the standard view, members of Congress
in passing trade legislation face a problem of how to organize for collective
action. Congress solves its internal decision making problems by delegating
authority to a central agent (namely, the president), and by establishing an
elaborate pre-negotiating advisory system with congressional vetos to constrain
presidential action. The central hypothesis - - Congress imposes structure and
process to ensure that policy decisions made by the executive are satisfactory
to its members - - is based on the premise that members of Congress are
motivated by an electoral incentive, that they adopt procedural arrangements to
help win reelection, and that changes in procedural arrangements yield
predictable changes in policy outcomes. The general conclusion is that while
members of Congress have delegated authority to the president to enter into
international trade agreements, they have simultaneously introduced procedural
arrangements which constrain the substantive authority the president can
exercise. This is independent of congressional approval and provisions for
constituents injured by import competition opportunities for exemption,
compensation, or delay. The importance of this analysis is that by identifying
the process through which international trade policy is made, we are better able
to specify the conditions that facilitate the maintenance of a relatively open
trading system in the face of rising demands for import protection.
