The focus of this project is the analysis of numerical schemes, and the
development of algorithms, to simulate materials which exhibit intricate
rheological behavior or mechanical response due to their microstructural makeup.
Examples include polymers, liquid crystals, and blood, whose elastic molecules
or cells influence the macroscopic properties at the macroscopic scale. These
materials are modeled by formidable systems of partial differential equations
whose structural properties capture important properties and physical
principles, and it is important to develop numerical schemes to faithfully
inherit these. This project will bring together tools from partial differential
equations, continuum mechanics, and numerical analysis, to analyze numerical
schemes to simulate these systems.

The ability to simulate complex materials is a key technology required for the
design and development of many next generation products such as micro-mechanical
devices, ink jets, bio-materials, solar energy devices, and prosthetic organs.
Predicting material response is an essential tool needed to determine biological
or physiological function; or to design and manufacture these materials; or for
the design of the multitudes of devices which use their special properties. The
research proposed here will result in improved understanding of the mathematical
models and the computational tools used to accomplish these tasks.
