Most of our everyday decisions involve interactions with others. Those decisions
result from our intrinsic motivations and our ability to reason and develop
strategies. However, motivations and reasoning cannot be directly observed and
it is usually difficult to infer cognitive choice processes from behavior
itself. As a result, little is known about how we make decisions in strategic
settings. Even less is known about the developmental trajectories of strategic
decision-making from childhood to adulthood or, more broadly, the ability to
develop strategies with repeated exposure. The objective of this project is to
use novel methods to reveal the information people attend to before making
choices, as an indirect measure of what people care and reason about. We also
propose to explore differences in reasoning and to assess how strategies are
learnt by comparing both the choices and the information attended by children
vs. adults and by inexperienced vs. experienced (e.g. professional)
players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many experiments have shown that people are
typically limited in the extent to which they think strategically. Other
experiments have demonstrated that decisions are not always driven by purely
selfish motives. We propose to advance the understanding of the reasoning and
motivations in strategic interactions by measuring both the information people
attend to, and the choices they make. We will conduct three sets of experiments
related to three environments in which anomalous behavior has been well
documented (dynamic mutual trust games, dominance solvable games and dictatorial
allocation mechanisms) and use a ?Mousetracking? technique to collect
attentional data. By relating attention to choice, we will be able to better
identify the theory that provides the best description of strategic decision-
making in those environments. By comparing attention and behavior across
populations, we will be able to assess how the ability to strategize develops
and is learnt through exposure.
