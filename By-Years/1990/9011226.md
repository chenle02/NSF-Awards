Much of what is known about the dynamics of active volcanos has been learned at
Kilauea volcano. Deformation and seismicity data demonstrate that magmatic
activity and slip on Kilauea's fault systems are coupled, yet the subsurface
geometry of these faults and the deep structure of Kilauea's rift zones are
poorly understood. The PI will analyze surface deformation data, including new
GPS measurements, to elucidate the geometry of active rift and fault structures
on Kilauea. Analysis of these unique data sets has the potential to answer
fundamental questions concerning the dynamics of shield volcanos, and lead to an
improved understanding of volcanic and earthquake hazards on Hawaii and
elsewhere.
