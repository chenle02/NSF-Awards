The objective of this project is to take key insights from grinding and
polishing, and create a novel Chemical Mechanical Paired Grinding technology
that combines the strengths of fixed abrasive grinding with those of free
abrasive polishing, while avoiding their weaknesses. This is achieved by
combining a key weakness avoidance insight from grinding, namely defect
mitigation via minimization of maximum force per grit, with two strength
enhancement insights from polishing, effective planarization via profile-driven
determination of force gradient and robustness via homogenization. The resulting
entity is embodied in a chemical mechanical paired grinding machine that will be
designed and built in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, relatively
expensive free-abrasive polishing is the process of choice when surface quality
and integrity are of primary concern, while fixed abrasive grinding with lower
surface quality and integrity is used if cost is the primary design driver. If
successful, chemical mechanical paired grinding will obviate this trade-off by
delivering the product quality of polishing at a cost of operation for grinding.
It will also introduce a new technique for combining strengths and avoiding
weaknesses in hybrid process design. Educational activities will include
infusion of research insights into graduate and undergraduate courses in design
and manufacturing, and providing lab internships to undergraduate students where
the resulting chemical mechanical paired grinding machine will be used as a
teaching aid in hybrid process design. Recruitment of under-represented women
and minority students will be facilitated by leveraging existing programs at
Iowa State University and exchange programs with other universities.
