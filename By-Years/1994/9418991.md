9418991 MacLaughlin Electronic structure, magnetism, and superconductivity in
highly correlated electron materials will be investigated using nuclear magnetic
resonance and muon spin rotation techniques. The research uses the sensitivity
of these two techniques to microscopic (atomic) charge and spin correlations as
tools to probe local effects of strong electron correlation. The techniques will
be used to study four different systems: 1) spin susceptibility, charge and spin
dynamics in lanthanum based planar cuprates and nickelates which exhibit quantum
and anti ferromagnetism, 2) spin-liquid behavior and effects of defects (chain
breaks, hole doping) in Haldane chain compounds, 3) non-Fermi-liquid properties
of Kondo alloys and heavy-fermion compounds, and 4) dynamics of low-lying
superconducting excitations in uranium based heavy-fermion superconductors. %%%
Understanding effects of correlations between electrons on magnetism and
conduction in solids remains an important unsolved problem in condensed matter
physics. This research uses magnetic resonance techniques as a probe of
correlated- electron behavior at the atomic level. In magnetic resonance, the
weak but measurable magnetism of probe" magnetic moments, (e.g. nuclei) is used
to "spy" on the local magnetic environment of the probes, which do not seriously
perturb their surroundings. The research seeks better understanding of the
behavior of 1) oxide magnets closely related to high-temperature
superconductors, and 2) the so-called heavy-electron metals, in which electrons
behave as if they were hundreds or even thousands of times more massive than the
free electrons. The work will involve university, government laboratory,
industrial and international collaboration. ***
