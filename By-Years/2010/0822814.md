This is a cross-cultural study of how groups and organizations retain and share
organizational knowledge via transactive memory (TM) systems. TM systems are
knowledge retention systems focused not on knowledge per se but on knowledge
about where knowledge resides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is original in
three key ways. First, it bridges the divide between organizational behavior and
information systems by investigating the interplay between human TM systems
(i.e., one-to-one human connections) and technological TM systems (i.e., one-to-
many communal, cyberenabled systems). Second, it examines how human affect
influences the development and functioning of TM systems at multiple levels:
between individuals, among groups and throughout networks of individuals and
groups. Third, it examines the development and usage of connective and communal
TM systems in different nations: US and China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition
to testing theories related to TM, the results of this research should help
teams, their managers, their organizations, and their networks of partners to
better manage crucial knowledge resources, including insights about how best to
deal with cultural differences in a globalizing economy.
