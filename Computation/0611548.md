Optimization of large scale eigenvalue computations is a long-standing problem
in computational mathematics and scientific computing community. In this
project, the PI and his collaborators will develop novel structure-preserving
algorithms for accurately and efficiently solving large scale eigenvalue
problems. Specifically, they will focus on large scale eigenvalue problems of
structured matrix pencils, quadratic eigenvalue problems and nonlinear
eigenvalue problems. They will study structure-preserving Rayleight-Ritz
subspace projection techniques for solving these eigenvalue problems, that
include the multi-level orthogonalization process of Krylov subspaces, second-
order Arnoldi (SOAR) method and the nonlinear Arnoldi method.

The goal of the project represents a significant advance in a frontier area of
scientific endeavor and engineering design through the application of
computational mathematics and simulations. The target applications include these
types of eigenvalue problems arising from simulations of electrical circuits and
MEMS devices, finite element analysis of structure dynamics, acoustics and
electromagnetics. These applications are of great technology importance for
next-generation electronics, automobile efficiency and safety and energy-
efficiency monitoring devices and others. The results of this project will be
both the description of effective computational simulation strategies for these
problems and also software made publicly available.
