The proposed project focuses on cluster algebras and total positivity. Fomin and
Zelevinsky have repeatedly encountered in their work a new kind of
combinatorics, which they axiomatized as so-called cluster algebras. Cluster
algebras have found applications in numerous areas of mathematics in recent
years, such as quiver representations, non-commutative geometry, discrete
integrable systems, Teichmuller theory and even string theory. In joint work
with Sergey Fomin, the PI will explore a model for certain cluster algebras in
terms of tensor diagrams. The PI will also study a closely related topic of
total positivity in joint work with Thomas Lam. Totally positive parts of
algebraic groups are closely related to cluster algebras and Lusztig's canonical
bases. The proposed research continues the study of affine total positivity,
which is a new and fruitful direction in this area.

The proposed project is rooted in two areas of mathematics: representation
theory and combinatorics. Representation theory is an important area that is
fundamental for the study of quantum mechanics and particle physics. Cluster
algebras provide a new approach to representation theory and related
disciplines. The PI's research focuses on cluster algebras that lie just beyond
the current frontier of our understanding (the so called infinite mutation
type). The notion, closely related to cluster algebras, of total positivity
first appeared in the literature at the beginning of previous century. It is a
major tool for understanding oscillations in mechanical systems. The PI's work
concentrates on extending this theory to the affine (or infinite dimensional)
case.
