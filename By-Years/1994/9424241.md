Dr. Suzanne Harris and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Wyoming are being supported for a new Research Experiences for
Undergraduates site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Research opportunities will include analytical,
environmental, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry. In addition,
participants will learn safety, library search methods, notebook and report
preparation, and verbal skills for communication of scientific ideas. A unique
feature of the program is a personal effort to recruit Native Americans from
institutions targeted by the University's American Indian Studies Program.
