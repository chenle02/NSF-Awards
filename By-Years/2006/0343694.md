Abstract: A variety of structures on three-manifolds have contributed
significantly to our understanding: notably, geometric structures,
incompressible surfaces, foliations, laminations, contact structures, automatic
structures on fundamental groups of three-manifolds, and the lattice of finite-
sheeted coverings of three-manifolds. There are many connections among these
structures, but nevertheless the known connections are sporadic and often only
loose, although suggestive of deeper connections remaining to be discovered. The
PI will investigate these various structures and their interrelationships, with
an emphasis on analyzing computability, and developing techniques for actually
constructing and computing examples. For example, is there a construction to go
from a taut foliation or an essential lamination to a geometric decomposition?
And conversely, does every hyperbolic 3-manifold admit a foliation or at least a
genuine lamination?

Three-manifolds are the mathematical descriptions of the possible ways for
3-dimensional space to be topologically interconnected. They are important
because they arise through geometric models in every corner of mathematics. A
central theme in modern three-manifold topology is the Geometrization
conjecture, which is the conjecture that all three-manifolds are made up of
locally homogeneous pieces, that is, three-manifolds that have a geometry in
which a neighborhood of any one point is completely identical to a neighborhood
of any other point, up to some fixed radius. This conjecture, proposed by the PI
about 20 years ago is now supported by a great deal of theoretical and empirical
evidence. Nonetheless, many basic questions remain unknown, including the famous
Poincare conjecture a special case of the Geometrization conjecture which
asserts that there is only one possible topology for a three-manifold in which
every loop can be contracted to fit inside a small ball. Besides geometric
structures for 3-manifolds, there are a number of other interesting structures
that have important implications for topology, but only loose connections among
them are understood. Among these structures are incompressible surfaces,
foliations (a kind of layered structure), laminations (layered structures that
only exist on part of the manifold), contact structures (related to Hamiltonian
mechanics), and various combinatorial structures from group theory. The PI will
investigate connections among these various structures, with an emphasis on
computability and techniques of making actual computations of examples
