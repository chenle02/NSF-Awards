0452465&lt;br/&gt;Fornari&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides support for the development of a shared-
use facility for digital deep-sea photography in support of deep-sea research.
This MISO (Multidisciplinary Instrumentation in Support of Oceanography)
facility will provide researchers with access to digital cameras in towed frames
(TowCams), for time-lapse deployments, or for use in conjunction with
submersibles and remotely operated vehicles of the National Deep Submergence
Facility. The tools will become part of the standard array of instruments
available to US oceanographic researchers, and they are expected to be of
substantial advantage to scientists in their deep-sea research during 2005 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
