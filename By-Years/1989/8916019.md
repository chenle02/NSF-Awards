The proposed research is designed to test the hypothesis that melatonin binds
to a cell surface receptor which, through an interaction with the guanine
nucleotide binding protein Gi, decreases cAMP production, protein kinase
activity, and protein phosophorylation to cause rearrangement of the cytoskelton
and melanosome migration in cultured amphibian melanophores. Characterization of
the molecular mechanism of melatonin action in the amphibian melanophore, a
simple and well characterized cellular system with a demonstrable response to
melatonin treatment, will provide an important precedent that may lead to an
understanding of melatonin's mechanism of action in more complex systems. The
proposed research is based upon the PI's finding that pertussis toxin prevents
melatonin action in amphibian melanophores and upon an in vitro melanophore
culture technology developed by the PI. In the proposed research, melatonin-
induced rearrangements of cytoskeletal components will be characterized, by
studying fixed and detergent permeabilized cells treated with fluorescent
cytoskeleton markers. Melatonin-induced changes in protein phosphorylation will
be evaluated by employing SDS-PAGE to separate proteins incorporating
radiophosphate after melatonin treatment and by employing radioenzymatic
analysis of protein kinase activities. This research will lead to an
understanding of the molecular mechanism of melatonin action which, in the long
term, will suggest pharmacological approaches for correcting biological rhythm
disorders or for synchronizing biological rhythms to coincide with specific
external events.
