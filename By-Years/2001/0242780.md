Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Gorokhovsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal belongs to the
area of noncommutative geometry. It is devoted to three projects. The goal of
the first project is to obtain construction of characteristic classes for the
important class of noncommutative spaces, arising naturally in the contexts of
discrete group actions on manifolds and foliations. The approach is based on the
recently developed by A. Connes and H. Moscovici theory of cyclic cohomology of
Hopf algebras. The goal of the second project (joint work with R. Nest and A.
Uribe) is to obtain index theorem for algebras of Fourier integral operators,
and study applications of these results. The third project (joint work with J.
Lott) is devoted to the proof of the local version of Connes' index theorem for
etale groupoids, as well as various extensions of this theorem. Noncommutative
geometry is a field of mathematics situated on the crossroads between analysis,
geometry, and mathematical physics. Discovery of quantum mechanics has shown
that the classical principles of geometry are not applicable to the world of
microscopic particles. Noncommutative geometry unifies geometry with analysis
for the solution of the problems of quantum mechanics. Different parts of the
present work deals both with solving internal problems of noncommutative
geometry and with applying methods of noncommutative geometry to other parts of
mathematics and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;
