Smith 95-28080 Dr. Smith will complete the survey of variable stars in the Draco
dwarf spheroidal galaxy which was initiated by Baade and Swope almost 40 years
ago. New CCD observations will provide accurate multicolor lightcurves which
will place the variables in the HR diagram and, together with follow-up
spectroscopic observations, test the existence of a metallicity-luminosity
relation in that system. Intensive series of photometric observations of
multiperiodic RR Lyrae stars will provide the observational base needed to test
theories of that poorly understood phenomenon. RR Lyrae variables in M14, M15
and M53 also will be studied. ***
