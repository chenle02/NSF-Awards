0329398 Chrysikopoulos The specific aim of this proposal is to experimentally
investigate the feasibility of applying acoustic waves toward residual phase
NAPLs in saturated porous media to enhance dissolution and cause mobilization.
Our proposal seeks to employ pore network and monolayer bead experiments
involving residual phase dense NAPL (DNAPL) saturations and ganglia with the
addition of acoustic waves to constant background water flow. The reasons for
performing network and monolayer bead experiments for this work are three fold.
First, both experiments allow direct observation and measurement of DNAPL
mobilization due to acoustic waves. Second, direct observation/measurement of
the DNAPL water interfacial areas will allow exact determination of mass
transfer coefficients, that cannot be determined in column experiments, with and
without the addition of acoustic waves. Third and finally, use of pore network
and monolayer bead experiments will allow a precise description of fluid flow
due to the regular pore geometries employed
