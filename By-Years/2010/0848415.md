The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of NSF Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research program of Professor S. Alex Kandel in the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame under a project
titled, "Gas-Surface Chemistry of Self-Assembled Monolayers." Professor Kandel
and his students are investigating how the exact arrangement of atoms and
molecules that make up a surface influence the rate and type of chemical
reactions that occur when the surface is exposed to reactive gases. The Kandel
research group uses scanning tunneling microscopy to develop atomic-scale movies
that map out the location and behavior of individual molecules during the course
of a chemical reaction. They specifically investigate the reactions of thin
organic films with hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine atoms. The study could lead to
development of new materials with improved stability in reactive chemical
environments such as flames, plasmas, and the upper atmosphere. The project will
provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students
in the central discipline of physical chemistry and in the interdisciplinary
fields of surface science and nanotechnology.
