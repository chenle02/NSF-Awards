This project examines the development since World War II of federal policies to
regulate the relationship between home and work. Such policies specify how work
organizations are to treat individuals defined in terms of their family status.
The project focuses on three aspects of policy development: the movement of
issues on and off the congressional agenda, the development of alternative
proposals, and the enactment of legislation. Factors affecting policy
development will include the concerns of experts, media coverage, activities of
interest groups and social movements, and public opinion. The PI will analyze
the contents of policy proposals, gathered from government documents, reports in
newspapers, specialized journals, and public opinion polls. The results will be
an analysis of a major policy area, which will aid the study of other issue
areas.
