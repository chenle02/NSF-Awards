The ability of jurors to deal with the complex issues involved in contemporary
civil litigation has been of increasing concern. There is currently no formally
accepted definition of complex litigation nor has there been an empirical
demonstration of the dimensions of complexity. Further, little is known about
how complexity may interfere with jurors' ability to reach a verdict. This study
examines effects of evidentiary and legal complexity on the jury decision
process. Integrating and adapting recently developed theoretical approaches to
jury decisionmaking, the research aims to test an explanation-based model of
decisionmaking that suggests that jurors process evidence as a narrative
organization of the trial data in which causal and intentional relations are of
fundamental importance. Decisionmakers are presumed to construct an intermediate
memory model of the trial data, and this representation, not the "raw" evidence,
guides interpretation of the evidence. An experiment will be conducted to test
this story model using 864 jury eligible individuals. The design includes the
investigation of the influence of three dimensions of evidence complexity:
informational load (high, moderate, or low rate of processing); technical
complexity (high and moderate); and implicational clarity (pro plaintiff, pro
defendant, and neutral or ambivalent). This research promises to make a major
advance in jury research. Introducing trial complexity into this line of
research will have significant theoretical and practical implications for
understanding juror decisionmaking. The analysis will also make an important
contribution to cognitive psychology by contributing to our understanding of
cognitive strategies for coping with complex judgment tasks.
