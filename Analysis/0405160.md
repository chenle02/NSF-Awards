Midwest Dynamical Systems Conferences

ABSTRACT

This award will hold conferences concerning various aspects of dynamical systems
for the two years beginning September 2004. We will cover expenses of
approximately 30 participants each of the two years. After covering some
expenses for speakers, the priorities will be to support graduate students and
nontenured researchers.

The Midwest Dynamical Systems Group has fostered the interaction of a diverse
group of people working in various aspects of dynamical systems, from
topological to analytical, and from theoretical to applied. We have also
actively supported the research of younger researchers. This program has been
active since about 1970.

Speakers for 2004-5 include Robert Williams (University of Texas), Robert
Devaney (Boston University), Carl Simon (University of Michigan), Michal
Misiurewicz (IUPUI), and Hassan Aref.
