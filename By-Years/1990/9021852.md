This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Beloit College for the renovation
and repair of the Chamberlin Science Building which houses that institution's
biology research and research training activities. This building was constructed
in 1967 and has not had any major renovations since then. The ARFMP grant of
$146,000 and $170,020 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by facilitating
the conduct of a greater diversity of projects. The renovation can be expected
to reduce contamination that currently challenges some research efforts and to
allow investigations to proceed with more exacting controls. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and research training of quality
undergraduate students. In this biology program, individual research is dominant
and students, alone or together with faculty, are trained primarily through
their own independent investigations.
