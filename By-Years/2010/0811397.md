For virtually the entire history of computing, improvements in the speed of
sequential computations, which execute only a single task at a time, have been
the primary source of increased computing power. But the computing field is now
encountering fundamental limits on the underlying computing substrate that
eliminate this source of performance improvement. The field must instead work
with parallel computers, which obtain increased performance by performing
multiple tasks at the same time. A key challenge to obtaining these performance
benefits is the difficulty of developing parallel software that can correctly
coordinate the activities of multiple tasks that execute at the same time. The
research addresses this difficulty by investigating the development of
compilation techniques designed to automatically translate sequential software
that performs a single task at a time into parallel software that automatically
performs multiple tasks at the same time.

The research focuses on modern object-oriented computations that manipulate
linked data structures such as lists, graphs, and trees. It builds on the recent
availability of verified implementations of these data structures to reason with
the more general abstract data structure state as opposed to the concrete
objects and references that the data structure implementations manipulate when
they run. The developer can then use the abstract data structure state to
specify an equivalence condition that any parallel computation must satisfy. The
expected result is that the analysis techniques will be able to use the
equivalence condition to automatically generate parallel software that may
produce a different but equivalent result as the corresponding sequential
software. This additional freedom promises to substantially broaden the range of
computations that are amenable to automatic analysis for faster parallel
execution.
