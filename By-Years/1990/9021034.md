The dynamics and physical structures in the cores of molecular clouds are
important because they are key ingredients for understanding the clouds and
their physical and chemical evolution. Dr. Helene Dickel will investigate the
velocity, temperature, and density fields of interstellar clouds by comparing
observed intensity profiles of different transitions of molecular species with
theoretical profiles calculated from the transfer of radiation through a model
cloud. Dr. Dickel will be looking for unique signatures in the profiles which
either point to a particular dynamical situation or by their existence (or
absence) can place bounds on a particular range of cloud parameters.
