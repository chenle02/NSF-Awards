The studies in this proposal are focused on the analysis of motion by living
organisms or individual cells either through live video image or videotaped
records of movement patterns. The CellTrakTM motion analysis system, with its
proprietary video processor, is the primary instrument in the request.
CellTrakTM is based on video "frame-grabber" technology: digitization of the
video frames and subsequent computerized analysis of the digitized images in a
time framework. It has been designed to trace paths of movement from video
records and then analyze the path shapes using algorithms that calculate speed,
direction, frequency of turning, path length, and other parameters related to
motion. CellTrakTM will be used in three distinct areas of research: 1) to
analyze the social correlates of foraging behavior of ants; 2) to examine
chemotactic swimming behavior of scallop sperm in relation to egg-derived
attractants and fertilization; 3) to investigate the role of specific membrane
receptors and trans-membrane ion fluxes in chemosensory behavior of Paramecium.
The requested equipment also includes a static image processor software
accessory (BioscanR OptimasTM) which will be used in conjunction with CellTrakTM
for the analysis of low-contrast video images or whenever contrast enhancement
preprocessing is necessary before accurate analysis of movement can be obtained.
