Professor Bellow and Jones will continue their study of almost everywhere
convergence questions which arise in ergodic theory and more generally in
analysis. They will focus on a number of issues. Central among them are
Bourgain's entropy criterion and the strong sweeping out property. They will
also study problems involving averaging over thin sets such as sets of Banach
density zero in the individual ergodic theorem, discrete averages in the case of
a one parameter flow, annuli in the case of a two parameter flow, etc. One
project on which they plan to spend some time involves almost everywhere
convergence for integrable functions. This is a difficult area but the principal
investigators hope to make some progress using Calderon-Zygmund decompositions.
This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general
concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too
complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading
"dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract
transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact
with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
