Professor Bass will work on problems in three areas of stochastic processes:
the construction and properties of Brownian motion on fractals; properties of
set-indexed and multiparameter processes; and probabilistic approaches to
singular integrals. The theory of stochastic processes is part of the larger
category of probability theory. Generally speaking, this subfield deals with
changes in a system that occur over time in probabilistic fashion. Professor
Bass is recognized by his peers as one of the stronger young probabilists
working in this subfield. The results of his research will be eagerly awaited.
