In this renewal project, the PI will continue to study the characteristics of
subtropical cyclones, but will now focus on the occurrence of such cyclones in
the Atlantic ocean basin. A climatology of sub-tropical cyclones will be made
for a ten-year period from high-resolution analyses. The investigation will
employ both synoptic-climatological and case study approaches as well as
simulations with a regional high resolution model. The latter will be used to
study the evolution of a subtropical cyclone into a tropical cyclone. Weather
events associated with these developments are of interest to weather forecasting
in North America and improved predictions are likely to have large benefits for
society. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this
research.
