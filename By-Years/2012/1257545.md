Predicting how the abundance of populations of plants and animals will change
through time depends on recognizing differences among individuals, e.g., young
vs. old, mature vs. immature, and on how those differences affect individual
survival, growth, development, and reproduction, collectively known as the vital
rates. Mathematical models based on these vital rates play an important role in
both basic and applied population ecology. For example, they can measure the
impact of environmental factors on population dynamics, evaluate strategies for
the management of natural resources, and project the consequences of global
change on species abundance. However, in addition to obvious differences among
individuals, all populations contain some level of heterogeneity among
individuals that cannot be measured. This heterogeneity may result from
physiological processes driven by food availability, genetic variation,
individual history, or environmental effects. This project will develop new
mathematical models that include such types of heterogeneity. The population
demographic models will be analyzed to quantify the effects of heterogeneity on
population growth and sensitivity patterns, and applied to long-term data on
Antarctic seabird populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational outreach is a
critical aspect of mathematical research in ecology. With the goal of making the
results of the research more widely accessible to other researchers, an
educational workshop will be organized at the national Annual Meeting of the
Ecological Society of America. The models that result from this work will also
have practical application in the management of wildlife populations, and in
conservation biology.
