*** 9661717 Hu This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
study the problem of reconstructing a three dimensional object from its
projections acquired with a large area detector and cone-shaped x-ray beams.
This problem is fundamental to the volumetric computerized tomography (CT)
scanner development and has not yet been successfully solved. Based on the
concept of function decomposition developed by the Principal Investigator, a
"hybrid-type" reconstruction algorithm for the circle-and-line scanning orbit,
consisting of a circular scan and a linear scan has been explored. In this
project, the remaining problems associated with this algorithm will be studied.
Specifically, the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of this
algorithm will be further improved by selecting the optimal theoretical
formulation and numerical implementation. Furthermore, the algorithm will be
extended to handle the object that is taller than the detector. This situation
routinely occurs in practice. It will be demonstrated that this hybrid-type
algorithm will combine the strengths and eliminate the weakness of existing
algorithms and therefore could become the preferable algorithm for cone beam
scanner development The successful development of this algorithm will accelerate
the commercialization of the fast volumetric CT scanner. With drastic
improvement in throughput and volume scanning capability, application of this
technology will generate fundamental impacts in the fields of medicine,
manufacturing industry, material science and engineering. ***
