The analysis of a reinforced concrete building subjected to seismic forces is
very complex because of the nonlinear properties of the concrete. This project
will investigate the development of a computer program for a personal computer
to analyze a reinforced concrete building for seismic effects. The method will
also be beneficial to determine countermeasures to mitigate building damage as a
result of seismic forces.
