0321275&lt;br/&gt;Raphael&lt;br/&gt;The ability to label individual molecules
inside of living cells with fluorescent probes has revolutionized our
understanding of basic cell biology and opened new opportunities to bioengineer
living cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy has proved to be a powerful and
versatile technique for studying fluorescent molecules in cells. Rice University
recognized the importance of this technique, and purchased a Zeiss LSM 410
confocal microscope in 1993. This microscope has supported numerous research
projects in cell biology and bioengineering. However, there are serious
limitations in the current technology, including limited ability to resolve
molecules with overlapping emission spectra and the damage to cells that occurs
with laser excitation. The importance and magnitude of these issues led Carl
Zeiss, Inc. to expend a significant amount of time and resources to develop a
user-friendly system that can overcome these problems. Zeiss recently integrated
powerful new technologies, including novel algorithms for resolving overlapping
emission spectra and the ability to use multi-photon laser excitation, into
their new confocal microscope. The new system is called the 510 LSM META/NLO.
