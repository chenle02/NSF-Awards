This project will investigate sources of short-period gravity waves at high
polar latitudes as well as the atmospheric conditions which influence their
propagation. This investigation will utilize measurements of gravity waves and
mesospheric wind speeds acquired by an all-sky imager and meteor radar co-
located at Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. The observed wave data will be
analyzed in conjunction with the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction
System Advanced High Altitude (NOGAPS-ALPHA) forecasting and data assimilative
model of the upper atmosphere, along with a Fourier ray tracing model for
localization of wave source regions. This analysis will result in an
identification of dominant wave sources at high latitudes, including an
assessment of the importance of orographic waves, as well as a characterization
of atmospheric conditions which affect wave ducting and propagation.
