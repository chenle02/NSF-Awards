Partial support is requested to defray room and board costs for graduate
students attending the 1993 West Coast Regional Developmental Biology
Conference. The conference will be held on March 25-28 at the UCLA Conference
Center at Lake Arrowhead, California. The program includes 24 speakers, who were
chosen both for their scientific excellence and to provide a full mix of gender,
race, and degree of professional advancement, as well as to provide information
of interest in both animal and plant development. The topics to be addressed in
the five formal sessions are: ı1! Asymmetric Cell Divisions in Differentiation,
ı2! Control of Pattern Formation, ı3! Steroid Hormone Action on the Developing
Nervous System, ı4! Influences of Bacteria on the Development of Higher Plants
and Animals, and ı5! Determinants of Cell Fate. The conference will also include
a keynote address to be given by Dr. Mark Konishi on the development of bird
song, and all attendees will be encouraged to present their own work at a formal
poster session.
