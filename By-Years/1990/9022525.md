Principal Investigator plans to investigate three issues central to the
understanding of disordered solids: 1) structural metastability in amorphous
silicon; 2) apparant Bloch-like nature of electronic states in amorphous carbon;
3) microscopic mechanism of electronic conduction in disordered metals such as
inversion layers in metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. New theoretical and
computational methods will be developed for solving the electronic Schroedinger
Equation for disordered materials.
