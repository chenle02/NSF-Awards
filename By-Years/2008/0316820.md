Phagocytosis of foreign microorganisms by macrophages is a critical event in the
initial response of the immune system to infection. Phagocytosis is a complex
process that involves the sequential envelopment, internalization, and
intracellular degradation of the invading organism within a membrane-enclosed
phagosome. In order for macrophages to enclose extracellular objects, they must
first form structures known as pseudopodia, extensions of the plasma membrane
that can engulf a foreign object. Pseudopod formation is driven by both the
intracellular production of membrane vesicles that fuse with the cell membrane
to increase its surface area, as well as the polymerization of an underlying
cytoskeletal substructure that supports the pseudopod. The goal of this project
is to test the role of protein called dynamin as a master regulator of the early
events of phagocytosis. Previous work has shown that dynamin is essential for
phagocytosis. This project will define the role of dynamin in phagocytosis by
determining (a) the location and behavior of dynamin during the internalization
of foreign objects, (b) the structural features of dynamin that are important
for its function and (c) the signaling pathway responsible for dynamin
activation. A wide range of electrophysiological, biochemical and molecular
tools will be used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phagocytic cells such as macrophages
represent an organism's first line of defense against infectious microorganisms,
yet our knowledge of the fundamental processes involved in phagocytosis is still
sketchy. Indeed, many pathogenic bacterial and viral species have evolved
mechanisms to subvert the normal phagocytic process. With a better understanding
of the molecular mechanisms underlying the phagocytic process, it will be
possible to design strategies to block the ability of microorganisms to
circumvent their internalization and destruction. &lt;br/&gt;
