9733502 Ram Where do electrons go ? They emerge from the source and dive toward
the drain. Their path between drain and source is inferred from a detailed
knowledge of the conductive terrain. Manipulating the electron's path has been
the goal of electrical engineering for over 100 years. At the present time there
is no practical technique for tracking the electron's journey through small
circuits or devices. This career plan is to develop a noninvasive current probe
that is capable of monitoring the current distribution in electronic devices and
circuits. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) can provide highly resolved images of
the current path inside mesoscopic devices. MFM's ability to sense magnetic
field gradients over distances as small as 10 manometers can be used to sense
the stray field surrounding a moving electron. The potential for spatially
resolving currents inside devices has not previously been available because of
the limited (0.3 to 10 Jim) resolution of other field contrast microscopies.
Direct measurements of magnetic fields associated with interconnect lines and
their associated inductances may provide insight into new circuit topologies. An
unprecedented look at the internal structure of the electron flow will enable
the observation of theoretically predicted structures such as current vortices
and electron shock waves. Detailed images of current distributions would reveal
such structures whereas previous external measurements of source and drain
currents.could only infer their existence. Seeing an electron's path involves
representing the @ data in a visually engaging and meaningful way. The graphical
representation of such intangible, yet physical quantities brings together
physics and aesthetics. This interface can be a fruitful arena for the education
of young scientists. Building on the principal investigator's previous
experience working together with art and science students on effective
scientific visualization, this proposal develops a curriculum for elementary
school and college students. ***
