The Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Arizona will purchase an HP 3566A PC Spectrum Analyzer which will be dedicated
to support research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular the development of a real time active
chatter controller. It is proposed to develop both analytically and in hardware
the necessary techniques for the real time control of machine tool chatter and
to implement this system in a manner that allows for integration into existing
CNC machine tools. To accomplish this objective, research will focus on
development of techniques for real time identification of the transfer function
between the cutting tool and the workpiece for a variety of metal working
machines as the machine tool operates in the fully developed chatter regime.
Development of an adaptive closed-loop control strategy (based on the data
provided by the real time system identification technique) for minimizing the
motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. Initial research will focus
on lathe chatter with the extension to a more broad class of machine tools,
including (but not limited to) milling machines and surface grinders, in the
future.*** //
