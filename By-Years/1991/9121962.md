This research is intended to evaluate, analyze and design a completely novel
approach to configuring Computer Numeric Control (CNC) metal-cutting machine
tools. Traditional CNC machines are primarily configured as a set of mutually
perpendicular linear axes and cutting tool paths are generated by the
interpolation of these linear axes, to cut the variety of shapes hat have to be
manufactured. In this approach the machine tool consists of only rotary axes and
all the variety of tool paths that need to be generated will result from their
interpolation. The benefits of configuring the machine in this manner are well
established but complex and significant control issues need to be evaluated and
addressed in order to establish the feasibility of this approach. The success of
this program, which is being jointly funded by a quasi-industry organization,
could lead to minor revolution in the way conventional machine tools are
configured and potentially provide the domestic industry an opportunity to
exploit.
