Killer yeasts produce extracellular proteins that are toxic to other yeasts.
The yeast Pichia kluyveri has several forms that differ in their ability to make
killer toxins. The differences are known to be determined by nuclear genes in
the natural populations of this yeast. The research described in this proposal
will investigate the effects of the genes controlling killer toxin production in
P. kluyveri on the ability of this yeast to survive and reproduce. The research
is primarily focused on the problem of how genes for production of killer toxins
are maintained in natural populations and why some populations contain both
killer positive and killer negative strains. This work should add to our
understanding of how genetic diversity is maintained in natural communities as
well as the role of killer systems in the natural environment. Killer yeasts are
also important as contaminants in industry, particularly the brewing industry,
so this research may be useful in understanding the killer yeasts that are
problems in industrial fermentation.
