This award is to develop a new servo controller architecture for machine tools
incorporating the methodologies of variable gain cross-coupling and real time
adjustment of apparent axial moment of inertia. These two approaches have been
independently demonstrated to improve interpolation errors in contour machining.
The combining of these methodologies and extending them to multi- axes
contouring is a logical and necessary extension of this research, to achieve
higher accuracies while contour machining at normal and high speeds. This
research effort, in close collaboration with manufacturers of Computer Numerical
Control systems, will be of significance to the domestic industrial base while
advancing the state-of-art in servo controlled systems applied to manufacturing.
