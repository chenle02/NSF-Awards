CNS-0346939&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Language-based Distributed System
Security&lt;br/&gt;Stephan A. Zdancewic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed systems
are an increasingly crucial part of modern&lt;br/&gt;computing infrastructure,
yet the existing technology for ensuring&lt;br/&gt;their security and
reliability is lacking. This research addresses&lt;br/&gt;the problem of
building distributed systems and reasoning about their&lt;br/&gt;security by
developing programming languages that provide better&lt;br/&gt;abstractions for
describing security policies and communication&lt;br/&gt;protocols.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for this project is existing work on
security-typed&lt;br/&gt;languages, which protect data confidentiality and
integrity. This&lt;br/&gt;research generalizes these information-flow policies
to make them more&lt;br/&gt;dynamic, enabling them to accommodate the changing
environment in which&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems run. For example, dynamic
information-flow&lt;br/&gt;policies should integrate cleanly with traditional
authentication and&lt;br/&gt;access control mechanisms to provide end-to-end
guarantees about data&lt;br/&gt;confidentiality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second
stage of this project is to develop language technology&lt;br/&gt;that applies
dynamic security policies to distributed programs. The&lt;br/&gt;idea for this
part of the research is to develop a theoretical basis&lt;br/&gt;for secure
distributed computing using existing process calculi&lt;br/&gt;augmented with a
heterogeneous trust model and the policy language&lt;br/&gt;outlined above. In
this setting, types describe communication&lt;br/&gt;protocols, properties of
which can be verified statically by the&lt;br/&gt;compiler. The result will be a
programming language with a sound type&lt;br/&gt;system that aids the programmer
in writing correct, security-critical&lt;br/&gt;distributed programs.&lt;br/&gt;
