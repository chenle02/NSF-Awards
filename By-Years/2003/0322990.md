This project seeks to answer the questions of network proximity estimation,
other than direct measurement, by exploring a new analysis approach, combined
with large-scale network measurement. Currently, there are very few methods for
estimating network proximity, which can add significant overhead to both
application and network in terms of delays and additional traffic. Newly
emerging Internet applications, e.g. content delivery networks, peer-to-peer
networks, multiuser games, overlay routing networks, and applications employing
dynamic server selection, depend for its optimal configuration on accurate
measures of network proximity. Recent effort in network proximity estimation has
suggested that a promising approach may be to model network distances using
coordinate systems; that is, via an embedding of network distances into
Euclidean space. This approach has many appealing properties, but many
fundamental questions remain unanswered: Is a Euclidean embedding effective in
general? What is the appropriate dimension to use, and what is the best method
for mapping distance measurements into a Euclidean space? How scalable are the
resulting schemes? For what sorts of distance metrics are such schemes
appropriate? The new analytic approaches proposed here are based on linear
algebraic techniques, in particular the application of Principal Component
Analysis to the problem of constructing good coordinate systems for the
Internet. This project will collect and analyze a large set of network
measurements to assess coordinate schemes on truly representative data and
develop new algorithms for constructing coordinate schemes that are accurate and
yet scalable to thousands of nodes, made available in the form of freely
distributed tools.
