This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. McGaugh will continue his work to
determine the masses of the different components of disk galaxies, in particular
the stellar disk, the gaseous disk and the dark halo. He will assemble velocity-
resolved maps in the H-alpha line of ionized gas and in neutral hydrogen, to
measure the density of gas in the galaxy disk, and its velocity field, for about
100 disk galaxies with a wide range in properties. He will use near-infrared
K-band images to determine the distribution of stellar mass, fitting the
rotation curves to obtain the mass contributions of the different components. In
the low-surface-brightness disks where the dark halo dominates the gravitational
forces, he will use the measured velocity field to search for evidence of the
steep inner cusp predicted by simulations with standard Cold Dark Matter. The
larger sample of galaxies will be used to derive the initial halo mass profiles
by proper treatment of adiabatic compression. Finally, he will calibrate an
empirical mass-discrepancy--acceleration relation. The mass discrepancy is
defined locally as the difference between the observed circular speed of
rotation and that predicted from the gas and stars alone. This discrepancy is
related to the orbital speed of disk material; the present study aims to
characterize that relation better as a step towards understanding its
origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr McGaugh will continue his program of outreach to
elementary-school children. He will distribute the data products and models from
this study to the astronomical community on a web page.
