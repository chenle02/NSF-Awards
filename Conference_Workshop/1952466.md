The 2020 PIMS-CRM Summer School in Probability will be held at the University of
British Columbia, Canada, from June 1-26, 2020. The main organizations
sponsoring the school are the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences
(PIMS) and Centre de Recherches Mathematique (CRM). The school will be devoted
to the training of doctoral students in the area of probability and this award
will provide support for the US based participants in the school.

The summer school will consists of two principal courses and three short
courses. The main courses will be devoted to interacting particle systems,
probabilistic growth models, stochastic partial differential equations, directed
polymers, metastability, phase transitions, and large deviations. It is expected
that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by
the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their
current research. The PIMS summer schools in probability theory were launched in
2004, and this will be the 10th school. Past participants have become current
academic faculty, able to spread their knowledge further in the research
community. The detailed information about the summer school is available and
will be continually updated at http://www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob20/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
