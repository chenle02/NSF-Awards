9421237 Lensky Microorganisms perform various ecological functions that may be
either beneficial (e.g., decomposition of wastes) or deleterious (e.g.,
pathogens of humans and crops), depending on the particular species and
environmental context. Much is known about the biochemistry and molecular
genetics of certain microorganisms, but very little is known about the
population dynamics of microorganisms and how various ecological and genetic
factors affect microbial evolution. The proposed research seeks to identify and
quantify important ecological and genetic processes that may influence the
dynamics of microbial populations. There are two major objectives (1) To model
mathematically the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions in order to understand
the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape virulence, especially in
relation to specific modes of pathogen transmission and (2) To quantify
experimentally the genetic variation in bacterial populations for such important
phenotypic traits as competitiveness and cell size, including the contribution
of deleterious mutations, substitution of favorable mutations, and balanced
polymorphisms to this variation.
