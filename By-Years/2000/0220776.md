Summary: This proposal requests support to collect a series of high accumulation
rate cores from the Indonesian region. Analyses of the cores will be used to
document the nature of centennial-millennial variability in the Western Pacific
Warm Pool and Indonesian throughflow. The field program will obtain a series of
cores in depth transects beginning at about 200m water depth along the main
route of the Indonesian throughflow including the Makassar Strait, Sulawesi Sea
and Timor channels. The post cruise analytical program will focus on
establishing a basic stratigraphic framework for selected cores using planktic
foraminifer oxygen isotope measurements and AMS 14C dating. In addition surface
sediment samples will be used for an initial temperature calibration study on
shallow water benthic foraminifer Mg/Ca.
