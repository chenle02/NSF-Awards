This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the
feasibility to develop effective replacements for fluorochemicals that are
widely used in the textile industry to produce soil and stain resistant finishes
on clothes, upholstery, carpet and medical textiles. Fluorochemicals, while
highly effective, have been shown to be persistent in the environment, bio-
accumulative, and have recently been cited by the Environmental Protection
Agency as probable carcinogens. Moreover, fluorochemicals and the precursors
used to prepare these materials such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been
shown to accumulate in human breast tissue and in arctic wildlife. There is a
clear need to develop an effective replacement for fluorochemicals that provides
the benefits of fluorochemicals but is not bio-accumulative and is not harmful
to the environment or people. G3 Technology Innovations will develop novel
advanced materials utilizing nanoparticle surface modification methods developed
by G3i, to create a superhydrophobic, nano-rough surface in a single-step
process.

The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project is to eliminate the use
of fluorochemicals in water-resistant textile finishes. The novelty of this
technology is that it provides a soil and stain resistant finish that is free of
fluorochemicals, contains no VOCs, and can be applied to fabric using existing
textile finishing equipment in a single-step process. This technology will be
highly beneficial to the US textile industry, enabling differentiation from
foreign competition. Furthermore, the technology is beneficial to society at
large since it virtually eliminates a major source of environmental pollution.
