9400307 Middleton This project involves the dissertation research of a student
in cultural anthropology from Yale University, studying an elite secondary
school in Kenya, Africa. The student will conduct participant observation in the
school, and study the development through its colonial history of the school's
customary practices and the educational values of both teachers and students. In
addition the student will do a survey of a sample of students in their home
communities, to assess their cultural backgrounds. The focus of the study will
be to determine how the students' cultural backgrounds and knowledge of history
interact with the school's program as developed through its own historical
trajectory through colonialism and independence to the present situation of many
global influences. The focal event to be explained is a violent attact against
girls by boys protesting some administrative decisions in a similar elite school
in Kenya in 1991. This research is important because schooling is commonly
thought to be the unique road to cultural and social advancement in developing
nations. Understanding how one elite school works in historical context will
provide a case study that will be valuable in interpreting and reacting to
student protests and activities in similar schools in similar countries. ***
