One of the biggest mysteries in lightning science is the Narrow Bipolar Event
(NBE), a rapid intracloud charge transfer. Its physics remains enigmatic,
because the NBE: (a) lacks readily detectable light output, unlike all other
known lightning of comparable current; (b) lacks any detectable channel-
preparation (leader) process, again unlike all other known lightning strokes;
and (c) radiates the most powerful High-Frequency (HF) and Very-High-Frequency
(VHF) emissions compared with those of any lightning.

Intellectual merit. This study will investigate the properties of NBEs using
both satellite- and ground-based observational data. In particular, the project
involves analyzing polarization and spectral information in the data by studying
all VHF events. The research will improve current understanding of the physics
of NBEs, and may advance our knowledge on lightning initiation processes.

Broader impacts. The remote sensing of lightning from space is an important
proxy for monitoring convective weather processes. Detecting and understanding
of intracloud charge transfer may improve prediction of severe weather. The
research may also shed light on lightning initiation processes, terrestrial
gamma ray flashes, or any other types of unusual discharges in the atmosphere. A
graduate student will be trained in this subject area as well.
