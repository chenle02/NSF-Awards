9421859 Greene This grant supports the JILA Center for Atomic, Molecular and
Optical Theory. The goal is to strengthen the status of atomic, molecular and
optical theory in the US by supporting a new faculty member whose research is
devoted to atomic, molecular or optical theory, a named postdoctoral fellowship
program and a series of topical workshops on critical problems in the area of
atomic, molecular and optical physics. ***
