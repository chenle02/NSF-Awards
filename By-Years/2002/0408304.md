Consortium (LUMCON) provides support for the acquisition of new shipboard
computers, dissolved oxygen sensors and spares for the existing multi-corer
system on R/V Pelican, a research vessel operated by LUMCON as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). This acquisition
will provide important new shared-use capability for marine scientists using R/V
Pelican in their research during 2004 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
