The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to advance an innovative method of fetal
monitoring, which has the prospect of improving outcomes, reducing cost, and
promoting equitable access to quality care during childbirth. The project serves
the aligned interest of several key stake holders: patients, payers, providers
and policy makers, as it will promote the safety of both the mother and baby in
the birth process, while reducing the need for unnecessary interventions by the
care providers. The project is expected to have very broad impact as safe
childbirth is a societal health imperative that touches virtually every family,
and disproportionately impacts families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
Other broader impacts include enrichment of traineesâ€™ educational experience at
the partner research institution, and transition of underlying federally-
supported basic research into the marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will build on an innovative
technology for non-invasive, transabdominal measurement of fetal arterial blood
oxygen saturation (fSpO2). The underlying principle of operation is shining
light in the abdominal area of the pregnant mother at two specific near infrared
wavelengths, followed by sensing the small amount of diffusely-scattered light
on the maternal abdomen. The relative concentration of oxygenated and
deoxygenated hemoglobin in the pulsating fetal blood regulates light absorption
by the fetal tissue, resulting in a faint pattern in the sensed light signals.
The sensed signals are analyzed to detect such patterns, and to infer fSpO2. The
project activities include further revisions of the device prototype and
collaboration with a team of clinical researchers to demonstrate safe and
accurate transabdominal fSpO2 measurement in a pilot patient study. The project
provides the foundation and support for impacting patient care in the longer
term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
