An algebraic surface of type K3 is a 2-dimensional analog of an
elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curve. It is characterized by the property that its tangent
bundle is not&lt;br/&gt;trivial but the first Chern class is trivial. Its group
of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;automorphisms is a discrete group sometimes infinite
sometimes finite and &lt;br/&gt;its structure is closely related to the
structure of the orthogonal group &lt;br/&gt;of the the Picard group of divisor
classes equipped with the intersection &lt;br/&gt;product. The structure of the
automorphism group of a complex K3 surface &lt;br/&gt;is well understood thanks
to the availability of trascendental methods &lt;br/&gt;based on the study of
the integration of a holomorphic 2-form on the surface &lt;br/&gt;over
transcendental cycles. No such methods are available in the case when
&lt;br/&gt;the characteristic of the ground field is positive. In the proposal
the &lt;br/&gt;principal investigator outlines several new approaches to the
study of &lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups of K3 surfaces over such fields. Some of
them based &lt;br/&gt;on the study of possible automorphisms of finite order
which will allow &lt;br/&gt;to compute the character of the group in its
representation on l-adic &lt;br/&gt;cohomology. Other approaches use the
relationship between the Picard &lt;br/&gt;lattice and the 24-dimensional Leech
lattice. The principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;will also study some applications
to coding theory and cryptology related &lt;br/&gt;to K3 surfaces over a finite
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of symmetries of mathematical
structures is one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important and oldest problems in
mathematics. A symmetry group of a&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surface or an algebraic
curve is now well understood. Much less &lt;br/&gt;is known about symmetries of
higher dimensional algebraic varieties. The&lt;br/&gt;principal inverstigator
proposes such study for a class of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;surfaces known as K3
surfaces which are two-dimensional analogs of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves. The
symmetry groups of K3 surfaces are related to&lt;br/&gt;symmetry of other
objects, for example lattices in hyperbolic spaces &lt;br/&gt;and convex
polyhedra. Many known abstract infinite and finite groups &lt;br/&gt;admit a
beautiful realization as symmetry groups of K3 surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;Applications
of symmetry groups of elliptic curves over finite fields &lt;br/&gt;to coding
theory and cryptology is well known. It is expected that the
&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of symmetry groups of K3 surfaces over finite field will
find &lt;br/&gt;new applications to these
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
