The project would investigate the different cultures in social studies and
mathematics classes to create a better understanding of the mathematics used for
investigating real-world problems. The theory of transfer called "Preparation
for Future Learning" seeks to increase the attention to argumentation in social
studies class and increase focus on formal techniques in mathematics classes.
Instead of teaching students to directly transfer skills from one situation to
another, instruction is created to prepare students to learn in new settings and
contexts. The researchers seek to increase "data literacy" which is defined as
formulating questions, using appropriate representations, and developing and
evaluating inferences. The researchers will examine their question of whether or
not an approach applied to quantitative reasoning in social studies classes will
be applied in mathematics classes and thus increases the student's data
literacy. The instructional methods include a significant amount of use of
modern technology. The researchers at SRI will work with Kent State Research
center for educational technology and the Green Middle School in Ohio.
