This proposal is for ultracentrifuge facilities to support molecular and
cellular biology research programs in twelve laboratories in the School of
Biological Sciences at the University of Kentucky. Specifically the
instrumentation will support research on the molecular genetic analysis of
pyrimidine biosynthesis in animal cells, the complex cellular interactions
within vertebrate retina, regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle at the
biochemical and genetic levels, replicative and transcriptive pathways of
vesicular stomatitis virus, cellular control of messenger RNA abundance, and on
understanding the role in virus transformation of cell surface carbohydrates
containing lipids and proteins. Together with existing instruments, the requeted
equipment will provide essential support for projected faculty expansions into
the area of molecular and cellular biology.
