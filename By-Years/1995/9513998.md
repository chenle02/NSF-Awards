9513998 Zhou This grant renews support for research by a group at Boston
University. Their research is with a large international group that operates the
L3 detector at the LEP electron-positron collider at the CERN laboratory in
Geneva, Switzerland. The group's major interest is a search for evidence of
Higgs-boson production. LEP having been increased in the past year, the
accessible mass range is substantially greater than is has been. ***
