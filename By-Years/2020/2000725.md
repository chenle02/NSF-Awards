In addition to its roles in basic research, nanotechnology is also a research
and development enterprise that focuses on rapid commercialization of products
and technology. For the US to capitalize on its investments in nanotechnology,
it is essential to prepare a skilled technical workforce with the appropriate
nano-scale skill set. The Nanotechnology Applications and Career Knowledge
(NACK) Resource Center proposes to extend a nation-wide nanotechnology education
approach that includes providing resources and assistance to the nanotechnology
education infrastructure. These resources can strengthen and streamline efforts
to ensure that students develop industry-relevant knowledge, skills and
abilities. In addition, the project will maintain web courses and remote
equipment access, as well as provide faculty professional development to ensure
that faculty remain at the cutting-edge of nanotechnology advances.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NACK Resource Center will support and grow
partnerships between community and technical colleges and research universities
to: 1) share resources and disseminate learning materials; 2) deliver web-based
professional development workshops and webinar series; and 3) widely disseminate
resources using the NACK website, nanoHUB, and ATE Central. Additionally, the
Remotely Accessible Instruments for Nanotechnology (RAIN) network will continue
to support current and develop new RAIN nodes, add new online-accessible
characterization and processing tools to the network, develop ways to increase
use of the network, and collect data to evaluate RAINâ€™s impact on nanotechnology
education. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education
program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology
fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
