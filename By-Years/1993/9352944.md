9352944 Mulder The aim of this project is to develop a framework (i.e.,
definitions,,contributing disciplines, design/implementation issues, major
needs, major issues) for identifying the discipline of Information Science and
Engineering (IS & E), that is consistent with the modern need for information.
An innovative, technical framework is being developed that integrates the
following fields of study and practice: data base engineering, query languages,
telecommunications, human/computer interfaces, organizational
structure/operations, operations management, other elements of computer science,
and computer engineering. Two recurring themes embedded within this framework
are problem solving/design methods and applications, and hands-on implementation
skills.The results of this project will be useful to: 1. Professional societies
to encourage the development of specific IS & E curricular and course materials,
2. Institutions which may wish to evolve existing information science,
information systems, and related programs, 3. Industry as a vehicle by which a
continuing dialogue can be established with institutions to evolve these
recommendations, 4.Industry to prepare their organizations for the modern use of
information, 5. NSF as a catalyst to identify areas of future support. ***
