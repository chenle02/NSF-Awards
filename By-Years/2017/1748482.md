This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the
opportunity to attend a Doctoral Consortium that will enable them to share their
knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn
about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to
become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors. The
Doctoral Consortium includes a full day of activities, including poster
presentations by students, a panel on how to complete the PhD, and an
interactive session on writing an NSF-style proposal. The proposal partially
supports the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International
Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which is one of two major
international robotics conferences co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and
Automation Society. The conference, which in 2017 is held in Vancouver, Canada,
attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers,
entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.
