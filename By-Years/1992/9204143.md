The study proposes to develop a diagnostic test for the verification and
validation of the origin of warm episodes in Earth's history. An isotopic
approach will be applied to the Cenozoic record to understand the mechanisms
responsible for changes in the polar temperatures. Latitudinal oxygen-isotopic
profiles from planktonic foraminifera will provide independent tests for the
validity of changes in deep-water circulation and/or varying trace gas
concentrations as mechanisms for the climatic shifts from the warm Eocene to the
glacial-interglacial cycles of Plio-Pleistocene.
