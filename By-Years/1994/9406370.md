9406370 Zindler This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of a high-abundance-sensitivity, multicollector, thermal ionization
mass spectrometer that will be installed and operated in the National High
Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University. The Florida State
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
acquisition. The equipment will be used primarily for research in geosciences
dealing with the geochemistry of the Earth's mantle and crust. ***
