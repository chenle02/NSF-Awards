A grant has been awarded to the University of Montana under the direction of Dr.
L.&lt;br/&gt;Fishman, Dr. S. Miller, Dr. M. Minnick and Dr. R. Rosenzweig for
the purchase of instrumentation to support research in evolutionary and
molecular genetics in the Division of Biological Sciences (DBS) and the School
of Forestry at UM. This instrumentation will increase the speed, efficiency and
affordability of DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequencing, genotyping and gene expression
analysis in order to reveal the connections between genotype and phenotype, and
to understand how changes in DNA sequence and gene expression contribute to
divergent evolution. The requested instrumentation will benefit the research
programs of at least twelve faculty working in fields from Conservation Biology
to Insect Evolution and Development to Viral Evolution. The research activities
of the core users include ecological genetics of floral evolution and
development of postzygotic isolating mechanisms in flowering plants, molecular
phylogenetics of cyanobacteria, and evolutionary functional genomics of yeast.
The equipment purchases will simultaneously invigorate all research activities
at the University of Montana that utilize DNA analyses. The requested
instrumentation will also advance UM's educational goals through use in
established training and outreach programs, as well as increased opportunities
for cutting-edge student research. Enhanced molecular genetic instrumentation
will further the goal of providing research opportunities for undergraduate
students, both in individual labs and as a component of DBS's core curriculum.
The proposed equipment will also facilitate the execution of ambitious pre- and
post-doctoral research projects and will prepare young researchers to succeed in
the rapidly changing environment of biology research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
