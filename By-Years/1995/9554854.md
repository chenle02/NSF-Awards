This proposal requests funds for establishing an Internet- bsed interactive
learning system at Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).
The Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) seeks to improve its
breadth-first computer science curriculum by adequately supporting student
learning of abstract theoretical materials through interactive learning,
simulation and modeling opportunities. The goals are 1. to develop an
interactive learning system called PACER (Personally Active Computing
Exploration Resource) as an instructional supplement for the breadth-first
introductory computing courses, and 2. to cultivate and support early interest
in science through delivering PACER to K-12, college, and returning adult
students. The PACER system meets learners" needs of repetition and visual
simulation of complex ideas and offers them the ability to pursue education from
remote locations and have access to resources never before available. The
interactive design of PACER encourages self- directed learning. It also
challenges and supports women, minorities, commuting adults and students with
disabilities to purse the field of quantitative reasoning. The proposed
interactive learning system will be developed as World Wide Web pages using
Hypertext Markup Language. Unlike traditional Web pages, the PACER pages will
support interactive learning sessions as well as simulations with animation
capabilities. The hierarchical organizations of Web pages allows the PACER
system to have learning modules that are inter linked, which in turn supports
"demand-based" learning. This feature allows PACER to be an active learning tool
for learners at all levels. The proposed PACER system will be available to
students in our breadth-first introductory compute science courses, Computing 1
and 2, and students at New Augusta Middle School in the Metropolitan district of
Pike Township, Indianapolis, Indiana
