This research focuses on the theoretical study of rasterization theory and the
prototyping of the developed rasterized structure. A real-time rasterized
structure is being developed. In this new architecture, the desired computations
are performed in the time interval between the arrivals of two neighboring
pixels without extensive buffering and reformatting of the data. This is
achieved by transforming a multidimensional computation into a one dimensional
one and by processing the transformed data. A rasterization theory is being
developed which provides a mathematical basis for translating many
multidimensional computations, constrained to utilizing scan-line data in real
time, into their equivalent one-dimensional computation. Many computations
require global data communication as well as the real-time evaluation of large
quantities of data. Computational architectures are often constrained by the
format in which the input data is available, namely, raster-scan format.
However, the operations to be performed are often global in nature. This
input/output format constraint would hinder full utilization of parallelism
without extensive buffering and reformatting of input/output data. This research
develops the necessary computational model, which makes possible the design of a
balanced structure of computations and inputs/outputs.
