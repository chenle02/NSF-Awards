The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Science Education will identify
an expert study committee to develop a report identifying the criteria for
successful out-of-school STEM learning based on evidence from successful
practice. The committee will be informed by commissioned papers and by a 2-day
public workshop that explores the current evidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
report will be written for policy-makers, funders, non-profit and private
industry representatives, and other representatives from civic society. The
primary goal of the report will be to help these audiences better understand and
more strategically support investments in out-of-school STEM education, and to
encourage partnerships that promote the linking of out-of-school STEM learning
to school-based learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study complements the NRC
work done to produce the Successful K-12 STEM Education report and builds from
prior NRC studies, especially Learning Science in Informal Environments,
Surrounded by Science and Education for Work and Life: Developing Transferable
Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century.
