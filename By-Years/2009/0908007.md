The first goal of this project is to better understand physical vacuum as a free
boundary for solutions to compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with or
without forcing and to develop a satisfactory nonlinear stability theory. The
physical vacuum naturally appears in astrophysics and gas dynamics: a
mathematical study of its behavior will help understand dynamics of gaseous
stars. Furthermore, this investigation will lead to a general theory of
degenerate hyperbolic equations. The second goal is to derive, with rigorous
justification, various fluid equations from Boltzmann equations. Study of
hydrodynamic limits for Boltzmann equations is important in connecting the two
different subjects of kinetic theory and fluid dynamics. A rigorous study will
help understand how large-scale behaviors emerge from dynamics or structures on
small scales. In particular, for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system, it will
open a new line of research.

The compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes fluid equations and the Boltzmann
kinetic equations are the basic, challenging models in gas dynamics; they have
broad applications in many other areas of science and engineering as well. For
example, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are useful to study shallow water
waves, and Boltzmann equations are important for semiconductor theory. The
mathematical problems addressed in this project are not only important for the
study of these equations, but also of interest in physics and other sciences. A
better understanding of them would prompt the study of models for more complex,
realistic flows.
