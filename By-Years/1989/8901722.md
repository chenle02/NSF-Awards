Professor Nelson's research group is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program in various studies of elementary condensed phase photochemical
processes time-resolved on a femtosecond time scale. Phase-coherent molecular
motion along reactive potential energy surfaces is being used to initiate,
manipulate, and observe in real time the detailed evolution of photochemical
processes occurring in condensed phases. The goals are to elucidate the reactive
potential energy surfaces along which photochemical change occurs and to
characterize the effects of the condensed phase upon both the potential surfaces
and the resulting dynamics. Two classes of experiments are distinguished by the
excitation mechanism. In the first class, optical absorption of femtosecond
pulses initiates phase-coherent molecular motion (coherent wavepacket
propagation) on excited potential surfaces. Time-resolved absorption of
subsequent visible and infrared pulses and time-resolved fluorescence are used
to monitor the subsequent dynamics and extract information about the excited-
state surface. The second class of experiments involves the use of impulsive
stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) to excite molecular vibrational motion on a
ground electronic state surface. Multi-pulsing techniques are being developed to
increase significantly the amplitudes possible with the ISRS technique. The
coherent vibrational motion might then be used either to initiate a
vibrationally-driven chemical reaction or to enhance or modify a subsequent
photochemical process.
