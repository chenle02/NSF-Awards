Mutations are one of the mechanisms by which bacteria evolve new physiological
and metabolic capabilities. It is presumed that mutations occur randomly in
dividing cells without regard to their utility. They occur predominately by
mistakes during DNA replication or repair. Recent evidence from extended
nonlethal selections suggests that under certain conditions the selection itself
can influence the rate or nature of the mutational events. This referred to as
adaptive mutagenesis. It appears to occur only during periods when cell growth
is limited by some nutritional scarcity, which is a common and recurrent
environmental condition for bacteria in the natural world. Currently, we know
very little about how bacteria genetically and physiologically respond to
natural environmental conditions such as nutritional scarcity. We are using a
combination of microbiological, biochemical and genetic approaches to determine
if mutation rates increase during extended nonlethal selections and if the
mutational events show preference for specific regions of the genome. %%% The
information obtained from this project will allow us to decide if adaptive
mutagenesis is a general physiological response in Escherichia coli bacteria and
will extend our knowledge of bacterial physiology in cells that are in a non-
growing but metabolically active state.
