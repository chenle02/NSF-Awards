This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Gene
regulatory networks in the halophillic archaeon Halobacterium." This project
begins the ambitious goal of deciphering the entire gene regulatory network in
Halobacterium by conducting a three-tiered analysis of transcriptional regulator
Bat and its influence on the interconnected light and oxygen dependent metabolic
processes. This system-level inquiry offers training in genome/proteome-level
science and assists in developing an understanding of the complex gene
regulatory mechanisms that control the response of microbial physiology to
external stimuli. &lt;br/&gt;
