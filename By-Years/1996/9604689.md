This proposal is for funds to upgrade an existing 2-channel 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer to a 4 channel spectrometer with triple-axis gradients, high-order
shims, shaped pulses and new probes, within the Center for NMR Spectroscopy at
Washington State University. The WSU NMR Center is a central University
facility, currently with three NMR spectrometers, newly remodeled space for 5
spectrometers, and a Ph.D.-level Facility Manager. The Center services 13
Departments in 4 Colleges at WSU, with a typical annual usage by some 100
students, postdocs and faculty. The research described here build on existing
strengths at WSU, and in particular within the Departments of
Biochemistry/Biophysics and of Chemistry, and represents a major initiative to
establish the area of structural biology at WSU. The projects in this proposal,
the majority of which are funded by NSF, include the use of high resolution
liquids NMR to the study of enzymatic reaction mechanisms; the application of
standard triple resonance 3D and 4D NMR to the structure determination of a
protein-DNA complex, a complex of a partially unfolded protein with a chaperone,
and a protein-RNA complex; the application of paramagnetic relaxation effect
studies to characterize a ligand-enzyme complex; and the application of
gradient-induced diffusion-filtered triple resonance NMR to locate bound water
molecules in a model iron-sulfur protein, and use of 2D selective excitation
experiments to characterize synthetic natural product diastereomers.
