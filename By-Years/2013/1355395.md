To improve our understanding of the state of computing education and to grow the
field, the Partnership for Advancing Computing Education (PACE) proposes to
organize an interdisciplinary planning workshop on computing education research.
PACE, a coalition of the ACM, the Association of Information Systems, IEEE-
Computer Society, Computer Science Teachers Association, the Computing Research
Association, and the National Center for Women & IT, is dedicated to improving
the preparation of the computing workforce. Through discussion among leading
computing and education researchers, we propose to achieve the following goals:
(i) to develop a shared understanding of the state of computing education
research across subdisciplines of computing, identifying gaps and overlaps; (ii)
to identify present strengths and future opportunities for research on computing
education; (iii) to assess the viability of building mechanisms for improved
infrastructure, such as a research coordination network, and (iv) to encourage
knowledge sharing across the fragmented domains of study.
