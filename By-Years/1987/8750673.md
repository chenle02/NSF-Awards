The Life Sciences Department is requiring an independent research project as a
component of its curriculum for majors. This Senior-year project is involving
students in research with a particular focus upon Molecular Biology. Powerful
motivators, the projects provide students an environment for developing modern
laboratory skills and techniques while pursuing a currently important biological
question. As a result, these undergraduates better comprehend the essence of
science while at the same time they gain better preparation for entering careers
based on scientific processes. Participants are being encouraged to communicate
the results of their research to their peers and to other scientists through
publication and/or oral presentation of their work. The new equipment provided
through this grant is being used for basic work in Molecular Biology, including
the purification and experimental manipulation of nucleic acids. The simplicity
of many of the techniques employed in Molecular Biology makes it feasible for
undergraduates to accomplish significant work if properly motivated and
supervised.
