Joyce 9529607 Top to bottom hydrographic and current measurements will be
carried out along two meridional lines at 66 W and 52 W in the North Atlantic as
part of the "Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment" (ACCE) of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic prgoram. The main objectives of
the work are to obtain a quantitative description of the North Atlantic
circulation and water mass distribution, and compare this state to similar
basin-wide descriptions from two previous era: the International Geophysical
Year (IGY) period of the late 1950s' and the early 1980s'. The overall goal is
to characterize these snapshots in terms of climate variability, with the hope
of furthering our understanding of the time scales and mechanisms of the coupled
ocean-atmosphere system.
