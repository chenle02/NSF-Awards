In order to determine the mechanisms for rapid ice stream flow, this project
will drill several boreholes to the base of Jakobshavns Glacier, Greenland.
Borehole measurements of internal deformation, basal water pressure, ice
temperature and electrical conductivity at the bed will be combined with short-
period measurements of the surface velocity to provide a firm basis for
establishing the mechanisms which govern the flow of this fast moving ice
stream. Ice core sampling at selected depths within the borehole and sampling of
the glacier bed will be undertaken to determine the physical properties and
structure of the ice and any existing subglacial material and the role which
these properties play in determining the rapid flow of the ice stream. Water
transport at the glacier bed will be investigated by following the flow and
dispersion of borehole salt injections using electrical conductivity methods.
This project is a fully collaborative effort with ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.
