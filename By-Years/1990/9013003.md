The purpose of this travel award is to support a visit at the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks by Dr. Yevgeniy Mishin, Head of the Ionospheric Laboratory of
the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Propagation
(IZMIRAN), to explore the possibility of developing proposals for long- term
cooperation in studies of the magnetospheric cusp. This is a targeted topic
under the general category of Arctic Research under the Memorandum of
Understanding between NSF and the Soviet Academy of Sciences for basic research
cooperation. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R.
to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
