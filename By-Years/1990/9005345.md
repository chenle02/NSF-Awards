Rhythmic biological phenomena which occur at approximately 24 h intervals in the
absence of environmental time cues are termed circadian rhythms. Two basic
questions about circadian rhythms concern the mechanisms by which: 1) time
information is used to regulate biological phenomena observed to be rhythmic,
and 2) time is measured. To address the former, genes have been identified whose
expression is regulated in a circadian fashion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elements
will be characterized that are required, in cis or in trans, for this circadian
regulation using gene fusion, gel retardation and DNA protection strategies. The
mechanism of time measurement will be addressed through the identification and
characterization of mutations which disrupt biological timekeeping. The
circadian rhythm in nitrate reductase will be explored to see if the protein
expression and mRNA levels correspond. If they do correspond, nitrate reductase
levels will be measured in an attempt to screen for circadian regulation
mutations. Fusion genes, in which clock control is conferred on a reporter gene
will be used as molecular tags on the biological clock in screens designed to
identify mutations which affect clock function. The circadian rhythm in stomatal
apertures will be used to select mutants in which circadian regulation is
altered. Characterization of these mutations will identify elements either of
the clock itself or of the regulatory system by which time control is exerted.
