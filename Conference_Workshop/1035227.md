This NSF award will provide partial financial support for the Twentieth
International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods, to be held at the San
Diego Supercomputer Center on the campus of the University of California at San
Diego, in February 2011. Domain decomposition, in some form, is by far the most
common paradigm for large-scale simulation on massively parallel distributed,
hierarchical memory computers. This paradigm permeates almost all arenas of
simulation, from such practical concerns as numerical climate modeling, modeling
of complex biological molecules and biological processes, the design and testing
of automobiles, aircraft and other structures, and the modeling of complex
porous media flows, to more abstract scientific endeavors such as modeling black
holes and searching for the origins of the universe. However, many users of
domain decomposition do not avail themselves of the most sophisticated and
efficient methods known. This has become more pronounced as the size of the
large-scale scientific simulation community has grown with the availability of
hardware in the past few years, particularly inside scientific communities
without traditionally strong ties to the computational mathematics or computer
science communities.

The goal of this conference is to promote advances in domain decomposition
methods by encouraging interdisciplinary technical interchange throughout the
international computational science and engineering communities, and by taking
advantage of conference siting, to attract to this important area many new U.S.
scientists. It is strongly aligned with NSF's, and more generally, our national
priorities to promote and advance fundamental interdisciplinary research in
Computational Science and Engineering. NSF funding will make possible financial
support for graduate students, post-docs, and other young researchers who
otherwise might not be able to attend. The funding will also allow for
increasing participation of women, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans
from across the nation as well as from the diverse Southern California
scientific community.
