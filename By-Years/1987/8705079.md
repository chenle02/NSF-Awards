Researchers at SUNY (Stony Brook) request an eight processor, shared- memory
system plus cameras, digitizers, and monitors for acquiring and displaying video
images. This equipment will be used primarily in experiments to develop working
vision systems. The main project is developing an automatic system to isolate
faces from digitized visual scenes, to extract their key size- and orientation-
invariant features, and to recognize them using a database of known faces. It
emphasizes highly parallel algorithms, using low- level vision processing
operators present in human visual systems. This work is producing efficient
parallel algorithms for symmetry axis location and other critical vision
operations. One result will be methods allowing real-time, automatic face
recognition and tracking from video images using small arrays of processors
running in parallel. Other projects will use this multiprocessor equipment: (1)
to implement a real-time active-vision robot navigation system based on a
binocular camera system controlled by a highly parallel algorithm, (2) to create
a family of advanced environments with graphical user interfaces that support
specification and design of concurrent systems, (3) to investigate the design
and implementation of parallel algorithms for computer-aided design (CAD) tools
for VLSI circuits and, (4) to experiment with methods of sharing memory and
controlling global resources in large networks of computers.
