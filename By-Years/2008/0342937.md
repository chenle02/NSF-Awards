With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University in California in
Irvine will acquire a 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
studies in a number of areas, including a) development of new methods for
chemical synthesis of complex molecules of biomedical importance; b) chemical
models of protein structures and interaction; c) structure determination and
synthesis of natural products; d) synthetic organic chemistry, new
polymerization catalysts, and organosiliconate chemistry; e) formation of
ditryptophan and dityrosine crosslinks and their influence on local secondary
structure in short peptides; and f) redox chemistry inside large bio-molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
