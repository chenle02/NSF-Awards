This award will support the participation of 12 undergraduate students each
year in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by the
Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL) of the University of Georgia. This
program, which encompasses 12 weeks each summer, allows the students to gain
research experience, training and career perspective through the use of the
unique field sites and laboratory facilities as well as through association with
full-time research ecologists. Project participants will examine the influence
of by-products from nuclear and fossil fuel energy production on selected
biological and chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems. SREL faculty
members, all actively engaged in research and publication, will be paired with
students having compatible research interests. Student projects, while distinct
and independent, are portions of on-going research programs of SREL. The student
experience is enhanced by interaction with a programmatic team comprised of
individuals with a diversity of ecological backgrounds, interests, and ideas.
Applicants from minority schools and regional institutions with limited research
programs will continue to be actively sought and encouraged, as in previous
years. Participant selection is based upon the quality of an application,
letters of recommendation, and academic record. Through the research training of
more than 500 undergraduate participants over the past 27 years, SREL has
created a highly successful program of student/advisor interaction. Scientific
publication and career development of former participants attest to the success
of the program. This award will foster the continued education and training of
individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic researchers in
ecology and help to produce citizens informed about various aspects of
environmental sciences, management, and decision making in environmental issues.
