New concepts will be developed for sensing and control of noise and vibration in
structures. Sensing of individual strain components in a plane requires three
independent measurements, typically using a strain Rosette. The concept of the
strain Rosette to piezoelectric materials that can be used for both directional
sensing and directional actuation will be extended. This will be accomplished
through designed anisotropy, an approach in which a combination of the physical
structure, the crystallographic orientation, and the domain structure of the
sensor/actuator element are concurrently designed to obtain desired couplings to
the host structure. Research will involve feedback and control, optimal
sensor/actuator location and spatial distribution, as well as exploration of
feedback techniques based on negative capacitance amplifiers. New design and
analysis tools will be developed for these sensor/actuator components. Student
involvement will include undergraduate (UG) research helpers, MS students, and
PhD students. An international component will bring in multicultural
interactions and experience. Research results will be carried through to the
classroom and UG instructional laboratories. Results will be broadly
disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and
collaborations with other research groups.
