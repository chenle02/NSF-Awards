ISI-9215117 Bio-Metric Systems,Inc. Melvin J. Swanson ABSTRACT The main focus of
this SBIR project is the development of microporous polysulfone membranes which
will incorporate hydrophilic polymers with photoactivatable moieties to serve as
anchoring sites for antibodies. It is expected that the polymeric coupling agent
will increase the binding activity of the antibody while having very low
nonspecific binding itself. Effective separation of target contaminant species
will be demonstrated. Purification of genetically engineering proteins and of
bioproducts formed by other means is often the greatest challenge and expense
for marketing. The method described is generic and potentially very powerful so
that other biotechnology ventures might benefit from this SBIR project.
