The sale and use of illegal drugs contributes to a wide range of societal
problems, including crime and violence. Recognizing the scope of the problem,
law enforcement officials have devoted substantial resources to interdiction,
investigation, and prosecution. Scientific measurements of the effects of these
efforts have fallen short. This project draws on recent advances in economics to
develop and analyze a new model buyer and seller behavior in this market. This
model builds upon empirical regularities that characterize interactions between
drug buyers and sellers and then uses game theory to generate predictions. These
hypotheses are empirically tested with data available from the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The findings from this project are expected to inform government
officials on the effectiveness of law enforcement initiatives designed to reduce
the supply and demand for illegal drugs.
