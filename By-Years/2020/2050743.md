This REU Site award to The University of Tennessee, located in Knoxville, TN and
will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of
2021- 2023. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from
schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group,
will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted,
and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.
Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students
will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths, and
be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program focuses on microbiology and the
interplay between the microbial community structure and microbial community
function. Housed in the Department of Microbiology, the site has more than 20
faculty who will serve as mentors. These faculty also have affiliations with
Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences, Biosystems Engineering &amp; Soil Sciences,
Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering and Earth &amp; Planetary Science. There
is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the students that
span microbiology in environments spanning oceans and lakes, caves and polar
regions, industrial and agricultural sites. Applications for this program can be
submitted through the program website (https://microreu.utk.edu/). Students will
be selected by a committee of faculty. More information about the program is
available by visiting https://microreu.utk.edu/, by contacting the program
director (Tennessee.microbiology.REU@gmail.com) or by contacting the PI
(Professor Steven Wilhelm, wilhelm@utk.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Gary LeCleir,
glecleir@utk.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
