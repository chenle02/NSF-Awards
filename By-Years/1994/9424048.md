This grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a
133 foot vessel, which is owned by the NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware, a transmissometer,
temperature sensors, a thermosalinograph, Niskin bottles, a flow-through
fluorometer, a pure water source, and an altimeter. The requested
instrumentation is necessary to support NSF funded cruises in 1995 and will
enhance the scientific capabilities of the vessel in the future. ??
