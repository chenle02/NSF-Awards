The conference "Vertex operator algebras, number theory, and related topics"
will be held at California State University, Sacramento from June 11-15th, 2018.
The conference is designed to bring together a diverse international pool of
researchers with expertise in algebra, number theory, and conformal field theory
in theoretical physics to discuss a variety of topics related to the
intersection of these fields. In particular, a wide range of junior and senior
researchers from varying institutions will disseminate recent work, discuss the
current state of intersection among their fields, exchange ideas on common
problems, and form new collaborations. The conference will focus on two main
objectives. First, the dissemination of recent and developing research trends
within the focused research areas of number theory, vertex operator algebras
(VOAs), and their intersection will help advance the mathematical sciences,
allow researchers to stay up to date with developments in the field, and allow
participants to form new connections among different research areas. Second, the
conference aims to help train and develop young and diverse scientists in the
mathematical and physical sciences, while introducing them to new ideas and the
international community. Presentations by senior scientists will aid in this
process.

The conference will include forty research presentations covering a range of
topics related to the intersection of vertex operator algebras, number theory,
and conformal field theory. This will include topics such as group theory, Lie
algebras, modular and other automorphic forms, quantum groups, representation
theory, tensor category theory, and theoretical physics, as well as applications
and intersections of these areas. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of these
mathematical fields, and their intersection with theoretical physics, this
conference serves as a timely and important opportunity for the research
community to share and disseminate knowledge in order to advance new research
developments. An important theme that will be highlighted is the interplay
between the theory of VOAs and automorphic forms. The presentations will be
chronicled on the conference website. The conference webpage is
