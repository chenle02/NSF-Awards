The University of Wyoming will implement a new teacher preparation program for
prospective elementary teachers in the state. A major feature of this project
will be the development of three new sequential, five-hour, introductory science
courses that will be required for elementary education majors and appropriate
for other nonscience majors. These courses will be developed by teams of
scientists from the biology, chemistry, physics, and geology departments around
integrating themes. Many of the accompanying laboratory experiments in each
course will use a learning cycle approach. Other features of the new program are
seminars for the preservice elementary teachers on teaching methodology that
will focus on cooperative learning and the learning cycle approach, and early
and continuous field experiences. By scheduling the field experiences and
seminars concurrently with the science courses, prospective teachers will be
given the opportunity to adapt the science presented in the introductory science
courses to the teaching of science in the elementary schools. The project also
includes workshops for preparing mentor teachers who will use both cooperative
learning and the learning cycle approach in their elementary school classrooms,
and who will be observed by the prospective teachers during their early field
experiences. The University of Wyoming will participate in sharing 13.5% of the
cost of the project.
