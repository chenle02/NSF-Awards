The Virginia Teach project is providing scholarships to a cumulative total of 23
mathematics majors who commit to teaching middle school or high school. Scholars
complete a BS in Mathematics, a Masters in Education degree, and Virginia
teacher certification requirements, in order to become highly qualified teachers
in high-need schools. Project goals concern the recruitment, preparation,
support, and retention of Noyce scholars as they progress through Virginia
Tech's mathematics education program and into professional teaching. The project
is a collaboration between Department of Mathematics faculty and School of
Education faculty. Project activities include inreach to students already
enrolled at Virginia Tech and outreach to local schools. For example, the
project introduces internships for STEM sophomores to spend spring break
investigating teaching by working in a Montgomery County, VA school. Noyce
interns, scholars, mentors, and personnel form a community of support through
participation in classrooms, conferences, colloquia, meetings, and a listserv.
In addition to adding 23 talented mathematics teachers to schools in need,
Virginia Teach is strengthening Virginia Tech's secondary mathematics
certification program. The university's program relies on partnership with local
schools and mentor teachers, and the project strengthens that partnership by
increasing teacher involvement in the program while increasing university
students' involvement in the schools. Data gathered in monitoring the progress
of Noyce scholars informs decisions on altering course requirements, course
revisions, and the design of field experiences, at Virginia Tech and elsewhere.
Data also generates research on effective recruiting and retention practices,
especially concerning teacher candidates from groups that are underrepresented
in mathematics classrooms.
