The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project encompasses the
area of personalized medicine and forensics. It will have an impact on medicine
by leading to new diagnostic applications. The technology being developed here
facilitates accurate determination of the mitochondrial genome. Degeneration of
mitochondrial function has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
disease and several other neurological disorders. In forensics, the technology
could allow for identification of individuals based on mitochondrial variants
derived from hair samples. Pharmaceutical R&D could use the technique to study
the effects of their drugs to measure mitochondrial toxicity.

This I-Corps project further develops a novel method that enzymatically purifies
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by depleting linear nuclear DNA, enabling inexpensive
sequencing of mtDNA. A major benefit of this method is the ability to identify
heteroplasmy, which is the existence of different mitochondrial genomes in the
same individual. Every person has some level of heteroplasmy, and measuring this
accurately is the key to identifying risk of diseases.
