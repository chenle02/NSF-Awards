ABSTRACT CMS9523141 PI: Kaliakin, et al., University of Delaware The problem of
time-dependent response of geosynthetically reinforced soil structures requires
study from the standpoint of fundamental mechanics, and attention is needed on
current design procedures and for future applications. Standing in the way of a
thorough understanding of the time-dependent behavior are the lack of stress
relaxation experimental data, and the lack of a robust constitutive model for
the reinforcement that will account for both creep and stress relaxation in a
rational manner. The major objectives of the research are: 1) to experimentally
study stress relaxation of selected geosynthetic reinforcement, 2) to develop a
simple constitutive model to realistically simulate the time dependent behavior
of the reinforcement, 3) to implement this model into an existing FE computer
code, and to verify the predictive capabilities of the model, and 4) to conduct
an extensive numerical parametric study of geosynthetically reinforced walls at
working stress conditions. The results will facilitate the understanding of time
dependent behavior of geosynthetic reinforcement interactive with backfill soil
and will make the design of such structures more rational.
