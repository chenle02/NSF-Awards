There is an important need for compact, lightweight, efficient laser systems
that are tunable. In order for these laser systems to achieve the beam quality
and the small size and weight required, they must be solid state systems. The
most efficient source for pumping these systems is the diode laser where 50%
efficiencies are possible. In-5+ order to efficiently couple the pump light into
the laser and to efficiently extract any heat generated, a fiber laser would be
the most attractive. LaserGenics Corp. has the exclusive license to the patents
held by Stanford University on the laser-heated pedestal- growth technique that
we will apply to the growth of single crystal fibers of titanium doped A1203,
YA103, and MgA1204. These materials are very attractive as tunable laser
sources. During the course of our proposed program we will study the effects of
composition, temperature, atmosphere, and pull-rate on the growth. We will also
study annealing procedures on these fibers to reduce the titanium to the +3
valence state. During the Phase II effort we will further optimize the growth of
these fibers and construct a tunable fiber laser breadboard based on the single
crystal fibers we have grown.
