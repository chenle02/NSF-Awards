Narrative understanding requires the use of large amounts of generic knowledge
about word meanings, the world, and narrative structure. Such knowledge is
typically unreliable ("defeasible"), and raises difficult representational
problems. The aim of this research is to develop a direct, natural, formally
interpretable representation for this kind of knowledge, taking English
formulations of the knowledge as an initial representation, and translating
systematically (ultimately, automatically) into the formal representation.
Certain classes of English generic sentences can already be mapped directly into
the logic, but the research will greatly expand these classes, allowing
virtually any generalization expressible in English to be directly formalized.
The result will be not only theoretical insights into the nature of unreliable
general knowledge, but also further development of an extensible narrative
understanding system, whose general knowledge base can be expanded through
English input.
