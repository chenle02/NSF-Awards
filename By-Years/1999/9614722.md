9614722 McClelland Recent studies have significantly changed traditional views
of the late Proterozoic- early paleozoic paleogeographic reconstructions for
Laurentia and Gondwana. Essentially two models are current: eastern North
America and western South America were in proximity due to actual collision
between Laurentia and Gondwana, or only a rifted portion of North American
collided with South America, with a large ocean remaining between the
continental masses. This research will test these options by study of a belt of
ultramafic and mafic rocks along the west side of the Precordillera which
represents the postulated Laurentia- Precordillera ocean. In particular, age
dating will address both crystallization and metamorphic ages of these rocks,
which differ in each scenario. Results are expected to clarify models for
Paleozoic tectonics in southwestern South American by providing information
about the ocean basin to the west of the Precordillera terrane and provide the
basis for a test between the collisional model and the rifted and drifted
terrane model.
