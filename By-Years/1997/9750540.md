Since plastics account for approximately 20 percent of the landfill volume,
recycling plastics plays a significant role in reducing solid waste flow.
Students must be educated in the methods of recycling plastics and better
controlling the properties of products made from recycled materials. This
project is enhancing materials recycling experiments by adding study of the
microstructural change in plastics due to recycling. These experiments are done
using a scanning electron microscope. These experiments include collecting and
cleaning postconsumer containers, grinding, extrusion compounding and
pelletizing, dry injection molding, and analyzing the structure of recycled
plastics. With the implementation of this project, students are able to better
understand the change in polymeric structure caused by recycling, and to control
the properties of the recycled materials using the structure property
relationship. Students in the technology majors and non-science-majors are
gaining fundamental understanding and practical experience through this series
of experiments. They are gaining knowledgeable insight into reducing, reusing,
and recycling plastics. *
