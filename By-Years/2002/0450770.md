Artificial Intelligence research has made limited progress towards computational
understanding of human reasoning: we have failed to emphasize the creation of
programs with "resourcefulness" in the face of unfamiliar problems. In computing
theory and applications the emphasis has largely been on specific algorithms and
mathematical techniques; complex systems have rarely yielded reproducible
results or fundamental insights into a theory of system construction.
Resourceful programs will require the application of multiple reasoning
techniques, a layered architecture for coordinating activity whereby higher-
order, reflective processes can diagnose failures in lower-order, deliberative
processes.

Scenarios requiring "commonsense reasoning" provide an anvil of sufficient scope
that only highly-resourceful programs will meet the requirements. Two projects
support these aims: Roboverse establishes a virtual world where humanoid
characters engage in complex, multi-realm scenarios, applying common sense to
physical, social and mental activities; Panalogy is a specification for
interconnect among multiple representations, combining diverse reasoning
techniques such as analogy, case-based reasoning, statistical analysis and
logical inference. An early version of Panalogy instantiates a set of meta-
management components, demonstrating different ways to coordinate and repair
baseline reasoning processes.

These resources enable wider research-community involvement by providing
motivating demonstrations of new theoretical principles and evaluation tools and
methodologies for experimental reproduction and comparison. We aim, through
workshops, publications and direct engagement to encourage broader support from
corporate and governmental sources. This increased effort in resourceful
computing research leads the way towards programs that engage readily with
humans in the search for solutions to complex problems of importance to science
and society.
