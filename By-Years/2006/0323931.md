The working hypotheses of this research are that E. coli contains two putrescine
catabo-lism pathways, and that both modulate intracellular polyamines, albeit
during different growth conditions. The first pathway has been previously
described, and involves two transaminase-dependent deaminations, and two
dehydrogenase-dependent oxidations. The second pathway has not been previously
described, and appears to involve glutamylated intermediates. To test these
hypotheses, mutants lacking each of the proposed genes of putrescine catabolism
will be con-structed, and the resulting phenotypes examined. Enzymes of the
proposed pathways will be pu-rified and characterized. The functions of the two
pathways will be tested by examination of the expression of putrescine catabolic
genes, and assay of the activities of the gene products in wild type strains and
in strains lacking specific regulators. Finally, intracellular polyamines will
be extracted, separated, and quantified in order to test whether the proposed
intermediates accumu-late in specific mutants, and whether these pathways
modulate intracellular polyamines.&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide insight
into a fundamental, but poorly understood, aspect of me-tabolism, and into the
growth and metabolism of bacteria. Polyamines, such as putrescine and
spermidine, are required for the rapid growth of essentially all organisms. The
role of degrada-tive enzymes in the control of polyamine levels has not been
examined because the degradative pathways have not been determined. This study
will elucidate a degradative pathway that has not been described in any
organism, and will determine the extent that the degradative pathways control
polymaine levels. Undergraduates constructed a majority of the mutants that
provided the unpublished background for this project. They will continue to be
an integral part of the discov-ery process.&lt;br/&gt;
