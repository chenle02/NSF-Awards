This research focuses on a new, sensitive search for a possible violation of the
Bose-Einstein statistics for photons, which uses the methods of laser
spectroscopy. The approach is based on a selection rule for two-photon
transitions following from the assumption that photons are bosons: such
transitions are strictly forbidden for degenerate photons (i.e. photons of the
same energy) between states of total angular momentum zero and one. The broader
impacts involve the education of both undergraduate and graduate students as
well as international collaboration and on-line tutorials.
