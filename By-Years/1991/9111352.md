The primary goals of the large-scale research project are thus: 1) to obtain an
unequivocal age of dolomitization; and 2) to critically evaluate the source of
dolomitizing fluid(s) and the hydrologic driving mechanism(s) in order to
develop a well constrained framework in which to interpret the present
geochemical data base. The objectives of this planning grant are twofold and
reflect the need to address the feasibility of the large-scale goals prior to
continuing with the project. The first objective of the preliminary research
addresses if and exactly how Knox dolomites are related to other diagenetic
minerals that yield radiometric and isotopic ages. The feasibility of tieing in
these minerals with he established paragenesis of Knox dolomites in
unmineralized areas will be tested. The second goal of the planning grant is to
determine the feasibility of using radiogenic isotopes for direct age
determination of minerals closely associated with the Knox burial dolomites.
