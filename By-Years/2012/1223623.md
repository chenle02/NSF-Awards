One of the cornerstones of modern cryptography is that new constructions of
cryptographic protocols should be accompanied by a proof of security. Such
proofs show that a construction satisfies a given definition of security, under
certain assumptions and in a specific model. Widely used models include various
forms of setup (such as the existence of a public-key infrastructure or common
reference string); idealized models such as the random oracle model where a hash
function is treated as a truly random function; or hardware models where
physical devices with some additional functionality are
assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the models used widely in cryptography are
still poorly understood, especially insofar as their relation to practice. The
goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of these models,
investigating in particular their relations and implications; the possibility of
constructing cryptographic protocols in weaker (or at least incomparable)
models; and the feasibility of designing schemes with "fallback" security that
provide more basic security guarantees in case the assumed model fails.
