Biotechnology and genetic engineering have become major social issues in
the&lt;br/&gt;United States and around the world. In 1998, Durant, Bauer, and
Gaskell&lt;br/&gt;published Biotechnology in the Public Sphere, which contained
profiles of&lt;br/&gt;twelve European nations in terms of public perceptions,
policy decisions,&lt;br/&gt;and media discourse. At that time, a collaboration
with researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. was developed, leading to another book to
be released in the Fall 2001,&lt;br/&gt;which contains surveys conducted in 17
European nations, Canada, and the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Another round of surveys to
measure public perceptions is scheduled&lt;br/&gt;to take place in late 2001 or
early 2002. These surveys will help to understand from &lt;br/&gt;a longitudinal
perspective how the public is changing (ornot changing) their &lt;br/&gt;views
towards such things as genetically modified crops,medical biotechnology,
&lt;br/&gt;and food containing genetically engineered products. This project
will support a&lt;br/&gt;national telephone survey within the U.S. and will be
coordinated with the &lt;br/&gt;comparable survey in Europe. This survey will
also support analysis and publications&lt;br/&gt;aimed at not only gaining an
insight into the issue of biotechnology, but also social &lt;br/&gt;change and
the social construction of social problems.
