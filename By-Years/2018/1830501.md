Information warfare and the purposeful spread of disinformation threatens to
destabilize democratic processes by polarizing the population and depleting
social capital. Information diffusion on social media is an important means by
which polarization increases and spreads through society. In this project, the
investigators will address the following fundamental question: How do we
measure, predict and mitigate the insidious threats resulting from extreme
polarization due to information diffusion on social
media?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will build real-time algorithmic
threat forecasting based on information diffusion patterns using topic flow
modeling, primarily, of Twitter data. The investigators will extend the popular
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to include spatio-temporal diffusion
terms. The investigators will use this to build a 'polarization barometer' based
on sentiment analysis of the data. The investigators will implement Bayesian
inferential algorithms capturing essential features of the spatio-temporal
information flows and link these quantitative results to the sociological
concept of social capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
