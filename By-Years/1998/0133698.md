The experience of providing or receiving medical care has a very personal
dimension. Quoted from the Hippocratic oath: "Whatsoever I shall see or hear in
the course of my dealings with men, if it be what should not be published
abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets". The 1996
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) required the
Administration to issue regulations protecting the privacy of health
information. Such a regulation gives consumers the right to see, copy, and
correct their own health information and the right of being notified as to how
their health information is going to be used and shared. It also imposes new
restrictions on those who hold health information. However, legal protection
alone is not enough as it can only be applied after the problem has occurred,
when the damage has already been done. Moreover, law enforcement is usually
expensive, slow, and complex. The goal of this project is to design a
comprehensive technical infrastructure that guarantees the enforcement of health
information privacy protection. The problem of data protection and privacy is
addressed on a technical level, thus preventing any violation of a privacy
policy in advance rather than correcting it after it has occurred. The intend of
the project is to demonstrate that health information privacy solutions can be
designed to achieve meaningful benefits without penalizing society with undue
financial burdens or worse, with the compromise of public safety.
