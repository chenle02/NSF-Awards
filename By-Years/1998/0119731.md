This proposal is to build the institutional capactiy and partnerships needed to
develop a full center for teaching and learning at West Virginia University. A
full center as it is envisioned will focus on issues of importance for teaching
science and mathematics in rural settings. These issues include aspects of
geography, the importance of indigenous knowledge, infrastructure needs and
limited financial resources. The center will also focus on ways to integrate and
coordinate the various sciences, mathematics and technology content areas at the
middle and high school levels, both within and across subject areas. During this
developmental project a study group will be formed to assess the needs at each
of eight regional math and science consortia (RMSCs) and another set of study
groups will be formed to study issues of concern to the project. These include
research on learning and teaching in rural settings, characterizing indigenous
knowledge, ways to provide learning support to students with special needs,
legislative and industrial support, barriers to implementation, professional
development programs and interdisciplinary math and science content.
