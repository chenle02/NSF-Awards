Large web search engines now receive billions of search requests per day that
are evaluated over hundreds of billions of documents, leading to significant
advertising revenue for the engines and many benefits for the overall economy.
To process these queries with sub-second latencies, search engines deploy
millions of computing cores housed in multiple large and geographically
distributed data centers. This project will propose and investigate new
techniques for partitioning and replicating document and index data across such
systems, and for routing search requests to the data, with the goal of improving
query processing efficiency and reducing hardware and energy costs. The work
will result in a better understanding of the basic data partitioning and load
balancing problems in such systems, and also has the potential to lead to
significant economic benefits for existing and future search systems in terms of
reduced hardware and energy costs. In addition, the project will support the
training of a number of graduate and undergraduate students in search engine
technology, a critical expertise sought by many employers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research activities can be divided into two
parts. The first part will focus on index sharding and tiering techniques, i.e.,
how to assign documents and index data to shards and tiers using clustering and
index reordering techniques, and how to route queries to shards and tiers for
efficient query processing. Here the goal is to minimize overall average query
processing costs, without considering issues such as load balancing between
machines, queuing delays, and resulting query latencies. The second part will
focus on shard assignment and replication and on query routing, i.e., how to
assign and replicate shards over machines, and how to adaptively route queries
to shard replicas, in order to achieve increased query throughput across a range
of realistic service level agreements (SLAs) on query latencies and result
quality. Here the focus is on studying the basic load balancing problems arising
in large search architectures, and on performing an end-to-end evaluation of the
new index sharding and tiering techniques from the first part, to show that they
can satisfy realistic latency and quality constraints with state-of-the-art load
balancing methods.
