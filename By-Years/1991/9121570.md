This grant is for the establishment of a new Materials Research Group at
Arizona State University. The research of the group emphasizes use of high
pressure in the synthesis of novel solid state materials. The high pressure
regimes being explored include 1-50 kilobar range using piston-cylinder
apperati, in-situ studies of phase changes and materials properties up to
approximately 1 megabar in diamond anvil cells, pressure and temperature
multiple anvil apperati capable of 230 kilobars at 2000 degrees centigrade for
synthesis of new materials. The materials being studied include: (a) novel
crystalline phases in the nitride system such as alkali and alkaline earth
nitrides, chalcogenide and oxide perovskites (b) novel vitreous phases by
pressure-induced chemical stabilization of pure nitride glasses, pressure-
induced destabilization of crystalline metallic and covalent phases, and (c)
novel ceramic phases from pressure stabilized plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
deposited precursors. These new solid state materials are being characterized
using x-ray and neutron diffraction, electron microscopy, micro-Raman and micro-
infrared spectroscopy, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
electron microprobe chemical analysis, Auger electron spectroscopy, and electron
energy loss spectroscopy. Theoretical guidance for the synthetic endeavors is
provided through ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and ab initio
molecular dynamics techniques. The Materials Research Group undertakes materials
research of a scope or complexity that would not be feasible through traditional
individual investigator research. Progress is enhanced through a group of
investigators with diverse backgrounds participating in interactive,
collaborative research.
