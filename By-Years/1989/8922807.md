The Hawaiian Islands possess one of the most distinctive floras in the world.
Because of its rich biodiversity and extreme geographic isolation, the Hawaiian
archipelago is often praised as an ideal locality in which to study the patterns
and processes of organic evolution. However, much of Hawaii's unique flora is
endangered because of habitat conversion by humans and introduced animals and
through the invasion of alien, weedy plant competitors. Fragmentation of forest
habitat in particular may reduce the effective number of mature plants able to
reproduce in the wild. There is a critical need, therefore, for studies which
not only address evolutionary questions but also obtain data useful to the wise
stewardship of Hawaii's plant resources. In a project relevant to the
conservation biology of native Hawaiian ferns, Dr. Thomas Ranker of the
University of Hawaii will employ enzyme electrophoresis to describe levels and
patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations of 24 species of
native Hawaiian ferns. Levels of outcrossing and inbreeding among the tiny
gametophytes of these species will be analyzed by examining natural stands of
fern sporophytes as well as by sampling natural and laboratory populations of
selected gametophytes. For species of the endemic genera Adenophorus and
Sadleria, gametophytes will be grown in the laboratory and tested for factors
affecting reproductive capacity and outcrossing behavior. Comparisons will be
made between wide-ranging, common species and narrowly distributed, rare ones,
and correlations sought with amounts of genetic variation and apportionment of
this variation within populations or among scattered populations. These data are
pertinent to management decisions regarding effective population sizes for
maintaining genetic variation and overall diversity in the Hawaiian fern flora.
