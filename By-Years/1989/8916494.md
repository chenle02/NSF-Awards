The Proterozoic of Arizona is part of a 1300 km wide orogenic belt that is
primarily made up of juvenile (1800-1600 ma) additions to the continental crust.
Work to date indicates that up to eight separate tectonic blocks having
different structural, metamorphic, geochronologic and geochemical
characteristics exist. The goal of this collaborative project is to understand
the mechanisms for the accretion, assembly and stabilization of the new crust,
and subsequent post-orogenic uplift of the Proterozoic crust. The work will
involve mapping, PTt determinations and U-Pb dating off metamorphic minerals,
and will be performed by workers at Northern Arizona University (EAR89-16373),
University of Massachusetts (EAR89-16494), and Washington University
(EAR89-16247). Results are expected to help understand how ancient juvenile
continental crust formed and was incorporated into stable areas of continents.
