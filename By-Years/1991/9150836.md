An Activity-Based Introductory Statistics Course for all Undergraduates An
activity-based statistics course for undergraduates is being developed that
draws from recent experiences at the secondary level and in industry, where
statistics has been made relevant by focusing on the production and analysis of
data of interest to the participants. Laboratory activities are being created
with emphasis upon modern data analysis and graphical techniques, student
projects, case studies, technology, and innovative teaching practices that treat
statistics more as a laboratory science and less as a subject for lectures. This
project is producing a cohesive collection of laboratory units for students of
introductory statistics, along with reference, assessment and implementation
manuals for instructors.
