Abstract ATM-9527637 Yerg, Marty NOAA-National Weather Service Title: US/PRC
Bilateral Meeting This award provides partial support (with NOAA) for a meeting
of the U.S.-PRC Joint Working Group on Cooperation in the Field of Atmospheric
Science and Technology, held in Washington, October 24- November 5, 1994. NOAA
and NSF have been involved in the official U.S. bilateral agreement with the
People's Republic of China for about fifteen years. It has resulted in many
accomplishments in the areas of tropical and monsoon meteorology, mesoscale
meteorology, and climate studies. The meeting is one in a series, held every two
years, where the U.S. and the PRC meet to discuss science accomplished and
future plans for the next two years of joint research. The meeting is of direct
benefit to NSF (ATM) in planning its science agenda in regard to joint work with
U.S. PIs and the PRC.
