Midwestern streams are dominated by complex algal growth during much of the
year. Interactions among predators, grazing minnows and crayfish could strongly
affect this algal structure. Interactions between grazers and their shared
predator may influence algal habitat structure and furthermore have cascading
effects on other stream-fish interactions with important consequences for
community structure. This study will focus on such effects and possible
behavioral mechanisms. Surveys throughout Oklahoma will test the generality and
strength of relationships among the algivorous minnow Campostoma anomalum,
crayfish, their shared predators, algal standing crop, abiotic habitat variables
and various aspects of stream-fish community structure. Manipulative experiments
will isolate abiotic and biotic variables that affect interactions among two
grazers (C. anomalum and crayfish), their shared predator (bass) and algal
structure. Further experiments will study the affects of algal structure on
interactions among two invertivorous fishes and their shared predator (bass).
