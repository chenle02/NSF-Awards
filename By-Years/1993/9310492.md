9310492 Nikravesh This project deals with the development of innovative
methodologies and algorithms for analysis and design of multibody systems. the
major objectives are to improve accuracy, computational efficiency, and modeling
capabilities in multibody analysis and optimal design, A multibody system may
consist of rigid and deformable bodies, a control system, aerodynamic effects,
and other interdisciplinary subsystems. The approach includes real-time
simulation using a Silicon Graphics computer system dedicated to support
research in analysis and design of a variety of mechanical systems such as
algorithm and software development in pneumatic tire and road interaction, four-
wheel-steering vehicle control, tilt-wing conversion and multisegment -
multijoint biomechanical systems and control.***
