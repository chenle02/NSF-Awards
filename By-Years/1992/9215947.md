This analytical 200kV transmission electron microscope with field emission gun
is a state of the art high brightness source to be used in highly relevant
fundamental materials research programs. Faculty members in four different
colleges at Ohio State University, and researchers throughout the state of Ohio
will have access to this new instrument. It will provide a field emission gun,
energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy in
parallel, and a high resolution video camera for recording high resolution
electron microscopy images. On-line image analysis and simulation will also be
possible.
