There is great potential for adapting biopolymer molecules such as RNA and DNA
to meaningful computational tasks and purposes. Having the ability to program
molecules at many orders of magnitude larger scale than at present using new
algorithms and software analogues has the potential to change the way we
analyze, understand and manipulate molecular systems. It can lead to practical
applications of significant benefit to society across a wide range of national
initiatives in materials, nano-biotechnology, tissue engineering, regenerative
medicine, and many other emerging areas. This ambitious Expedition addresses the
exciting challenge of developing initial foundational steps toward creating
large-scale molecular programs. This experimental technology Expedition aims to
develop a functional abstraction hierarchy to create molecular programming
languages, compilers, tools and models; a theoretical framework for the analysis
and design of molecular programs; validation of the above utilizing molecular
programs with orders of magnitude higher scale of components than at present;
and testing of the developed molecular programming technologies on real-world
applications. This high-risk/high-payoff research will increase our
understanding of the relationship between computation and the physical world,
how information can be stored and processed by molecules, and the possibilities
and limits of what can be computed and fabricated. Outreach includes summer
undergraduate and minority student research fellowships, K-12 visiting days,
boot camps, workshops and many other efforts to create a broader molecular
programming research community.
