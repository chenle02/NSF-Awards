The objective of this research is the determination of the rate of collisional
growth of ice hydrometeors. This will be accomplished using both laboratory
experiments and various theoretical calculations. The former will exploit an
existing acoustic device (at MIT) designed to suspend selected crystals using
standing sound waves. This device will be used to determine the collision
efficiency between ice particles and water-ice particles. Also, electric charge
separation will be measured when charged drops and ice crystals collide.
Finally, the calculation of three dimensional unsteady fields of motion in the
vicinity of various hydrometers will be used to interpret the experimental
results. //
