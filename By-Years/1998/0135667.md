The investigators will continue scientific studies of the magnetosphere with
detailed data analysis of multi-point observations. The effort will take
advantage of the unprecedented coverage provided by ground-based observatories
and satellites launched as part of NASA's International Solar Terrestrial
Physics Program. Specific goals are to study the pressure distribution in the
magnetosphere, to assess the accuracy of global models, and to demonstrate
techniques for assimilation of data. The work includes examining plasma pressure
distributions during storms and substorms and comparing the pressure values with
those inferred from low-altitude Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
satellites. The results will help develop a reliable model for pressure in the
magnetosphere and pave the way for data assimilation in future space weather
models.
