The objective of this research project is to create a framework, and to advance
the associated theory, for design of materials at the microstructural level. The
proposed work is significant because it will enable materials scientists to
derive characterizations of microstructure that go substantially beyond
statistical measures. Furthermore, by incorporating computational learning
theory into a decision-theoretic setting, knowledge from the materials science
and micromechanics viewpoints can be effectively incorporated into the materials
design process. The theoretical foundation of the design method is general, and
may well find application to design problems not directly involving
microstructure. Bayesian classifiers, developed primarily for image analysis
problems, will be used to evaluate the micromechanical response of candidate
microstructures without time consuming, high fidelity mechanics analyses. By
recasting the classification procedure into the framework of decision theory we
transform the technique from one that is purely evaluative to one which can be
used as part of the design optimization scheme critical to improved
microstructural design. The proposed research will strengthen the link between
materials science and component design, leading to higher performing materials
using less materials resources, and safer and more durable designs with direct
benefits for the consumer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will provide
training for engineering graduate students in novel strategies for design and
analysis of materials. Through the Ingenuity Project of the Baltimore City
Schools the project will also provide experience in engineering research to
under-represented high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
