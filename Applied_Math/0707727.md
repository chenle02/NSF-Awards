The study of flow problems in polymeric liquids poses numerous challenges for
mathematical analysis. The topics addressed in this project include
controllability of viscoelastic flows, global stability and dynamics, asymptotic
analysis of the breakup of liquid jets, numerical simulation of complex flows of
emulsions, and high Weissenberg number asymptotics of flow past an obstacle.

Applications of viscoelastic flows arise in manufacturing of plastics, foods and
other products, as well as in biological problems such as blood flow. The
research carried on under this project will clarify fundamental issues to enable
a better understanding of these flows and the development of methods for their
simulation.
