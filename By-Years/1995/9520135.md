This project will analyze 14C data to study long term changes in solar activity,
as it relates to terrestrial climate. There are two pertinent components of
solap activity: the solar wind and irradiance. The solar wind modulates the
production of 14C and irradiance forces the carbon cycle. This project will
investigate both measurements and theory. Measurement of decadal or bidecadal
samples prevents observation of high frequency changes in solar activity such as
the 11-year cycle or short-lived phenomena such as 14C production by solar
flares. Hence, it was decided to measure the C isotopes in annual tree rings.
The project will measure 195 samples to complete work on the Oort and Wolf Solar
Minima and the intervening Medieval Solar Maximum. Additional measurements would
be made to further resolve questions concerning the Schwabe cycle during the
Maunder Minimum. Theoretical work would concentrate on analysis of the new data
and continued study of data from the 10,000 year data bank. Efforts would be
made to deconvolute the solar wind and irradiance components of 14C variance in
order to achieve a better understanding of the Sun's role in modulating the
production of 14C and forcing of climate. Plans include further study of the
14C-climate correlation.***
