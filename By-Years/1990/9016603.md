A workshop on research needs in friction will be coordinated by the ASME.
Initial surveys will be made of major industry groups to determine their most
pressing research needs in friction. A workshop will subsequently be convened to
evaluate the current status of friction research, to formulate long-term basic
research programs which are both good science and responsive to the industrial
needs, and to recommend priorities. Areas of interest include the fundamental
nature of friction and the use of advanced techniques for its study, the effects
of surface structure and surface reactions on friction, and the interaction
between friction and mechanical vibrations and noise.
