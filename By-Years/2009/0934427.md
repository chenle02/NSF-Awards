Humbolt State University Marine Laboratory is awarded a grant to renovate a wet
lab facility to facilitate maintenance and improve reliability of the
recirculating seawater system, provide improved configuration of tanks for
research studies, provide improved seawater system drainage, provide a safer
work environment, and provide improved displays for visitors and educational
outreach. Humboldt State University Marine Laboratory (HSU ML) supports a
diversity of marine research and education programs, with a focus on upper
division and graduate level instruction and research. Constructed in 1964 at an
original size of 7,400 sq ft, it was expanded to 16,200 sq ft in 1975. The HSU
ML has instructional classrooms- laboratories, offices for faculty, affiliated
scientists and graduate students, and other specialized spaces. A recirculating
seawater system provides high quality filtered and chilled seawater to
classrooms, and supports a 3,000 sq ft wet laboratory, a set of six rectangular
public display aquaria, a large circular tank with small public viewing window,
and a "touch tank". A marine naturalist maintains an active K-12 education
program and an estimated 12,000-15,000 visitors tour our facility each year.
