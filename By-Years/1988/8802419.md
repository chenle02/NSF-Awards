A massively parallel approach to the tracking of rigid motions in image
sequences can be based on a Lie-algebra formalism. This research will extend the
theoretical basis of such neural-network visual analysis, with experimental
verification via a Connection Machine simulation. The key insight is that
instantaneous tracking of variations in Gibson's "flow of the optic array" can
be achieved by local wiring of Hoffman orbits derived from a canonical Lie
decomposition. This is similar to repeated application of a Hough transform, but
will here be combined with a new technique for exploiting "momentum" of the
visual flow. Inspiration for this work comes from Pitts and McCulloch's theory
on the extraction of universals from transformation groups. The goal is to track
objects simultaneously in position and depth, without first segmenting them from
the optic field.
