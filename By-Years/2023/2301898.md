Carbon has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization.
Despite the vast potential of various carbon forms, including different existing
and emerging 0D, 1D, and 2D carbon nanostructures, to advance applications such
as quantum computing, terahertz communications, energy storage systems, and
carbon capture, the knowledge gap between carbon allotropes and device
fabrication communities continues to hinder progress in scaling and integrating
carbon devices into carbon systems. The Broadening Carbon Ring Network of
Networks (N-o-N) is a strategic alliance that aims to advance the state of the
art in carbon materials and devices by bringing together researchers from
different research communities. The goal is to fill the knowledge gap in carbon
materials, accelerate new carbon materials discovery, create and share
fabrication and manufacturing toolboxes, explore frontier carbon device and new
applications, and train highly diverse researchers and technical leaders with
skillsets to conduct complex projects requiring international coordination.

This Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network
Collaborations (AccelNet) project will connect 18 networks including
interdisciplinary research networks, regional clusters and user facilities
across 10 countries. The specific aim of this N-o-N is to fill in the knowledge
gaps in the areas of modeling the pyrolysis from polymer precursor to final
carbon microstructure, tuning carbon shapes and carbon interfaces through self-
assembly and controllable functionalization, hybrid carbon materials enabling
high performance energy, sensing, and electronic devices, and scalable
manufacturing through the creation of an International Roadmap on Carbon Systems
(IRCS) and building a global database for best practices, sustainability, and
life-cycle analysis. The training and exchange activities will impact diverse
workforce development and STEM education.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
