The first two objectives of the proposal are to investigate the asymptotic
stabilization and the approximation of infinite dimensional linear systems. When
infinite dimensional systems are being stabilized it is usually attempted to
find a state feedback such that the closed loop system is exponentially stable.
The PI has shown recently that there is a class of systems for which no feedback
can be found such that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable. But a
state feedback can be found such that the closed loop system is asymptotically
stable. It is proposed to continue this investigation to obtain a clear
understanding of the systems that can be asymptotically stabilized. The second
objective of the proposed work deals with the approximation of infinite
dimensional systems using balanced realizations. Progress on both objectives
depends on improving the understanding of infinite dimensional par-balanced
systems. In particular it is expected that significant progress will be made in
the investigation of so-called definitizable par-balanced systems. These systems
are symmetric in an indefinite inner product space and the main operator is
definitizable. The third objective is to implement system identification
algorithms in various areas of applications.

These algorithms will make use of balanced parameterizations, which were
developed by the PI because of their potential superiority over conventional
parameterizations. Fundamental engineering problems are the stabilization of
unstable processes and the approximate description of complex dynamics by less
complex mathematical models which nevertheless capture the important aspects of
the full process. Such approximate models are often needed since they are
amenable to computations and current engineering design methods. A significant
part of the proposal is devoted to solving problems that have been identified in
the course of a collaboration with molecular biologists who are working on
biotechnological problems such as the investigation of protein-protein
interactions. Experimentation by surface plasmon resonance biosensors and NMR
spectroscopy lead to complex modeling and data analysis problems. Earlier
theoretical results by the PI will be used to develop computational tools to
improve on currently employed methodologies. An interesting aspect of this
proposal is that the three topics can be investigated using mathematical tools
which are known as balanced realizations.
