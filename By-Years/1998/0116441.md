With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Brown University will acquire a high resolution
magnetic sector mass spectrometer. This equipment will be used to analyze a
broad range of chemical and biochemical samples that include compounds resulting
from organic synthesis, enzyme inhibitors, high-molecular weight hydrocarbons,
neurochemicals, carbohydrates, peptides and organometallics, as well as organic
chemicals from lake sediments.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact
in a number of areas including environmental chemistry and biochemistry.
