The synthesis and characterization of macromolecules whose polymeric nature
does not solely derive from direct covalent bonding of the repeat units will be
carried out. These materials, known as polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes, may be
considered interpenetrating netwoks at the repeat unit (micromolecular) level.
However, because the units are not covalently bonded, but are like links in a
chain, they may have a large degree of independence from one another. As such,
they are expected to have physical properties distinct from those of
conventional polymers and copolymers. Use in a broad range of applications may
be envisioned for these two new classes of materials, including engineering
materials. In the latter case, attainment of toughness through physical, rather
than chemical, bonding should avoid the brittleness that plagues current highly
crosslinked polymeric systems used, for example, as matrixes for composites.
