9604299 Striedter The ability to learn complex vocalizations has evolved only in
humans, songbirds, and parrots. This project investigates how the neural
circuits controlling vocalization have changed during the evolution of vocal
learning. Particular emphasis is placed on an area of the midbrain, as the
function of this region is hypothesized to have changed significantly as the
capacity for vocal behavior moves from being genetically coded to being
dependent on learning. Neuroanatomical analysis of the inputs and outputs of
this area, observations of the behavioral effects of damage to this area, and
electrophysiological examination of the activity of midbrain neurons are all
used to test comparative analysis is then used to reconstruct how neural
circuitry and behavioral function of the vocal control system change during
evolution. In doing so, this is one of the first studies to examine how
historical constraints can influence current brain function. The results of this
study enhance our understanding of the brain's systems for controlling vocal
behavior, including human speech, as well as improve our understanding of how
nervous systems in general evolve to accomodate complex new behavioral abilities
within the constraints of preexisting circuits with preexisting functions. Such
research is important in advancing knowledge about how natural and artificial
learning systems acquire increasingly complex abilities as a function of
experience.
