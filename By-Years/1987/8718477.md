In this project Dr. Leslie and his colleagues will conduct a biological study
of Turkana pastoralists who live in the northern desert region of Kenya. The
goal of the research is to understand Turkana fertility and the team will
conduct a number of coordinated studies. Through menstrual diaries and salivary
progesterone assay it will be possible to determine if and when women are
fertile, determine individual cycle length and what percentage of the adult
female population is fertile. To understand the causes of observed patterns a
number of ancillary studies will also be carried out. Data will be collected on
health and nutritional status and it will be determined how these vary over the
course of the year. Measurement will be taken to determine body composition and
activity patterns and energy expenditure will be observed. Since ties have been
established between breast-feeding and fertility, breast-feeding patterns will
also be studied. The Turkana are an extremely interesting population from a
demographic perspective. They are pastoralists who depend on their herds of
camels, cows, goats and sheep for food. They live in a harsh desert environment
which receives limited amounts of rain only at specific times of the year.
Therefore they are subjected to severe stress during some seasons and milder
stress during others. Previous work has shown that their energy intake is low.
However (perhaps because of high protein intake) the average fertility level is
extremely high. Also it is extremely seasonal. The purpose of this study is to
document this further and determine the causes. This research is important for
several reasons. It should provide additional understanding of the natural
processes which control fertility. Secondly, although the Turkana live in a
highly stressful desert environment, they have adapted to it extremely well. In
other environmentally similar areas of Africa, when drought strikes, people
starve unless the international community provides food. The U.S. government
expends large sums for this purpose. Hopefully what is learned about Turkana
adaptation can serve a useful function elsewhere in Africa.
