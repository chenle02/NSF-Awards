9400316 HUNT This dissertation project on the socio-economic organization of an
East Greenlandic hunting economy, based on the harvesting of seals, will result
in a description and analysis of an economy operating in both a modern
industrial market context and a traditional domestic household economy. The
subsequent analysis will contribute to social theory on the impact of cash on
traditional subsistence economies and the structure of mixed economies. In the
context of the 1989 European Community's indefinite ban on the trade of seal
skins, the research will contribute to our understanding of the adaptive
strategies of a contemporary Arctic society. ***
