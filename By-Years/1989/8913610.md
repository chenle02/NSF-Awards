This project will support the 1990 Summer Institute on Differential Geometry
which will be held during July 1990 at the University of California, Los
Angeles. The three-week institute is the thirty-eighth in a series which brings
together groups of mathematicians interested in a particular field of
mathematical research. The program will address both new developments in the
more classical areas of differential geometry and new connections with partial
differential equations and mathematical physics. The major topics to be
addressed at the institute include (1) Riemannian geometry, (2) minimal
submanifolds and constant mean curvature, (3) complex geometry, (4) the general
theory of partial differential equations on manifolds, harmonic functions,
harmonic mappings, the Monge-Ampere equation, differential systems and isometric
embedding, (5) eigenvalues, heat flow, and index theory, (6) gauge theory and
geometry in mathematical physics, (7) groups and manifolds and dynamical
systems, and (8) symplectic geometry.
