Title: 2017 Programming Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS)

This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2017 Programming
Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS). This summer school provides an
important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study topics
related to designs and implementations of programming languages. The award's
broader significance and importance include building international community,
broadening participation, and enhancing education of US students, including
women and underrepresented minorities. The school also provides students
exposure to and multiple opportunities to interact with leading-edge research
and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school thus imparts
training to the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software
engineering researchers in both industry and academia, as well as to future
application developers.
