This research will involve spline functions. Spline functions and their various
generalizations in several variables have proved to be very useful for building
empirical models which describe multivariate physical phenomena in large data
sets. The general approach of this project is to develop theoretical properties
of the proposed semi-parametric models, to assess how well they might be
expected to work in practice by Monte Carlo simulation studies, and finally, to
try the methods on selected "real" experimental data sets. This project is in
the general area of statistics and focuses on high speed computing. The spline
function models need new statistical and numerical techniques to let the data
select from among various possible models, to fit these models, and to provide
as much information as possible on how accurate the model forecast are likely to
be. Most of this research is supported by AFSOR and NASA. This award supports a
graduate student to work in the project.
