This proposal will study the unusual and rare class of peroxides that have an
o-o bond adjacent tot a carbon-carbon double bond. This study will complement
previous work done on acyl and alkyl peroxides and should provide fundamental
knowledge in the area of oxygen - centered radicals. The proposal will also
examine methods to generate vinyl peroxides under mild conditions with
subsequent study of their polymerization. The planning activities will include
the following: 1) Literature search and consultation with senior researchers. 2)
Molecular orbital calculations. 3) Synthesis of vinyl peroxides. 4) Drafting MRI
competitive proposal.
