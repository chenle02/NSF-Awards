This project addresses major issues related to the design of metropolitan and
nationwide all-optical networks. These are networks that attempt to use a
substantial portion of the low attenuation bandwidth of single mode fiber (about
30,000 GHz) on each link of the network. Such nets switch data between links by
all optical means, such as frequency selective couplers, avoiding the use of
optoelectronics at the data rate, except at the periphery of the network. Major
areas of emphasis are (1) link level issues: design and performance of optical
demultiplexing filters, laser phase noise effects on performance including the
effect of feedback stabilization, impairments in long distance multiuser
communication including nonlinear effects such as amplifier saturation and Raman
scattering; (2) theoretical and experimental work at the subsystem level:
frequency stabilization at remote locations in a network, fast frequency
identification in a distributed environment. The influence of these issues on
network level issues will be a component of the work.
