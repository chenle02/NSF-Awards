This award provides travel support for approximately 20 U.S. participants to the
52nd Biennial Session of the International Statistical Institute, held in
Helsinki, Finland, from August 10-18, 1999. This premier statistical
international conference jointly hosts the Bernoulli Society, the International
Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), the International Association for
Statistical Computing (IASC), the International Association of Survey
Statisticians (IASS) and the International Association for Statistical Education
(IASE). The grant will provide partial support to defray transportation costs
for individuals selected by a committee appointed by the ASA president, with
emphasis on newer faculty (within 10 years of degree) and women and minorities.
