Processes responsible for the mosaic of hemlock stands and hardwood stands in
the old-growth forest at Sylvania, Michigan will be studied with retrospective
techniques. These approaches include reconstruction of disturbance history over
the last two centuries from tree-rings, windstorms, fire and the consequent
changes in forest composition over the last five millennia from pollen deposits
in small forest hollows. The mosaic of stands and soil textures will be studied
in three permanent plots established on different soil types. The ways in which
the mosaic changed through time in response to climatic change, to changes in
disturbance regimes and to the invasion of hemlock beginning three thousand
years ago, will be monitored by pollen diagrams from closely spaced spatial
arrays of hollows, approximately one per hectare, within each of the plots.
Mosaic changes on a large spatial scale will be shown in pollen diagrams from
seven additional hollows scattered throughout Sylvania in stand types not
represented in the plots. Modeling and studies of pollen representation will
develop needed techniques for accurate interpretation of pollen assemblages from
heterogeneous vegetation.
