9306385 Kanatzidis In the work, technologically significant conjugated and
saturated polymers are intercalated into lamellar hosts. Studies on the
(polymer) hydrated vanadium pentoxide and (polymer) iron oxychlorides will
continue to better understand their structure and properties. Experiments to
gain insights into the degree of polymerization of the conductive polymers in
these materials are proposed. Based on the n-type to p-type transition which
occurs as a function of x in (polymer) hydrated vanadium pentoxide, the behavior
of p-n diodes will be studied. Single crystals of polyanaline/iron oxychloride
will be explored by crystallographic analysis and charge transport measurements.
In what constitutes a new research direction, new methodologies will be
developed to include other layered hosts, which are not amenable to in-situ
intercalative redox polymerization. A variety of new conjugated
polymer/inorganic intercalation compounds will be prepared. These new hosts
include uranyl phosphate, zirconium phosphates and phosphonates, molybnenum
oxides and transition metal dichalcogenides. In addition to conjugated polymers,
saturated polymers will be used to prepare novel molecular scale nano-
composites with layered inorganic hosts. A full physico-chemical
characterization of these materials is proposed. ***
