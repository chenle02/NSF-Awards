With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Gutsche shall extend
his investigation into the preparation of novel calixarenes and the mechanisms
of reaction. Further, his investigation will include studies of molecular
conformation and enzyme mimics of several new calixarene systems. Calixarene
molecular systems represent a laboratory prepared complex system which has
potential to facilitate/catalyze chemical reactions. The molecular recognition
units function uniquely and are useful to industry as well as academia. They now
rival other molecular systems as cyclodextrins with regard to usefulness as
molecular recognition systems.
