Dynamics and Variational Problems

Abstract of Proposed Research Michael Loss and Eric A. Carlen

This project will support research on some mathematical problems that are
motivated by questions arising from issues about the behavior of complex
physical systems. We shall develop analytic and probabilistic tools to study a
number of problems in statistical mechanics. These include proving results about
Cercignani's conjecture, deriving optimal geometric correlation inequalities,
studying certain variational principles that arise in the study of phase
transitions and also some topics in Quantum electrodynamics.

Many of these results center on the proof of physically motivated inequalities.
The investigators have had considerable success in recent years in discovering
some sharp geometrical and analytic inequalities using techniques from the
calculus of variations.
