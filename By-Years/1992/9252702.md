Xavier University of Louisiana and the University of New Orleans propose to
establish a Research Careers for Minority Scholars program for the purpose of
recruiting promising high school graduates and currently enrolled students who
will commit to pursuing graduate study in science or engineering. The proposed
program will identify selected students and provide them with undergraduate and
graduate teaching and research advisors, help in obtaining summer research
internships, and financial aid in sufficient quantity so as to facilitate
student success. The unique feature of the proposed project is the development
of a Graduate Dual Degree (Bachelor of Science and Master of Science)
arrangement between Xavier University (for undergraduate degrees) and the
University of New Orleans (for graduate degrees) in chemistry, computer science,
mathematics, physics, and engineering. Those students pursuing engineering
careers will receive both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degree
from the University of New Orleans. Structurally, this program is unique not
only in its ability to provide students an opportunity to obtain an
undergraduate and a graduate degree, but also, in a time frame which is reduced
by one year from the traditional approach. Numerically, we expect this proposed
project ultimately to increase the minority pool of doctoral candidates in the
sciences by approximately 20% on a nation-wide basis. The amount requested from
the National Science Foundation for this project is $2,363,08 or only $10,503
per year per student to obtain a Bachelors and Masters Degree in either
Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics Physics, or Engineering. University
cost sharing is set at an additional $776,168.
