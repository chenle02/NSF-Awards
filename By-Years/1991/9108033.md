This is an award to provide renewal support for a project previously conducted
under NSF Grant No. 87-14640 in which an existing 1.5 Mev, 50 ma, electron
accelerator located at the Virginia Key Wastewater Treatment Plant in Miami was
used to study electron-beam applications in environmental engineering practice.
Results confirmed the effectiveness of the electron beam for inactivation of
microorganisms in aqueous suspension, destruction of organics contaminants in
aqueous solution, and defined reaction rate constants associated with
destruction of organic contaminants in water. Research in this project includes
expanding studies of dose-destruction relationships for polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, identification of reaction mechanisms and byproducts produced by
electron beam irradiation, exploring methods for more efficient presentation of
the fluid to the beam, study of radical scavengers and enhancers to improve the
beam's efficiency, and development of cost models for determination of economic
feasibility of electron beam use in environmental engineering practice. Results
of this research conducted at a sufficiently large scale to obtain engineering
design parameters are likely to be utilized in environmental engineering
practice. Potential applications include design of processes and systems for
decontamination of surface and groundwaters, destruction of hazardous wastes,
treatment of sludges derived from treatment of wastewater to improve their
dewaterability and amenability to stabilization processes, disinfection of
sludges and processing byproducts and to improve their biodegradability or
removal from aqueous solution by other physical or chemical processes.
