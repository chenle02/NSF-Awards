This project is concerned with the study of problems coming from fluid
mechanics, gas dynamics, and plasma physics. The principal investigator with his
collaborators P. Germain and J. Shatah develops the method of space-time
resonances, which combines the standard notion of resonances with the study of
the spatial localization of solutions. One application of the method is the
global existence and scattering for water waves and for capillary waves. He
studies asymptotic problems in fluid mechanics, especially those giving rise to
boundary layers: zero viscosity limit and compressible-incompressible limit in
the presence of a free boundary, and the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann
equation in a bounded domain. Understanding the properties of the boundary layer
is important in many applications. He investigates the homogenization of
elliptic operators in the presence of oscillating boundary data. He also studies
global existence of weak solutions for some non-Newtonian fluids (viscoelastic)
and especially polymeric liquids. These systems require a coupling between a
fluid equation and the Fokker-Planck equation for the polymers.

The investigator studies the behavior of complicated systems with different
boundary conditions and in different limiting cases. These studies provide an
improved understanding of the real physical phenomena taking place and of the
domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is important for engineers
and physicists who look for the simplest model that captures the phenomena, to
implement numerically or to apply in real life. For instance, water waves
problems are important to understand tsunamis and rogue waves. Moreover, the
study of viscoelastic fluids and especially polymeric liquids (egg white, blood,
or dough for example) is important in many industrial applications such as food
processing and is of great interest in many branches of applied physics,
chemistry, and biology. This project includes the training of graduate students
in mathematics and physics.
