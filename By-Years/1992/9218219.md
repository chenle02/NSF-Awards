Small Grant for Exploratory Research: Proof of Concept Study for Acoustically
Telemetering XBT This Oceanographic Instrumentation Development proposal seeks
funds to prove that development of an acoustically telemetering, Deep- depth XBT
(DDXBT) that could operate to depths in excess of 3,000 meters is technically
feasible. Two previous proposals to develop a DDXBT have been declined due to
reviewer concerns about power requirements, sensor reliability and acoustic
transmission. In spite of the technical barriers, reviewers have been
enthusiastic about the scientific potential of the proposed DDXBT. This SGER
grant provides funds for the PI to conduct exploratory research into the issues
of power, sensors and acoustics for the DDXBT. Rossby proposes to provide
scientific oversight with a majority of the engineering research to be
accomplished via a subcontract to Spartan of Canada, Limited.
