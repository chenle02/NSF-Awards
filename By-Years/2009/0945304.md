This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop innovative
edge emitting superluminescent light emitting diodes (SLED) and laser diodes
(LD) with emission in the UV-B spectral range (280 nm to 320 nm). A variety of
optical sensing applications that require high power density with a highly
localized spatial emission will benefit from the edge emitting device design.

Development of novel UV-B emitting III-nitride devices will enable broad
expansion of semiconductor DUV sources in medical diagnostics and treatment,
fluorescence sensing and curing market sectors. This innovative technology is
positioned to create new applications in the U.S. manufacturing sector that were
previously unattainable for UV lamps and gas lasers. These DUV SLEDs can reduce
or eliminate the use of mercury based UV technology for a variety of
applications.
