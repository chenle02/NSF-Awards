This project was submitted under the program for Research Opportunities for
Women. The research is to collect data and to work out techniques on macroalgae
in Arctic tundra streams in order to establish strong, testable hypotheses for
future research. This work will be coordinated with the nutrient enrichment
experiments of Long Term Ecological Research Program at Toolik Lake. The four
objectives address macroalgal distribution and hydrochemistry through three
adjacent tundra drainage basins, the productivity of dominant macroalgae species
in the nutrient-enriched gradient of the Kuparuk River, the effect of grazers on
the occurrence of macroalgae, and the search for macroalgal species as
indicators of environmental change. The study will establish some baseline data
on macroalgal communities in fertilized and pristine Arctic ecosystems.
