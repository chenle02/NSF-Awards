This award aims to provide hands-on experience to scientists in communicating
complex scientific concepts and the quality and accuracy of their research to a
variety of audiences. The investigators will achieve this aim through a series
of interactive and problem-solving exercises in annual week-long workshops. The
workshops will use a detailed and complex science case study designed to
simulate a real world scientific conflict involving competing scientific
testimony. Participants will receive coaching and feedback on their performances
thereby allowing them to experiment and practice with what works best in a given
context. In addition, participants will discuss ethical issues concerning expert
scientific communication.

The primary broader impacts of the workshops are training scientists who are
active in teaching, researching, writing, and publishing on how to improve their
communication skills. Once participants complete the workshop, they will join
other graduates of the workshop as "Fellows" and form a network of trained
scientists who will educate other students and colleagues on the methods of
effectively communicating scientific knowledge, research, and process in a
variety of public forums.
