This project will support a conference on Numerical and Computational
Developments in Harmonic Analysis to be held on May 18, 1989 at DePaul
University in Chicago, Illinois. The conference will be organized by Professor
Jonathan Cohen of the Department of Mathematics of DePaul University. The focus
of the conference will be on new results arising from the use of computers in
research in harmonic analysis. Four one-hour talks will be presented by
prominent researchers; the areas of discussion will include wavelets, singular
integral techniques in the solution of boundary value problems, and the
computation of harmonic measure.
