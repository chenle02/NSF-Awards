The department is purchasing an oligonucleotide synthesizer, a spin- dryer, a
spectrophotometer, a gel dryer-vacuum pump, and an automated polymerase chain
reaction apparatus for undergraduate instruction in a junior year course in cell
and molecular biology and for senior research projects. This equipment enhances
the development of the laboratory course by introducing the theory and practise
of site- specific mutagenesis using deoxynucleotides, enhances the ability to
screen large numbers of clones and carry out DNA sequence analysis of mutant
genes, allows the preparation of large amounts of rare genes for sequencing work
and the preparation of probes, and provides a sensitive and precise
sepctrophotometer. The equipment impacts on all upper level courses in the
curriculum and enables the college to provide a modern program in cell,
molecular and developmental biology. The college will contribute an amount equal
to the award.
