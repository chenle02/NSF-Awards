94-53362 Broholm This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a project
involving neutron diffraction investigations of quantum phenomena in condensed
matter systems. The project has a strong educational component which involves
both undergraduate and graduate students in the research. The research addresses
structural and magnetic order in so-called quantum disordered solids that only
exhibit a magnetic phase transition in the limit of zero temperature. The
systems include one-dimensional linear chains, two-dimensional antiferromagnetic
sheets, heavy-Fermion metals and transition- metal oxides. The research is of
considerable fundamental interest, but has potential technological importance
since it may shed light on related fields such as high temperature
superconductivity. This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a project
to study magnetism and electrical properties of materials which exhibit quantum
effects. The project has a strong educational component which involves both
undergraduate and graduate students in the research. The research seeks to study
phase transitions that only emerge as the materials reach "absolute zero". This
can be contrasted with non-quantum materials such as ice that undergoes an
ordinary phase transition, melting a 32 F. The systems include linear chains or
two-dimensional arrays of magnetic atoms, complex metal alloys and transition-
metal oxides. The research is of considerable fundamental interest, but has
potential technological importance since it may shed light on related fields
such as high temperature superconductivity.
