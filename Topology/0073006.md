Among the range of problems to be investigated in topology and geometry in low
and high dimensions, some concern the study of transformation groups, that is
the symmetries of manifolds and of more general spaces. New methods of
classifying such group actions will be developed with a view to making good
connections with methods of equivariant homotopy theory; basic "naturality"
questions for the set of group actions on a manifold will be studied. Another
set of problems concerns a variety of both topological and algebraic invariants
of varieties, e.g. theories of characteristic classes, and new methods of
explicitly computing them. A related series of questions to be investigated
concerns the relations between the global topology of divisors and the local
geometry of their singularities which must, in general, be regarded as "singular
knots." The natural actions of mapping class groups and their Torelli subgroups
on the moduli spaces of representations (which are foundational in algebraic
geometry, in gauge theory, in 3-manifold topology, and in string theory) will be
investigated with a view to applications in three dimensional topology.
Decomposition methods for studying analytic and geometric invariants of
manifolds and the relations between them will be investigated, again with a view
of applying such relation to three manifolds. Computations of generalized
characteristic classes of toric varieties will be combined with other
topological, geometric, and analytical methods to obtain results in geometrical
combinatorics and applications to problems concerning lattice sums.

This research project involves several investigations in a range of problems in
topology and geometry in low and high dimensions and studies of some new
applications of these in other areas of mathematics. Some of the research work
will involve invariants of manifolds and of more general spaces, such as
singular varieties. Effective methods of computing such natural invariants will
be sought. The moduli spaces and three manifold invariants to be investigated
also arise in geometrical approaches to theoretical physics. A combination of
geometrical, algebraic and analytical methods will be used to study possible
applications of singular varieties to problems concerning comparisons of lattice
sums with integrals. Such comparisons are of interest in many areas of the
mathematical sciences.
