This award will provide funds to partially cover the cost of a technician for
the solid-earth isotope geochemistry laboratory at Columbia University's Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory. The laboratory consists of three solid-source mass
spectrometers and associated equipment and requires the services of a full-time
technician for operations, maintenance and repairs. The laboratory is currently
engaged in a number of research projects involving the use of rare isotopes to
determine the geologic age and origin of rocks from the Earth's mantle.
