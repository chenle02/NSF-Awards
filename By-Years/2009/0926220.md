This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the processes
that remove nitrogen oxides in high latitudes during winter by measuring near-
surface nocturnal nitrogen oxide levels, quantifying their lifetimes through a
steady-state analysis, and correlating their loss rate to the presence of
various types of ice. This will be done during two field campaigns. During
autumn, the boundary layer is less stratified and a gradient method will be used
to quantify the deposition flux of dinitrogen pentoxide to the snowpack. During
spring, the boundary layer is often very stratified, allowing sampling of air
with little ground contact from a moderate-height tower (10 meters). Visibility
measurements and microscopy will be used to quantify suspended ice particle
surface area and size distributions. These comprehensive data sets will be used
to address the question of what types of ice surfaces are primarily responsible
for dinitrogen pentoxide losses during high-latitude nighttime. The important
mechanisms will be implemented and tested in the Weather Research and
Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pollution in
the Arctic is an increasing problem that may accelerate due to climate changes
and industrial changes like trans-Arctic shipping and increased mineral
exploration and extraction. By studying the fate of nitrogen oxide pollution
under these conditions, this project will enhance the ability of planners,
regulators, and industrial stakeholders to consider impacts of pollution on the
Arctic. The research team is engaged with other researchers and with regulators
studying particulate pollution in Fairbanks, which is now in violation of
particulate matter standards, and will integrate the project's work with these
particulate studies. Two students and a postdoctoral associate will be trained
in atmospheric chemistry through this project, and the public will be engaged
through blogging of field campaigns as they happen.
