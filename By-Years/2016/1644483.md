This is a proposal from the University of California - Irvine (UC-Irvine) to
create an I-Corps Site. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded
entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support
multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, at UC-Irvine, integrates units
across campus, focuses on minorities and is likely to have an impact both on the
campus and on the regional ecosystem. The Site is built on an already existing
31K sq. ft. collaborative facility, providing a rich environment for
commercialization. The I-Corps Site focuses on research strengths such as
photonics, nanotechnology, bioengineering, chemistry, medical and life sciences,
and transportation. The institution has a large percentage of low-income
students, and ranks first among UC institutions for Latino freshman
applications, and second in African-American freshman applications. They have a
good plan for accessing these students, as well as STEM students. In addition,
the Center has helped create businesses with socially conscious missions.
