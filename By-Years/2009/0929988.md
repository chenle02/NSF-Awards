The use of location-aware devices, such as cell phones with GPS or objects with
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, is exploding in a number of emerging
spatio-temporal applications. Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are
not designed to handle such applications, especially if the application requires
managing a large number of moving objects. The goal of the COMET (Continuous
Management of Evolving Trajectories) project is to design, implement, and build
a database management system for managing large repositories of continuously
evolving trajectories data sets. Since in these environments location updates
are issued continually, the DBMS must support extremely efficient methods for
dealing with updates. In addition, to allow querying on previous locations of
the moving objects, the DBMS must keep track of past trajectories. As time
passes these trajectories continue to increase in length, and with large and
often increasing number of moving objects, the database size can increase
dramatically. Consequently, the backend DBMS must deploy scalable techniques to
deal with increasing data sizes, and increasing number of mobile objects. The
key focus of the COMET project is on developing efficient and scalable methods
for querying on past, present, and future locations of moving objects, and on
scalable trigger mechanism in this environment. The expected results of this
project may have a strong impact on emerging notification-based applications,
such as emergency response systems, in which critical data needs to be
disseminated to a physical mobile user based on the user's current and changing
spatial location. The project will also train a number of graduate and
undergraduate students. The project Web site
(http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jignesh/comet) will be used for making the COMET
software, all developed applications, and real user movement data freely
available to a broad research community.
