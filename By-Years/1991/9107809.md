Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include efforts to
make contact between superstring theory and experimental physics, and to predict
the experimental signals that would be expected in the presence in nature of
supersymmetry. Superstring theory is a promising candidate for a theory that
describes all the forces of nature, including gravity, but determining the
experimentally testable consequences of this theory is a very difficult and
important problem Supersymmetry relates the behavior of particles (such as the
electron) which are the constituents of matter to that of particles (such as the
photon) which serve as the carriers of the various forces. If superstring theory
is right, then supersymmetry is indeed present in nature, so the consequences of
this presence are important to elucidate.
