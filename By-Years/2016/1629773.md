This award is to fund the National Academy of Science dues for continued
representation of the United States in the Scientific Committee on Solar-
Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) of the International Council for Science (ICSU)
from May 1, 2016 - April 30, 2019. SCOSTEP's principal tasks are to promote,
organize, and coordinate international interdisciplinary programs and symposia
in solar-terrestrial physics (STP), and to define the data relating to these
programs that should be exchanged through data centers. Through its programs,
SCOSTEP advances scientific knowledge of solar terrestrial physics, supports a
globally aware and engaged STP community, and promotes the development of early-
career STP scientists. The U.S. continues to have a substantial scientific and
leadership role in SCOSTEP, and the U.S. dues support these activities.
