A conference entitled Symposium on Primate Locomotion - 1995 will be held at
U.C. Davis from March 26-28, 1995. It will bring together a multidisciplinary
group of scientists to address recent discoveries in primate locomotion studies,
specific methodological problems and specirfic evolutionary problems. The
conference will focus on six issues - 1) the paleontological record of primate
locomotion; 2) locomotion in hominid evolution; 3) quantitative approaches to
locomotor studies; 4) field-based locomotor studies; 5) lab-based locomotor
strdies; and 6) the phylogenetic analysis of locomotor behavior. There will be
presentation of papers and workshops to discuss the issues raised. The
conference papers will be published as an edited volume.
