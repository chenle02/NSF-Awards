An undergraduate computer graphics laboratory using a DEC Microvax II will be
acquired. Using interfaces, the computer will serve as a dedicated machine with
four existing graphics terminals. Two undergraduate courses will be supported by
the laboratory, and seniors will use the laboratory for special projects such as
processing astronomical images and producing geological maps.
