Hybridization measurements made with phylogenetic group-specific probes for
bacterioplankton ribosomal RNAs have shown that several major bacterioplankton
groups form highly stratified populations in the lower ocean surface layer in
the northwestern Sargasso Sea. Other studies at the same site have uncovered
evidence of a seasonal cycle in which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accumulates
in the upper surface layer during the vernal period and is exported to the lower
surface layer during winter mixing. This study proposes to examine the
relationship between the composition of bacterioplankton communities and the
source, amount and lability of DOC in the water column by conducting seawater
culture experiments that combine water and inocula from different depths. High-
resolution electropherograms of amplified ribosomal RNA genes will be used to
survey community composition. Electropherogram results will be confirmed by
hybridizations of total community RNA to phylogenetic group-specific probes.
Data from this study will be compared to ongoing measurements of
bacterioplankton production, biomass and DOC that are a part of the Bermuda
Atlantic Time-Series Study.
