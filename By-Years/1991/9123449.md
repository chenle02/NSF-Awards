Determining possible responses of Arctic ecosystems to global warming requires
an understanding of both the past and present tundra communities. Although the
distribution and composition of modern North American tundra communities are
relatively well documented, the late-Quaternary history of their development
remains poorly known. This award supports an examination of the paleovegetation
and paleoclimate of far northern Alaska over the last 18,000 years as a means of
improving our knowledge of terrestrial-climate system interactions in Low Arctic
settings. This research, as part of the PALE initiative, will analyze lake
sediments from a suite of sites located in 4 tundra types of the Alaska North
Slope. This work will concentrate on calibrating modern pollen, moss spores, and
lignin compounds with surrounding vegetation and climatic parameters to assess
their ability to accurately reconstruct past environments and will apply these
calibrations to a set of fossil records chosen during the modern sampling. The
proposed research addresses the goals of PALE by describing the late-Quaternary
history of a poorly know Low Arctic region, by calibrating paleoenvironmental
indicators, and by increasing the resolution of lake records for defining
variations within tundra environments.
