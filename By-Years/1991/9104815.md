The project investigates a new method for estimating the exceedance
probabilities of extreme floods. The method is based on separately estimating
the probability distribution of flood volumes and the distribution of flood
peaks conditioned on volume. Preliminary results from the upper midwestern
United States indicate that flood volumes are very well behaved compared to
peaks, and suggests that regionalized estimates of their probability can be
extrapolated more credibly than can the estimates of probability of flood peaks.
These results will be tested using flood data from other regions of the United
States as well. Various methods of regionalizing the distribution of flood
volumes also will be explored. In estimating the distribution of flood peaks
conditioned on volume, the deterministic watershed modeling will be used in the
formulation and estimation of the statistical model. This approach will be
developed and applied to one or more drainage basins. The watershed model will
incorporate a one-dimensional, full dynamic flood routing model in order to
capture the impact of floodplain storage on flood wave propagation. The results
of this work will improve the understanding of basic rainfall-runoff-flood
probability relationships, and will result in a significant reappraisal of
techniques used in risk analysis of major engineering water projects and
existing structures.
