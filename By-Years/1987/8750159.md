The versatile instructional experiences which modern, computer- interfaced
spectrophotometers make possible are now available to undergraduate students in
chemistry at Coe College. A photodiode ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer has
been recently acquired, which when suitably configured with a personal computer,
affords students opportunities to perform experiments utilizing the latest
advances in spectrophotometry. The capacity to recall archived data and use
third party software to design spreadsheets for performing calculations and
plotting spectral data is of pedagogic value in advanced courses that include
the study of kinetics, coordination compounds, and the quantitative analysis of
complex mixtures.
