Proposal #: 93-21840 The PIx requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V THOMPSON, a 274 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and
operated by the University. Instrumentation funded includes fiber optic hubs for
the computer network, a CTD underwater unit, a 24-position rosette pylon, a
thermosalinograph, a Swath mapping workstation, and two altimeters. The
instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard
the R/V THOMPSON during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the
vessel in the future.
