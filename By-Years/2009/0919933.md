This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many organisms exhibit a remarkable
capacity for tissue regeneration. Most dramatic is the ability of free-living
flatworms known as planarians to regenerate an entire new body plan from small
excised pieces of tissue. This regenerative ability is driven by specialized
stem cells known as neoblasts. Understanding the properties of these cells, and
their behavior during regeneration is key to unlocking the secrets of
regenerative biology in these organisms, and consequently why this ability is
lacking in other animals. Specifically, this project will seek to understand the
role of intracellular calcium and Wnt signaling pathways in controlling how
neoblasts generate discrete cell types with appropriate positional identity
during regeneration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Broader impacts of
the project encompass an annual outreach course to High School Teachers that
provides a retraining and "hands-on" opportunity to gain lab experience in basic
molecular and genetic methods. NSF-supported undergraduates participate in these
activities, and in research projects relating to the interest of the PI's
laboratory in planarian regenerative biology. Consequently, trainees gain skill
sets appropriate for future careers as both researchers and scientific
educators.
