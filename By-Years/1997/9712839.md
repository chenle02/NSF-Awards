CTS-9712839 P.H. McMurray Univ. of Minnesota SUMMARY The Fifth International
Congress on Particle Sizing will be held in Minneapolis, August 11-14, 1998. The
specific topics, pertaining to fundamentals of optical particle sizing, that
will be covered by this meetings, are as follows: (Elastic scattering of shaped
light beams by shaped particles; (Dynamic light scattering (Multiple scattering
by suspended and deposited particles ( Inelastic scattering. The conference will
also cover innovative applications of these principles to measure particle size,
size distribution, concentration, and measurement of particle properties other
than the size including shape and compostition. The areas of application that
will be covered are: (Fluid mechanic of multiphase flows, such as sprays of non-
reacting and reacting liquids; (Particulate matter in pharmaceutical and
chemical processes, such as crystallization, powder handling etc. (Aerosol
mechanics; (Particle sizing in the semiconductor industry, etc.
