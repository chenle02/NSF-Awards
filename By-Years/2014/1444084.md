This award will support the foundation of a postdoctoral training center in
probability at the University of Washington. This center will support four
postdoctoral researchers, each for a period of two years, in the field of
probability. It will closely coordinate activities with the Microsoft Research
theory unit, the University of British Columbia, and the soon to be established
PIMS Postdoctoral Training Centre in Stochastics (PPTCS) in western Canada.
These groups will co-host activities, including an annual retreat for postdocs,
a probability summer school, and conferences. The centers will also regularly
bring in leading experts from around the world to give colloquia and to teach
short courses on the most recent developments in probability. The combination of
the University of Washington center and the PPTCS will form a world-class hub
for probability training, bringing together academic and industrial researchers
in an international setting, and will have significant impacts on the
mathematical sciences. With the combined programs, the postdocs will have the
opportunity to interact with more of their young colleagues as well as more
established mentors than they could in almost any other setting. In addition to
the scientific interactions, the postdocs will receive career mentoring from
their sponsors. This mentorship will come at a significant time in their career
and train them to work either in industry or the
academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probability is a rapidly growing subject which is
assuming increasing importance in the mathematical sciences. Together, the
probabilists at the University of Washington, Microsoft Research and University
of British Columbia form a group that excels in both quality and diversity of
research. These scientists have helped to lead the growth in the field of
probability and show the connections between probability and other areas of
mathematics and theoretical computer science. They will mentor the postdocs on
research in many areas of probability; both continuous and discrete as well as
pure and applied. The topics to be investigated by the postdoctoral scholars
include random walk in a random environment, first passage percolation and the
spectral measures for random graphs. The postdocs will also study the
relationships between analysis and probability, specifically the relationships
with Brownian motion and Stochastic Loewner evolution. The center will also
study applications of probability to topics such as finance and to solar energy.
