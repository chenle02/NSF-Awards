*** 9661236 Treadwell This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
aims to develop low-cost, processable precursors to numerous aluminosilicates.
Certain modified silatranes and aluminum carboxylates form water stable
solutions suggesting the potential for water processable aluminosilicate
precursors. The phase I objectives are: (1) develop an understanding of the
dissolution processes that control the rates of formation of mullite, spinel and
cordierite precursors; (2) examine simple methods of modifying aluminum
alkoxides to determine water solubility and stability and scale up; and (3)
characterize the processability and physical properties of these polymer types.
If this approach is successful it could lead to significantly less expensive
ceramic coatings and composites. ***
