A symposium will be held at the Cornell University campus May 14-15, 2012. The
focus of the meeting covers a range of topics in current hydrologic sciences
(Turbulence in ABL, atmospheric radiation, evaporation, erosion, open channels,
instability and fluid mechanics; infiltration, Boussinesq and runoff
relationships, and hysteresis and thermodynamics) suggested by two leaders in
the field , Wilfried Brutsaert and Yves Parlange. The symposium will include 30
students as well as videotaping of presentations and planning for a special
issue of Water Resources Research. The gathering of individuals around these
research themes represents a solid research contribution to advance the state of
the field.
