This project provides participant support for the 36th Conference on Stochastic
Processes and their Applications (SPA) to be held July 29- August 2, 2013 at the
University Colorado Boulder. Organized under the auspices of the Bernoulli
Society and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, SPA has emerged as the
premier international forum for the dissemination of new results in probability
and random processes.

As with past SPAs, the Boulder meeting will feature a wide range of topics,
bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers. In addition to
plenary talks which include the most prestigious named lectures of the
probability calendar, the Boulder meeting will be organized around a large
number of shorter contributed talks. This provides a platform for young
probabilists and affiliated researchers to present their work alongside the key
figures of the field. To facilitate these important exchanges, travel support
for Ph.D. students, postdocs, and new faculty, particularly for women and
underrepresented minorities, represents a large portion of the project.

In addition to the scientific program the Boulder meeting will feature a series
of round table discussions aimed at supporting new researchers to the field.
