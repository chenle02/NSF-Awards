This award supports the analysis of calcareous nannofossil assemblages from high
quality DSDP/ODP drill cores from the South Atlantic to help reconstruct the
thermal gradient of surface waters of that basin for the Maestrichtian to
Miocene time interval (74 to 5 million years ago). The investigation will
characterize major surface water masses and infer from biological gradients
latitudinal thermal gradients that can be compared against those derived
independently from stable isotope techniques. This should provide new insights
into the thermal structure of the oceans through time. Such data have important
implications for studies that attempt to reconstruct changes in the global heat
budget and the deterioration of Cenozoic climates that accompanied the
progressive isolation of the Antarctic continent. The study will record in
detail latitudinal shifts in surface water masses through time as a means of
tracing steps in the deterioration of global climates. //
