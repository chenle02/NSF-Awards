Of the roughly 7,000 languages spoken in the world today, it is estimated that
at least half will cease to be spoken within the next 100 years. Many of these
languages are so far entirely undocumented, meaning that when they fall out of
use no record of them will remain, and the knowledge they encode will be
irrevocably lost. One such language is Wamesa, currently spoken by approximately
8,000 people in the province of West Papua, Indonesia. The goal of this project
is to document Wamesa, creating a lasting record of the language. Ms. Gasser
will spend seven months in Indonesia working with native speakers of the
language and recording stories, conversations, and elicited texts. The result
will be a reference grammar of the language, a transcribed corpus of recorded
texts, and a small Wamesa/English/Indonesian dictionary. The reference grammar
will also be submitted as the doctoral dissertation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work will be of value to linguistics and to the Wamesa people. Though Wamesa has
more speakers than many neighboring languages, very little research has been
done on it. This means that Wamesa is not informing linguistic theories; any
insights it might provide are currently unavailable to science. Wamesa children
growing up in cities communicate primarily in Indonesian, putting the future of
Wamesa in jeopardy. It is important to begin work now while the speech community
is still vital enough to provide a thorough account of the language and its
structures. The dictionary and collection of recordings produced by this project
will be valuable to the Wamesa community as they work to preserve their
traditional language and culture. Finally, this project will provide linguistic
training to local college students so that they may undertake the documentation,
analysis, and preservation of the many other endangered languages of Papua.
