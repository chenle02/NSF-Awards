This proposal seeks to use a relatively new and highly versatile analytical
technique (Tandem Mass Spectrometry) to separate and identify individual
components of complex mixtures in a bioreactor. The proposed methodology also
seeks to utilize a capillary membrane interface for sample transport and
selective permeation of analytes. Preliminary results using a triple quadrupole
instrument show that the proposed methodology has the sensitivity to allow
identification of trace amounts of previously unsuspected intermediates in whole
(unfiltered) fermentation broths. Sensors for monitoring, controlling and
optimizing bioprocesses is a strong need of the biotechnology field and this
proposal provides a means of addressing this need. This proposal is also an
excellent example of the type of cross-disciplinary project we wish to see in
the Engineering Directorate's Biotechnology Program. The Principal Investigators
are considered to be well qualified to carry out the proposed research.
