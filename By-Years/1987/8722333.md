The Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering and Technology
(FCCSET) is currently completing a report to Congress that is expected to
propose the establishment network to serve the scientific community. FCCSET has
asked the National Research Council (NCR), through its Computer Science and
Technology Board (CSTB) to: (1) comment on the utility of such a capability to
the U.S. Research Community; (2) review the technical feasibility of plan; (3)
review existing computer forecasts as they might affect the network service as
it become available. Gordon Bell, Director of Computer and Information Sience
and Engineering at the National Science Foundation, submitted a letter to the
NCR dated July 31, 1987 on behalf of FCCSET to Formalize this request. CSTB
proposes to conduct a 5-month review of the FCCSET plan, culminating in a
succinct report that summarized current knowledge about the three stated
issues.//
