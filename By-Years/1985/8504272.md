Zinc oxide varistors are commercially important discrete components used for
surge protection of electronic circuits and electric machinery. The presence of
deep electron traps within the zinc oxide grains could influence the response
time by acting as one of the factors which might affect the rate at which the
depletion zones surrounding the grain boundaries narrow prior to breakdown.
Admittance spectroscopy will be used to characterize trap energy, density,
emission rate, and capture cross section on commercial and specially fabricated
varistors. The information will be correlated with I-V properties and voltage
response times to meet the objective and, additionally, provide an extended
understanding of electronic ceramics in general.
