Colorado College has a very strong emphasis on field experience, an emphasis
which is encouraged by a unique teaching environment and curriculum. Faculty and
students participate in only one course at a time (the Block Plan) allowing a
great deal of freedom in scheduling lectures, laboratories and field studies.
Through the acquisition of geophysical equipment for this project (gravity
meter, seismometer, magnetomer, resistivity meter), the Geology Department is
establishing a field-based geophysics course to round out a strong and growing
program and to complement the theoretical course currently offered. In addition,
the equipment is being used in introductory and upper-level geology and physics
classes for field projects to illustrate theoretical principles. Developing an
understanding of the main aspects of geophysical exploration--gravity, seismics,
magnetics, electrical--enhances student understanding of the fundamentals of
each of the approaches to exploration. This project will provide a significant
advance in the geophysics offerings available and will result in improvements in
undergraduate instruction in physics and geology.
