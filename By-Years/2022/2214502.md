This planning proposal, submitted by Regents of the University of Idaho is
directed to support the coordination and planning for identification of existing
research infrastructure, additional future capacity and infrastructure needs, a
cogent logic model, and a robust collaboration plan that are necessary to
formulate a meritorious RII Track-1 project on energy water security and
resilience. The approved research topic is directly aligned with three of
Idahoâ€™s high impact research areas from the Science and Technology Plan: Energy
Systems, Natural Resource Utilization and Conservation, Systems Engineering and
Cybersecurity.This request for a planning grant is expected to lead to a
meritorious project that enhances and develops transformative science in energy-
water security and resilience. The team has planned a series of meetings and/or
workshops in order to address the different activities involved in the planning
of the Track-1 proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
