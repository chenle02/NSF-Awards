The principal investigator will study various aspects of Lagrangian
submanifolds in symplectic geometry. This will involve an analysis of the
relationship between symplectic structures and the Riemannian structure of
Kahler manifolds. This investigation will include, as a model case, the study of
minimal submanifolds and their mean curvature evolutions. Symplectic geometry
has a long history of success as a framework in which difficult questions in
mechanics can be formulated and solved. The principal investigator will use
connections between this theory and complex Kahler manifolds especially as
related to minimal submanifolds. Such surfaces are modeled by soap films and
have been the objects of intense mathematical research in recent years.
