This research involves the investigation of the asymptotic properties of
sequences of random variables with various types of dependence. By relating weak
dependent sequences to semiamarts and demimartingales we shall clarify some
aspects of the almost sure convergence of these sequences. Other part of this
research will study two estimators of the variance of the sample mean based on
dependent data. These estimators are suggested by blocking techniques and robust
statistical procedures such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. The estimators
can be used as selfnormalizers in the Central Limit Theorem. One of the main
problems of statistics is to provide interval estimates for some unknown
parameters. These confidence intervals are constructed based on an estimator of
the parameter and an error given by the variability of this estimator. The
purpose of this research is to study this problem in the case when the data is
dependent.
