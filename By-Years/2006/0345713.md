This research program will establish the broad-based utility of a series of
group 2 organometallic compounds as reagents to perform a variety of
synthetically important organic transformations. Magnesium bisamides will be
developed as selective bases for enantioselective deprotonation reactions.
Magnesium reagents will be explored which effect asymmetric induction in
addition reactions to enolate anions and across carbonyls, in enantioselective
reductions, and in asymmetric Wittig-type reactions. The related chemistry of
homochiral heavier group 2 analogs (Ca, Ba, Sr) will also be studied. Reactivity
studies will be complemented with structural and theoretical analyses.

With this new award, the Organic and Macomolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the work of Professor Kenneth W. Henderson, of the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame. Professor Henderson
is exploring the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of unusual compounds
containing magnesium, calcium, barium, and strontium. These compounds offer
promise for effecting highly selective organic chemical transformations while
providing a number of practical advantages over more traditional reagents,
including low toxicity, low cost, and effective function without the need for
specialzied reaction conditions.
