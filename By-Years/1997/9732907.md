Basic research in theoretical computer science is studied. Fundamental
questions, about the analysis of algorithms and complexity theory are
researched. This seminar series focuses on inviting distinguished outside
speakers who are able to give an overview of a research area to first and second
year graduate students. It is hoped that the interaction between graduate
students, researchers in the DC metropolitan area, and outside visitors will be
very productive and useful in stimulating new research and facilitating new
collaborations. Students will also get an opportunity to present their work to
the faculty. A special effort will be made to involve honors undergraduate
students in this endeavor.
