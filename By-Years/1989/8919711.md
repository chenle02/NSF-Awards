Considerable research on the mother-infant bond has proceeded on the assumption
that mothers' facial expression is the principal medium of communication. Cohn
and Moore hypothesize a much stronger role for vocal interaction; if this is
true, then previous studies might seriously underestimate the extent to which
infants are responsive to their mothers' behavior. The research will study the
frequency and patterning of mothers' speech, to determine the relationship of
these variables to the intensity of mothers' affective behaviors and infants'
attention. In attention, the research will seek to determine if specific
mothers' vocalizations influence specific infant behaviors. Finally,
developmental shifts in vocal-vs-facial influence will be studied. This research
promises to throw a powerful light on the mysteries surrounding the bonding of
mothers and their infants, and ultimately on the factors that influence crucial
developmental processes in infancy.
