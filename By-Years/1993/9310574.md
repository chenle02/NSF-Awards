9310574 Bender As part of the U.S.JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study effort to
understand how physical forcing by the regional monsoons affects marine primary
production and the regional carbon budget, the PI will carry out shipboard
incubations of seawater samples to estimate seasonal photosynthetic production
rates of molecular oxygen. Because the oxygen and organic carbon produced during
photosynthesis are in a fixed proportion, these measurements will provide
indirect measurements of primary production by making direct measurements of
carbon. Similar shipboard laboratory studies will be carried out at different
light levels to derive quantitative relationships that would then permit the
estimation of in situ water column production rates from bio-optical data.
Additionally, in order to calculate how much of the oxygen escapes to the
atmosphere, the PI plans to make frequent measurements of dissolved oxygen and
argon (a non-reactive gas that can be used as a mixing tracer) in the upper
wind-mixed water column along the cruise track. The PI expects these studies to
provide major insights into the oxygen and carbon dynamics of the Arabian Sea
region and that these insights will benefit our understanding of the global
carbon cycle. ***
