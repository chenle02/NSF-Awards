A novel approach to a time-based analysis of landslide hazards founded on the
slope stability response to precipitation and infiltration will be developed.
Historical climate records and infiltration-induced groundwater response will be
linked with geotechnical stability analyses to provide a probabilistic
assessment of landslide hazard as a function of time. A case study will be
conducted to test and evaluate the overall approach and to indicate critical
areas for follow-up and future research.
