Support is requested for a CAREER development plan at Penn State University
which synergistically integrates research and education activities in the area
of atmospheric aeronomy and electrodynamics, and space plasma physics. The PI
and his undergraduate and graduate students will develop a dynamic research
program at Penn State directed on understanding of the recently discovered large
scale luminous phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere above active thunderstorm
systems. The proposed research project will provide answers to critical
questions concerning large scale energetic effects of lighting discharges on the
upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere and implications of the associated
energy depositions for the thermal and chemical balance of these regions.
Specific educational activities of the proposed CAREER plan include development
of a multi-disciplinary computer experiment laboratory for undergraduate and
graduate students at Penn State majoring in Electrical Engineering, Aerospace
Engineering and Nuclear Engineering, incorporation of the elements of proposed
research in undergraduate education, including active involvement of
undergraduate students in proposed research activities during summer time
periods, and providing active mentoring and training for undergraduate and
graduate students.
