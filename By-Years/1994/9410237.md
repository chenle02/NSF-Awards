This research pursues the development of a formal semantics for real
implementations of functional languages, modeling sharing and cycles, and for
parallel functional languages with state. Traditionally both the operational
semantics and the compilation process of functional languages are given by
translating them to either the lambda-calculus, combinatory logic or abstract
reduction systems. However, these computational models do not capture sharing
and direct recursion, and thus are inadequate for reasoning about compiler
issues and implementations. This research develops a sound theory for cyclic
structures involving lambda abstraction. The need for new mathematical
foundations arises when state is introduced in functional languages. Previous
theories apply only to languages with sequential semantics. This research seeks
to provide a framework for reasoning about state in a parallel setting by
extending the above graph calculus.
