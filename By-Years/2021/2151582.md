The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance clinical outcomes for patients with
a traumatic or palliative peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In the U.S., 20 million
people suffer from PNIs, with a high prevalence among young individuals and a
total economic cost to society in excess of $150 billion per year. Acute PNIs
account for more than 500,000 annual surgical procedures in the U.S and
frequently result in permanent disability. This project develops a platform
technology with the potential to address many types of
PNI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will create a novel nerve graft/conduit for nerve gap injury repair and
a nerve cap. The project goal is to advance a solution to improve the nerve
functional outcome while still reducing the tension across the repair. It
provides a tissue-like matrix that allows aligned nerve growth out of the free
nerve ending. The technology is derived from decellularized porcine nerve tissue
and maintains native structural and functional proteins, providing an ideal
environment for nerve repair and regeneration. This project conducts in-vivo
studies, sterilization demonstrations, and lyophilization. Supply chain
security, packaging development, and tooling will be developed in preparation
for commercial launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
