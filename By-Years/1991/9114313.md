The overall objective of the research is to understand better and to make more
predictable the expansion of concrete due to alkali- silica reaction. The work
consists of three broad tasks: 1) to develop a new test method, similar to ASTM
C441, to measure the potential reactivity of portland cement in combination with
alkali- reactive siliceous aggregate; 2) to develop a performance specification
for the potential reactivity of portland cement in combination with alkali-
reactive siliceous aggregate for proposal as an alterative to optional
specification on alkali content currently included in C150; and 3) to develop a
model that describes the kinetics of expansion due to alkali-silica reaction,
aimed at improving our understanding of the factors that control expansion and
at improving the estimation of ultimate expansion from short-term, accelerated
tests.
