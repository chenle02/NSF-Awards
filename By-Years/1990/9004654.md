Hurricane Hugo devastated beachfront communities from Charleston to Myrtle
Beach destroying hundreds of shorefront structures. Reconstruction has already
begun under the 1988 Beachfront Management Act and Hugo has provided an early
test for some of the buildings which were located in this dead zone but were
destroyed by the hurricane beyond repair will be tested. The study will follow
and analyze the decisionmaking process and the implementation of the retreat
from the shoreline policy at the private and public, local, state and federal
levels. The evaluation of the effectiveness and viability of these rebuilding
restrictions will be of benefit to researchers, administrators, insurers and
other professionals interested in decreasing the vulnerability of people and
property located in the coastal areas of the United States.
