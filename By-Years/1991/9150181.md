The Minnesota Mathematics Mobilization, in cooperation with the Minnesota High
Technology Council, plans a three-year effort by the education and business
communities to advocate systemic changes to help implement national standards
for mathematics in Minnesota schools and colleges. The focus will be on higher
education and its links to school mathematics, especially in the pre-service and
in-service areas. The proposed activities include conferences and workshops,
regional meetings, policy summit meetings, and a newsletter. The proposal builds
on the existing 6,000 member Mobilization which was established through a
previous NSF grant. Cost sharing is 73% of the NSF contribution to the project.
