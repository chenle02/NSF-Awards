The objective of the project is to develop and expand the application of
nonlinear optics to image processing, optical computing, and beam control, using
both theoretical and an experimental approach. In traditional nonlinear optics
studies, a small number of beams are caused to couple to each other, or a single
beam is self-modified, by the nonlinear dependence of the electric polarization
density on the optical electric field. It has been found more recently that
certain of these effects can couple very large numbers of beams or beam
components, and can thereby perform such tasks as image correlation, image
phase-conjugation, and image-frequency conversion in "real time:, i.e., on
nanosecond or even picosecond time scales. The investigators have already
introduced phase-conjugation of complex optical images by four-wave mixing, and
especially photorefractive materials to enable phase-conjugation at low
(milliwatt) power levels. In this work they propose to pursue experimental and
theoretical studies in three areas growing out of the previous and ongoing
research. These are: (1) Understanding and characterization of nonlinear optical
materials, (2) Development of new nonlinear materials, and (3) Development of
nonlinear image processing devices, algorithms, and architectures.
