Pontifical College Josephinum will use this grant to connect its Columbus, OH
campus to the Internet using a OARnet, an Ohio based ISP. Pontifical College
Josephinum is a private, Roman Catholic seminary which offers six bachelor
programs and three masters degree programs with an enrollment of approximately
130 students. The college needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project
for two years.
