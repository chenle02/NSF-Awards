The Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;will
purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated&lt;br/&gt;to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;The equipment will be used for
computational and&lt;br/&gt;visualization aspects of the research in the
following&lt;br/&gt;projects: 1) Functional Data Analysis for Modeling
Human&lt;br/&gt;Motion; 2) Spatial Modeling with Applications to
Integrated&lt;br/&gt;Circuit Fabrication and Reconstruction of Color
Images;&lt;br/&gt;3) Bioinformatics; 4) Inference in Dynamic
Treatment&lt;br/&gt;Regimes; and 5) Design of Experiments. The high-
speed&lt;br/&gt;equipment will consist of a 16-node Linux cluster
connected&lt;br/&gt;with a high-throughput Ethernet switch and two high-
end&lt;br/&gt;workstations with advanced graphics capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;
