The investigator will study differential equations with symmetry and
applications to solid mechanics. The applications involve geometrically exact
formulations of nonlinearly elastic and viscoelastic solids and structures. The
goals of the work are to detect new phenomena and to further develop and exploit
the connection between symmetry and nodal properties of solutions of elliptic
equations, particularly in the context of global bifurcation and continuation
problems. The way that structures bend can be described mathematically as the
solution of equations describing the structure. Often the bending depends on a
parameter, for instance the load on the structure, If as the load varies the
structure can bend in different ways for the same load, then the solutions are
said to bifurcate at that value of the load. Global descriptions of the
bifurcations are generally hard to get, but are very valuable. When the
structure is symmetric, those symmetries can be used to get a better grip on the
global behavior. Applications arise not only in analysing structures but also in
studying the behavior of materials themselves.
