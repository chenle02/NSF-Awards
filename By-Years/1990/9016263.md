We propose to study the design, fabrication, and characterization of the 8-12 u
long wavelength infrared (LWIR) sensing element of image sensor cell, which is
composed of one GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW) photoconductor and three
modulation doped field effect transistor (MODFET) switches, controlling the
cell's charging, output, and reset, respectively. The critical issue is how to
make the mesa structures of the MOW photoconductor and the planar structures of
the MODFET compatible. BAsed on our new invention of the integration of MQW
photocondutor and FET structures, the patent of which is being applied, the
design and fabrication procedure of a monolithically integrated image sensor
cell is proposed. The success of the project is crucial for the development of
the monolithically integrated GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well imager, which is
a two dimensional focal plane array of sensor cells combined with the signal
readout circuits. The development of the monolithic long wavelength IR multiple
quantum well image sensor represents an important goal, not only in the thermal
imaging technology, but also int he innovative application of superlattices.
