9526367 Huband The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), its Deans
Council, and the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) seek to
contribute to defining the future of engineering education and practice by
convening an International Congress which will address the relevant major issues
in the context of a changed world where globalization of engineering is rapidly
occurring, and where information technology has changed the education and
practice of engineering. This International Congress to be held in Washington,
DC in June 1996 will examine engineering education in the global context, will
serve as a unique forum for cross cultural information sharing, and will foster
a spirit of international cooperation among the world's engineers, engineering
educators, and scientists. ***
