The electric power grid, a cyber-physical system (CPS), faces an alarmingly high
risk of catastrophic damage from cyber-attacks. However, modeling cyber-attacks,
evaluating consequences, and developing appropriate countermeasures require a
detailed, realistic, and tractable model of electric power CPS operations. The
primary barrier is the lack of access to models for the complex legacy
proprietary systems upon which the electric power grid has relied for decades.
This project aims to overcome these challenges with the development of an
attack-verifying (verifiable) software framework that will capture the electric
power system operations in adequate detail. Cyber threats will be verified using
this framework through a combination of sound theoretical methods and an open-
source commercial simulation engine accessible via a unique transition to
practice (TTP) option. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on four
fundamental and related thrusts: (i) identifying classes of cyber-attacks with
quantifiable physical consequences and developing detection-based
countermeasures; (ii) identifying communication attacks on distributed grid
operations and developing information-sharing countermeasures; (iii) developing
a verifiable software framework that models the spatio-temporal operations of
the electric grid in tandem with thrusts (i) and (ii) to verify attack models,
evaluate countermeasures, and develop new resiliency protocols; and (iv) a TTP
option, in collaboration with industry-leading experts from IncSys and
PowerData, to develop commercial grade open source power simulation software
packages to integrate and test the attacks and countermeasures of Thrusts (i)
through (iii) as well as develop workforce training curriculum for North
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) certification. This research also
includes engagement with K-12 students via the Arizona Science Laboratory
program.
