This research investigated methodologies and efficient algorithms for
performance-driven layout design and logic synthesis of high-speed, high-
complexity VLSI systems. The research on performance-driven layout focuses on
interconnect design process, including the development of accurate interconnect
models which enable efficient layout optimization algorithms, efficient
algorithms for circuit partitioning and clustering , interconnect-driven
floorplan and placement, interconnect topology design with buffer insertin,
simultaneous device and interconnect sizing, and clock layout optimization. The
research on performance-driven logic synthesis mainly focus on synthesis and
mapping for field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs), including optimal or near-
optimal algorithms for structural and functional gate decomposition, minimum-
delay technology mapping trade-off of delay and area in technology mapping,
combined retiming, technology mapping, and resynthesis for clock period
minimization, and automatic pipelining.
