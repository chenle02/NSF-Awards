Several areas of research in organosilicon, organoaluminum, and organoboron
chemistry will be pursued, which include: (1) Gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry
to prepare and study the reactivity and thermochemistry of a number of low-,
normal-, and high-valent silicon, aluminum, and boron containing anions. Triple
quadrupole collisionally-induced dissociation (CID) will be used to study
thermochemical parameters. (2) Periodic Table relationships and substituent
effects of these anions will be investigated. (3) Relationships between the
anions and their corresponding neutrals, which are in general species of
enhanced reactivity and of theoretical interest, will be pursued. (4) Condensed-
phase studies will be continued to prepare silicon-containing cages in order to
probe inside-outside substituent effects and to generate silicon- carbon bonds
from organoboranes. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
the continuing work of Professor Robert Damrauer at the University of Colorado
at Denver. The major thrust of the research will be a study of molecules
containing silicon, aluminum, and boron in the gas-phase. The chemistry,
thermochemistry, and acidity of these highly reactive species will be
determined. Comparisons of these properties will be made between the silicon,
aluminum, and boron molecules, based on the Periodic Table of elemental
properties. These studies will shed light on technical aspects of the
manufacture of electronic components. Another aspect of the research will be
directed to the study of silicon-containing cage molecules and the generation of
silicon-carbon bonds in the condensed-phase.
