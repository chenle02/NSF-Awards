This proposal is to provide travel assistance for U.S. students and young
investigators to participate in the Tenth International Conference on Permafrost
(TICOP) in Salekhard, Russia. TICOP will be a rare opportunity for many of the
200 members of the Permafrost Young Researchers Network to meet and develop
their own plans for this new generation of permafrost researchers. By sending
young researchers to Russia, the PI hopes to open doors for a whole new
generation or researchers to begin conducting research in Russia and to develop
personal knowledge and personal contacts with researchers abroad, which can be
later instrumental to the success of a research program.
