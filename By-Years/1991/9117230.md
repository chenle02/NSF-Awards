Fouling occurs in most heat exchangers and the associated degradation of
performance is of considerable economical importance. It has plagued industry
for years and remains poorly understood and resolved. The proposal is a
continuation of current NSF funded research, during which interesting results
have been obtained. The proposed research will include fundamental studies on
solubility and polymerization, effect of salt ions on attachments of silica
scale, transient measurement of fouling thermal resistance, and analytical
modelling of solubility and silica scale formation. Applied topics to be
investigated will include mitigation of fouling by magnetic devices and
ozonation.
