The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a device to treat chronic lymphatic system failure (lymphedema).
An estimated 10 million Americans are affected by lymphedema while two-thirds of
all cases are cancer-related. Lymphedema is a chronic condition that prevails
throughout the patientâ€™s lifetime, and passive treatment methods, such as
compression devices, are routinely used to treat the condition. However,
currently patient compliance is a problem. The proposed device is intended only
to be worn for a short period of time unlike compression stockings and is
expected to improve patient compliance and satisfaction. Current sequential
compression devices are reported to be uncomfortable, which also results in
reduced patient compliance. The ergonomic design of the proposed device may be
more comfortable, which is expected to result in increased patient
compliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of a technology to treat lymphedema. The proposed device is designed
to create 20,000 compressions per minute, whereas the currently marketed
sequential compression device only creates 1 compression per minute. The core
technology produces sound waves in a novel pattern of microcurrents to move
fluid. The sound wave technology may be used to treat lymphedema, edema,
fibrosis, fibromyalgia, and venous insufficiency in various tissues that include
lymph, nervous, connective, and muscular tissue. This device has been tested in
silico and data support the proposed mechanism of action, and the therapeutic
effects have proven successful in a human model. The goal is improved lymphatic
return to reduce the girth of the limb and improve function thereby alleviating
symptoms of lymphedema.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
