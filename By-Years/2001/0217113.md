Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 02-17113&lt;br/&gt;The History and Philosophy of Science
-- Advancing U.S. Interests in International Activities&lt;br/&gt;Laura Sheahan,
National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
supports the operation of the U.S. National Committee for the International
Union of the History and Philosophy of Science (USNC/IUHPS). The USNC represents
the United States in the International Council for Science (ICSU) -- an
international union. This support is designed support effective U.S.
participation and strong leadership in the international union in response to
expanding needs in international science and technology through the efforts of
volunteer members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this USNC are to: 1)
Assure that membership privileges and obligations to the international union are
fulfilled and that the U.S. community is appropriately and fully represented in
international congresses; 2) Serve as neutral fora where representatives of
multiple U.S. societies and government agencies can meet to discuss trends in
their disciplines; 3) Work with other USNCs in the network to foster
interdisciplinary projects; 4) Serve as conduits of communication between the
ICSU family and the professional societies and between ICSU and individual
scientists; and 5) Serve as incubators of ideas that are then brought to the
attention of professional societies, NRC disciplinary boards or commissions, and
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This specific proposal provides funds for two years
for the support staff from the National Academy of Sciences, primarily to allow
for the regular meetings of the volunteer members of the USNC , and in support
of USNC activities related to the international activities of the IUHPS and
ICSU. &lt;br/&gt;
