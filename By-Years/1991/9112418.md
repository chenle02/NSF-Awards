An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
This grant is concerned with theoretical modeling of the low latitude boundary
layer (LLBL) and its mappings and electrical coupling to the dayside ionosphere.
The primary objectives are to advance current understanding of (i) the field
line mapping between the LLBL and the ionosphere, and (ii) the generation and
distribution of the dayside region 1 currents and the associated convection and
particle precipitation.
