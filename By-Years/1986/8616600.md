A U.S.-Asia Conference on "Engineering for Mitigating Natural Hazards Damage"
will be held in BAngkok, Thailand, on December 14-18, 1987. The purpose for
convening this meeting is to provide an open forum for intensive exchange of
information, discussions, and sharing experiences in this field of research and
professional practice between the U.S. and several Asian countries; and to
identify problems of mutual interest and areas for cooperative research.
Although there are many types of natural hazards, the focus of the conference
will be on: extreme winds, floods, draughts, earthquakes, and various ground
failures. The program will include the presentation of keynote speeches, special
lectures, papers, panel discussions, and a field trip. The proceedings and a
final report will be published and disseminated internationally.
