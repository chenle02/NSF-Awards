A scientific computing facility for students majoring in mathematics, physics
and chemistry is being developed. The facility provides a computing environment
sufficiently powerful and versatile to be useful in many technical courses
without being tied to any one course. Prospective majors are being taught the
required computational skills during their sophomore year, using examples taken
from concurrent course work. Following the introductory course, all instructors
are able to assume that every student can access and use a range of
computational tools. This common background facilitates appropriate use of
computers in the three disciplines.
