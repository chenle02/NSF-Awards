The investigators seek support to continue analysis of a project that has merged
information from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)
with the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY). The LSAY is a longitudinal
study that concentrates on the high school experience for learning mathematics
and science of a national sample of students from public high schools. This
proposal would concentrate on the learning of science by analyzing the content
of textbooks used by the students during their high school years. These
textbooks have been identified and coded according to a framework that permits
correlation of exposure to curriculum with other factors in the student's
educational experiences. The purpose of this project is to identify and model
the primary factors associated with U.S. student achievement in science.
