9451356 Monce This project will replace the ion accelerator at Connecticut
College and enhance the associated instructional activities. The new accelerator
will enable the revitalization of a senior-level experimental physics course,
permit accelerator-based experiments to be introduced into the sophomore-junior
laboratories, and find applications in introductory physics as well. The
accelerator will also enhance the opportunities for student research projects by
allowing experiments in a wider energy range and using a greater variety of
beams, as well as opening up new areas of inquiry such as surface physics.
Finally, the new accelerator will allow us to engage in interdisciplinary work
with anthropology and biology in the x-ray analysis of materials.
