This award supports a planning visit by the Directors of the Institute for
Environmental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Irving M.
Shapiro and Professor Robert Giegengack, to the University of Cape Town, South
Africa. The purpose of the visit is to discuss the establishment of a Center for
Environmental Studies at the university, which would collaborate with other
universities and environmental research organizations in South Africa. The
proposed center would focus on the identification and resolution of
environmental problems that affect the social and material development of
Africa. By linking students, faculty, research scientists, and communities in
common studies, the center will promote multidisciplinary analysis of
environmental problems and the dissemination of knowledge throughout the
country. It is hoped that the center will develop an Africa-centered and world-
recognized capacity for postgraduate studies of the environment that will
stimulate a `call to action` for effective resource management in pursuit of
sustainable development.
