9521074 Brett A Directory Services testbed based on the WHOIS++ protocol, is
proposeed for locating people and resources on the Internet. WHOIS++ provides a
highly flexible client/server environment that allows a user to search across
multiple distributed databases located on multiple servers, without prior
knowledge of the architecture of the database or the network location of the
desired information. This project proposes to deploy a medium-scale (&gt;450,000
entries) WHOIS++ database distributed across at least 13 servers (which contain
the actual directory data base entries), and utilizing at least six centroids
(data bases of indexes which point to the individual servers) in a three-level
mesh (centroids which point to lower-level centroids which, in turn, point to
the lowest level of centroids which point to the actual data base servers). In
addition, this project proposes to develop a widely-usable access method based
on clients for the World Wide Web (e.g., Netscape or Mosaic), create interface
modules to allow the use of a number of different database technologies to store
the WHOIS++ data, determine and implement the security and privacy issues likely
to be required for use in the commercial sector, and determine whether the
protocol will scale to serve the Internet at large.
