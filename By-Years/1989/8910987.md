The long-range objective of this project is to understand how subpopulations of
neural crest cells differentiate into specific types of mature neurons during
embryonic development. What genetic and other factors are at work? Dr. Barald
and her coworkers have identified subpopulations of cells in the neural crest of
chick and quail embryos with different biochemical properties. They have
developed markers for these different subpopulations and techniques for
separating these cell types while keeping them alive. They can now grow these
subpopulations in culture and characterize their responses to a variety of
regulatory factors as well as to examine the interaction of various genes
important in cellular differentiation. By employing these methods, Dr. Barald's
group will be able to answer the following questions: When does a neuronal
population that is derived from the neural crest become determined, and
therefore segregated from other cells in the crest lineage? Is the expression of
the determined state plastic? Can it be modified by environmental cues in vivo
or in vitro?
