The Thames Science Center collaborative with the resources of theSmithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, Wesleyan University andthe National Air and Space
Museum will design and develop theproject, "Shoot For the Moon." This science
education projectwill capitalize on the attraction, familiarity and proximity
ofthe moon using it as a basis to enrich and supplement the eightand ninth grade
physical science curriculum. Ten classroomunits, complimentary experiments and
demonstrations will bedeveloped. "Moonwatch" software and audio visual
materials,including an instructional videotape and a multi.imagepresentation
will accompany the units. Sixteen teachers and museum educators will participate
in thetraining, evaluation and testing as the project is integratedinto the
curriculum of twelve schools and four museums. Theproject is designed to be
replicated in schools and sciencecenters in different geographical locations
nationally. The site for development and testing will be the Thames
ScienceCenter, a regional science museum in eastern Connecticut. Thescience
center offers formal science enrichment programs andtours for students and
teacher professional development programsthroughout the region.
