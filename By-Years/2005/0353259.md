The SGER proposal "Explorative Study: Design for Resiliency" describes design
and analysis work targeted to the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is a
core underpinning service and protocol enabling name-to-address mappings for the
Internet. Previous work in the community combined with recent measurements and
analysis by the author reveal a number of weaknesses in DNS as it is deployed
and configured by authoritative zones. These weaknesses stem from both an
original design that considered only physical errors in the infrastructure, and
a set of inefficiencies and breakage resulting directly from misconfiguration
and human error. This study will explore a re-design of DNS based on principles
of resiliency in the protocol. The new design will be analyzed comparatively to
today's existing system and known vulnerabilities will be applied in the
assessment. An amendment to the SGER proposal applies recent DNS measurement and
analysis to the addition of several DNS-specific tools that provide automated
checking for DNS configuration problems through active measurement, zone file
checks and DNS protocol enhancement.
