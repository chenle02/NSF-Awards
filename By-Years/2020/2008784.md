The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become commonplace in many
applications nowadays. Like many other technologies, UAVs brings comfort and
efficiency to the current practice in many applications while posing threats and
safety issues. This project will advance the frontier of science in developing
safer and more reliable aerial monitoring platforms while offering privacy and
safety. Towards this goal, this project aims to make accurate predictions in a
network of unmanned aerial vehicles, by using inverse learning techniques, so as
to enable safer and more efficient operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A smart
observation system will be developed to constantly monitor the behavior of
autonomous agents to identify suspicious activities by measuring their deviation
from the most rational behavior under given conditions. The proposed research
includes several steps: (i) to develop mechanisms to simulate the target node's
perception of its surrounding environment (i.e., seeing the word from the
target's eyes) using deep learning methods, (ii) to predict its rational
behavior(s) under given conditions and available resources by modeling the
target's decision making procedure through inverse learning (reading the
target's brain), and (iii) to measure the level of trust by detecting rare but
critical episodes of deviating from its expected rational behavior. In
particular, the mobility of UAVs and their networking activities will be
investigated as two important scenarios of malicious activities. This project is
expected to result in developing new tools and algorithms for the action
analysis of smart nodes that will be shared with the research
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
