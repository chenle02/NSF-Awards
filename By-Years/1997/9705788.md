This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports work by Professor William DeW. Horrocks of the Pennsylvania State
University. The research is aimed toward: 1) answering fundamental question
regarding the formation of lanthanide chelate complexes, which are important in
imaging internal biological structures by magnetic resonance techniques, 2)
developing a new supramolecular chemistry of lanthanide ions in aqueous
solution, and 3) exploiting a recently discovered photosensitized emission
phenomenon in the near infrared to develop chemosensors. The chemistry and
luminescence of lanthanide complexes will be investigated in order to better
understand present agents used to affect proton relaxation times for imaging
purposes and to develop new chemistry aimed toward improving these agents. A new
type of complex exhibiting a stable low energy (near infrared) emission will be
explored for chemosensor and other applications. New large molecular structures
composed of lanthanide subunits will be prepared in water.
