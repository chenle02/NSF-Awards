This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will aid in purchasing a Reflectron Matrix-Assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer for the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. The research studies to be performed
include the following: (1) Protein Design and Protein Refolding; (2) Analysis of
Oligosaccharides and Glycopeptides with a MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer; (3)
Polymeric Carbohydrate Inhibitors; (4) Applications of MALDI- TOF Mass
Spectrometry in Gene Sequencing; (5) Analysis of Peptides with a Reflectron
MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer; (6) Polymer Interfaces and Dynamics; and (7)
Lateral Diffusion of Vinyl Polymers at the A/W Interface and of Star Polymer at
the Toluene/Water Interface. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the
technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid
molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
