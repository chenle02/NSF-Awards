The proposed research addresses inverse, ill-posed optimum design and parameter
estimation problems in solidification processing. The major contribution of the
work would be to develop and experimentally verify mathematical and
computational models that provide information for the optimum thermomechanical
design and control of casting processes and utilize experimental data to
accurately evaluate the thermomechanical material state during solidification.
This research will enhance our understanding and may potentially lead to better
design and evaluation of solidification processing.
