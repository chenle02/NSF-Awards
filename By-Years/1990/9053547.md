The Institute for Science Instruction and Study (ISIS) will associate
experienced science teachers from Connecticut (including minority teachers and
teachers of minorities) with research scientists who are working at the
frontiers of knowledge in their fields. Seminars, weekend workshops, field site
visits, summer programs, and mentorships will introduce the teachers to every
aspect of the scientific research process. Since the teachers will be intimately
involved in ongoing scientific work, they will be identified as ISIS Fellows.
Through ISIS, Fellows will learn to interact with the scientific community
personally and intellectually. By experiencing real and recent science, teacher
participants will be scientifically remotivated to acquire an enriched knowledge
of science, technology, and social values. Through the sharing of experiences
with other ISIS Fellows, and interaction with participating scientists, they
will become more skilled and dynamic in their teaching. The result will be
teachers with renewed self-images and increased levels of confidence in their
science-related abilities. ISIS Fellows will form a cadre of scientifically-
informed teachers who will become leaders in their school districts. Their
ability to provide leadership will be enhanced by the guarantee of support from
their school administration and continued access to ISIS resources. An amount
equivalent to 42.6% of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
