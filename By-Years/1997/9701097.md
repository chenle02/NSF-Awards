9701097 Meagher Insects can cause positive and negative selection on flowering
plants through their contrasting roles as pollinators and predators. This
project addresses selection pressures placed on Silene latifolia (white campion)
flowers by moths of the Hadena genus, which are pollinators and seed predators.
The relative importance of Hadena moths as pollinators will be assessed for
white campion growing in its native Spanish environment. Positive effects will
be evaluated by reconstructing pollination events using genetic paternity
analysis. Negative effects will be evaluated by investigating seed predation.
Both positive and negative impacts of moth visitation will be analyzed in
relation to flower size, which is important for moth attraction. Long-term
effects of predation will be investigated by analyzing variation among
populations in flower size in relation to observed current predation rates. This
system provides a rare opportunity to study an interaction between two species
that involves both positive and negative selection. Seed predation is also a
major issue in agricultural systems, where pollination is desirable but the
attraction of seed predators is not.
