Dissertation Improvement Research: Historical Ecology of Terra Preta Vegetation
in the Lower Amazon This project will investigate the extent and ways in which
past and present activities of Amazonian peoples have influenced the vegetation
of Amazonian forests. To do this the project will study the historical ecology
of the people and plants in the Arapiuns River Basin, Brazil. This region is
particularly suited for learning about the human role in shaping a complex and
diverse environment. Species composition, structure, diversity, use, and
management will be compared with control forest plots. The hypothesis is that in
comparison to the surrounding forest, the study sites are distinct in species
composition and structure, have greater potential for crop productivity, have a
greater concentration of useful species, and present evidence of human-induced
enhancement of biodiversity. The results of the research should have important
theoretical implications for both social and ecological sciences and hold
valuable le ssons for the applied fields of conservation, environmental
management, and development.
