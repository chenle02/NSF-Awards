Ionization of atoms and molecules is a ubiquitous process common to all
instances of the interaction of intense laser pulses with matter. It is central
to industrial and defense applications, including strong laser heating of
droplets to produce radiation for next generation semiconductor lithography,
studies of high energy density matter on the National Ignition Facility, and
propagation of high power laser pulses through the
atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the importance of laser-driven
ionization, the process has never before been measured with ultrafast time and
micron space resolution in combination with absolute yield. This information is
essential for both applications and for verification of underlying theoretical
models. In this work, these measurements will be accomplished for the first time
with a special laser-based strobe-like diagnostic capable of achieving these
time and space resolutions.
