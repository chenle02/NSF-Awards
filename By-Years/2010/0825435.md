Fabrication and Thermomechanical Characterization of NiTi Shape Memory Alloy
Nanowires

The research objective of this award is to develop a fundamental understanding
of martensitic phase transformation at nanometer scales and the resulting
thermomechanical behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanowires. SMA nickel-
titanium (NiTi) is a promising functional material for the nano-biotechnology
field, constituting an ideal, biocompatible, nanoscale mechanical transducer.
The research will result in methods to synthesize nanostructured NiTi and to
characterize their resulting shape memory properties. The research approach
includes (1) development of a novel bottom-up approach to synthesize NiTi
nanowires and nanopillars, (2) experimental measurement of the thermomechanical
deformation and shape memory effects of NiTi nanopillars, and (3) use of novel
atomistic simulations to interpret experimental findings and guide experimental
test plans. If successful, the results of the research will provide original
contributions to elucidate the fundamental deformation mechanisms of shape
memory alloy NiTi nanowires. The active coupling of the experimental and
modeling approaches will yield a deeper understanding of martensitic phase
transformation and dislocation nucleation in nanostructures. Another expected
benefit of the research is the development of a new material for nanometer scale
actuation. The ability to invoke mechanical transduction at the nanoscale is
imperative for many emerging nanosystems. Some innovative applications may
include: directed actuation for device self assembly, repeated actuation for
locomotion, pressure induced local fluid flow, generation of local force on
adhered cells or organic molecules, force delivery from a micro-device. The
project will engage graduate researchers, as well as high school students and
teachers.
