This award provides funds to the Neuroscience and Behavior Program at the
University of Massachusetts to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site. This program will take advantage of a unique neuroscience
community that exists in this regional site. Neuroscientists at each of five
colleges in the Amherst area are members of the University of Massachusetts
Neuroscience and Behavior Program (NSB). This program will bring undergraduates
into a laboratory environment where they will become members of a research team.
This approach will facilitate the development of mentor-protege relationships,
which may have a profound and long-lasting affect on career choices. The Program
will consist of an eight-week research project in one of the laboratories. The
laboratory work is designed to introduce students to one of the three specialty
areas in neuroscience represented in the NSB Program; Learning and Behavior
Neuroendocrinology, and Neurodevelopment. In addition to their laboratory work,
students will attend a series of weekly workshops designed to provide an
overview of neuroscience by introducing the knowledge and technology of
laboratories outside the one in which the student works. In this way REU
students will become familiar with a broad segment of neuroscience and thus be
better prepared to choose careers in the neurosciences. The REU program will be
followed up by encouraging work in the home institutions. Qualified
undergraduates will be recruited from the five local institutions as well as
from the national undergraduate population. The program will focus special
attention on recruiting groups that are under-represented in science - women and
minorities. In addition, personal contacts with faculty at a number of
institutions with large minority populations have agreed to help identify
qualified minority undergraduates for the program. Since the REU faculty is made
up of 28% women and minorities, appropriate role models and mentors will be
available for all participants.
