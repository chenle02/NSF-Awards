9603735 Zeh Discoveries in molecular biology are providing growing evidence
that the genomes of species are dynamic entities, constantly evolving, at least
in part, as a result of genetic conflicts within and between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm. Selfish genetic elements, such as cellular endosymbionts,
transposable elements, segregation distorter alleles, maternal effect lethal
alleles, as well as hyperavailable ("junk") DNA and imbalances in genomically-
imprinted genes, can all undermine female fitness by rendering certain
combinations of maternal and paternal genotypes incompatible within the
developing embryo. The development of single-locus minisatellite DNA probes for
the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, in combination with a mammalian-
like viviparous reproductive biology highly amenable to experimentation and
involving the production of large numbers of offspring, makes this species a
model system for investigating the effects of paternal genotypes on female
fitness. Through a research program involving behavioral analyses, breeding
experiments and DNA profiling, this study will test the hypothesis that cellular
and molecular interactions within the female reproductive tract can provide
females with mechanisms for minimizing the risk and/or cost of fertilization by
genetically- incompatible sperm. This genetic incompatibility hypothesis will be
tested against several previously proposed hypotheses to explain how paternal
genotypes can influence female reproductive success, namely the trading-up
hypothesis, the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis and the intrinsic male quality
hypothesis.
