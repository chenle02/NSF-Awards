Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0241425&lt;br/&gt;Hanley/Illinois-
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project, supported in the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the use of hyperthermal polyatomic
ions to form specific organic thin films. Using mass-selected and non-mass
selected ion sources, the growth of thiophenic thin films is examined. The
effects of ion energy, ion fluence, ion-neutral ratio in the source beam, and
ion structure are correlated with properties of the grown thin film. Fundamental
information about how organic films can be grown from characterized ion sources
is useful for the development of organic electronic devices, flexible solar
energy cells, and the understanding of related plasma processing methods.
Professor Hanley and his colleagues at the University of Illinois-Chicago have
developed a unique capability to carry out these studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Hanley and his coworkers at the University of Illinois-
Chicago are examining the growth of organic films using polyatomic ion sources.
Unique polythiophenic films that may have application in flexible solar cell
devices have been constructed, and the fundamental understanding of the growth
of these films is being pursued. Ion beam characteristics are compared with the
morphology and properties of the grown films in this work.
