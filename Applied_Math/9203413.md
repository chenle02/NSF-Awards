The principal investigator will study a variety of problems concerning the
qualitative properties of the solutions of partial differential equations which
describe nonlinear wave motion. In particular, analytic justification of
asymptotic methods for nonlinear waves arising in geometric optics will be
sought and questions concerning the controllability of hyperbolic waves will be
studied. The qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves is of significant
scientific interest in view of their wide spread occurence in real world
situations.
