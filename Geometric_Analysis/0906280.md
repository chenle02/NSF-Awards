Abstract

Award: DMS-0906280 Principal Investigator: Krzysztof Wysocki

In general terms, the goal of the project is to study analytical aspects of
symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The overall aim of the
project is the development of a general framework for studying nonlinear
elliptic equations appearing in symplectic geometry. Many of the problems in
symplectic geometry, like the Gromov-Witten theory and the Symplectic Field
Theory, are based on the study of the moduli spaces of the first order nonlinear
elliptic equations. These muduli spaces exhibit lack of compactness, however,
they have nontrivial compactification. In the project, Wysocki jointly with
Hofer and Zehnder continues the development of a new general Fredholm theory,
which takes place in new smooth spaces called polyfolds. This general Fredholm
theory has all the properties of the classical Fredholm theory, but is more
flexible and applicable to problems with lack of compactness. In the project,
the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds is applied to the Gromow-Witten theory
and to the Symplectic Field Theory. In another part of the proposal, we use the
theory of pseudholomorphic curves and the theory of generating functions to
study multiplicity of closed characteristics on weakly dynamically convex energy
surfaces.

Symplectic geometry has its origin in classical mechanics. For example, the
motion of the planetary system can be described by a system of nonlinear
differential equations called Hamiltonian systems. The flow lines of Hamiltonian
systems follow very complex patterns. Hence it is of importance to get better
understanding of Hamiltonian flows on its energy surfaces. The development of
the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds will put the Symplectic Field Theory on
solid analytical foundations. The methods developed in this project should have
applications to larger classes of nonlinear partial differential equations of
relevance in differential geometry and physics.
