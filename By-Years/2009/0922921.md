This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Robert
Bergosh, Perry Corbin, Brian Mohney, Jeffrey Weidenhamer and their colleagues
from Ashland University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support
chemical research of faculty and their undergraduate research students. Proposed
research spans a number of areas in chemistry, biochemistry and biology,
including: 1) the synthesis of dihydropyridones (in collaboration with a chemist
at Merck); 2) the development of models for chemical shift to structure
relationships for fullerene characterization; 3) the synthesis of calixarene and
resorcinarene-core biodegradable polylactides and related amphiphilic star block
copolymers; 4) the study of the interaction of the heat shock cognate protein 70
with the c-terminal PDZ domain of neuronal-interleukin 16 ; 5) the study of the
conformational restriction of cysteine-bound nitric oxide in peptides and
proteins; 6) the characterization of biologically active natural products and 7)
the study of the flexibility and thermal properties of alpha A-crystallins found
in ectomorphic bony fish. The instrumentation will also be heavily-incorporated
into the laboratory curriculum at Ashland University -- in a curriculum that
emphasizes hands-on training of students.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic, biochemistry and biology.
Students receiving training with this instrumentation will be better-prepared
for careers in science and technology.
