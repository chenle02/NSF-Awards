The aim of this proposal is to study several random spatial models on various
infinite graphs. Several related topics concerning self-avoiding walks,
percolation, Ising and random cluster models, and stochastic dynamics of Ising
models are proposed. For the self-avoiding walk, the proposer hopes to answer
some fundamental questions of the model on non-amenable graphs. Such questions
include: (1) What is the average end-to-end distance of an N-step self-avoiding
walk? (2) What is the asymptotic behavior of the number of N-step self-avoiding
walks starting from a given point? The topic in percolation concerns the
critical behavior and critical exponents of the model on d-dimensional
hyperbolic graphs, which are regular tessellations of the hyperbolic
d-dimensional space. The main project of Ising models on non-amenable graphs
concerns problems which are of fundamental importance in physics literature.
They include: (1) How many extremal Gibbs states are there in different
temperature region? What are they? (2) How many translation-invariant Gibbs
states are there and what are they? Problems concerning stochastic dynamics of
Ising models on various infinite graphs where spins evolve according to the
usual Glauber dynamics are also proposed.

The proposed topics originate from and have a wide range of application in
materials science, statistical physics, chemistry, biology and other fields of
sciences. The study of the self-avoiding walk arose in chemical physics as a
model for long polymer chains. It is the simplest mathematical model which
characterizes the self-repulsion between monomers in a polymer chain, yet
exhibits critical phenomena. The interest in this model is, however, much
broader since it is closely related to other stochastic models such as the
Brownian motion and the newly discovered stochastic Loewner evolution.
Percolation is a probabilistic model of studying flow through a disordered
system, such as particles flowing through the filter of a gas mask, or fluid
seeping through the interstices of a random porous medium. Ising models capture
the basic magnetic properties of materials. An important goal of this project is
to understand how the geometry of the space affects the nature of macroscopic
behavior of these models. The proposer will continue to make an effort to
involve undergraduate students to undertake small pieces of the problems
proposed here. The proposal, if funded, will also support the students to
present their findings in undergraduate research/education conferences.
