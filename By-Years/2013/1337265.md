1337265&lt;br/&gt;Jin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to acquire a new
fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), FACSAria III,to upgrade a multiuser-
shared FACS that has been serving the entire campus of the University of
Arkansas (UA) for more than 18 years. The requested new generation FACSAria III
is capable of sorting four different types of cells and analyzing nine
fluorescence markers simultaneously. Its rates of analysis and sorting are
75,000 events/second and 25,000 cells/second, respectively, with 98% of purity.
This rapid sorting capability will significantly improve cell survival rate and
reduce the chances of cell contamination. Access to this state-of-the-art flow
cytometer and cell sorter will have an immediate and tremendous impact on UA
researchers and students. Since flow cytometric analysis of cell types and
further sorting them based on their properties are absolute pre-requisites for
performing high-quality life science and biomedical research, FACSAria will
propel UA?s recent health research initiative, boost faculty research
capabilities in the newly-formed biomedical engineering department, and help
more individuals on campus obtain preliminary results to seek NSF or NIH
funding.
