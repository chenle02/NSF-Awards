The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve management of Municipal Solid
Waste (MSW) in a sustainable fashion. The proposed system can manage MSW without
generating toxic air emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 98%
compared to landfills and incineration. An additional benefit is that waste does
not need to be separated, thereby promoting recycling of glass and metal, as
they are left untreated. In addition, the technology is envisioned to be
affordable and easily deployed to enable on-site treatment, saving
transportation costs and associated impact. Finally, the system has the
potential to use excess heat to generate electricity and use the by-product
effectively. This system promotes a circular economy and supports multiple
benefits to the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances
development of a novel system of applying gas plasma to create thermal
degradation of MSW. Phase I objectives are to research, design, construct, and
test a prototype and define an industrial-scale design. Tasks include testing
functionality and emissions quality with a variety of waste feedstock and
operational parameters, and conducting a life cycle analysis. Furthermore, the
project will explore the co-generation of electricity and beneficial reuse of
the ash by-product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
