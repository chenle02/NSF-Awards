9724759 CORNELL Professors Howard Cornell and Ronald Karlson of the Department
of Biology at the University of Delaware, and Dr. Terence P. Hughes of the
Department of Marine Biology of James Cook University, Australia, will sample
corals in six sectors of increasing regional species richness across the Indo-
West and Central Pacific Ocean to quantitatively evaluate the relative influence
of regional and local processes on local richness. Data will be collected on
species presence, relative abundance, habitat breadth, and depth range of
selected species to test the effects of the increasing regional pool on local
richness, evenness, habitat compression, and habitat overlap. This synthesis of
regional and local perspectives should provide an integrated conceptual
framework not only for basic studies of community ecology but also for applied
problems associated with species extinctions, habitat loss and fragmentation,
and ecological restoration.
