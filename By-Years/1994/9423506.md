9423506 This project is an enhancement to the treatment of sea ice in a
comprehensive numerical environmental model -- the Global Environmental and
Ecological Simulation of Interactive Systems (GENESIS) model -- being developed
by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The enhancements will include a
more physically representative surface albedo, turbulent fluxes of heat from
leads and other openings in the ice, and the shear strength of the sea ice
cover. An additional goal of the project is to investigate the effects of some
approximations used in the GENESIS model that have not been adequately studied,
and which may be the source of seasonally anomalous distributions of ice. These
include the treatment of ice deformation as a cavitating fluid and the
assumption of a linear thickness distribution. The output of the enhanced
GENESIS model will be tested and validated with a stand- alone sea ice model and
with existing arctic surface data. ***
