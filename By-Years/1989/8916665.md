The objective of this research is to make a systematic analysis of intermediate
and deep earthquakes with large non-double-couple source components. The primary
task is to determine from previously identified non-double-couple events whether
they are "intrinsically" non-double couples, or whether instead they appear to
be sums of subevents which individually appear to be double couples. Some events
will be studied in a matched pair mode where two events from the same area
differ markedly in their non-double-couple components in order to minimize path
effect and other systematic differences. True non-double-couple events will be
classified for location and other systematic characteristics. This work has
direct application to the problem of the source of deep earthquakes.
