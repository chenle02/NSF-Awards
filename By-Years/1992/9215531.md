The Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) project will imbed
sensitive photomultiplier tubes about one kilometer deep in the Antarctic ice
sheet at South Pole to use the ice itself as a Cherenkov detector for high
energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin which have passed through the Earth.
Additionally, AMANDA will be sensitive to neutrinos which are produced in the
atmosphere near the north pole and can be used to make measurements of neutrino
properties. Neutrino astronomy has, to date, been limited to detection of solar
neutrinos and one brief burst from a supernova which appeared in the Large
Magellanic Cloud in February 1987. Very recently several new sources of high
energy gamma rays, which may also be neutrino sources, have been discovered by
the Compton Observatory satellite and, most significantly, the atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope on Mt. Hopkins, AZ. There should also be many detectable
neutrino sources which are not detectable by gamma rays, or any other wavelength
of electromagnetic radiation, because of intervening matter. Only just now is it
becoming technically feasible to build neutrino telescopes and as one of the
first generation of such instruments, AMANDA promises to be a large contributor
to a new branch of observational astronomy.
