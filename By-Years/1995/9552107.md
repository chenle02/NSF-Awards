ILI - Instrumentation Project: Geosciences Title: Integrated Geophysics Lab The
Geology Department at Amherst college is adding to its course, Physics and
Chemistry of the Earth, a quantitative 13-part laboratory analysis of a single
objective (the local Deerfield basin) conducted with technology appropriate to
the problem address and consistent with questions that modern scientists can
raise and expect to answer. The laboratory engages students in an integrated
application of refraction seismology, gravity and magnetic anomaly analysis,
paleomagnetic study, major and trace element geochemistry, and geochronology to
determine the evolution and present geometry of the Mesozoic rift basin in which
the College is located. These "hands-on" laboratory investigations complement
and invigorate the lecture portion of the syllabus where the class takes up the
more generalized theory, implications, and applications of these earth systems
and disciplines. The equipment is being used to conduct the refraction
seismology and gravity survey portions of the integrated study. All other
facilities or equipment required for this undertaking are available either at
the College or in the laboratories of the University of Massachusetts nearby.
The equipment will also be effectively used in the Department's Environmental
Geology course and by majors undertaking senior independent research.
