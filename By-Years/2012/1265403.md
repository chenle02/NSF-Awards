The ability to obtain fast I/O using a sustainable, easy-to-use, fast, and
portable framework for the largest applications running on high performance
computers remains a formidable task. This project researches techniques for two
challenges that are faced by the research community in high performance I/O.

1. Fast and scalable I/O that adapts to ever-increasing system complexity in
current HPC systems, built with multi-core nodes possessing accelerators and
deep memory hierarchies. This research will investigate new techniques to deal
with the trends for current-generation supercomputers to use accelerators such
as GPGPUs and Intel's Xeon Phi.

2. Sustainable and portable parallel I/O. The project will build on the team's
Adaptable I/O System (ADIOS) to develop such an I/O infrastructure that
encapsulates research and best practices and can enable scientists to use
emerging platforms.

Additional goals are to promote international visibility of the benefits of
investment in HPC by demonstrating the capability of ADIOS, and to explore new
collaboration mechanisms for international researchers. This research is
simultaneously high risk (researching and developing a conceptual solution that
can address the I/O challenges faced by large HPC centers when using
accelerators) and high reward (this solution will be encapsulated into a
sustainable software framework that has a large user base).
