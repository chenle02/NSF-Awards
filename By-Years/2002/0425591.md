This project will acquire new samples from the PACMANUS hydrothermal system
during an already scheduled oceanographic cruise and will conduct fluid
inclusion and petrologic studies of the silicate and sulfate mineral
assemblages. On the basis of heating and freezing techniques, fluid inclusion
geothermometry will elucidate the past thermal history of the system and
complement information gleaned from vent fluid sampling, isotopic analyses,
mineral chemistry, and thermal measurements. Microprobe studies of the
inclusion-bearing samples will constrain mineral chemistry and provide the
context for the fluid inclusion studies. Through a collaborative effort, samples
may also be analyzed for Cl/Br and chloride isotopes, a new technique that may
constrain the nature of the volatile input based on principles related to the
fractionation of species between brines and vapor. The research program will
contribute to further analysis of samples obtained during ODP Leg 193 drilling
at PACMANUS and to the assessment of this site for potential future drilling as
part of IODP. The research will involve an undergraduate student at every phase
of the project, including the oceanographic cruise.
