0958790&lt;br/&gt;Romanowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes acquisition of a broadly
tunable femtosecond laser system, which includes an optical parametric
oscillator pumped by a titanium-sapphire laser and associated instrumentation.
It will enable a broad range of experimental work on the interface of
nanotechnology, materials sciences and medicine. This highly advanced
instrumentation is prohibitively expensive to be acquired through individual
research funding. The requested instrument will be installed in a novel type of
a laser beam facility, which will provide open access to the laser beam, and
room for multiple experimental installations as required by researchers sharing
the research focus on optical spectroscopy and imaging. Research in many areas
of chemistry, materials sciences, biology and medicine relies on using light for
probing structure and function of individual molecules, their assemblies, and
living systems. Increasingly important is understanding of photophysics and
photochemistry at the time scale as short as femtoseconds, and in the broad
spectral range spanning ultraviolet, visible and near infrared. The shared laser
facility is requested by a core user base representing a broad range of research
expertise and active projects. When installed, it will accelerate the pace of
research in medical diagnosis and intervention, analytical methods for bio-
threat agents, solar energy harvesting and conversion, and basic sciences.
