9730971 Bradley A night field program using the Autonomous Benthic Explorer
(ABE) to survey the seafloor on a previously-funded cruise to 17oS on the East
Pacific Rise is proposed. The previously-funded cruise will include ALVIN dives,
DSL-120 side-looking sonar, wax coring, and dredging operations to determine the
petrological, geochemical, and volcanological aspects of this mid-ocean ridge
environment. The use of the ABE should allow the better identification of lavas
flows, their morphology, dimensions, and along axis continuity. A magnetometer
has been added to the ABE for the purpose of identifying recent, highly
magnetized feeder dikes and, potentially, non-magnetized feeder dikes.
