Synthetic fibers are used extensively in composite materials. They have been
considered for reinforcement in cement. However, the silicate network glass
reacts with cement, which is strongly alkaline (PH 12.5). Consequently, more
expensive glass fibers containing zirconia were developed for improved chemical
stabiliity of the fibers for this application. The PI proposes to use basalt
fibers for cement reinforcement. Basalt is a naturally occurring relatively
inexpensive material widely available in the drawing basalt fibers. To improve
the chemical stability of basalt fibers, the PI proposes to form thin films of
silica-zirconia by sol-gel processing. This is in contrast to the alloying route
other researchers have taken in the use of glass fibers. Both the application
and approach are novel. Industry has expressed strong interest in this work as
well as other applications of basalt fibers.
