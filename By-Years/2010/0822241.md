This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to
provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development
methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across
the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&amp;D
contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education
Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy
Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance,
which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of
composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual
technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic
meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2)
Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a
comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the
program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b)
evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the
field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to
summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in
practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b)
a series of dissemination-related workshops.
