Do the quirks of different languages affect how speakers think about the world?
Do English, Mandarin, Russian, or Turkish speakers experience the world
differently simply because they speak different languages? Do they partition the
world in different ways or remember things differently? Does learning a new
language change the way you think? Do speakers of multiple languages think
differently when speaking different languages? Dr. Lera Boroditsky seeks answers
to these and other questions in her National Science Foundation funded research.
A different way to ask the previous questions is: What is core or universal in
human cognition? The question of universality has long been a touchstone for
controversy. Despite much attention and debate, however, definitive answers have
not been forthcoming. Dr. Boroditsky reformulates the relations between language
and thought toward resolving this debate. She introduces innovative and subtle
methods that have greater sensitivity to interactions between language and
thought. The intellectual merits of the research come from her fresh creative
approach to a problem that most other scientists had put aside. Broader impacts
of this funded project are in its educational benefits. These include many
terrific research opportunities for students. The focus on languages in addition
to English insures participation of groups who are underrepresented in American
science. The funded research is also the basis for two new courses at MIT aimed
at both graduate and undergraduate students, and for a new textbook for
undergraduates.
