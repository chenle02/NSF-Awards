Hampshire College will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars project
in mathematics for 60 students entering the 11th and 12th grades. This summer
program will emphasize research participation in the study of combinatorics,
graph theory, number theory, geometry, and topology. Students discover patterns,
make and test conjectures and definitions, create proofs and counterexamples,
build models, write programs, and make oral and written presentations of their
work. There also will be opportunities for students to engage in career
exploration activities through interactions with practicing mathematicians.
