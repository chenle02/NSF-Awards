This award will support NSF funded research programs by providing a safe
platform for studies conducted primarily on the East Coast and the Gulf of
Mexico. This proposal covers year 1 of a 5-year cooperative agreement, from
January through December 2012. Funding will be re-negotiated each year and will
be dependent upon the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research.
In 2012, 69 operational-sea days out of 112 are funded by NSF. The intellectual
merit of the proposal lies in the peer-reviewed proposals from the science
sections that have been funded. Cape Hatteras is in compliance with USCG,
University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and American Bureau
of Shipping (ABS) regulations and is owned by the National Science Foundation.
