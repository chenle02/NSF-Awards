New products and material processing methods often require the identification of
novel materials that are stronger, lighter, cheaper, or better in some way.
Searching for new materials with a trial-and-error approach can be expensive and
often ineffective. With this award, new mathematical methods and computer
software will be developed to accelerate materials discovery. The planned
approach will narrow the available options to those that are most likely to
succeed, making discovery of new materials and processes more reliable and less
costly. Demonstration of the approach will be made for materials to be used in
flexible organic solar cells, but the methods could also be amenable to
materials for use in pharmaceuticals or to food
additives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new optimal learning approach to materials
design is planned that uses advances in Bayesian experimental design and machine
learning to predict material properties from previous data and domain expertise,
and to intelligently suggest physical and computational experiments that will
provide information that is most supportive of discovery. These new mathematical
techniques promise to greatly accelerate materials design, providing better
materials more reliably and with less experimental effort. The approach will be
demonstrated in the search for organic semiconductor materials over a set of
existing candidates, solvent choices, and processing conditions, and integrate
both physical and computational experiments in this search. The test case is an
all-organic solar cell system of contorted hexabenzocoronenes (c-HBC), deposited
on carbon nanotubes (CNT). This complex system involves issues including
complexation between c-HBC and CNT at different processing conditions, etc.,
which provide a stringent test of optimal learning and computer simulation
methods to predict the processing-structure-function triad. This approach is
broadly applicable to a diverse set of materials design problems.
