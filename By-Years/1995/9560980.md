This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will identify and
demonstrate a new idea and design for an ellipsometry mapping instrument, which
will be applied to processing control of semiconductor wafers and flat panel
displays. The conventional point-measurement-based ellipsometry is widely used
for semiconductor thin film thickness and dielectric constant characterization.
However, fast in-line wafer mapping by ellipsometry, which should be desirable
in semiconductor processing control, has been impractical. This proposed idea
and design, if proved, will produce a new generation of ellipsometry
instrumentation, which is non-destructive, fast for in-line mapping, suitable
for any large size semiconductor wafers or flat panel displays, and will be a
breakthrough in the semiconductor instrumentation market.
