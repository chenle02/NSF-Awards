The increased activity in signal processing at Drexel University has placed
higher demands upon the existing facility and has uncovered some deficiencies in
the present system. The primary area of need is in the peripherals of present
computing facilities of the Signal Processing Laboratory. The improved PDP 11/23
system includes a tape drive, hard disks to operate a 16-bit data acquisition
system at maximum capacity direct to disk, a high speed data link, and expanded
graphics. Current projects that will benefit through the use of this new system
are: nonlinear spectrum compression, EEG signal analysis, compensation of blood
pressure waveforms, data acquisition, pitch detection, and high fidelty digital
signal processing.
