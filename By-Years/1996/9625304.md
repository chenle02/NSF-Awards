9625304 Weng This project is to study the thermomechanical behavior in both
single crystal and polycrystalline versions of shape-memory alloys (SMA). To
make best use of these materials it is important that their behavior be modeled
with precision. Thus constitutive equations that capture the phase
transformations under thermal/mechanical loading, must be used. The phase
transformations are thermoelastic in nature and are therefore driven by the
thermodynamic forces of the system which is inherently a two phase one. A
combined theoretical/experimental program will consider the three dimensional
martensite-plate morphology as well as the shear and dilatational components of
the transformation strains. ***
