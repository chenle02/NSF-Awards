EIA-0205116&lt;br/&gt;Fred Roberts&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Special Focus on Computer Science and
Epidemiology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical methods have become important
tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious and also noninfectious
diseases. The size of modern epidemiological problems and the large data sets
that arise call out for the use of powerful computational tools in conjunction
with the mathematical analysis. This project believes that partnerships between
computer scientists and epidemiologists can make important new contributions to
the usefulness of these mathematical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research
efforts in the project will be carried out by interdisciplinary, international
working groups which will investigate issues in computer science and related
mathematics that need to be resolved to make progress on important problems in
epidemiology and will explore and apply methods of computer science and related
mathematics not widely used in epidemiology. Topics to be studied by these
groups include: Adverse Event/Disease Reporting, Surveillance, and Analysis;
Data Mining and Epidemiology; Analogies Between Computer Viruses and Immune
Systems and Biological Viruses and Immune Systems; Distributed Computing, Social
Networks, and Disease Spread Processes; Phylogenetic Trees and Rapidly Evolving
Diseases, Spatio-Temporal and Network Modeling of Diseases; and Methodologies
for Comparing Vaccination Strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other important
goals will be to involve more computer scientists in epidemiological research;
develop and strengthen collaborations and partnerships between mathematical
scientists and biological scientists; introduce young investigators from both
the computer science and biological science communities to the issues, problems
and challenges of epidemiology; and involve biological and computer scientists
together to define the agenda and develop the tools of computational
epidemiology.&lt;br/&gt;
