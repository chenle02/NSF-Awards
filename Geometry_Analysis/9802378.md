Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9802378 Principal Investigator: Tudor Ratiu

A first goal of this project is to use symplectic reduction theory and its
extension involving singularities to the study of various mechanical systems and
coadjoint orbits of finite and infinite dimensional Lie groups. In addition,
these techniques will be applied to symmetric Hamiltonian bifurcation theory by
combining them with methods of dynamical systems and classical bifurcation
theory methods. A Lagrangian counterpart of reduction will be developed, where
symplectic geometry techniques are replaced by variational principles.
Applications of these variational methods yield the equations of various
approximate models in geophysical fluid dynamics. A second goal of this project
is to understand completions of diffeomorphism groups with the scope of applying
geometric and Lie theoretical methods to the study of nonlinear wave equations
and the understanding of the convexity properties of the momentum map in
infinite dimensions. A third goal is the application of methods of Hamiltonian
dynamics in conjunction with singular reduction to study the bifurcation and the
long term behavior of concrete mechanical systems such as the Riemann
ellipsoids. The same methods are intended for the design and study of numerical
algorithms on nonlinear manifolds.

Symplectic methods in geometric mechanics are a powerful tool to address
difficult questions in the dynamics of concrete problems such as the control of
submarine or robotic arm motion, the elaboration of models for continuum systems
such as rods and shells, or the study of the shape of liquid or gaseous masses
ranging from tiny drops to galaxies. The development of the geometric
foundations to attack these problems as well as their application to several
problems comprises the work to be done on this grant.
