Previous research has demonstrated that a strong Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) identity predicts persistence and success in
STEM disciplines. Individuals identify themselves with STEM to varying degrees
depending on their perceptions of STEM and their other important identities.
This project will add to the tools available to researchers to measure STEM-
identity, other identities, and identity balance by developing, piloting and
testing a new measurement instrument and analytic approach. Approximately 300
STEM majors, from underrepresented groups and from groups traditionally well
represented in STEM, will be recruited into the project from three California
State University campuses (San Marcos, Long Beach, Northridge). The new
measurement tool will allow researchers to better understand STEM identity
development and is expected to lead to more effective interventions to increase
and broaden participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The measurement
instrument design is based on social identity and balanced identity theories and
is intended to answer a range of research questions about STEM-identity and its
balance with other self-identities. This project will test the validity and
reliability of this new tool for measuring STEM-identity and the development of
STEM-identity over time. This study could advance knowledge about interventions
needed to broaden participation in STEM fields. The project is funded by the EHR
Core Research (ECR) program, which funds basic research that seeks to
understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations)
to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and
participation.
