9313344 Nibler In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, Prof. J.W. Nibler of Oregon State University will undertake
an investigation of the formation, growth, and surface/bulk properties of
nanoclusters ranging in size from 1 to 100 nanometers. These clusters will be
produced in a supersonic expansion and their phases, and thermodynamic
temperatures, and other properties determined. The experimental technique will
rely on non-linear Raman spectroscopies, specifically the methods of Coherent
Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) and Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (SRS) as
well as double resonance methods. Clusters of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and
hydrogen molecules will be the principal species investigated. %%% The study of
large clusters is now wide spread in chemistry, physics, and materials science
and their fundamental properties remain to be more fully explored. Clusters
composed of monomer molecules having no permanent dipole moment are not fully
accessible to study by means of infrared spectroscopy. In such cases the Raman
spectroscopic method is capable of providing the desired information. This
research will provide information on the structures, phases, phase transitions,
and surface effects of clusters. This information will be of importance for the
development of theoretical models of cluster structure and dynamics. ***
