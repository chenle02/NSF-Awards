This project is a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant
EAR 83-06410 and amendments. The research involves experimental studies of
melting relationships in natural and synthetic silicate systems as a function of
pressure and of volatile content. The results of these studies will contribute
to our knowledge of the structural, thermal, and physical properties of silicate
liquids and of the geological processes of formation, migration, and evolution
of silicate magmas.
