9317804 Grujicic The mechanism and the potential for transformation toughening
of gamma titanium aluminide (TiAl) by the introduction of a metastable titanium-
aluminum-vanadium-iron (Al-Ti-V-Fe) beta phase dispersion are investigated by
(a) experimental characterization and numerical modeling of materials
constitutive relations, and (b) fracture toughness measurements and detailed
observations of martensitic transformation in the vicinity of the crack tip.
Three types of gamma TiAl base-alloys containing a dispersion of beta phase with
different thermodynamic stabilities have been designed using a thermodynamic-
based procedure. Quantitative constitutive relations that are based on stress-
assisted and strain-induced transformation kinetics for gamma TiAl plus beta Ti-
Al-V-Fe systems are to be developed. These relations are then used in a finite
element analysis to study the interaction of a moving crack in the gamma TiAl
matrix with beta phase particles and grain boundary microcracks. %%% This
research represents a new approach to toughening of gamma titanium alloys. The
results could serve as a basis for improved toughness in high temperature
titanium alloys. ***
