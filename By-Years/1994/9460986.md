This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to explore the
feasibility of developing a product modeling system for sheet metal and
associated assemblies. This system, whose domain is the set of non-multi-curved
objects, will be used to evaluate products for life-issues, capture designer
intentions, propagate those intentions to planning modules, and to generate the
necessary process information for manufacture. To accomplish this Geometric
Machines Corp. will extend the research on ProMod-S, a sheet metal oriented
product modeler developed by their group, which captures the geometric intents
of the designer (which are related to the designer's functional intents), and
evaluates the product geometry against manufacturing constraints. They will
further develop principles and algorithms to capture design intentions, to
evaluate designs, and to offer design advice. The capturing of assembly
relations to preserve design intent will be accomplished using a spatial
relationship kernel developed by their group in an earlier National Science
Foundation SBIR grant for a product design system for mechanical assembly. The
design rule checker will be developed using the concept of Medial Axis Transform
applied to sheet metal design. The mapping of features to the tools and
operations which make them and automatic process sequencing will also be
investigated. This work will ultimately provide a stand-alone designer system
for sheet metal.
