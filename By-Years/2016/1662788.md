This award supports participation in the 42nd and 43rd Spring Lecture Series,
taking place at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in March 2017 and
April 2018 respectively. The award supports travel and lodging, both for the
principal speakers and for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early
career participants. These three-day conferences provide opportunities for
dissemination of research results, discussions that lead to new connections and
collaborations, and for professional development for junior participants. The
conferences also include a public mathematics lecture aimed at broadening
mathematical appreciation in the community, and networking events for women in
mathematics and for graduate students. Further information can be found at the

The 2017 conference will feature lectures by Professor Robert Lazarsfeld of
Stony Brook University on geometry and the equations defining projective
varieties. This topic is of significant interest in both commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry and is related to many of the most important open conjectures
in both fields. The 2018 conference will feature lectures by Professor Kiran
Kedlaya of the University of California at San Diego on new and old themes in
p-adic cohomology. This topic has been of fundamental importance in arithmetic
geometry and mixed characteristic commutative algebra and the talks will
describe recent advances and relate them to the classical picture. In addition
to the principal lecturer, both workshops will feature talks by ten of the
world's leading experts in the respective fields, as well as contributed talks
by participants and a small workshop for graduate students held in advance of
the principal lecture.
