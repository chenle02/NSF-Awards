This proposal seeks funds for 4 months of field work in Brazil, and 3 months in
Switzerland for completion of a Ph.D. dissertation by Katia F. Rodrigues. The
study concerns endophytic fungi in leaflets of the Amazonian palm Euterpe
oleracea mart. in Brazil and biochemical/nutritional studies of those fungi in
Switzerland. The work will be essentially taxonomic and ecological. The
following parameters will be considered: season, subsite, tree age, leaf age,
and tissue specificity. The biochemical studies will be undertaken in
collaboration with Dr. Orlando Petrini (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,
Zurich). This research will result in a descriptive catalogue, with keys for
identification, of the endophytic fungi found within leaves of E. oleracea.
Endophytes found in trees grown in a wet versus a dry site will be compared and
a study of the distribution of endophytic fungi within plant leaf tissues will
be undertaken. A biochemical study of the abilities of the endophytic fungi to
produce cell-wall lysing enzymes, and phytoalexins is included. The work will
provide a database containing taxonomic and ecological characteristics of those
fungi that will be available to other workers.
