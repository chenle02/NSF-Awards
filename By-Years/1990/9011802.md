This proposal is to complete the first phase of a longitudinal study of social
and cultural change in six rural towns in Venezuela. The towns are located in a
zone slated for a large- scale, multi-stage regional development program based
on commercial pine plantations, sawmills and paper pulp mills, and large
infrastructural projects which include a new regional system of highways and a
bridge linking the zone to the industrial complex at Ciudad Guayana. The data
will make it possible to explore how management of natural resources affects and
responds to the social and economic structures of local communities in a
developing nation. The results will be generalizable beyond the study area and
the methods will be replicable.
