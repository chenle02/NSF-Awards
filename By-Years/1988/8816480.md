Dr. John Herron has been given a standard grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to partially support The Second International Conference on
Chemical Kinetics which will be held at NBS in Gaithersburg, MD on July 23-27,
1989. Subject areas of interest in this conference include: atmospheric
chemistry, combustion chemistry, chemistry of energetic materials, plasma
processing, clusters, modeling, and the development of numeric data bases for
reactions of ions and neutral species. The NSF contribution to the total funding
of this conference will be used exclusively for travel grants for domestic
graduate students to attend this meeting.
