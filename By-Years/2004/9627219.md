Spilhaus 9627219 The objective of this project is to make possible the
participation of approximately 7 researchers, from the United States in the
International Geological Congress (IGC). The 30th IGC will take place August
4-14, 1996 in Beijing, China. This venue will highlight the demands of massive
populations and evolving economies on the resources of the earth and the
environment. It will also offer unparalleled opportunities for U.S. scientists
to learn about the unique geology of China and the progress made by Chinese
geoscientists. The scientific contacts and new perspectives that U.S. scientists
will find at the technical sessions and field trips of the Congress will be
invaluable for advancing understanding of the dynamic earth system.
