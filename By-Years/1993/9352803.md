The project involves purchase a 300 MHz FT NMR that would form the basis for
upgrading several existing courses. The instrument would be used for new
experiments being introduced into the chemistry and biology laboratory courses.
Acquisition of this instrument would greatly expand the analytical capabilities
for undergraduate laboratory and research courses as well as provide students
with valuable "hands on" experience in chemistry and biology to meet
requirements for adequate career preparation.
