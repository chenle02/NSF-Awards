9405824 This proposal concerns computational approaches to determining the
behavior of membranes. In particular, the goals of this project include (1)
further understanding of long-length-scale conformations of membranes (2)
determining the range of various interactions between membranes separated by
aqueous solvent (3) developing new algorithms for the numerical simulation of
the dynamical behavior of polymers and membranes in solvent. The dynamical
methodology involves treating the solvent via finite difference methods coupled
with a Langevin simulation of the polymer/membrane. %%% This proposal is
concerned with the shapes and dynamics of membranes. It uses new computational
methodology to achieve this end. Membranes are, of course, very important in the
natural world. In particular the PI will concentrate on the red blood cells,
vesicles and sponge-phases. His interest is in transport of such systems and in
their shape both in static and dynamic (e.g. in a flow) environment. Further he
will study how membranes interact with one another when there is aqueous
solution between them. The PI uses methods used in solid state physics and
applies them to bio-materials and bio-systems. This is a fine example of cross-
disciplinary research.
