This proposal was submitted for consideration as an Expedited Award for Novel
Research. The PI has proposed to study theoretically a novel variant to high-
energy particle acceleration utilizing laser- plasma interactions. Currently,
two laser-plasma approaches are in the literature, the beat-wave accelerator and
the inverse free- electron laser. The basic idea originally suggested by Bobin
of introducing a plasma into the IFEL could improve significantly the
acceleration gradient. The PI considers Bobin's theoretical calculations as far
from complete or reliable and, in particular, feels that a treatment of phase
information is lacking that is crucial to its operation. He proposes to carry
out theoretical modeling and computer simulation of the plasma-enhanced concept,
based in large degree on new ideas of adapting particle codes available from
UCLA. The project is timely as it could serve as proof-of-principle experiments
for future advanced accelerator concepts planned at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory.
