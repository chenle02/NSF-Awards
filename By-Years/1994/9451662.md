9451662 Beyermann This project will develop an advanced physics teaching
laboratory at the upper-division undergraduate level. This laboratory, which
represents an extension of the teaching laboratories now offered by the
department, will have four experiments in condensed-matter, nuclear, and
elementary-particle physics. The experiments that will be developed are Pulsed
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Josephson Effect and Superconducting Quantum
Interface, Rutherford Scattering, and Cosmic-Ray Muon Lifetime and Michel
Spectrum Measurement. These experiments are advanced and versatile enough to
allow creative exploration of physical phenomena by the students and instructor.
