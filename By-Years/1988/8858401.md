This award supports research in elementary particle physics by Dr. Gregory R.
Snow, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Snow is working on UA-6, an
experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. This experiment is a study of "direct
photons" produced in high energy collisions of protons. These are photons (light
quanta) emitted directly from some of the constituents of the proton, during the
collision. Their detection and study will provide information on the way the
constituents are held together in protons and other subnuclear particles.
