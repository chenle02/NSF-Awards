This is a collaborative research project with Kenneth Wolpin at the University
of Minnesota. The purpose of this research is to study the initial phases of
career development using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor
Market Experience of Youth. There are three components to the project: (1) to
describe the patterns of job and occupational mobility within the first decade
after leaving school; (2) to estimate a structural dynamic model of job changing
behavior; and (3) to estimate an equilibrium model of occupational choice. This
project is important because it may change the way in which we think about the
standard human capital model of earnings growth, which neglects job search
behavior and labor mobility.
