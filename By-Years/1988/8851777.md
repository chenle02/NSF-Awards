Seven courses in the biology curriculum have been targeted for inclusion of a
molecular physiology component, both because of the role played by molecular
physiology in modern biology, and because these seven courses involve both
majors and non-majors at all levels of undergraduate education. Two
spectrophotometers with flowcell, thermoelectric cell, and recorder interface,
and one strip chart recorder now are enabling students (a) to perform
experiments in enzyme and transport kinetics, (b) to conduct a variety of
metabolic studies, and (c) to pursue aspects of molecular physiology in their
independent research projects. These experiences better inform undergraduate
students about comtemporary biology and better prepare majors for advanced
studies, teaching careers, and professional work. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
