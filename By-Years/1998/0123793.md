0123793&lt;br/&gt;Thadhani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to study and
develop a model of international research experience based on the team travel of
a graduate student, an REU undergraduate student, and a RET teacher participant,
to Japan. The results of the model study will be used during a subsequent site
visit by the P.I.'s for developing international REU/RET sites at national
laboratories and academic institutions in East Asia. The institutions being
targeted are those that have extensively interacted with the P.I.'s during the
last ten years, in conducting collaborative experiments, as well as via exchange
of post-docs and faculty sabbaticals. The purpose of the international research
experience is to allow the team members to gain an understanding of the research
culture, as well as the philosophy of baccalaureate and higher education in East
Asian countries.&lt;br/&gt;
