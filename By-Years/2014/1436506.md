This project supports a series of scientific workshops among Alaska Native,
Hawai'ian Native, and Plains Indian indigenous scholars and scientists. The goal
of these workshops is to engage the participants in developing new guidelines
for building collaborations between Native and non-Native researchers working
with Native communities. The research team proposes that these guidelines
reflect Indigenous knowledge production, honor Indigenous innovation, and
resonate Indigenous perceptions of place and as such, they will incorporate
Native principles, protocols, and practices. This approach to scientific
collaboration, one that supports scientific and indigenous principles as co-
producers of scientific knowledge creates a new vision for interdisciplinary
research, one that includes scientific and indigenous scholarly
perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientists increasingly engage Native
communities in research as subjects, landowners, tradition bearers,
participants, and/or collaborators in research there is increasing awareness
among indigenous people, particularly in North America, that the scientific
endeavor could benefit greatly from their knowledge and perspective. This
project is about understanding the diversity of indigenous knowledges and how
indigenous people can best engage with science and scientists. This type of
multi-knowledge engagement holds the potential to expand our understanding of
the world's natural and social systems. In addition, this project engages the
next generation of Alaska Native, Native Hawai'ian, and Plains Indian scholars
and scientists through meaningful participation by undergraduate and graduate
students and early career scientists from these groups. By engaging students
from underrepresented groups in science through this workshop series, the
research team proposes to prepare the next generation of interdisciplinary
scientist that can think and analyze data in a more holistic way. They are in
essence laying the groundwork for a 21st century diverse scientific workforce.
