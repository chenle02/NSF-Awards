ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funds to partially support the
travel of U.S. authors to attend the Third IFAC Symposium on Mechatronic Systems
to be held in Sydney, Australia, from September 6th through September 8th, 2004.
The U.S. participants will include both faculty and graduate students. The
faculty are involved in education in the field of mechatronics and will be able
to incorporate the new material presented at the conference into their teaching.
For the students, this conference offers the opportunity to expose themselves to
the international community in their field and to prepare for &lt;br/&gt;their
future careers. As mechatronics considers the synergistic application of
knowledge from the fields of mechanics, electronics, and information technology,
dynamic systems and control are central topics of relevance to its practice.
Furthermore, mechatronics is essential to the proper application of advances in
control to industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;
