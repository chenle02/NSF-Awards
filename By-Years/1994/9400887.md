9400887 Berger This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research Program. It is an experimental study of the impact of task
feedback on expectations for competence and status. It is well known that small
task oriented groups tend to stratify into consistent patterns of participation,
task activity, reward behavior and influence. Recently, theorists have begun to
examine the conditions under which these interaction hierarchies become
legitimated or normative for the members of the group. This study seeks to test
the argument, developed from expectation states theory, that feedback on the
outcome of a task will have important consequences for the likelihood of
legitimation in subsequent tasks. The likelihood of legitimation based on
initial status is experimentally crossed with the presence or absence of
positive external feedback which increases the likelihood of such legitimation
occurring. %%% This experiment tests an important extension of expectation
states theory, which has become highly influential in research on group
processes in both sociology and social psychology. This tradition has
contributed in the past to administrative and management science, and we would
expect this study to do so as well. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of social scientists. ***
