9511824 Burgdorfer The project centers around the description of the complex
dynamics of atomic systems. These systems are classically chaotic, although the
underlying quantum mechanical description is regular and quasi-periodic. The
critical issue is to explore this classical/quantum correspondence in; 1) the
dynamical evolution of Rydberg states under the influence of short laser pulses,
2) in relativistic H- beams and 30 in microscopic semiconductors. ***
