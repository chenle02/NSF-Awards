Axial and radial solids concentration within circulating fluidized beds will be
measured using a new capacitance probe capable of good time and space
resolution. The facility is unique in that different gases can be used as the
fluidising medium. This should permit the simulation of large scale, hot
combustors by a single cold flow facility. The research should provide better
scale-up procedures for circulating fluidized beds which are very promising
candidates for efficient gas- solid contacting with high throughput. Such
devices may be used as the next generation of coal combustors.
