John Dickey University of Minnesota Dr. John Dickey will carry out a spectral
line survey of the atomic hydrogen line near 21-cm wavelength from the 4th
quadrant of the Galaxy. The survey will be conducted using radio astronomy
facilities in Australia, and colleagues in Australia will collaborate with Dr.
Dickey. This survey represents a great advance in angular resolution and
sensitivity over existing data sets. The observations should dramatically
improve our understanding of the distribution and kinematics of the atomic gas
component of our Galaxy. Accompanying observations of the radio continuum
emission should significantly advance our understanding of the detected ionized
hydrogen regions, supernova remnants, and the Galactic magnetic field structure.
