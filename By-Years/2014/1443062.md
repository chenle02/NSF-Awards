Science data and results must be well documented in order to be reproducible and
re-usable. Metadata -- ancillary contextual information such as science
objectives, data provenance, and uncertainty estimates at each step -- is a
fundamental part of the research documentation, reuse, and collaboration
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops flexible tools for
evaluating metadata, using consistent measurement systems that encourage
community engagement, integrate guidance for improvement, and are a critical
element in cross-community metadata improvement efforts. Provision of these new
metadata and data evaluation services across communities will improve the
ability to integrate and reuse trustworthy data for crosscutting synthesis and
analysis across science communities. The focus on use metadata rather than
discovery metadata is a significant shift in focus. Use metadata is a
fundamental building block needed to allow effective scientific analysis
workflows. The team builds a significant collaboration with several
interdisciplinary partner organizations that provide guidance to this project.
