The objective of this research is to continue the investigation of the non-
smooth solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equation and their application
to optimal control theory. Recently achieved results have established a new type
of relationship between the HJB equation and optimal control theory. The value
function is characterized in terms of its directional derivatives as the unique
solution to HJB equation. The intuitively and geometrically clear-cut nature of
the results promises powerful new first and second order optimality conditions
as well as a deeper insight into the structure of the optimal policy. An
extension to stochastic problem would offer a novel unified approach to
deterministic and stochastic control theory free of any kind of degeneracy or
non-degeneracy assumptions. The technical core of the research will be to
establish the necessary relations between Lagrange multipliers and directional
derivatives of the optimal value function as well as to identify and investigate
an appropriate non-smooth second order differential operator.
