Title: Resampling Methods Under Long Range Dependence ABSTRACT: The main thrust
of the research is to develop suitable resampling schemes and to study their
properties for data exhibiting very strong forms of dependence. It is well known
that existing resampling schemes perform very poorly under such dependence
structures. Two new resampling schemes for long-range dependent data are
investigated. These schemes are a sampling-window method based on subsamples of
the data and a bootstrap method based on finite Fourier transformations. Their
effectiveness in different inference problems is examined. The phenomenon of
long range dependence, such as the concentration of an air-pollutant in a city
observed at closely located sites, occurs when the data are highly correlated.
This sort of data has a high level of variability, even after averaging. The
research involves developing suitable resampling schemes for long-range
dependent data that will provide good statistical estimates. The research has
direct applications in Hydrology, Geology, Economics, and Environmental
problems.
