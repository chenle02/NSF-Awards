This SBIR Phase I device will be developed to improve the accuracy and
reproducibility of the Standard Penetration Test (SPT), a test widely used
throughout the world by geotechnical engineers to obtain subsurface data. The
new device, called the Accu-Hammer, is placed in the borehole, reducing energy
losses in the drill train.
