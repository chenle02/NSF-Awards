This project examines the development of students' schemes for multiplication
and multiplicative rate of change that will enable students to understand the
crucial societal and environmental issues of exponential growth. Through the use
of teaching experiments, historical analysis and the design of software
incorporating new representational and visual forms, the research team seeks to
investigate how to improve students' insight in issues of scale, functions,
multiplicative rate of change and biological forms of growth. To facilitate the
research on secondary students, preliminary work will be undertaken into young
children's concepts of multiplication, similarity and growth in relation to a
primitive construct labelled "splitting" which is conjectured to be the basis of
an approach to multiplication independent of counting. Initial studies will also
include an ethnomathematical investigation of scientists' and social scientists'
use of exponential functions. Informed by the interview studies, research on
whole classroom implementation will be undertaken towards the preparation of
applied research products including curricula, case studies of teacher
development and software products.
