In response to a Project Solicitation, the Cornell Theory Center submitted a
proposal to conduct a Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987. This proposal and
eight others were evaluated by a review panel. Cornell has proposed a two week
Institute for 25 young researchers from June 29 to July 10, 1987. Students will
be reimbursed for travel, accomodations, meals, and some incidental expenses. In
addition to detailed training on the use of the IBM 3090/400 vector
supercomputer and FPS attached array processors, students will be exposed to
seminars from experts in the computationally intensive areas of statistical
mechanics, solutions of coupled multi-dimensional equations, protein structure
calculations, and quantum physics. The review panel found this to be a strong
proposal, and found favor with the emphasis on hands-on access to the Cornell
computer system. Students will be expected to bring a working Fortran program
for optimization during the Institute. The variety and numbers of
terminals/workstations for student access was noted. Training will also
emphasize the various methods and kinds of digital network access to the Cornell
facility. While the initial costs were high, negotiation has succeeded in
reducing the cost from $104,200 to $68,672, without reducing the quality of the
Institute. In addition, Cornell has identified an undergraduate component of
$7000. The Theory Center ran a successful Supercomputer Summer Institute in
1986, and can be expected to do so again in 1987. The Centers Program recommends
support in the amount of $75,672.
