Dr. John W. Borneman (Princeton University) will continue longitudinal
ethnographic research on the uses of incarceration and therapy to treat
perpetrators of specific classes of criminal offenses. One central research
focus is how experts assess motivations and justify decisions regarding
penalization and therapy. As public awareness and the law address a wider
variety of social problems, it is important to understand the underlying logic
and consequences of penalization, therapy, and
rehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is being conducted in Berlin,
Germany, a site of innovation in the field of integrating incarceration and
rehabilitation. The researcher employs a combination of social science methods
including observation at group therapy sessions, analysis of cases, and pre- and
post-therapy interviews. The research will contribute to social science theory
through its innovative focus on the micro-processes that produce contemporary
relations between law, personhood, and the state. Findings from this research
also will provide a basis for future comparative work to inform public policy.
