ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maize genome is thought to comprise
islands of lightly methylated genes in a sea of highly methylated, repetitive
DNA. Complete sequencing and assembly of the whole maize genome is currently not
feasible because of the repetitive DNA. Methods are beginning to be developed
that will allow the regions of the maize genome that contain the genes to be
filtered out for sequencing. It is expected that once validated in maize, such
methods could be used for similar sequencing projects in other crop species
having complex genomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel expression vector system
has been developed to rescue directly open reading frames (ORFs) from genomic
DNA. Preliminary data suggest that this "ORF Rescue" vector system is a
potentially powerful tool for gene discovery in complex crop genomes.
Experiments will be performed to validate the utility of this vector system for
preparing filtered template DNA for genome sequencing. The three specific aims
of the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1] evaluate the ability of the ORF
Rescue vector to filter genes from maize genomic DNA; &lt;br/&gt;2] evaluate the
ability of the ORF Rescue vector to filter genes from maize DNA cloned into
Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs); &lt;br/&gt;3] determine whether novel
ORFs define monocot-specific genes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work merits
funding as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) because it represents
work on an untested and novel idea that is needed urgently.
