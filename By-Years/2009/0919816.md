The reform of the Introductory Biology III: Organismal Biology to integrate
physics into biology and the concurrent reform of introductory physics courses
for biology majors is being conducted. A set of educational materials that
covers two broad physics topics of importance in basic biology &amp;
thermodynamics and transport are being developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
combined team of education-reform-minded biologists and physics education
researchers is carrying out the integration of physics into biology and the
matching reform of a course in physics for biologists by using an approach to
curriculum reform that focuses on issues of content, epistemology, and pedagogy.
Materials developed include structured on-line readings, Peer Instruction
conceptual problems for large lecture biology classes, sample problems for in-
class group problem solving, sample exam problems, structured homework problems
coordinated so that there are matching problems in the biology and physics
classes, and in-class tutorial-style worksheets. Each item undergoes a rigorous
cycle of development, review, revision, and testing to ensure the quality and
effectiveness of the finished products. The resulting materials will be
disseminated over the internet and described at appropriate professional forums.
