This proposal seeks funding to stage a workshop at the Maxwell School, Syracuse
University in April 2009 to bring together scholars who conduct qualitative
research in political science. The goal of the workshop is to begin to develop
practices to allow such scholars to archive their data in order that it will be
available to other scholars to analyze. Approximately 13 senior scholars will
join 6 to 8 junior scholars or graduate students in the development of archiving
practices. Topics to be considered include human subject concerns, dealing
different types of qualitative data, the impact on archiving on how qualitative
research is conducted, and the use of information technology on uploading,
storing and accessing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6 to 8 junior scholars or
graduate students will be expected to collect qualitative data during the year
following the workshop. With the input of senior scholars at the workshop, they
will work during that period to archive their data at an archive at the Maxwell
School. This activity will provide models with which to encourage other scholars
to archive their data. In addition, they will provide a beta test for the
archiving practices developed at the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project's broader impacts include the development of a systematic repository for
qualtitative data, which would then make the data available to other scholars in
readily usable forms.
