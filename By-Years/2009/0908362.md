This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a program to perform a multi-
wavelength study of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) to: 1. Systematically analyze GRB
afterglow data, and clearly identify emission components that have distinct
physical origins; 2. Perform detailed modeling of broadband, multi-component
afterglows using a sophisticated external forward shock model; 3. Analyze the
GRB prompt emission data collected by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM, and investigate
the validity of various empirical correlations; and 4. Model the broad band
prompt emission of GRBs. Data will come from the Swift and Fermi space missions,
and from HESS and VERITAS on the ground.
