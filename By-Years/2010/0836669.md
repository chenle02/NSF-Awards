This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Nano Nano: Two courses on the social, human, and ethical impacts
of nanotechnology, at Pennsylvania State University (PSU), under the direction
of Dr. Mark Horn, will produce two permanent courses. The main focus is creating
an upper division 3-credit couse that uses design to integrate the R&amp;D of
nano science and technology with analysis and reflective reasoning drawn from
disciplines in the liberal arts. The second course creates a one credit first
year pipeline that echoes the content of the first course while raising
students' awareness of the extraordinary potential of nano-science and
technology (S&amp;T), and of the opportunities for career development in
nanotechnology at PSU.
