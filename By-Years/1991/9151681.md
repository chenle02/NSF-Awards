This project is transforming the introductory mechanics laboratory so that
freshmen students gain experience with realistic electronic instrumentation
while learning the fundamentals of mechanics. The project is part of an
extensive curriculum development accompanying a change from a quarter calendar
to a semester one. New experiments are adding dynamic force transducers, sonar
rangers, digital readout strobe lighting, oscilloscopes, and digital readout
function generators to the air tracks, light gates, air-bearing rotational
apparatus, and PC computers previously used. The new experiments include non-
linear systems, small oscillations, static and dynamic unbalance in rotating
objects, and rotation of rigid bodies about a point. Such new topics as soft
modes, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and chaos are being included. Folded in
are an introduction to electronic instrumentation including use of
oscilloscopes, and study of wave forms, triggering, signal conditioning, and the
integration of computers into the measurement system. The new lab presents a
richer variety of important mechanical phenomena, is more interesting, and
better prepares the students for employment in a modern industrial or research
setting.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
