This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
photovoltaic devices based on tin (II) sulfide (SnS). The properties of SnS,
including bandgaps, carrier density and mobility, chemical and thermal
stability, and metallurgical properties, promise the possibility to achieve
relatively high conversion efficiency given state-of-art process control and
device design. In this project, close space sublimation (CSS) technique, a thin
film fabrication method proven for low cost and high manufacturability, will be
used to synthesize SnS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of
this project will be the potential to produce photovoltaic devices based on low-
cost and environmentally-friendly materials. There is no doubt that solar
electricity has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as an alternative
and renewable energy source. However, most of the current solar cell
technologies have one or more of the following issues that, (1) raw materials
are not abundantly available; (2) toxic materials are used; (3) overall cost is
high. This project will address these issues by developing photovoltaic devices
using SnS, a semiconductor material that can be supplied on a massive scale and
at low recovery costs. &lt;br/&gt;
