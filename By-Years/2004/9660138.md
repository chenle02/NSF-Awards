*** 9660138 Ivkovich This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a
novel approach to real-time process monitoring and MMI (man-machine interface)
feedback for manual welding. Direct and indirect (hidden) process information
will be used to improve stability and repeatability of the manual welding
process. Phase I will address operator-dependent variations in process control
and repeatability. These variations will be minimized by identifying welding
defects and implementing 'in-process' repair. Phase I will provide experimental
results which quantify performance feasibility for representative welding
candidate operations. This approach is expected to reduce welding re-work,
improve quality, and reduce weld inspection and testing requirements. Commercial
applications are expected in manual welding applications within the automotive,
aerospace, heavy manufacturing, ship-building, oil, petrochemical, process,
power generation, and machinery industry sectors. ***
