9603590 Levin The functional contacts between nerve cells are called synapses,
and the biochemical compounds that carry signals between the cells at the
synapse are called neurotransmitters. The transmitter molecules are captured on
the surface of the cell membrane of the target cell by molecules called
receptors. Classes of transmitters, like particular amino acids, or particular
catecholamine compounds, were known to have particular receptor types that
triggered particular responses in the post-synaptic cell. More recently,
subtypes of receptor molecules have been found, often with different chemical
binding affinities, molecular arrangement, and coupling mechanisms. This
symposium covers recent advances at the molecular level in understanding the
subtypes of the particular receptors called muscarinic receptors, which modulate
the responses of nerve and muscle cells to a widespread neurotransmitter called
acetylcholine. Support is to help cover some travel costs young investigators in
the field to be able to attend and deliver their own research results at this
meeting. This support will have an impact on fostering the career development of
young neuroscientists, and the symposium presentations will have an impact on
muscle and cardiovascular research as well as neuroscience.
