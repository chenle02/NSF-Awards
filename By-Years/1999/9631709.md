w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9631709 Murphy This Research Planning Grant will
provide support for research to investigate the possibility of using the newly
developed high mobility Si/SiGe heterostructures (by others) to study skyrmions.
These skyrmions are topological many-body excitations in a two dimensional
electron system (2DES) and have at present been observed in high mobility GaAs
material. The Si/SiGe material has potential for integrated circuit use and this
planning grant will attempt to control the valley splitting in Si/SiGe and tune
it to near zero in order to enhance the prospects to observe skyrmions.
Demonstration of tunability is the primary goal. %%% A predicted new type of
electron excitation in a planar electron system (two-dimensional) called
skyrmions has been observed in gallium arsenide material that can be made with
high electron mobility. This high electron mobility has recently been produced
in a silicon/silicon-germanium multilayer structure and this Research Planning
Grant will support the investigation of this new material in which skyrmions can
be identified. Since the silicon/silicon-germanium material has potential for
commercial use in the electronics industry the understanding of the behavior of
the excitations that affect the electron transport is of considerable interest.
