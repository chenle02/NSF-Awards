9311526 Jurik Dicranopteris linearis, a fern, is one of the most wide-ranging
species in the Old World tropics. This weedy, understory species is capable of
colonizing severely disturbed habitats such as landslides and lava flows, but
also can dominate late-successional forests and plantations. Preliminary studies
on Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii, indicate that this fern has impacts on forest
productivity and nutrient cycling that are disproportionately large, relative to
the fern's size. The physiological mechanisms and morphological attributes that
enable this species to dominate many sites, and that limit its appearance on
other sites, will be explored and related to broader scale community and
ecosystem patterns of plant productivity and nutrient cycling. The integration
of these various perspectives yields an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate
some of the plant-level mechanisms that control ecosystem- level processes. It
will be possible to test rigorously the effect of temperature on this fern's
physiology, growth and dominance and to relate these responses to community and
ecosystem-level dynamics. %%% The study of Dicranopteris linearis along a
gradient of sites that vary primarily in temperature also provides an
opportunity to relate the warming effect of global climate change to
vegetational patterns and processes. The study of how leaf-level processes in
Dicranopteris are linked to community-dominance patterns and ecosystem-level
processes along a temperature gradient will increase our understanding of how
species, communities and ecosystems may respond to global climate change. ***
