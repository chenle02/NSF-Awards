This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for a connection to enhance and accommodate research needs for the
University of Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham by
establishing a connection to the Very High Performance Backbone Network Service
(vBNS) in coordination with the Alabama Research and Education Network. Projects
in this proposal include: collaboration on thin film and particulate materials
for ultra high-density information storage, simulation of virus capsid assembly
from individual coat proteins, remote interactive design of inhibitors using
molecular modeling techniques, multisite three-dimensional brain visualization,
digital transmission of pediatric cardiology, remote use of astronomy
observatories, medical videoscope computer-assisted neurosurgery, ATM network
stress testing based on telepath paradigm, mobile network applications test-bed,
distributed parallel processing in "tuple-space", simulations of action
potential propagation in models of cardiac tissue, large scale simulations of
materials, and distance learning. With this high performance network capability
the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham will
expand current research and collaboration with both academic institutions and
federal laboratories. On this project, collaborating institutions include:
Washington University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota,
Harvard University, University of Nebraska, George Washington University,
University of California at San Diego, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, University
of Kentucky, MIT, Yale University, Columbia University, Auburn University,
University of Arizona, Georgia Institute of Technology, National Optical
Astronomy Observatories, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Ohio State University,
University of North Carolina, and Henry Ford Hospital.
