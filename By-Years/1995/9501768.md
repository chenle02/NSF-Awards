The goal of this project is two-fold. First, it seeks to study the communication
characteristics of applications that can benefit from the computing power, very
large memory, and high-speed communication of parallel computing systems. Within
this context measurements are being takel of the traffic generated by both
regular and irregular scientific applications, applications written in a variety
of programming paradigms, data-mining applications and applications with real-
time traffic demands. Second the project seeks to use the information gathered
from applications to guide the designs for interconnect devices and programmable
communication coprocessors that efficiently support multiple classes of
applications and multiple programming paradigms. The education plan addresses
two important issues in experimental computer science: First it addresses the
issue to teaching a subject area, such as high performance computing, that is
technology-driven and where the relevance of knowledge and information can have
a very short life span. Second, it addresses the issue of teaching the
methodology of experimentation and in particular the process of designing
experiments.
