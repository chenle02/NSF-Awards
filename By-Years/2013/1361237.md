The Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) proposes to continue providing
three mobile Doppler radars known as Doppler on Wheels (DOWs) as part of the
national Lower Atmosphere Observing Facility (LAOF) suite. The CSWR DOWs fulfill
an important role in the suite of NSF-supported lower atmosphere observing
facilities by providing a low-cost, nimble technology for obtaining critical
measurements at close-range to severe weather. Users of the DOWs have conducted
research into topics such as tornado genesis, winter storm development, winds
associated with hurricane landfall, and in-cloud microphysical processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DOWs are state-of-the-art X-band radars mounted on
purpose-built trucks to provide rapid access to weather phenomena of interest.
The facility consists of two dual-polarimetric X-band radars (DOWs 6 and 7) and
one multi-beam X-band (Rapid-Scan DOW) that provides very fast, high spatial
resolution data. During the next performance period (2014-2018), CSWR will
deploy the DOWs, as well as their Mesonet vehicles (truck-mounted mobile weather
stations) and "tornado pods", a collection of ruggedized, deployable,
instrumented structures designed to measure meteorological variables during
encounters with extreme weather, in support of research projects deemed to be of
exceptional merit by the peer review process. CSWR staff will maintain and
upgrade the instrumentation to facilitate cutting edge research in the areas of
atmospheric dynamics and cloud physics. Future deployments will be augmented by
the availability of the mobile mesonet sampling capability. CSWR will apply the
latest technologies in their radars in accord with community research needs and
plan to develop new mobile capabilities such as a mobile C-band
radar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past five years, the DOWs have been the
most requested lower atmosphere observing facility for educational and outreach
purposes. Since 2008, the DOWs and CSWR staff have deployed to eighteen
universities across the United States and have carried out extensive "on-the-
road" tours involving public displays and lectures that have reached over
100,000 members of the general public. CSWR expects to continue providing these
services as requested and has among its staff two credentialed teachers (one in
elementary education and another in high school science) who bring age-
appropriate pedagogy to the outreach events.
