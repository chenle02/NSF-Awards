Transmission electron microscope and other electron microbeam techniques are
being emphasized in studies of diagenesis through biotite-grade metamorphism of
fine-grained clastic sediments and igneous rocks. The focus is on charac-
terization of clay minerals, for which the high resolution techniques permit
direct structural, chemical and textural characterization. Comparison of
characterized samples that cover the range of a given process permit mechanisms
of transitions to be defined. This research emphasizes the parallel effects of
changing temperature, water/rock ratio and stress in promoting reactions in
metastable phases, for which transitions are in predictable Ostwald-step-rule-
like changes toward the equilibrium state generally reached at greenschist
facies conditions. Specific projects include: (1) Gulf Coast argillaceous
sediments, with emphasis on illite/smectite relations (2) quanti- tative studies
of the causes of variation in illite crystallinity (3) diagenesis through
biotite-grade metamorphism, with emphasis on processes causing textural changes
in southern New Zealand rocks, principally greywackes (4) low grade metamorphism
with contact metamorphic overprint in Welsh pelites (5) alteration of marine
basalts, emphasizing trioctahedral clay minerals in DSDP core 540B. Such studies
lead to a better understanding of diagenesis in clay-rich rocks which will have
important implications to oil and gas exploration.
