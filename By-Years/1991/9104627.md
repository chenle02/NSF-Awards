Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
the University of Pennsylvania and Ain Shams University is in the general area
of electromagnetic phenomena at metal surfaces. Project funding will allow the
team from Ain Shams University to work for various periods of time in the
laboratory of Dr. Elias Burstein at the University of Pennsylvania. The
collaborative research will investigate experimentally and theoretically the
contributions from surface electronic excitations to the linear and nonlinear
optical response of noble metal surfaces. Research results are expected to
ascertain the specific nature of the surface excitations involved. This project
in materials research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
