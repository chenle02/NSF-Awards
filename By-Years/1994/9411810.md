9411810 Wang Research equipment grant funds are used in this project for
acquisition of computer and automation equipment to support collaborative
research between the Robotics and Automation Laboratory and Advanced Mining
Systems Laboratory. Specific research projects include automated robotic
excavation using fuzzy logic and neural networks; automated rock drill operation
using adaptive force feedback control; and mechatronic design of high
performance robot arms. The equipment is utilized to conduct cross-disciplinary
experimental work, test innovative ideas and concepts in advanced robotic
research, and develop hands-on expertise in robotic applications. ***
