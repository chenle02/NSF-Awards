Undergraduate faculty in Chemical and Mechanical Engineering join with
industrial and academic professionals experienced in chemical process safety for
a two-week workshop that shows how safety fundmentals are used in the
application of chemical process safety in an industrial facility. Participants
are provided with background information and educational materials necessary for
teaching an effective safety course at their own institutions. Topics include:
toxicology, industrial hygiene, source modelling, fires and explosions,, relief
systems, toxic release, dispersion modelling, hazards identification and risk
assessment. The workshop participants develop problems on chemical process
safety suitable for use by undergraduates in existing chemical process safety
suitable for use by undergraduates in existing chemical engineering courses.
