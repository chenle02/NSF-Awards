We shall organize a Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences conference on
`Expansion Methods in Combinatorics' to take place in Memphis in May 2003. The
principal lecturer will be Christian Borgs of Microsoft Research and the
conference will be aimed at young researchers as well as established researchers
in combinatorics, computer science and other areas related to statistical
physics and probability theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although several methods
from statistical physics have already found applications in combinatorics and
theoretical computer science, one of the classical methods of statistical
mechanics, cluster expansion, has&lt;br/&gt;hardly been employed in these
fields. There is every reason to believe that in the right hands these expansion
techniques will find important and far-reaching applications in combinatorics
and theoretical computer science. For this reason, the conference will address
these important techniques with the twin aims of raising awareness of them and
working towards their simplification.&lt;br/&gt;
