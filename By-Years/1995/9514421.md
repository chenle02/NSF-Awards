9514421 Thompson Understanding the functioning of messenger molecules inside
cells is critical for a complete explanation of how nerve cells communicate.
Activation of molecular receptors on the surface of nerve cells by
neurotransmitter molecules unleashes a cascade of events, which is orchestrated
by the intracellular messengers. The key messenger is the concentration of
calcium ions, which controls the production of the gaseous neurotransmitter,
nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide, in turn, stimulates the production of the
cyclic nucleotide messenger, cGMP. Calcium ions, NO, and cGMP together regulate
numerous physiological events, including synaptic transmission and the opening
of membrane ion channels. The focus of this research project is on the dynamics
of calcium ion concentrations, which are affected by calcium release from
intracellular storage compartments and by calcium ion inflow through the cell
membrane. More specifically, the experiments are concerned with the internal
signaling pathway that is activated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors in
cultured cells. Techniques employed include the voltage clamp and calcium
imaging; these are combined with modern molecular techniques to examine in
detail rate-limiting steps in the activation of calcium release, for calcium
influx, and in the production of cGMP. It is expected that these experiments
will greatly advance our understanding of fundamental cellular mechanisms that
regulate signaling within nerve cells.
