This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the
technical and commercial feasibility of a realtime automatic accompaniment
technology. The proposed innovation would allow a computer to improvise in
realtime with a human musician. The intellectual merit of this proposal is in
researching a novel computational framework for modeling musical interaction.
Realtime improvisation is one of the most demanding cognitive tasks that humans
undertake. This proposal seeks to model the sequential structure of melodies and
realtime interaction between two improvising musicians. Although music is a
creative act, often full of small surprises, it nevertheless is highly
patterned. The prediction methods described in this proposal attempt to uncover
this structure through context-dependent models. Realtime musical interaction in
the context of tonal music is a relatively new area of research, and the
cognitive and musical strategies by which musicians coordinate are complex. The
research plan will explore whether this intuitive negotiation can be modeled
using game theory, with musically appropriate ideas of payoff. The researchers
will evaluate both methods using cross-entropy, an objective measure of how well
the predictive distribution matches the actual sequence data. The objective of
this proposal is to develop a RAA technology that facilitates technology-based
music creation among people that are not musically trained and, in so doing,
leads to a new class of self-expression products that represent a multi-billion
dollar commercial opportunity. Further, the approach may have clinical
applications in the areas of speech therapy for stroke patients suffering speech
loss and children with developmental disorders.
