This workshop is designed to provide undergraduate computer science faculty with
material and techniques for introducing the social and ethical impact of
computing in their courses. The primary focus is on a set of tutorials presented
by Dr. Judith Perrolle, a nationally known expert in the field. To provide the
participants with an effective method for introducing the material in the
classroom, each tutorial is followed by having the participants design exercises
in reinforcing the material in a cooperative learning context. The participants
are oriented to the many sources--books, periodicals, groups--available. A
separate video component emphasizes the value of video in such courses. The
workshop is scheduled for June 19-23, 1995, on the Bradford Campus of the
University of Pittsburgh. A follow-up session, two days long, where the
participants meet to exchange experience and materials on how they have
introduced this material in their courses, will be held in June, 1996.
