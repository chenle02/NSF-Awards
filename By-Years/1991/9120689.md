This project invoves multidisciplinary (seismic, magneto- telluric) transects
along and across the Sierra Nevada in order to examine the crust and upper
mantle beneath these mountains. The principal investigators resolve the cause of
uplift of the Sierra Nevada and its relation to the adjoining Death Valley
extensional province and the southern San Joaquin basin. Currently, two end-
member models for uplift of the range have been presented. These are: (a)
isostatic compensation of a deep crustal root and (b) upwelling of the
astenosphere associated with extension to the east. These two models have
fundamentally different consequences for the dynamic behavior of the continents,
particularly in the manner in which crustal sections are either (a) underplated
by materials from the upper mantle or (b) weakened and extruded to fill in
extensional voids. In addition to the uplift and related extension of comparable
mountain ranges worldwide, examples of globally significant features that will
be better understood by resolution of the Sierran root question include: factors
controlling the manner in which sialic basement nappes detach; how collision
zones collapse under their own burden; and how intra- continental transform
faults partition strain to and beyond the Moho.
