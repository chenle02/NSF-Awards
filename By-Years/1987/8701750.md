Smale, a recent Fields Medalist, will continue his studies in computational
complexity theory. In particular he will study Newton's method and variations of
this algorithm for solving equations. Smale's approach is to view iterative
algorithms dynamically. The implementation of the algorithm is viewed to a large
extent as a dynamical system and the results from dynamical systems theory are
then used to develop estimates on the global speed of convergence of the
algorithm rather than just estimates on the asymptotic rate of convergence.
