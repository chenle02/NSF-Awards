Proposal Number: 1440334&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Rogan,
Elizabeth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this OSA BIOMED conference is to
bring together people working in biomedical optics from academia and industry to
disseminate recent technological developments and novel applications in the
field, exchange and stimulate ideas, advance innovation in optics and optical
technologies, and promote clinical translation of optical technology. BIOMED is
a multidisciplinary conference&lt;br/&gt;aimed at not only biomedical optics
researchers, but basic scientists and clinicians, who are actively developing
biomedical optics technologies or utilizing optical technology to advance
clinical medicine and basic research. In addition to this core of biomedical
optical scientists, the organizers also hope to attract scientists with new or
upcoming photonic technologies that may have practical application in
biomedicine, including the field of nano-technology, optical&lt;br/&gt;probes
and agent chemistry.
