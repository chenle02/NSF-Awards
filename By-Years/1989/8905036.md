Extensions of previous experiments at high temperatures and high pressures in
the laser heated diamond anvil cell and calculations involving the detailed
pressure-temperature environment are to be carried out. The PI will reexamine
the phase loops involving the transformation in the magnesium-iron silicate in
the perovskite structure in both the olivine and pyroxene systems. The sharpness
of this phase loop, the partitioning of elements among coexisting phases, and
the Clayperon slopes of these reactions will be determined.
