Liquid aerosol thermolysis (LAT) refers to the general class of particle
synthesis processes in which a liquid precursor solution is atomized into
discrete droplets and subsequently transported through a
time/temperature/atmosphere-regulated reactor. The overall objective of the
proposed program is to establish a fundamental engineering science for the
synthesis of submicron, composite particles by liquid aerosol thermolysis.
Particle synthesis and solution experiments are designed to identify those
factors affecting solid composite particle formation and chemical distribution.
In situ technique will be used to monitor droplets generation and shrinkage
during the evaporation stage as a function of atomization, precursor solution
characteristics and evaporation conditions. After the evaporation stage, on-line
sampling will be used to obtain and characterize particles as a function of time
and temperature. Each process step will be mathematically analyzed using
information generated in the above experiments and evaluated against existing or
derived models for those processes. Model systems, based on alumina precursors
as the matrix phase, have been selected examine first the synthesis of
homogeneous composite systems in which the nanocrystalline phases are uniformly
dispersed and second, those in which one phase encapsulates the other. Zinconia
and platinum in alumina allow use to examine issues associated with uniform
precipitation whereas alumina-SiC allows us the possibility to examine the
isolation of one phase (SiC) within another (i.e. intragranular). The proposed
techniques aim to production of nanocrystalline materials of a wide
compositional range and having 100 nm crystallinity, of desired uniformity and
second phase distribution.
