Title: Mesoporous PVDF Thin Film Device for Implantable Cardiac Power Generation

Goals: The PI will design flexible porous polymer film power generators that
convert cardiac motion into electricity to recharge implantable devices



Nontechnical:

Energy consumption and battery replacement are among the most challenging
problems with permanently implanted biomedical devices. This research addresses
the fundamental issues related to the creation of robust, scalable, energy-
relevant nanomaterials and implantable microsystems that work with the
extraordinary effectiveness of biomechanical motion and processes of the human
heart. The potential benefits of the research in advancing the field include the
development of a broad class of tunable nanomaterials networks to tailor energy
conversion characteristics at the level of a single layer of nanomaterials, with
potential translational applications in energy efficient biochips for diagnostic
sensing, biomarker identification, and therapeutic drug delivery. Life
scientists, engineering researchers, graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained in key emerging areas of biomedical engineering.

Technical:

The objective of this project is to lay the foundation for constructing and
evaluating different highly flexible and conformable multilayered piezoelectric
polymer devices for converting the mechanical displacement of the heart into
electrical energy. While the longevity of an average implantable cardiac
defibrillators (ICD) patient with congestive heart failure has increased to 10
years after implantation, the battery for an automatic implantable cardiac
defibrillators (AICD) needs to be replaced typically every 4-5 years depending
on the degree of pacing and/or occurrence of defibrillation. This mismatch poses
a significant and ever growing clinical and economic burden since replacing the
battery requires a surgery. An innovative solution to increase AICD battery
lifetimes is to harness the robust energy of the heart and convert it to
electrical power. The hypothesis of this proposal is that flexible and
conformable poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer films containing mesoporous
structures at both surfaces and throughout the bulk can be embedded inside the
current dead spaces of the AICD leads to convert the mechanical motion of the
heart into electrical energy by exploiting the piezoelectricity of PVDF. The
research methods include: 1. Design flexible micro-power generators made of
porous PVDF layers that can be interfaced with current AICD lead technology; 2.
Develop computational model of cardiac power generation devices based on 3D RV
heart motion to allow for optimal design and power efficiency; 3. In vitro
quantification of mechano-electrical coupling of the power generator presents to
an AICD lead.
