9520262 Warlick The University of Texas at Austin proposes to hold a "Workshop
for Broadening Participation in Regional Affiliates Program," and is aimed
directly at links to the NSF Supercomputer Centers and the MetaCenter Regional
Alliances, two major programs of ASC. In this regard, Austin is the logical
representative of CASC, the Coalition of Academic Supercomputer Centers, which
has more than 20 members of state and regional academic supercomputer centers.
CASC has invited more than 75 like minded organizations, including NSF
Engineering Research Centers and Science and Technology Centers, to work in
shared areas forging stronger links to the major supercomputer centers, to
strengthen the national information infrastructure.
