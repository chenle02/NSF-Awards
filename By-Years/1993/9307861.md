This is an award to support international travel of the Principal Investigator
to an international conference on carbon dioxide management at which he has been
invited to present a paper at the plenary session on deep ocean placement of
excess amounts of this gas. Other issues to be addressed at this conference
include dispersal modeling and engineering design of systems to place the carbon
dioxide in deep ocean locations, hydrate formation and biological effects of
this management practice. Results of this project are expected to provide
guidance for program management relating to better utilization of the ocean for
waste management than is now possible with existing knowledge.
