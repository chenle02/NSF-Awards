9614483 Ritzwoller This grant provides $34,500 as partial support of the costs
of acquiring a new multi-CPU server and peripherals for the Geophysics group at
the University of Colorado. Specifically, the equipment which will be purchased
includes a dual CPU Sun Ultra SPARC Enterprise 3000 server with a 256 Mb memory
expansion and 27 Gb of mass storage to be used for computationally intensive
geophysical modeling and data analysis including inversions of large seismic
data sets, modeling of the anelastic and elastic properties of the Earth's
crust, lithosphere and mantle, modeling of the geomagnetic field and mantle
dynamics and calculation of the effects of tides, earthquakes and isostatic
adjustments on the geoid. Funding of this grant is provided through both the
Earth Science's Instrumentation and Facilities Program ($22,000) and the Office
of Polar Program's Geology and Geophysics Program. ***
