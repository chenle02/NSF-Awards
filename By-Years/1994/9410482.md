9410482 Wathugala A general numerical procedure based on the strain path
method, mixture theory and non-linear finite element method will be developed
that will simulate pile driving, subsequent consolidaiton and pile load tests.
This numerical method will be verified by simulating laboratory tests. An
instrumented pile segment model which can continuously measure and record shear
transfer, pore pressure and total radial pressure will be fabricated and tested.
Four clay samples with different overconsolidation rations, confining pressures
and drainage conditions will be studied in these tests. ***
