We live in a time of great progress in the observational and theoretical study
of the relationship of the very small and the very large in our universe. This
field has come to be known as Astro-Particle physics, and is concerned with such
questions as the nature of the dark matter which seems to "seed" galaxies and
clusters of galaxies, the process of formation of galaxies, and the origin and
age of the universe itself. This grant provides partial support for an
international conference of active workers studying these exciting questions.
