This Presidential Young Investigator award is for the support of Dr. Malik's
outstanding work in computer vision. He has already brought deep mathematical
insight to innovative problems in shape from shading, curved-object recognition
using aspect graphs, and scale-space approaches to edge detection and early
vision. He plans to continue work in image segmentation, shape recovery, and
object recognition. Dr. Malik is also an excellent speaker and a promising
teacher, having graduated one outstanding Ph.D. student and co-authored papers
with several others.
