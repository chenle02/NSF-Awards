This proposal discusses the use of nonlinear dynamical systems theory in solving
several long-standing problems of fluid mixing and flow separation. On the
mathematical side, it will advance the theory of nonhyperbolic invariant
manifolds, inertial manifolds, advection-diffusion and dynamo equations, finite-
time invariant sets, stability of nonautonomous systems, and aperiodic
averaging. On the fluid mechanical side, the proposed work will broaden the
understanding of three-dimensional unsteady fluid separation, diffusive tracer
mixing, the topology of three-dimensional vortices, and the origin of dynamo
action in the induction equations.

In a broader sense, the proposal describes new approaches to nonlinear dynamical
phenomena in oceanic and aerodynamic flows. Such phenomena have traditionally
been poorly understood, because advanced mathematical theories, notably
dynamical systems theory, have been underutilized in their study. The
investigator proposes new theoretical tools for describing how different
substances mix, and how high-speed fluid separates from boundaries. The proposal
discusses how the results can improve ocean feature detection and prediction,
advance aerodynamic design and aviation technology, and impact the design of
efficient chemical mixers.
