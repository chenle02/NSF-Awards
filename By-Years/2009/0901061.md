The objective of this research is to combine a high-mobility semiconductor and a
highly piezoelectric material to produce acoustic charge transfer (ACT) devices
giving performance significantly improved over current devices. ACTs were
developed from surface-acoustic wave filters to be capable of complex
programmable filtering functions on high-speed analog signals. The approach is
to exploit chip-to-chip bonding techniques to fabricate a novel structure
consisting of a piezoelectric substrate supporting a quantum-well.
&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is to enable transformational
improvement of ACT devices which currently need high power input to propel
charges using a weakly piezoelectric semiconductor. Using a highly piezoelectric
material, the power input requirement for moving charge through the quantum-well
layer is substantially reduced. Initial estimates using available data show over
one thousand times reduction in the input power required (e.g., from 0.35W to
300Ã¬W using typical device design parameters). This level of improvement is
unprecedented and if successful would allow ACT devices to take their place as
an important and competitive signal-processing device rather than as a power-
hungry curiosity. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include capitalizing on the PI?s
frequent appearances as a scientific communicator in the broadcast media;
transforming the electronic device landscape by allowing ACT usage in
applications where power is at a premium; integrating research and educational
goals by providing support to undergraduate Senior Design projects as well as
training graduate students in techniques of both signal-processing and
microfabrication, essential for future technology development; and promotion of
diversity through close involvement in University minority programs.
