9753160 Shireen Intelligent power distribution systems must be developed to
switch, protect and manage the distribution of power in a number of
applications. A key element in any power distribution system is the circuit
breaker. A solid state, MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT) circuit breaker will be
investigated, which promises lower conduction losses and higher operating
temperatures than traditional devices, thereby enabling more efficient solid
state switching. This grant provides the PI with opportunity to strengthen the
Power Electronics and Power Conversion program at the University of Houston by
establishing a well equipped graduate power electronics laboratory, and to serve
as a visible role model, attracting and improving retention rates of young women
in the power electronics field. ***
