Highly promising mathematical programming techniques applied to medical
diagnosis and prognosis as well as to machine learning in general. Five years of
experience with a highly accurate system for breast cancer diagnosis, in current
use at University of Wisconsin Hospitals, is drawn upon to develop a linear-
programming-based prognostic system. Parallel algorithms for the solution of
large-scale constrained optimization problems are developed, by distributing
ingredients of the problem (constraints, gradients, or/and variables) among
parallel processors. Each processor has complete responsibility for varying its
own problem ingredients, while allowing the other ingredients to vary in a
restricted fashion. The processors share new information computed, then a fast
synchronization is performed and the process is repeated. Preliminary algorithm
prototypes have been tested successfully with some high parallelization
efficiency on publicly available test problems and significant real-world
applications. Error bounds are developed for possibly inconsistent systems of
inequalities, programs and complementarity problems. The novel idea here is that
the system may be unsolvable, and the bounds are meaningful whether the system
is solvable or not. In the latter case, it bounds the distance between the point
under consideration, and the set of least error solutions of the system. New
mathematical programming approaches to some machine learning problems are
studied. In particular a new quadratic programming model for a cascade
architecture in neural networks is being studied, as is another one for the
inherently difficult problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by
a separating plane.
