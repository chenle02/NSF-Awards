This exploratory effort at Savannah State University will develop and test the
framework of an innovative Business of Engineering Education Model (BEEM) which
facilitates understanding and measuring the impacts of teaching, mentoring, and
advisement upon student outcomes such as retention, graduation, and career
success. After research to develop the model is complete, a pilot test of the
model will be conducted for a selected number of K-12 middle and high school
students, engineering faculty, and engineering students at the freshman and
sophomore levels. Data from the pilot test will be compared to model predictions
to test the accuracy of the model. Several workshops will be held, and
dissemination of results and findings will use a dedicated web site for the
business model and publications. This project will be the first step toward the
development of a sustainable and effective full-scale business model that will
be available for widespread use by other members of the engineering education
community.

Increasing the number and diversity of engineering students is necessary to
provide the technical workforce needed for the future. This project will take
steps toward understanding factors that influence retention and graduation rates
from a business model perspective which will be developed in collaboration with
K-12, higher education, and business/industry partners.
