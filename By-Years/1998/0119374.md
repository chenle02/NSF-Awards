The project will take aerial photographs of the same terrain photographed
approximately 50 years previously to examine changes in the environment,
particularly the expansion of areas dominated by shrubs. Shrub size, density,
and extent will be compared between the old scenes and the new photographs to
see if previous results from a pilot study are applicable to a wider area of the
North Slope. The northward expansion of shrubs is an expected response to
climate warming and will have important implications for global change research
in an area expected to experience the first impacts from global warming. On-site
measurements of vegetation indices (e.g. vegetation age, size, dimensions,
composition, spacing, growth rates) will be used in comparison with temperature
history to assess the impacts of warming climate on shrub growth/expansion in
the region.
