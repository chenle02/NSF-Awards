An active area of research in commutative algebra since the 1950s has involved
the use of homological methods to characterize Noetherian rings and the
homomorphisms between them. In the 1960s, simplicial methods were used to enable
homotopy theory to apply to commutative algebras and develop richer homological
techniques. This project seeks to use homotopy theory to characterize
(simplicial) commutative algebras with a Noetherian property. Part of this
effort will seek to resolve a conjecture of Quillen on the rigidity of the
homology of commutative algebras and draw deeper connections between simplicial
methods and methods from differential homological algebra. This project will
also study how the cohomology of algebras can serve as host for obstructions to
realizing a topological space from given algebraic data that functions as the
value of a suitable homotopy invariant of the putative space. Attention will be
paid to developing methods for computing such obstructions.

Homotopy theory is a method of studying certain mathematical objects and the
relations between them from a global perspective. In the case of geometric
objects, certain algebraic invariants can be assigned to study and distinguish
between homotopy types. Understanding the properties of these algebraic
structures and how they relate to the geometric objects they are associated to
are therefore important parts of this theory. This project seeks to further the
understanding of the homotopy theory of geometric objects from the algebraic
perspective. There are two aims to this project. The first is to develop further
the homotopy theory of algebras that parallels that of geometric objects. The
second aim seeks to make use of the homotopy of algebras and their various
properties to understand the homotopy of spaces. This would involve studying the
extent to which algebraic structures and properties can be lifted to
corresponding structures and properties for geometric objects.
