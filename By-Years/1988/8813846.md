It has long been suggested that aircraft flying through supercooled clouds
might cause the formation of ice particles. Recent observations of these
Aircraft Produced Ice Particles (APIPs) have indicated that the effect might be
quite pronounced. The magnitude of the APIPs phenomenon and the conditions under
which it occurs is of importance in interpreting the results from previous
experiments which used research aircraft and in planning future projects. The
Principal Investigators propose a field experiment to test the hypothesis that
APIPs are caused by aerodynamic cooling in the vortices created behind propeller
and wing tips. The experimental sight will be near Mono Lake, California which
is known for frequent and stable supercooled fogs in the wintertime. The
Principal Investigators will use a range of aircraft in this "natural
laboratory" to produce APIPs while quantitatively sampling the resultant ice
particles using a state of the art research aircraft.
