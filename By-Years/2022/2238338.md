This project seeks to reduce uncertainties in wildfire smoke modeling in order
to enhance our ability to make forecasts of smoke events and improve smoke
advisories to the general population. This would not only enhance our
understanding of wildfire smoke events, but also reduce harmful pollutant
exposures for communities affected by wildfire events and provide new tools for
decision makers and the public. Existing observations will be used to update
wildfire smoke models, and wildfire smoke forecasters will receive training and
share knowledge via regular workshops. Feedback from these end user wildfire
smoke forecasters will be incorporated into the research plan to ensure that new
knowledge gained during the course of this work will not only advance the field
but also reach communities affected by wildfire smoke events.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three primary tasks included in this proposal.
First, satellite and ground-based observations of smoke and smoke-relevant
variables will be collected and assessed for their viability of usage within
wildfire smoke models. Second, these observations will be used to evaluate and
improve smoke simulations via improvements to model parameterizations such as
smoke emissions, injection heights, chemical evolution, and optical properties.
Finally, training will be conducted to potential end users of the updated
wildfire smoke forecasting system with the goal of developing a framework for
evaluating and establishing routine or operational smoke forecasting systems.
Additionally, this work will provide potential end users with a platform for
developing and sharing methods for routine or operational wildfire smoke
forecasting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
