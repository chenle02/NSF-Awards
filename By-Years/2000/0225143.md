This award supports participants in The Third IMACS International Conference on
Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory, held
at the University of Georgia on 7-10 April 2003. The interdisciplinary meeting,
sponsored by the International Association for Mathematics and Computers in
Simulation, focuses on computational and theoretical aspects of nonlinear waves
and optical solitons, and brings together researchers in applied mathematics,
computational mathematics, and applied physics. Topics of interest include
theoretical aspects of solitons and integrability, nonlinear waves in fluids,
symbolic and numeric computations for integrable evolution equations, numerical
methods for nonlinear waves (symplectic, IST and Fast Fourier methods, adaptive
methods of lines, parallel algorithms), nonlinear waves in optics, dispersion
managed solitons in optical fibers, and advances in modeling optical fiber
transmission systems. The interdisciplinary meeting will provide excellent
opportunities for communication and collaboration between senior and junior
researchers.
