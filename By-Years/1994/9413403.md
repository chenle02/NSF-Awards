A novel system, based on two video cameras, is developed to quantify the
position of a moving subject. Human operators will track the subject with
cameras that rotate. The innovative feature of the system is its ability to
record the pan and tilt directions of each camera as the cameras are moved. The
direction angles are measured by optical shaft encoders and stored on the image
at video frame rates in bar code format. These angles and the pixel coordinates
of the subject in the video images will be used to calculate the position of the
subject in three-dimensional space. The data gathered will establish the
feasibility of building a portable video camera system to study animal
locomotion out of doors.
