This award provides support for the assembly of what is known as a piston-
cylinder apparatus used for the study of materials at high pressures and
temperatures (up to 50 kilobars and 2000 degrees Kelvin). Funds are also
provided for the shipping of a 2000-ton press from Ohio to Cambridge,
Massachusetts where it will be incorporated by the Principal Investigator into
an experimental high-pressure system. The press is being donated to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology by the General Electric Superabrasive
Division in Worthington, Ohio. The upgraded high-pressure systems will be used
in experiments whose purpose is to define solid-melt chemical reactions that are
relevant to the formation of magmas in the earth's lower crust and upper mantle,
and to determine the temperature and pressure conditions of these reactions.
