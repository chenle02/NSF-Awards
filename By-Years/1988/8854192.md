The State University of New York College at Brockport, in cooperation with the
U.S. National Weather Service, will conduct an Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement
Workshop for Teachers of Introductory Courses with Weather Content. The two week
workshop will be held July 25 - August 5, 1988, at the National Weather Service
Training Center in Kansas City, Missouri, for 25 selected undergraduate college
instructors of weather-related introductory courses. The major purposes of the
workshop are (a) to bring participants up-to-date on those technologies and
techniques used in meteorology to detect, analyze, and forecast weather, and (b)
to equip and encourage these teachers to use the latest in telecommunicated
weather information and instructional materials in their classrooms. In addition
to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will contribute about 15% in travel
costs to the operation of the project.
