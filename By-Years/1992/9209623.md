University Cooperative Research Center on Intelligent Information Retrieval was
established at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst in 1992. NSF in
partnership with the State of Massachusetts and 18 other companies both large
and small support the program. This program addresses scientific issues that are
key to the efficient access, management and control of information. The core
research program includes four thrust areas, 1) information retrieval, 2)
natural language processing, 3) case based reasoning and 4) control
architectures. The Industrial Advisory Board which is composed of one
representative from each of the member companies is actively participating in
this program particularly in the area of medical information retrieval. The
Industrial Advisory Board also provides guidance and evaluation of the research
program. More than 15 papers have been accepted for publication for the research
work that has been completed since the start of the Center.
