The Pomona College Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to
teaching students how to investigate and solve scientific problems and a strong
tradition of involving undergraduates in biological research in meaningful ways.
In the REU Sites program at Pomona College students will work jointly with
Ph.D.-holding faculty advisors on projects in a variety of fields, including
molecular biology, population and behavioral biology, physiology and cell
biology. Students will also participate in a number of support activities that
will provide them with the opportunity to discuss their projects with other
student researchers and with younger students who are considering doing
research. The student-faculty research community will hold regular informal
research meetings and open houses. All students will present the results of
their work at a science poster conference. This award will foster the continued
education and training of individuals who will be part of the next generation of
basic researchers in the biological sciences.
