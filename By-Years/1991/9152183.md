The Department of Geological Sciences is purchasing a variety of optical
equipment for use in a three-tiered approach to undergraduate education. The
first tier is use of video- integrated microscopes in the introductory-level
laboratories to increase student comprehension and laboratory productivity. The
second level is the introduction of video technology into the upper-division
undergraduate laboratories studying texture, composition and optical propoerties
of minerals and rocks. The third level is the establishment of an undergraduate
research microscopy laboratory.
