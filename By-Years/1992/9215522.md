The purpose of this project is to (1) organize and conduct the Fifth U.S.-Japan
Workshop on Earthquake Disaster Prevention for Lifeline Systems, and (2)
initiate a joint research activity between U.S. and Japanese investigators
interested in the earthquake performance of telecommunication systems. This
Workshop will be held in Tsukuba, Japan in the fall of 1992. The Workshop is
intended to provide an opportunity for researchers, designers, and construction
specialists to exchange discussions and ideas on the current state-of- the-art
in seismic risk assessment and design for lifelines, what future directions
should be pursued to improve current methods, and what mutual programs between
the U.S. and Japan can be initiated so that the most effective use of available
information is maximized. A joint U.S.-Japan database on seismic performance of
telecommunication facilities will be developed for use by U.S. and Japanese
investigators. This project is a part of the U.S.- Japan Natural Resources
(UJNR) Program.
