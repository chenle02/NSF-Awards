The University of Hawaii Manoa, located on the island of Oahu, will implement
the project entitled: "Hawai'i Kumu-Ola: Source of Knowledge Program". This
five-year TCUP project will adapt a successful Native American recruitment and
retention model used at Oregon State University to increase the number of Native
Hawaiians and underrepresented students in STEM fields of
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will endeavor to increase the number of
Native Hawaiian and underrepresented students by: integrating traditional
ecological knowledge in core courses; assisting teachers and students in the
establishment of math learning communities; providing students with exchange,
mentoring and internship opportunities; involving students in "hands-on" field-
based learning; assisting students in their transition from high school to
college; and involving students in the production and delivery of television and
internet media used in program outreach.&lt;br/&gt;
