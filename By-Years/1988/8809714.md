This award to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
(VPI&amp;SU) establishes a Science and Technology Center for High-Performance
Polymeric Adhesives and Composites. The Director of the Center is Professor
James E. McGrath. The Center for High-Performance Polymeric Adhesives and
Composites focussess on the performance of these new materials by investigations
into synthesis and characterization, processing (the development of adhesive
bonds and the preparation of composites), interfacial phenomena (both
fundamental surface science issues and tribology), and mechanical behavior of
the composite structures. The integration of these major areas is designed to
permit a concerted attack on major scientific problems, the goal being to
provide the basis for developing improved materials with superior performance or
manufacturing characteristics. Approximately 20 senior researchers from four
academic departments at VPI&amp;SU - namely Chemistry, Chemical Engineering,
Engineering Science and Mechanics, and Mechanical Engineering - participate in
the Center activities. Chemists, engineers, and materials scientists work
collaboratively in the Center to develop methods to understand and predict the
performance of adhesively bonded and composite systems. A major goal is to
provide a connection among molecular, interfacial, and micromechanical phenomena
in polymeric systems and their macroscopic mechanical properties. Emphasis is
being placed on new types of thermoplastic matrix materials for composites,
which have the potential of providing better properties and facilitating the
automated production of composites. Quantitative relationships between
mechanical properties, interfacial chemistry and microstructure are sought to
deal with the failure and fracture of adhesively bonded materials and predict
their performance. Vigorous outreach programs with industry and with other
colleges and universities, including minority institutions, form an important
part of the Center's activities.
