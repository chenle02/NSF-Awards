0124401&lt;br/&gt;Wood&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to optimize
the activity and expression of monooxygenases for the purpose of converting
naphthalene to 1-naphthol and (chiral) styrene epoxide. Replacing the current
method for producing 1-naphthol and styrene epoxide with the proposed enzymatic
alternative may prove to be more environmentally benign in that less solvent and
by-product wastes will result. There are two components to the work: (1) enzyme
"breeding" (University of Connecticut) and (2) regulation of expression and
bioprocess optimization (University of Maryland), which are highly
synergistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
