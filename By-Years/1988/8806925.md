The economical solution of complex three dimensional fluid flow problems by
direct numerical simulation techniques requires simultaneous, compatible
advances on the algorithmic and architectural fronts. The architectural
foundations for the next ten-fold improvement in simulation performance are now
established in the form of resource efficient massively parallel processors.
Work to date on parallel algorithms has focussed on the fundamental aspects of
parallel soultion of partial differential equations (e.g., load balancing,
communication latency) in the context of simple discretizations of idealized in
non-general geometires. The extensions of these parallel concepts and constructs
to the numerical solution of complex engineering flow problems is the subject of
the current proposal. The ultimate goal is the parallel solution of a broad
class of flow problems at supercomputer speed, but at a fraction of current
supercomputer cost.
