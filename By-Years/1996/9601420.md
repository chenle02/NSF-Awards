9601420 Farell This Americas Program award will support a collaborative research
project between Dr. Cesar Farell, University of Minnesota, and Dr. Rafael
Guarga, Instituto de Mecanica de los Fluidos e Ingenieria Ambiental, Universidad
de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay (IMFIA). The objective is to carry out
comparative studies of the performance of two boundary layer wind tunnels, one
in Montevideo, under the direction of IMFIA and the other at the St. Anthony
Falls Laboratory (SAFL), Minnesota. The proposed program will provide prototype
performance data for several of the tunnel components. Simulations of
atmospheric boundary layers in both tunnels would be compared, with attention to
the effects of turbulence and its scales on the mean and fluctuating pressures
on building models. Considerable advances have been made in ongoing research to
investigate critical issues in the modeling of atmospheric boundary layers, but
there are many aspects of the techniques that still require investigation.
Results of this research, which complements earlier NSF funded work related to
the design and evaluation of the SAFL tunnel, would make a contribution toward a
better understanding of the flow dynamics and the identification of essential
modeling requirements. The benefit to the U.S. research effort will be in added
manpower, and broadened scope of work to include different component geometries
and scales, and the opportunity to advance the international exchange of
scientific knowledge. ***
