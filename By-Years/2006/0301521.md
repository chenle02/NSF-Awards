The goal of this research project is to synthesize and implement combined
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mechanical methods that afford quantitative
spatially-resolved images of material mechanical properties, with subsequent
application of the methods towards the industrial sensing. The initial phases of
the research will be devoted mainly to ex-situ static elastography MRI schemes
that map Young's modulus in heterogeneous materials external to an applied
magnetic field. The study will then move towards the development of two sensors:
a macroscopic unit and a microscopic unit. While similar principles are involved
in both sensors, the size and scale of the sensing units will be emphasized,
with the former aimed at inch length-scales and the latter emphasizing micron
length-scales. These efforts will be coordinated with the development of
computer algorithms crafted to take material displacement measurements as inputs
and yield spatial maps of Young's modulus as outputs. The final phase of the
work will be devoted to producing microelastograms and macroelastograms of
samples determined by collaboration with industry, as well as samples that might
demonstrate new scientific value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
