Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on the recently
discovered top quark and on the `Higgs` particle predicted to exist as part of
the mechanism which may explain the origin of mass. Analyses will be done which
will make it possible to determine the properties of the top quark (especially
its mass) from experimental studies despite the complex relation between these
properties and the experimental observations. Analyses facilitating the
determination of the properties of the Higgs particle from future experiments
will be done as well. Learning the properties of the top quark and of the Higgs
particle is centrally important to our learning more about the nature of the
elementary particles and their interactions, and about the origin of mass. The
project will also have an educational component in which an effort will be made
to make physics more accessible to introductory students. An effort will also be
made to increase the participation of women in physics by providing teaching
internships for undergraduate women, and by the principal investigator serving
as a role model for women.
