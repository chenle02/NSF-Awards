The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center will conduct a two week (ten day)
project-oriented workshop on the fundamentals of VLSI design and CAD tool usage.
This workshop will be directed towards EE faculty with little experience in VLSI
design, EE faculty with expertise in VLSI but little familiarity with the design
tools available in an academic environment, and CS faculty with minimal
acquaintance with electronic engineering. The goal of the course is to equip the
faculty with the resources necessary to conduct an undergraduate course in VLSI
design that would culminate in the fabrication and subsequent test of student-
designed chips. Topics will include an introduction to UNIX, device behavior,
design methodology, design styles, and process fundamentals. Lectures will be
supplemented by design and simulation laboratory exercises on CAD workstations.
Emphasis will be on public-domain CAD tools in a UNIX environment. The course
will culminate in the fabrication of individual projects. Fabricated chips will
be mailed to participants shortly after the end of the workshop.
