With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Rochester will acquire a gas chromatograph mass
spectrometer (GC/MS). This equipment will support research in a number of areas
including the synthesis of natural products, development of photoresponsive
polymers and organic electroluminescent materials, and studies of catalyts and
catalytic mechanisms. The proposed MS instrumentation will support for the
education and training of more than 60% of the 80 graduate and 30 postdoctoral
students in the Chemistry Department. In addition, the instrument will support
the collaborative academic/industrial research of two NSF GOALI projects. The
equipment will also be used by undergraduate students and high school teachers,
including those from underrepresented groups, which are supported as summer-
research visitors in the Chemistry Department's NSF REU/RET site.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection
(GC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique for the separation and analysis of
complex mixtures and is a workhorse method for a wide range of chemical research
projects. It allows high-resolution separation of the components of complex
mixtures and provides simultaneous structural information to help identify the
individual components.&lt;br/&gt;
