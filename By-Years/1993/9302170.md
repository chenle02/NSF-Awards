The role that eddies and Rossby waves generated by instabilities of the wind-
driven circulation have in forcing the deep western boundary currents and the
abyssal circulation will be studied using a combination of analytical and
numerical models with increasing complexity. Of particular interest are the
effects of the continental rise on eddy-driven circulation beneath the Gulf
Stream and the weakly non-linear wave-mean flow interactions between a bottom
trapped current and topographic Rossby waves.
