The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60 MHz Fourier transform nmr for use
throughout the chemistry program. Students in Organic Chemistry are using the
instrument to characterize the products of synthetic reactions and to confirm
orientation rules. Introduced to advanced techniques such as the use of chiral
shift reagents and spin decoupling techniques are being undertaken in a upper
level Organic Chemistry laboratory. Physical Chemistry students are studying
line broadening by paramagnetic species and the kinetics of chemical reactions
with the instrument.
