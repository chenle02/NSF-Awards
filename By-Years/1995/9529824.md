9529824 Young A mechanistic understanding of potential vorticity mixing and
homogenization will be developed by constructing streamfunctions that are
solutions of the equations of motion, and in which particle trajectories exhibit
sensitive dependence on ilitial conditions. The main objective is to show that
critical layer absorption of Rossby waves radiated by meandering boundary
currents leads to irreversible deformation of potential vorticity and the
potential vorticity homogenization of the flanking recirculating gyres. Another
objective of this study is to examine potential vorticity in zonal flows, and in
particular the marginal stability and potential vorticity evolution during the
nonlinear equilibration of unstable waves.
