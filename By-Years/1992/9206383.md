The overall goal of this research is to develop continuous reactor strategies
which overcome the inherent limitations of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) transcription
in batch reactors so that efficient production of oligoribonucleotides in useful
quantities (gram scale or greater) can be made possible. Synthesis of RNA
molecules can be carried out using an RNA polymerase and synthetic or plasmid
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) templates. Because of their expense, this requires
that both the polymerase and the DNA template be retained in the bioreactor, and
that the unreacted nucleoside triphosphate precursors be recycled. Exploratory
studies are to be carried out on the activity of the transcription reaction when
the DNA template and the RNA polymerase are immobilized (either separately or
together) on microspheres with reactive surface groups. Feasibility studies will
also be undertaken on the use of ultrafiltration membranes for separating the
RNA product transcripts from the reaction mixture.
