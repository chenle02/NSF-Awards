9509751 Kerkhoven This research will focus on the development of numerical
simulation approaches suitable for the analysis and design of nanostructures.
The investigations will address quantum wire and quantum dot structures, with
the goal to develop comprehensive physical and numerical models that can explain
the results of measurements on experimental nanostructures, in a wide range of
temperatures. The work will also consider new structures based on modification
of existing silicon technology scaled into the nanometer range. A major effort
will be in the area of 3-D models, to extend previous work to even more
realistic situations, and improve the ability to treat extremely large numerical
problems efficiently. Among other problems of interest is the development of
direct numerical approaches for the characterization of atomic cluster, like the
writing tip of a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) in proximity of the surface
of a nanostructure and 3-D solvers for the optical behavior of microstructure
semiconductor lasers with surface emitting topology. For both applications, the
unique approaches that were developed earlier for the solution of large sparse
eigenvalue problems for semiconductor structures, will be adapted and extended.
