Systemic Change project in four rural school districts in Virginia. The four
districts have an elementary population of 644 teachers. All of these teachers
will receive professional development for school reform if a full grant is
funded. A planning committee and site based teams will design a process for
selecting K-8 curriculum materials and the process for delivering professional
development in the four districts. The requested funding from National Science
Foundation is $49,935 with a cost share estimated as $99,354 for a 24 month
project.
