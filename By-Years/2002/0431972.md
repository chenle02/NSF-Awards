The University of California at Merced is a completely new campus. It provides a
unique intellectual environment for defining an academic culture without having
to expend money, time or effort to dismantle pre-existing departmental
structures or boundaries. Service learning (SL) experiences are being created
for all undergraduate students, to achieve a three-fold impact on engineering
education: (1) enhancing the quality of the education, (2) increasing the
recruitment, retention and diversity of engineering students and (3) changing
the culture of engineering in academia. The unique circumstances at UC Merced
are ideal for testing the effectiveness of the SL experience. They are part of
the NSF-EPICS program led by Purdue University and have strong support from
community organizations. The campus draws its students largely from the
predominantly Hispanic community in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are
creating a culture of service learning in engineering education, where
departmental separations are non-existent and majors only appear on paper. The
project has the potential to be a showcase and to make strong contributions in
engineering education reform as well as improve recruitment and retention and
diversity. Given the school's location, this project has the potential to
attract a large Hispanic student base. Because students at all levels
participate - freshmen to seniors - the project can have maximum reform impact.
