Dr. Mario A. Alpuche-Aviles of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Nevada, Reno, is supported by a Career Award from the Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the NSF Division of Chemistry.
The research being conducted involves nanoparticle electron transfer reactions
that are of importance in photocatalysis, a process that enables conversion of
light into chemical energy. New approaches to their study are being developed
with potential application in the design of more efficient energy conversion
schemes based on photocatalysis of semiconductor nanoparticles in solution. The
long-term goal of the project is to understand the interdependence between
photocatalytic properties of semiconductor nanoparticles and nanoparticle size
and shape. These photocatalytic properties will be determined from interactions
between semiconductor nanoparticles and electrodes with diameter of a few
micrometers or less. The work includes (1) measuring photoelectrochemical
electron transfer rates of individual nanoparticles; (2) correlating the
intrinsic nanoparticle activity with nanoparticle structure; (3) developing
computer models of the interactions between colloidal nanoparticles and the
working electrode. Subsequent refinements of the methodology will include
studies of reactions that hinder efficiency because they compete with the
desired photoelectrochemical reactions for energy
conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Alpuche will encourage students to consider
careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields
through the development of hands-on activities for K-12 level. This includes
outreach to Hispanic population of Nevada with presentations at K-12 schools
with large Hispanic populations.
