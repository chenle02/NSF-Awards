9725913 Anderson This is a renewal grant to support theoretical research on
high-temperature superconductivity and related phenomena. The research has a
two-fold thrust: (1) to exploit the theoretical framework established during the
last grant period both in terms of explanation of the complex array of
experimental data available and in terms of broadening, deepening and making
more detailed the theoretical basis for this framework. (2) Using the cuprates
as a paradigm, to look for comparable breakdowns of conventional theory in other
systems including organic superconductors, spin ladder compounds and mixed-
valence electron systems. %%% This is a renewal grant to support theoretical
