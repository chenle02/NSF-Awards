In the base isolation mechanisms increased damping is not necessarily
beneficial. In this project, a damping-independent seismic isolation scheme
consisting of a pedestal with multi- curvature geometry and roller supports will
be analytically examined. The multi-degree-of-freedom shear building models with
this isolation scheme will be utilized in the analytical study to demonstrate
its effectiveness. The isolation effectiveness of the proposed scheme will be
compared with those of the conventional schemes which use damping in their
isolation devices.
