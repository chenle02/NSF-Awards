CTS - 9627361 Edward Cussler Frank Bates University of Minnesota ABSTRACT The
proposal aims at building membranes for gas separations whose surfaces feature
submicron-sized corrugations. The corrugations will be achieved by surfactant-
directed self-assembly and also self-assembly of block copolymers. The first
approach involves interfacial polymerization at a "middle phase" interface to
improve selectivity and increase flux. The second approach utilizes block
copolymers that self-assemble into corrugated structures. In particular,
polystyrene-polyisoprene diblock copolymers of different volume fractions of the
blocks will be used to obtain various microstructures. The results may lead to
significant improvement of flux in selective membranes.
