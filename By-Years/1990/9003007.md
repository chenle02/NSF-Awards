Importance sampling is a general Monte Carlo method that in principle allows
the simulation designer to utilize specific knowledge of the systems operation
in order to reduce the computational burden of a particular simulation run.
Computational efficiencies of three to five orders of magnitude might be
possible. The application area being studied in this project is the digital
satellite communication channel, characterized by noise, intersymbol
interference, and system nonlinearity. Trellis-coded modulation and Viterbi
decoding are initially employed as the signalling format.
