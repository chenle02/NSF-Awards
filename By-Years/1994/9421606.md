ABSTRACT NINKOV, Zoran AST-9421606 An ongoing investigation into the star
formation process has utilized the Rochester Institute of Technology 2K x 2K
cooled CCD camera to image OB clusters that are at the core of associations in
both the southern and northern hemispheres. These UBVRI images of the central 7'
x 7' core regions have allowed study of the initial mass function to lower mass
limits than previously determined. In many of these OB cores there is a central,
luminous O-star, or multiple system, that dominates the brightness. From CCD
images it is apparent that these central O-stars have many more companions than
has been cataloged in existing double and multiple star catalogs (e.g. ADS and
IDS). The brightness of the central star and the size of the point spread
function results in considerable contamination of the secondary star image.
Accurate multi-band photometry of the companions would allow for estimation of
their spectral types and thus the mass function, and from this is a better
understanding of the massive star formation process and the possible origin of
runaway stars. The use of the Phillips Laboratory Starfire Optical Range to
obtain high resolution images of these central stars, and their companions, in a
number of OB clusters, and to permit the reduction and analyses of this data. *
