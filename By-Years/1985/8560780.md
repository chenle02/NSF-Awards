A continuing problem in machine dynamics is that of transmission of vibration
from the supporting surface (e.g., a floor surface) to machine components.
Passive vibration isolators are effective for low frequencies but not for a
broad range of frequencies. This project of research and development is the
first step in providing a prototype, actively controlled gas bearing for
precision movement in instruments and machine tools. The active bearings promise
to provide a stiff support which can be made opaque to the tranmission of
vibration from the supporting floor. The ultimate object is a complete
functioning bearing system with a user friendly interface to facilitate
incorporation in machines by designers not skilled in gas-bearing design.
