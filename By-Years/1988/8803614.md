The role of transcurrent faulting during Late Cretaceous to early tertiary
deformation associate with terrane accretion to northwest North America is
controversial, and several different hypotheses exist to explain the evolution
of the orogen from Washington north into Canada. This project will collect data
on displacement history (sense of shear through time), the Pressure-Temperature
conditions during deformation and the age of movements along two major basin-
bounding faults, the Pasayten and Entiat faults in northwestern Washington.
Results will help elucidate the relative importance of contractional and
transcurrent structures in one of the major Late Mesozoic orogenic belts of
North America, and more fundamental questions regarding the role of transcurrent
faults near convergent margins.
