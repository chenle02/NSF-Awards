9502046 Kenny This is a CAREER award which emphasizes the combined aspects of
research and education in the area of MicroElectroMechanical Structures (MEMS).
Particular emphasis will be placed in the research program on an improved
understanding of micromechanical properties with experiments conducted over a
wide temperature range on phonon (thermal) transport in confined geometries and
acoustic wave transmission through isolated microstructures. The materials
employed will be amorphous, polycrystal-line and single-crystal microstructures.
The teaching program will involve both undergraduate and graduate courses in
MEMS with particular emphasis on development of a new micromechanical systems
course. ***
