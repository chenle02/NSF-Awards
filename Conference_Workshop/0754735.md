This award will support the participation of invited speakers, junior faculty,
postdocs, and graduate students in the conference ?Dynamical Systems and
Topology? that will be held in Tossa de Mar, Spain, from April 21 to April 25,
2008. The official host of the meeting is the University of Barcelona.

The conference program will comprise thirty-two talks by a diverse group of
mathematicians, both senior and junior, including an unusually large number of
women. The principal theme of the conference is complex dynamics, with
particular emphasis on the impact that the contributions of Robert Devaney have
had on the field.
