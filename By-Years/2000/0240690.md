The need for a technology roadmap for the capital projects industry has been a
matter of discussion at many board meetings of corporations and industry
organizations in recent years: it is part of the FIAPP (Fully Integrated and
Automated Project Processes) Steering Committee's charter to desighn and develop
a technology roadmap for the industry. Since October 2001, a technology roadmap
has been evolving to define a comprehensive technology research and development
agenda, based on input from experienced, forward-thinking technical and business
professionals from various parts of the capital projects industry. The roadmap
serves to identify critical technology needs that crosscut all sectors of the
industry as well as the requirements for focused R&amp;D to meet those
challenges. This small award recognizes the criticality of engaging the academic
community at this stage in the development of the Roadmap R&amp;D plans through
financial support to academics to encourage them to attend FIATECH's Capital
Projects Integrated Technology Roadmap Workshop in October .
