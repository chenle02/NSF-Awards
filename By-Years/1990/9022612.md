This research consists of three separate, but related projects focusing on
international financial institutions. The first project will analyze the nature
of the World Bank's third-world debt and compare it to the debt held by
commercial banks. Among the important question to be analyzed are: (1) to what
extent are bank loans really aid? (2) Does the financial structure of the World
Bank affect the allocation of its loans across countries? Is the restructuring
of third world debt appropriate? The second area of research looks at the
coordination of fiscal policy across countries with different electorial
structures and different timing of elections. This research will consider both
pressures caused by staggered elections and possible mechanisms to mitigate
these problems as they arise. The final topic is an analysis of how to design a
central bank for a monetary union as in the case of the European Monetary
System. This research is important because it will provide a better
understanding of emerging financial arrangements and institutions in the third
world and in Europe and how the U.S. might be affected changing international
financial institutions.
