9224640 Patrikalakis This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. This research is also sponsored by the MIT Sea Grant College Program at
the level of $75,000 per year. The objective of this project is to advance the
state of knowledge in efficiently representing, interrogating, visualizing,
updating and manipulating vast amounts of geophysical data. The research
combines, in a synergistic effort, database and visualization expertise from
computer science, computational geometry expertise, advanced concepts from
theoretical and applied mathematics with concrete geophysical data with the goal
to prove the practicality of the developed database concepts for a challenging
automated navigation problem. Specific objectives are: (1) to attack the problem
of multidimensional physical data representation using advanced higher
dimensional geometric concepts; (2) to address the problem of uncertainty in
data representation and computation by invoking the concept of interval splines
and the theory of interval arithmetic; (3) to study the problem of geometric and
physical information storage, retrieval, reconstruction and interrogation by
applying methods from differential topology and algebraic topology; (4) to
develop new methods for continuous non-linear data representation and
interrogation using global topological generalized boundary representation
databases based on the cell-tuple structure; and (5) to evaluate the developed
concepts in a preliminary fashion in a practical example involving autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation using a marine geophysical database. The
database techniques developed in this project will enhance the conduct of
research in environmental and ocean sciences and engineering and other
disciplines studying continuous physical phenomena. ***
