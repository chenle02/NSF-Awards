The 51st Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 12-15, 2009 at the
Pheasant Run Resort and Spa in St. Charles, IL. The meeting offers members of
the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss their most
recent research results. A wide range of topics investigating the structure and
function of genes, pathways, and traits are included, spanning both basic
studies of gene action and applications to crop improvement. The 51st Annual
meeting will feature 45-minute talks by four invited plenary speakers: Joe
Ecker, Salk Institute; Curt Hannah, University of Florida; Luca Comai,
University of California-Davis; and Marja Timmermans, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory. In addition the program will include approximately 30 15-minute
talks given by speakers selected from submitted abstracts and two poster
sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maize
Genetics Conference program is designed specifically to allow students to
participate and interact with their peers from other institutions and with
scientists who are leaders in the field. The program provides multiple
opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to present their
research ideas as invited platform talks or as poster presentations. For most of
the students attending and presenting their data at this meeting, it is their
first exposure to a research conference; the students begin to establish their
scientific contact networks here, and as they continue to advance their
scientific careers, this conference series remains valuable as a source of
information and interactions in the area of maize genetics.
