9313586 Shahidehpour This study considers a fuzzy set formulation of the optimal
reactive power planning, taking into account the static security constraints and
uncertainty in load values. The overall solution will be a compromise between
least cost planning (lower investment and operation costs) and security (tighter
feasible region). The planning process will be decomposed into investment and
operation problems via the generalized Benders decomposition. The operation
problem will be decomposed into 4 subproblems via the Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition. Practical examples will be considered for the applicability of
the proposed approach to multi-area power systems. ***
