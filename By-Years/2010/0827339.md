ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OISE 0827339 SHIH/MOORE
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"DDEP in China- Biopsy and Interstitial Brachytherapy
Needle Devices for Tissue" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds Dr. Albert
Shih, PI, for a Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project in China for Jason
Moore, Ph.D. candidate, both of whom are in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Michigan. Mr. Moore's research focuses on
improved needle design through a better understanding of the geometric and
cutting mechanics of the needle-tip/tissue interaction. Mr. Moore plans to stay
four months starting in fall 2008 to work with Associate Professor ZHENG, Haojun
in the Institute of Manufacturing Engineering in the Department of Precision
Instruments &amp; Mechanology at Tsinghua University in Beijing,
China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
