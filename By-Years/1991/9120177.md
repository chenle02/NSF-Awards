The interior of the cells is electronegative respect to the extracellular
media. However, against the natural tendency of the positively charged Na and Ca
ions to accumulate into the cells, they are much more concentrated in the
external side. To maintain that situation a net steady Na and Ca extrusion must
take place while energy is consumed. For Ca, two proteins located in the plasma
membrane cooperate to that end: (i) the Ca pump, which uses energy from ATP
hydrolysis, and (ii) the Na/Ca exchange which, though it takes that energy from
the inward Na gradient, is also stimulated by ATP. The studies will characterize
the structure-function relationships of the Na/Ca exchanger employing the squid
giant axon. Under dialysis, this preparation is unique for it allows almost
complete biochemical control of intra and extracellular environments and also of
the transmembrane electrical potential. Answers to the following specific
questions can be expected to provide an increase in our understanding of how
extraordinary electrochemical barriers to their movements. (i) Is ATP
stimulation is exerted directly on the exchanger or are other structures,
perhaps kinases, involved? (ii) What amino acids (structural units of proteins)
are relevant to the functions of the exchanger? In this case compounds known to
selectively block different amino acids or chemical groups will be used. The
physiological relevance of the Ca extruding systems is evidenced by the fact
that intracellular Ä±Ca! regulated blood flow and pressure and neural and
endocrine functions.
