This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research among three
investigators: Derek Sears at the University of Arkansas and Grenville Turner
and Ian Lyon at the University of Manchester. The objective is to systematically
measure the oxygen isotope composition of olivine (the major silicate mineral)
in chondrules, the major structural component of chondrite meteorites.
Chondrules and their formation are considered an important and widespread
phenomenon in the early solar systems. The analysis of their composition and
properties could be used to determine the origin and history of chondrite
meteorites, the most common form of meteorites, and eventually contribute to our
understanding of the origins of solar systems. The US investigator brings to
this collaboration expertise in petrography and chemical characterization of
chondrules. This is complemented by the British investigators' expertise in
oxygen isotope measurements and their development of an ion microprobe method
for determining the oxygen isotope ratios in chondrules.
