Although women now enter undergraduate engineering programs with higher math
SAT scores than men, many of them fail to process beyond the first year. There
is considerable evidence in the literature that there may be a threshold or
critical- mass effect: if a sufficient proportion of students in a class are
women, attitudes toward the subject, performance, and retention are improved.
Why such an effect may operate is not understood. This research study proposes
to vary gender balance across different sections of the first course in
engineering, statics, in the undergraduate engineering programs of 30 large
universities, over a period of two semesters. In each institution, the
instructors, syllabus, teaching style, overall class size, and other aspects of
instruction will be held constant. Without doing harm to individual students,
different proportions of women in the various sections will be achieved.
Persistence beyond the first course will be tracked, and grades and other
aspects of performance will be measured or obtained by structured interviews, in
both men and women. The hope is that a critical zone for gender balance may be
established, either for all institutions or for subtypes of institutions. If so,
universities with multiple sections of beginning engineering courses ought to be
able to improve retention of women in a fairly straightforward and
administratively easy way.
