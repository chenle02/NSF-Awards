The results obtained from surveys are used to estimate characteristics of
populations. Calibration estimators use auxiliary information to improve the
efficiency of these survey estimates. Calibration is used in the U.S. in the
Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS), the Bureau of Labor Statistics'
Consumer Expenditure Survey, and a variety of other Federal surveys as well as
surveys administered by other nations. Some of the key uses of calibration are
to (i) reduce variances, (ii) correct for nonresponse, and (iii) correct
coverage deficiencies of a sample frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary
assumption with calibration is that the sample estimates are calibrated to true
population values known without error. Often, however, these population values
are estimates obtained from other surveys which could possess sampling variance.
These estimated controls add variability to survey estimates and may produce
bias if the source of controls is inaccurate. The use of estimated controls in
surveys is common but is virtually never accounted for in survey variance
estimation. This research will investigate methods that will account for this
extra imprecision in variance estimates and also study the effects of bias in
the population vlues and in the analytic survey itself. The specific goals of
this research will be to (1) analyze the effect of benchmarks and analytic
survey estimates that are biased due to coverage errors with extensions done for
general regression (GREG) estimators and other calibration estimators; (2)
develop variance estimators for GREG and other calibration estimators that
account for estimated benchmarks and undercoverage by sample frames; (3) develop
some practical rules for determining whether estimated benchmarks are too
variable to be worth using; and (4) illustrate theoretical findings via
simulation studies based on real survey data sets.
