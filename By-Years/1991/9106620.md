Saddlepoint methods have been particularly useful in the approximation of joint
and conditional parametric density functions. A theory of predictive inference
has drawn heavily on these constructions of approximate likelihoods; and this
theory will continue to be developed under this award. However, the class of
potential applications for saddlepoint methods is much broader, and the
principal focus for this research is this expansion into several new areas.
These include multivariate testing problems where the null distribution of the
likelihood ratio statistics can be written in product Dirichlet form, also
finite (unequal probability) sampling schemes and resampling schemes, and
response analysis for non-linear stochastic systems prevalent in the engineering
literature.
