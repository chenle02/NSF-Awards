van der Hilst 9614341 This research involves the study of the structure and
dynamics of the crust and mantle beneath Australia using high-resolution 3-D
models of seismic properties and surface observables such as heat flow, gravity,
and topography. The main data set is derived from project SKIPPY, a continent-
wide deployment of broadband seismometers in Australia that record earthquakes
within and surrounding the continent. Spatial variations of seismic parameters
will be determined by tomographic imaging. Azimuthal anisotropy maps a t
different depths will be constructed from shear wave splitting and surface wave
inversion. Modeling studies will be used to map 3-D variations in temperature,
density, and viscosity in the Australian mantle. The results will be applicable
to mineral economic and seismic hazard studies. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
