Several lines of research in atomic physics will be continued. These include:
(1) Collision and spectroscopy studies on low energy, multi-charged ions. These
ions will be confined in ion traps, or will be studied in the form of low energy
beams from an ECR ion source. Synchrotron radiation will be used for sequential
photoionization of stored ions. (2) Anisotropic excitation of ions, including
the study of the production of oriented states by ion-surface grazing
collisions, resulting in the emission of circularly polarized radiation, and the
capture by low energy confined ions of electrons from spin-polarized hydrogen
atoms. (3) Spectroscopic studied including laser spectroscopy stored, metastable
helium-like Be ions, and laser spectroscopy of certain ground state fine-
structure transitions of highly- charged ions from the ECR source. Synchrotron
x-rays will be used to produce a cold, stored multi-charged ion gas, which has
interesting properties, and serves as a target for the study of photoionization
of ions as well as other research.
