Dr. Patrick J. Farmer has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Farmer's doctoral degree was from Texas A&M University under the
supervision of Professor Marcetta Darensbourg. Dr. Farmer will continue research
at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor
Harry Gray. Dr. Farmer's Postdoctoral training will provide him with
bioinorganic expertise in metal-DNA interactions, cytochrome c oxidase, protein
structure and function, metal porphyrin chemistry, and electron transfer through
proteins. Longer term, he plans to synthesize well defined porphyrin ligand-
metal systems in which the relative angle between donor and acceptor sites can
be altered by bridging moieties. In this way, the directionality of electron
transfer between ligand and metal sites can be determined. %%% The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
