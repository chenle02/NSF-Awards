Abstract The University of Tampa - P. Fingar Connection to NSFNET Proposal No.
NCR-9355010 The University of Tampa request support from NSF for connection of
their campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the University of Tampa a 56 thousand bits
per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
second) National Backbone network. The university needs greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
