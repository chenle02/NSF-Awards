The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a theoretical model for the
effect of temperature on time-dependent creep deformation of structural
materials. The theoretical model will consist of combining the micromechanic
aspects of deformation with the continuum mechanics formulation. It is planned
to experimentally verify the model where possible. The temperature range covered
in this investigation will extend from room temperature to above half the
melting point of the materials. Particular emphasis will be given to combined
effect of temperature and stresses. After the micromechanical model is developed
and verified, macroscopic models, useful for engineering design and analysis
will be developed. The proposed research could lead to significant fundamental
advances in high temperature deformation of materials.
