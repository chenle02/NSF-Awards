Funds are requested for the purchase of an X-band Bruker ESP 300- 10/12 electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer with a liquid helium temperature
cryostat. EPR spectroscopy is an essential component of four
biochemical/biophysical research programs in the Chemistry Department and Center
for Metalloenzyme Studies at the University of Georgia, all of which focus on
the role of transition metals in metalloenzymes and metalloproteins. The
requested spectrometer will facilitate EPR studies of Fe-S clusters in the
mitochondrial respiratory chain and at the active sites of range of different
metalloenzymes, binuclear Fe centers in hemerythrin and rubreythrin, binuclear
Mn centers in ribonucleotide reductase, the Ni-containing F 430 cofactor of S-
methyl coenzyme M reductase, and Co in Co(II)-substituted alcohol
dehydrogenases. The proposed instrument will be used for training and research
directly related to the NSF research training group in the role of transition
metals in biology at the University of Georgia.
