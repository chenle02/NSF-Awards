The growth of digital data, along with new social and business practices, raises
new research questions about data security and privacy, knowledge production and
intellectual property. Increasing digitization has altered the fundamental cost
of collecting and retaining and distributing personal information. The research
community has begun to examine the impact of rules, policies and institutions
that govern the economic incentives to create, store, and use digital
information. New frameworks are required to provide policy relevant analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NBER Digitization Project, launched in 2010, is
building the foundations for an economics oriented research community that
examines the causes and consequences of digitization. &lt;br/&gt;This project
supports a graduate student conference to promote the development and diffusion
of economic research analyzing the effects of the rise of digital technology on
the behavior of firms and households. The project fosters growth of a research
community to examine the potential impact of regulation and other government
initiatives on the incentives to produce and distribute digital content.
