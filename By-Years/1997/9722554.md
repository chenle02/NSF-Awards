This three-year grant will support a faculty member, two graduate students, an
undergraduate student, and some staff and technician support at the dedicated
Wisconsin Van de Graaff facility to perform a variety of measurements
investigating the nature of the nuclear force in light nuclear systems. Using
polarized ion sources and cryogenic polarized targets radiative capture of
protons with deuterons will investigate the role of tensor forces. The
scattering of deuterons from 3He will investigate possible violation of time-
reversal invariance in the strong interaction. Other experiments will explore
the effects of three-body forces. Radioactive oxygen beams will be developed for
use in important nuclear astrophysics cross- section measurements; these
radioactive nuclei play an important role in the CNO cycle. A very important
part of the Wisconsin program is the in-depth education of undergraduate and
graduate students.
