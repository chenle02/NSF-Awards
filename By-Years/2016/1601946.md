The project will explore various topics within algebraic number theory and
algebraic geometry. The study of integer and rational number solutions to
polynomial equations has been an ongoing area of research since the time of the
ancient Greeks, and the project will develop a theory of "number field
fragments" that may yield a new approach to answering some such questions, in
particular those related to Fermat's last theorem and its generalizations. In
algebraic geometry, the project aims, among other things, to show that one of
the simplest parameter spaces already has bad singularities, and in fact
contains every singularity imaginable. Many of the specific research topics
contained in the project are at a level accessible to beginning graduate
students, and one of the goals is to involve students in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, given a Galois extension K of
Q with Galois group G, the project will extend geometry-of-numbers methods to
study the "fragments" of K cut out by an idempotent of the group ring QG, in the
hope of developing a new way to prove the nonexistence of certain Galois
representations. It will also study correspondences from a curve to itself that
are unramified on one side, from the point of view of arithmetic dynamics, since
such setups yield new examples of almost-everywhere-unramified arboreal
representations. In algebraic geometry proper, the project will study
infinitesimal neighborhoods of the vertex of a cone to try to prove that the
Hilbert scheme of points satisfies Murphy's law. Finally, the project will
explore whether there is an idele class group variant of the Cohen-Lenstra
heuristics.
