The overall purpose of this project is to develop an improved model of decision
making under risk and uncertainty. Specific objectives of the project are: (1)
to examine the theoretical and empirical bases of lottery-dependent expected
utility models; (2) to study the role of ambiguity in the specification of
probabilities; (3) to empirically test several models of preference; and (4) to
develop a model that incorporates equity considerations in the development of
risk management alternatives. Despite the importance of equity considerations in
the decision making process, little effort has been made to develop models that
explicitly address issues related to the distribution of risks and benefits.
Results of this innovative project will be used to identify strategies that can
simultaneously maximize efficiency and equity. It is expected that this project
will be useful to analysts and decision makers in formulating and evaluating
alternative risk management strategies.
