HRD 03-28625&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Rudolf Henning is a professor of electrical
engineering who has developed the "YES-We Care" program to interest, influence,
and prepare minority pre-college students for success as engineering students.
The program promotes innovative education and mentoring concepts and philosophy
at the pre-college level (middle and high school). The 25-week long program
includes Saturday morning enrichment sessions, academic reinforcement
(engineering, mathematics, science, computers, and technology), and small group
instruction and mentoring, all in a friendly, club-like
atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henning's activities 'expanding the pool' of
diversity began more than 20 years ago. His program includes a reward based
system, and supports family participation (parents) in addition to students.
