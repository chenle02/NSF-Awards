To better understand the mantle geochemistry of the platinum group elements
(PGEs), and the information returned by 186,187Os isotopic studies, we propose
to determine the PGE abundances of a global suite of high-MgO lavas of Archean
to Phanerozoic age, including komatiites and picrites. The results reported from
our lab are based on a precise isotope dilution ICP-MS technique which has been
successfully applied for the determination of PGEs in such rocks. We also
propose to analyze separated mineral phases and extract, by physical and/or
chemical techniques, the carrier phase(s) of the PGEs from these rocks. Proposed
localities include high-MgO lavas from the following: Kamennoozero, Vetreny,
Onega and Lapland (Baltic Shield); Belingwe (S. Africa); Emeishan (China); Song
Da (NW Vietnam); Gorgona (Caribbean); and Iceland. All samples are available in
collections held by us or will be generously provided by collaborators from
other geochemical studies, particularly previous Os isotopic studies. Our
intellectual goals for the proposed study are 1) to establish the rules of PGE
behaviour during the high degrees of partial melting, and subsequent fractional
crystallization, experienced by komatiites and picrites; 2) to obtain mantle
source PGE compositions with which to test the hypotheses of crustal recycling
and core-mantle interaction, and to establish, where possible, the mechanism of
core-mantle interaction. The proposal supports the salaries of a graduate
student and a research scientist, and the research forms the basis of a PhD
thesis for the graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;
