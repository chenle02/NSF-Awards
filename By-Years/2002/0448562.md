CAREER: Time and Event Based System Software
Construction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
will define and develop a novel suite of tools and techniques for verifiable
system software construction. Towards that end, this project is investigating
(1) formal models based on timed automata for canonical sets of primitive system
software mechanisms, (2) algebraic representations of how automata for primitive
mechanisms can be composed to form more complex mechanisms that are prevalent in
current system software practice, and (3) type systems and other techniques for
efficient guidance and checking of system software composition and
configuration. This approach allows system developers to leverage application-
specific constraints on the timing and ordering of system events, to guide
composition of new mechanisms and customization of previously composed
mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project makes it easier for a wide audience
of designers, developers and testers to specify, implement and verify correct
behavior of software systems. The software and educational materials developed
under this project are to be released on-line and open-
source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
