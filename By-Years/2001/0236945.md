A Near InfraRed Imaging Magnetograph (IRIM) and a real-time image reconstruction
system will be designed, developed, and deployed by the PI and student
assistants. The effort capitalizes on the new Center for Solar Research (CfSR)
optical laboratories, which present an ideal environment to involve students in
a coordinated program of instrument construction and research. After the
instruments are deployed at the Big Bear Solar Observatory, which is operated by
the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the gathered data will be used to
support research and thesis projects. The scientific objective of these
instruments is to resolve some of the fundamental length and time scales of
solar magneto-convection. Ultimately these intrinsic scales are related to the
global aspects of solar variability and therefore to basic physical processes on
the sun that affect the Earth environment, i.e., communications technology, the
power grid, civil and military assets, humans in space, and in the end, the
terrestrial climate.
