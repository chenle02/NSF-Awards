Intellectual merit

This project offers a new conceptual framework for thinking about control of
fibroblast migration at the level of intracellular signal transduction and novel
tools for quantitatively analyzing it. If successful, the proposed work would
more generally unify distinct cell migration stimuli and behaviors in terms of
common signaling dynamics, providing a blueprint for more ambitious studies with
other cell types, environmental contexts, and molecular-level perturbations of
the underlying signal transduction network.

Broader impacts

The project would contribute to the training of researchers in the cross-
disciplinary areas of engineering analysis, cell biology, fluorescence
microscopy, image analysis, and kinetic modeling. In all of these endeavors, the
PI will maintain an inclusive research environment that embraces diversity on
all levels. The results of the proposed research will be published in archived,
peer reviewed journals, and all MATLAB codes will be freely available via the
PI's website.
