This travel services work order (AMEX 91-AS-01) supports the travel and per diem
costs of six U.S. university-based scientists to enable them to attend the
U.S.-Australia Joint Seminar on Radiation Effects on Polymeric Materials to be
held in Stanford, California, from August 18 through August 22, 1991. The
meeting is organized in the U.S. by Professor Curtis Frank of Stanford's
Department of Chemical Engineering and Dr. Elsa Reichmanis of AT&amp;T Bell
Labs. A similar number of Australian scientists will attend with support from
the Australian Department of Trade, Industry and Commerce, organized by
Professor James O'Donnell of the Department of Chemistry, University of
Queensland. Additional participants from industry and third countries will
attend with non-NSF means of support. Over five days of meetings, the
participants will discuss the way in which radiation affects the physical,
chemical and engineering properties of polymers, a topic of great importance to
the electronics and space industries of the U.S. and Australia.
