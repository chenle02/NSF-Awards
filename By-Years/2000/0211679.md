This recommendation memo provides support and justification for funding of
IIS-0211679. The proposal requests support for convening a workshop to explore
possibilities for collaborative research and demonstration projects involving
libraries as access and service providers for Internet2 applications. Workshop
participants will include experts in advanced networking, librarians from the
academic, and public sectors and international experts in the area. The goal
will be to collect perspectives, examine feasible alternatives and produce an
action plan for deploying advanced networking and digital services through
libraries and other community access providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
