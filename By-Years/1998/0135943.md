0135943&lt;br/&gt;David Luebke&lt;br/&gt;University of
Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer g aphics community increasingly
recognizes the importance of understanding and leveraging the human pe ceptual
system.Indeed,several researchers have proposed techniques to accelerate
rendering by exploiting the limitations of human vision. However,this research
has focused on realistic rendering algorithms such as ray and path tracing,
which take seconds or minutes to render.Ve y little work has been done on
perceptually d iven interactive rendering,whe e each image must be completed in
milliseconds.Yet a dire need exists for techniques to accelerate interactive
rendering of ever-la ger datasets,fo despite&lt;br/&gt;tremendous strides in
graphics hardware,the growth in complexity of 3-D models appears to
be&lt;br/&gt;outstripping our ability to render them.&lt;br/&gt;One barrier to
research on perceptually motivated interactive rendering acceleration methods
has been the inflexibility of standard graphics hardware.The rendering pipeline,
specialized and perfected over many yea s,is now extremely fast at a narrow set
of rendering tasks,but researchers cannot tamper with the traditional polygon-
rendering underpinnings. We propose to circumvent this barrier by using software
rendering,distributed across a cluster to achieve interactive ates on complex
scenes.This SGER focuses on building the equipment necessa y to analyze several
perceptual rendering techniques impossible under the traditional polygon-
oriented interactive rendering paradigm.
