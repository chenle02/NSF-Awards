A three day meeting, Midwest Numerical Analysis Conference, is proposed to be
held in May 2005 at the University of Iowa. This meeting will bring together
researchers of all career stages and graduate students, mainly from the
Midwestern area, who work or are interested in numerical analysis and
applications. The purposes of the meeting are: (1) to provide a forum to
exchange new ideas and results related to research and teaching on numerical
analysis, computer simulation, and their applications in engineering and
sciences; (2) to provide an opportunity for numerical analysts in regional
colleges to remain involved in research activities; (3) to expose exciting
research topics to graduate students and recent doctoral recipients; (4) to
encourage women, minorities and persons with disabilities to participate in the
research areas.

The proposed Midwest Numerical Analysis Conference will greatly contribute to
the advancement of research and teaching on numerical analysis, computer
simulation and their interdisciplinary applications in the Midwestern region of
the nation, especially in many of the regional colleges and teaching
universities. The conference will serve as a forum to exchange, understand and
promote new ideas, results and techniques on research and teaching in the areas
of numerical analysis, computer simulation and interdisciplinary applications.
Special efforts will be made to ensure a broadened participation in the research
and teaching activities from students, junior researchers, college faculty,
especially women, minorities and persons with disabilities. The conference will
help to enlarge the personnel base of the nation for next generation numerical
analysts and computational scientists.
