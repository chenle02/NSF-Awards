9322389 Ellis Technical abstract: Third sound waves will be used to study the
properties of vortices in superfluid 4He films at low temperatures. These
vortices have been recently shown to exist well below the superfluid transition,
pinned to the substrate and stable against moderate film flow. Large amplitude
third sound waves not only provide film flow large enough to move the vortices,
but are able to create and destroy the vortices by the quantum-mechanical
analogy of swirling. Small amplitude waves are used to probe the vortex
distribution. This detailed study of vortex pinning and creation will provide
better understanding of the importance of innate vortices at low temperatures
and their properties. Non-technical abstract: This research will investigate the
properties of microscopic quantized circulation states in thin films of
superfluid helium. These vortices have been shown to play a role in the
properties of films near the superfluid transition temperature and will be
studied directly for the first time at lower temperatures by their interaction
with sound waves. Unlike its counterpart superconductivity, there remain
fundamental problems in the microscopic description of the superfluid state and
clarifying the role of the vortices in films will contribute to the general
understanding of condensed matter physics. ***
