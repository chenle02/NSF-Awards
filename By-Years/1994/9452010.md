9452010 Thomas The Department of Mathematics at Colorado State University is
developing and implementing a renewed calculus/ordinary differential equations
sequence that includes approximately one hour per week of computer laboratory
work. The renewed calculus/ordinary differential equations sequence uses the
computer algebra software Maple to (1) graphically illustrate basic concepts in
calculus and ordinary differential equations, (2) emphasize the trilogy between
data, graphics and formulas, (3) give students an experimental tool for
investigating mathematics and the solution of mathematical problems and (4)
enable students to attack problems too difficult to attempt using paper and
pencil.
