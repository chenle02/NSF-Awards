A controlled-environmental room with two chambers procured with assistance from
this award is enabling Biology students to develop a better understanding of
experimental design. The laboratories in which these new facilities are being
used are designed to give the students hands-on experience in manipulating
environmental variables. This provides them with a better understanding of the
effects of the various environmental factors on the physiology and behavior of
organisms, as well as helping them to improve their investigative skills.
Courses to which these chambers are contributing fresh opportunities for student
originality and creativity include Animal Physiology, Plant Physiology, General
Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology, as well as Independent Research. Since the
school is located in the Appalachian Mountains, numerous local montaine species
of fish, amphibians, reptiles and small mammals will be employed in these
studies.
