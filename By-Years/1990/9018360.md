Paleozoic positions and orientations of the cratonic blocks and terranes that
constitute present-day Asia are not well known, but this information is required
from both paleogeographic and global geophysical stand points. This project will
utilize recently-discovered Ordovician and Silurian strata from the western
margin of the North China Block to determine paleomagnetic pole positions for
these terranes. Results will help unravel the tectonic history of China and
provide a paleomagnetic reference frame for determining relative displacements
and times of accretion of blocks and terranes both within and outside China.
