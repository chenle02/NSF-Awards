In many jurisdictions the Uniform Building Code, UBC (ICBO, 1988), regulates
the design for lateral wind and seismic forces. However, most architecture
students and architecture design firms find these regulations difficult to
interpret and apply for multi-story buildings. Therefore, lateral design is
often not considered in the early design process as it should be when important
decisions are made that affect lateral forces. This proposal makes lateral
design simpler and more transparent, visualizes effects of building form on
lateral forces, and facilitates trade-off studies for creative integration in
the early design process. The project will: 1) develop a computer program for
lateral design by means of tables and graphs, and 2) develop paper graphs for
use without a computer. No such graphs have been available to architects in
designing for lateral forces. This project will fill in this gap by allowing
architects and students of architecture to consider earthquake resistant design
in the early stages of building design. As such, the proposed products resulting
from this project will have a direct application to the earthquake resistant
design process at an early stage. It is very timely.
