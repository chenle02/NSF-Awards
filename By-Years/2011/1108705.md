This award supports the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a broad
community based study of the science opportunities and technology challenges in
high magnetic field research. The study will be forward looking and addresses
the decade beyond that addressed in the 2005 NRC report, on Opportunities in
High Magnetic Field Science. The study is conducted by the Board on Physics and
Astronomy, in consultation with the Board on Life Sciences, Board on Chemical
Sciences and Technology, and the National Materials and Manufacturing Board. It
will provide an assessment of the current status of the high magnetic field
program in the United States and an analysis of trends in the makeup of the
principal user groups of that program. The study will develop recommendations
for the future of magnetic-field research and technology development for this
area given the needs of current and anticipated user communities and in the
context of other programs worldwide. The outcome of the study will be a report
that will be published and made broadly available to the community. Funding for
the study is provided by the Biosciences directorate, and the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences directorate (Chemistry Division, Division of Materials
Research and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary activities) at NSF.
