Title: REU Site: Secure Software Testing for Web and Mobile Applications:
Research Experience for Undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
establishes an REU Site on the topic of secure software testing for web and
mobile applications, at the University of North Texas. The project's
intellectual merits are that it exposes students to an intense research
experience that focuses on software testing with an emphasis on techniques that
may help to increase security and reliability of web and mobile applications.
The project's broader significance and importance are that it trains three
diverse cohorts of ten students each in summers 2015, 2016, and 2017 to provide
them with a supportive environment and research experience that encourages them
to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science. The students are better prepared
to enter the graduate school pipeline as they gain an understanding of basic
research skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students work in collaborative teams that
explore research questions in areas such as test suite generation, test suite
prioritization, test suite reduction, attack surface analysis, and sanitization
validation techniques. Empirical studies examine the techniques in the context
of web and mobile applications.
