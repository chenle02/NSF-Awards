9317700 Battistella Grant funding is sought to improve access to the University
of South Dakota mid-level Internet node for those health professionals and
students who are in medical research, clinical practice, and medical education
outside of Vermillion, especially in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Yankton. Access
to the University of South Dakota Internet node will also be extended to health
professionals practicing in rural and frontier areas of South Dakota, reducing
geographic barriers to communication and obtaining information. Access to the
Internet is an important element of medical research, teaching, and clinical
care. Electronic mail improves communications between health and information
professionals for consultation on patient care and administrative issues. Access
to the Internet's online databases, full text files, electronic journals,
special interest groups, and software achieves will enhance research and
teaching productivity. Funding will cover the cost of a router, terminal server,
modems, communications costs, and computer storage. Librarians at the Lommen
Health Sciences Library, University of South Dakota (USD) School of Medicine and
also librarians at remote clinical training sites will serve as the primary
agents for Internet training. The Lommen Health Sciences Library will also play
a major role in product development, creating and maintaining databases on South
Dakota health issues and assisting in the design of the USD wide area
information system. ***
