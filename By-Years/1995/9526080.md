9526080 Wright This project will study many questions related to the development
of an Integrated Infrastructure Management System (IIMS) as an organizing theme.
Specifically, the following five topics will be considered: (1) asset valuation
and cost estimation; (2) latent class models of infrastructure facility
deterioration; (3) modeling the interaction between urban economic activities
and infrastructure renewal; (4) methods for exploring N- dimensional objective
space; (5) total factor productivity and the management of civil infrastructure
systems. The participation of practicing professionals of a stake holder
partnership and faculty outside civil engineering is a prominent aspect of the
project.
