9401249 Hittle The objective of this research project is to increase the
efficiency of control methods for energy systems in buildings. IN meeting this
objective, novel combinations of feedback controllers and neural network
learning algorithms will be developed. to achieve the objective, recent
developments in reinforcement learning methods for neural networks will be
adapted to the HVAC system control problem. Neural networks will not be the sole
source of control decisions for such a complex system. Adaptive schemes are
notorious for leading to instabilities. to lessen the possibility of introducing
instability, adaptive schemes will be integrated with existing, fixed
controllers. the adaptive methods will only augment the control actions taken by
the fixed controllers and a limit will be enforced on the degree to which the
fixed controller's decision can be modified. This will result in a control
system with an initial performance at the level provided by the original control
designer. Then, with experience, the learning mechanism will be able to increase
the performance of the controller beyond its initial ability. Results will
certainly be of interest to building engineers, but will also advance the sate-
of-the-art in neural networks for control. ***
