Proposal Number: ECS-9733720 Principle Investigator: Alexander Cartwright
Abstract: This proposed research is focused on the development of visible
spatial light modulators (SLMs) using AlGaN, InGaN, and GaN material systems for
application in the next generation of display and printer technologies.
Specifically, III-N visible SLMs will be modeled, designed, fabricated, and
tested by the PI and in collaboration with Eastman Kodak Company. The
investigation will include the Franz-Keldysh and quantum-confined-Stark effect
in III-N materials, linear optical properties and ultra-fast dynamics of charge
transport in p-i-n devices. The educational part of the proposal will extend
PI's undergraduate research symposium to outreach programs including mentoring
of minorities and women students in high schools and undergraduate school.
