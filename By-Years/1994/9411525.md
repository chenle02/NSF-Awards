Engineers Boston University has the only Manufacturing Engineering Department in
the country that grants manufacturing degrees at all levels. It offers a part-
time 17-month master of Science in Manufacturing program to train experienced
engineers for dual-use manufacturing careers. TRP funds will create fellowships
for unemployed engineers and partial fellowships for engineers employed by small
businesses affected by defense conversion. Industry involvement in this program
will include guest lectures, sponsorship of student capstone projects, and
tuition support for sending students to the program. ***
