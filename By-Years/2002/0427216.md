This grant provides funding for the development of a computer-aide tissue
engineering (CATE) approach for design and fabrication of load bearing tissue
scaffolds. The CATE approach provides novel models and computational algorithms
that address multiple design constraints for tissue scaffold, including the
structural integrity (needed for implantation), micro-architecture (for cell
growth, transport and tissue formation), and the scaffold manufacturability. The
project work involves: 1) the modeling and representation of tissue morphologies
as CAD based feature primitives, and the design of feature-based scaffold
building block database; 2) the development of a biomimetic design framework and
the interface to transfer intricate scaffold design towards the scaffold
fabrication; and 3) the development of a computational algorithm for
distribution-based mapping that will be used for scaffold structural and
transport design optimization.

If successful, this project will lead to developing new techniques and tools for
the design and fabrication of load bearing tissue scaffolds and replacements.
These modeling and design techniques will facilitate the application of state-
of-art computer-aided technologies to emerging tissue engineering problems. The
project will actively engage industry, government and medical institutions,
including collaborations with the developers of national and international
standards for scaffold production, the leading tissue engineering manufacturer,
and a major medical center with expertise in tissue scaffold and replacement
application. This project will also produce joint curricula, integrating
computer science, mechanical engineering and bioengineering to educate future
generation of scientists and engineers who are interested in pursuing design,
manufacturing and application of tissue substitutes.
