The goal of the Workshop on Logic, Rewriting, and Concurrency is to provide an
interdisciplinary research forum, focused on advancing the foundations of formal
methods and reasoning about properties of cyber-physical systems and their safe,
secure, and reliable operation in the real world. Such systems are rapidly
becoming key component of critical infrastructure, medical systems, and
artifacts that affect our daily lives such as smart buildings, wearables, and
entertainment systems.

This workshop grant will enable students and speakers from many disciplines,
from industry and academia, to participate in research discussions at this
workshop with leading researchers about new approaches and applications of
rewrite-rule systems for composability, symbolic analysis, temporal modeling,
and verification of hybrid systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for
students and young researchers to interact with leaders in these important
fields. The diverse experience and expertise of the participants coupled with a
shared interest in rewriting and formal systems provides an ideal setting to
foster new synergies and collaborations to address challenging problems in
theory and applications to real world problems.
