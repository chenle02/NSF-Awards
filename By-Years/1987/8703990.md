It has become apparant that the key to understanding the mechanism and control
of genetic information transfer resides on the interactions of DNA with various
proteins, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic. Specific recognitions of DNA
structure by proteins are involved at every step of DNA replication,
transcription and recombination. Although a tremendous amount of information on
DNA-protein interactions has accumulated over the past several years, the
molecular mechanisms of the sequence recognition by these DNA-binding proteins
still remain to be elucidated. Dr. Wu will continue to investigate the molecular
mechansims and functional roles of DNA binding proteins in gene expression.
Specific emphasis will be placed on (1) both structural and dynamic aspects of
the recognition of specific sites on native DNA by RNA polymerase and other
regulatory proteins and (2) the factors that affect the operation and regulation
of gene expression.
