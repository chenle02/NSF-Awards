9604476 Grodzicker This service to the plant biology community provides
continued funds for support of the Cold Spring Harbor Course on "Arabidopsis
Molecular Genetics". In this course, to be held for three weeks in the summer of
each year, plant biologists will be provided hands-on experience in techniques
of molecular analysis of plants, with a strong emphasis, but not exclusively, on
working with Arabidopsis as a model. Concepts are transmitted through intensive
lectures and discussion periods by invited speakers which deal with their
specialty area. The value of the course lies in the training of young scientists
who often continue to collaborate for years after they attended this course and
in its function in the dissemination of new techniques and conceptual approaches
to study plants.
