This research investigates optimization methods for constructing higher-order
learning machines to solve very large classification problems such as those
found in data mining and character recognition. In higher-order learning
machines, the input vectors are mapped nonlinearly into a higher-dimensional
space and then a linear discriminant is constructed in the higher- dimensional
space. The resulting discriminant function may be a polynomial, neural network,
radial basis function classifier, or decision tree. Vapnik's Statistical
Learning Theory is used within the problem formulation to avoid over-fitting or
over- parameterizing the discriminant function. To solve the resulting
minimization problem, innovative optimization methods are developed. This work
will have both an educational and research impact. The optimization methods for
classification problems will also be used within computer-based course materials
for teaching concepts of mathematical programming and as a basis for research
projects for undergraduates. The research impact will be the development of
novel, fast, and accurate classification methods based on statistical learning
theory. These methods will be applied to very large practical applications in a
diverse set of fields, for example: character recognition in engineering, cancer
diagnosis in medicine, database marketing in business, and prediction of
mortgage prepayment in finance.
