This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use simple chemistries to develop
biopolymer derivatives based on chitosan with controlled macromolecular
architectures for oil and gas drilling applications. This Phase II project will
focus on the following objectives : (1) Show how chemistries common in food
processing can be extended for the simple and safe modification of polymers ;
(2) Use data on rheological characterization to better understand the structure-
property relations of polymers; (3) Use the proposed high throughput screening
to demonstrate how combinatorial screening can be adapted to materials
development ; and (4) develop an entirely new class of high performance and
environmentally-friendly products for oil and gas drilling.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of industrial
bioproducts.
