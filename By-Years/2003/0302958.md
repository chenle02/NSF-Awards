U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary
Research&lt;br/&gt;Travel Grant Program to the XVI Congress&lt;br/&gt;Reno,
NV&lt;br/&gt;July 23-31, 2003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the terms of
Master Agreement No. 0239568, the National Academy of Sciences requests funds
for Support of Travel to the XVI International Union for Quaternary Research
(INQUA) Congress. The work will be conducted by the U.S. National Committee for
the INQUA (USNC/INQUA), a committee of the Board on International Scientific
Organizations in the Policy and Global Affairs Division. The objective of this
travel grant program is to assist U.S. graduate students in attending the
Congress in Reno, NV and to inspire the enthusiasm of U.S. Quaternary students,
individually and collectively, by encouraging their substantive face-to-face
interaction with the world Quaternary community. This travel grant program of
$19,245, will subsidize the travel of approximately 30 U.S. graduate students,
and a small amount of staff time to create, receive, and handle travel grant
applications; to distribute the awards; and to collect the post-meeting
reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
