AST 0348990 Dale

Dr. Daniel Dale, at the University of Wyoming, will undertake a program to
develop a better understanding of how normal star-forming galaxies evolve, and
to convey his passion for astrophysics to the next generation of laypeople and
scientists. To accomplish these goals, he will carry out an extensive survey for
Ha-emitting galaxies at multiple epochs over the latter half of the Universe,
with the aim of conclusively determining the strength of the evolution in the
cosmic star formation rate density since z ~0.8, and to quantify any
dependencies on environment. In the process, the PI will train undergraduates,
graduate students, and a postdoctoral student, and develop a research
infrastructure for Wyoming's public education system.
