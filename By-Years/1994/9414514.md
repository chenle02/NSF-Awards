NSF-CBMS Regional Conference Proposal #9414514 Joseph Brennan Abstract: Tight
Closure, Big Cohen-Macaulay Modules and Uniform Artin-Rees The three topics
listed in the title of these lectures have provided distinct yet suprisingly
intertwined threads in commutative algebra. These lectures will provide a
general presentation of these topics with a view towards examination of the
relationship of the homological conjectures to the resolution of singularities,
the Relation-Type conjecture, the strong uniform Artin-Rees conjecture, and the
strong Macaulayification conjecture.
