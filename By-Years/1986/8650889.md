With the funds conveyed in this award, the Biology faculty at Ithaca College
will acquire a microprocessor-controlled ultracentrifuge and its rotors. A new,
intensive, laboratory-oriented course in recombinant DNA methodologies is being
developed for junior and senior biology and chemistry majors. The course is
designed to illustrate many of the key concepts and methods of modern molecular
biology. One exciting aspect of the new course is that it will use recombinant
DNA techniques on both procaryotic (bacteria) and eucaryotic (higher) organisms
where future developments will have a profound impact on medicine, agriculture
and numerous other areas. The course will provide students with the knowledge to
understand and appreciate the latest advances in molecular biology.
