Mhaskar will continue his investigations on the complexity problem in the theory
of neural networks and construction of multiscales based on orthogonal
polynomial coefficients as well as samples of the target functions. Variations
of such classical methods from approximation theory as summability methods and
polynomial inequalities will be developed to provide a unified theory of these
apparently diverse areas. The work will be applied to the numerical construction
of orthogonal polynomials, approximation on the sphere using scattered data, and
the theory of system identification.

Although approximation theory is a classical area of mathematics, active for
more than a hundred years, technological progress in the areas of neural
networks and wavelets has given rise to many new possibilities for applications
of approximation theory. Neural networks and wavelets are both useful in high
speed parallel computing, and naturally involve the approximation of functions.
Approximation theory techniques used with neural networks have produced
dramatically better results in certain applications to array antenna technology,
pattern recognition, and financial time series prediction.
