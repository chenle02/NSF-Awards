Foreman will investigate the descriptive set theoretic aspects of the
classification problem for ergodic measure preserving systems. He has partial
results showing, for example, that they cannot be classified by countable
structures. He conjectures that the isomorphism problem is provably complex,
e.g. analytic but not Borel. The second aspect of Foreman's proposal is to study
``canonical structure" in set theory. This is structure that requires the Axiom
of Choice for its existence, but is independent of the choices made in it
construction. Of particular interest are PCF objects and relations with squares
and diamonds.

Foreman will investigate two areas of mathematics. The first has to do with the
evolution of complex systems in time. These systems appear to show random
behaviour, but of qualitatively different sorts. Foreman's project is to show
that various behavior types are not distinguishable by concrete observations.
The second project has to do with the assumptions that the study of mathematics
is based on. The usual assumptions are not strong enough to be able to find the
answers to all mathematical questions. For this reason it is necessary to
investigate strengthenings of the ordinary assumptions. Foreman proposes to do
this by focussing on ``canonical structure" in set theory.
