The Historically Black Colleges and Universities – Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) is designed to enhance the quality of both undergraduate STEM education and
research at HBCUs to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. As
such, HBCU-UP provides support to principal investigators who are committed to
meeting the nation's accelerating demands for STEM talent through a number of
priority areas, including, supporting the professional development of HBCU
undergraduates majoring in STEM for entry into the STEM graduate programs and/or
the STEM workforce. Morgan State University, a Historically Black
College/University (HBCU) will work with partners committed to broadening
participation in STEM to host a Student Technical Symposium at Lincoln
University, another HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dr. George Carruthers Student
Technical Research Symposium will be held in conjunction with the 93rd annual
meeting of the National Technical Association and support the professional
development of 60 HBCU students. The students, representing 20 HBCUs, will have
the opportunity to present the results of their research, engage with scientific
experts, and participate in a geosciences workshop. The workshop will emphasize
the development of students’ communication skills in STEM by providing diverse
platforms for students to present their research, including oral and poster
delivery, and provide award incentives to students who excel in the diverse
forms of delivery. Ultimately, the conference will impact students from
populations that are historically underrepresented in STEM fields, which include
African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
