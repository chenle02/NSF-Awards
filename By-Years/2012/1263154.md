The Chemistry REU program at Syracuse University (SU) will provide research
opportunities for students in a unique research environment created to combine
structured learning with maximum hands-on time in the laboratory. Participants
will experience the entire scientific process: planning and conducting
experiments, interpreting results, drawing conclusions, and presenting their
results in written and oral form. The overall theme of the program is "research
in chemistry", involving all faculty members in the department. This topic was
chosen to expose participants to the full breadth of chemical research,
including the vast array of chemistry subfields and related interdisciplinary
topics. Additional funds will extend the program to several other students, some
of them participants in the SU LSAMP program, plus two high school teachers. The
unique partnership with Le Moyne College (LMC) in Syracuse will support the
development of year-round collaborative research programs between the two
institutions. Specific emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of at least
one veteran utilizing SU's or LMC's veteran's resource center. Financial support
and recruiting assistance by several minority inclusion programs on campus
(LSAMP, McNair, and CSTEP) demonstrates SU's commitment to involve
underrepresented students in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program
will introduce a diverse group of students to a rigorous research environment,
motivating and readying them for scientific careers or graduate school in the
chemical sciences. The program will include veteran students, minority students,
students with limited access to research, international students, and high
school teachers, providing all with the benefit of exposure to peers with wide-
ranging experience and perspectives. Results will be reported through
publications and conference presentations, many made by the students themselves.
Students will be involved in highly relevant research projects that directly
benefit society while covering the breadth of chemical research.
