This instrumentation development project will develop new hardware for enhancing
and modifying a Mackereth coring device for use in water depth from 20 to 6,000
meters. The design will allow recovery of large diameter (12.7cm), precisely
oriented, and undisturbed 10-meter sediment cores. The new deep-water corer will
have significant advantages over presently used piston corers and will have
application in a variety of ocean science research applications.
