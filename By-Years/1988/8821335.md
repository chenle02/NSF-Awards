Traditionally, the rapid growth and development of the life sciences in the
United States at the end of the 19th century has been largely attributed to the
American adoption of the well- developed German ideal for physiology and
morphology. Recent scholarship, however, sees German science as only one factor,
and not the most important one at that, in shaping the development of American
biology. Dr. Benson, under this research grant, is completing his study of the
unique American setting for biology, especially in the context of the marine
biology laboratories. The early stations--the Anderson School of Natural History
on Penikese Island (1873), Alexander Agassiz's Newport Laboratory (1875) and
William Brooks' Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory (1878)--were summer institutes
to teach secondary school teachers the rudiments of natural history, the
descriptive study of the natural world that characterized American biology prior
to the 1880's. With the reform of science education, several of these
laboratories were established to provide opportunities for graduate students in
advanced instruction in biology. These included the Marine Biological Laboratory
at Woods Hole (1888), the Hopkins Marine Station (1892), the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography (1903) and the Friday Harbor Laboratories (1904). These stations
played a critical role in the growth and development of American biology, from
its roots in the natural history tradition to its position when it began to come
of age and gain an international leadership role at the turn of the century. Dr.
Benson will provide a critical assessment of the American development of marine
laboratories and the role these institutions played in the growth and maturation
of American biology.
