Faeth 97 27020 Endophytic fungi frequently live intracellularly within the
tissues of plants with little obvious indication of their presence. In grasses
these symbionts have been thought to increase plant resistance to herbivory,
resistance to drought, and the competitive abilities of some plants in their
interactions with their neighbors. Despite the widespread occurrence of these
associations, however, information on the nature of fungal-plant interactions
remains limited. This project will continue investigations of the relationship
between endophytic fungus, Neotyphodium, and Arizona fescue an economically
important range grass in the southwest. An earlier series of experiments, funded
by the Ecology program at NSF, failed to demonstrate that these fungi, provide
any resistance to grazing by invertebrate herbivores, in contrast with widely
held conventional wisdom that such a resistance is provided. Alternative
hypotheses to be tested in this new work center on the observation that plants
increase root biomass and, possibly, osmoregulatory efficiency when infected by
fungi. It will examine the varying survival of seed, seedling, and mature-plant
stages of fescue under different conditions of soil moisture and nitrogen along
with fire frequency and intensity for different plant genotypes. It will employ
a series of field and laboratory experiments to test the notion that the
Neotyphodium-Arizona fescue mutualism is context dependent. It will also
consider that fire may be an evolutionary factor that maintains these
associations. The results of this work will increase the understanding of the
role of microoganisms in plant-animal interactions, plant population dynamics
and the organization of plant-microbe-herbivore communities. It will shed
insight into the evolution, ecology and maintenance of mutualistic interactions.
It will also provide useful information for the maintenance important
southwestern grasslands.
