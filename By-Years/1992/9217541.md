This Science in Developing Countries award will support twelve U.S.
mathematicians to participate in the Second Latin American Meeting in Analysis.
This meeting is being organized by the Latin American Federation of Mathematical
Societies and the Colombian Mathematical Society and will emphasize nonlinear
analysis, functional analysis, partial differential equations and differential
geometry and other areas of analysis. Participants will deliver plenary talks
and lead informal sessions with Latin American researchers interested in a
common set of problems. The project will involve students and active
researchers. This meeting will provide an opportunity for highly regarded U.S.
mathematicians to interact with their Latin American counterparts. This
opportunity is fundamental, not only in fostering short and log- term projects
on specific research problems in analysis, but also in helping to sustain the
mathematical infrastructure of the countries of the region.
