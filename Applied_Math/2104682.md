This project seeks to understand an important universal stabilizing phenomenon
concerning several incompressible fluids. The magnetic field stabilizes and
damps electrically conducting fluids, a phenomenon observed in many physical
experiments and numerical simulations. The temperature tames and stabilizes
buoyancy driven fluids and helps the formation of stable structures in turbulent
thermal convection. These are just two outstanding examples of a universal
stabilizing phenomenon. The goal of this project is to fully comprehend this
remarkable phenomenon and establish these observations as mathematically
rigorous stability results on the models governing the dynamics of these flows.
Understanding the proposed stability problems will help gain insight into many
astronomical and meteorological phenomena such as Northern lights, solar flares,
and severe weather events. The PIs will integrate the proposed research with the
training of graduate students. In addition, the PIs will host events to get more
K-16 students interested in these mathematical topics.

This project focuses on the stability and large-time dynamics of the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations near a background magnetic field and on the
Boussinesq equations near the hydrostatic equilibrium. Mathematically these are
extremely difficult problems. The fluid velocity in these MHD and Boussinesq
systems is governed by the Euler or the Euler-like equations. The corresponding
vorticity gradients could potentially grow rather rapidly in time. This makes
the proposed stability problems appear to be impossible. The goal here is to
solve these difficult problems by creating new strategies and innovative
approaches. In particular, the PIs will reverse some of the classical approaches
to the global regularity and stability problems on the MHD and the Boussinesq
equations and treat the bad terms such as the Lorentz force and the buoyancy
force in these models as good terms and exploit the smoothing and stabilizing
effect of the magnetic field and the temperature. In addition, extensive
numerical simulations will be performed to complement the theoretical studies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
