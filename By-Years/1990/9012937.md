The proposed research program aims to study a number of transport processes in
two-phase materials using a variety of theoretical techniques. Example of
problems to be investigated include the effect of polydispersity on: (1) the
thermocapillary migration of drops and bubbles in a gravity- free environment;
2) the effective shear viscosity of suspensions, and 3) the permeability of a
packed bed. Calculations will be performed using both exact solutions, which are
limited in their validity to small particle concentrations, as well as the
effective medium technique developed by one of the PI's. In addition, an attempt
will be made to place this method on a firmer foundation and to extend its scope
so as to determine the pair probability function in flowing suspensions.
Finally, it is proposed to develop a general kinetic model for computing the
variation of the particle distribution functions in flowing suspensions.
