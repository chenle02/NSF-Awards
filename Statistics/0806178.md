Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has several disadvantages when compared to
classical Monte Carlo methods. In particular, an important issue that every
practitioner faces when implementing MCMC is when to stop the computation.
Typically, a mixture of experience and ad hoc methods is employed to make this
decision. Thus one is forced to wonder about the quality of the inference. The
investigator studies sequential fixed-width methods that allow construction of
an interval estimator for the quantity of interest. The interval estimator
describes the confidence in the point estimate. The investigator uses this to
study the development of valid stopping rules when the MCMC computation is aimed
at estimating general quantities of the target distribution. These methods
require the Markov chain to converge at a geometric rate which in turn implies
there is a limiting distribution of the point estimate in the settings of
interest. Thus the investigator studies the convergence rates of Markov chains
encountered in two broad classes of Bayesian models.

MCMC methods have become a standard technique in the toolbox of applied
statisticians (and many scientists in other disciplines). Indeed, it is not much
of an overstatement to say that it has revolutionized applied statistics,
especially that of the Bayesian variety. Unfortunately, MCMC methods are not
always used carefully leading to dubious claims in the literature. In
particular, there has been little effort to include measures of uncertainty in
inferential conclusions. Rigorously addressing the issue of stopping rules in
terms of these measures of uncertainty enhances infrastructure for research and
education by providing statisticians and other scientists valid techniques for
using MCMC to make inference in their research setting.
