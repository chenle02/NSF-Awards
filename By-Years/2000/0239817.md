This Career Proposal describes a research plan to exploit innovative ideas and
research data to search for new forms of matter and interactions beyond those of
the standard model. The proposed research is to understand predictions of
Supersymmetry and extra space-time dimensions and investigate their observable
consequences for particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The educational
component is meant to spark scientific interest in both high school and college
students. Working with Lankford and lead teachers of QuarkNet the PI intends to
develop an intensive two week Associate Teacher Institute to train high school
teachers in frontier topics of physics. These teachers will also visit SLAC and
learn how to analyze data from recent experiments. There will be an attempt to
integrate this knowledge into the high school curriculum. At the undergraduate
level, Peer Instruction will be implemented in the physics lecture course.
