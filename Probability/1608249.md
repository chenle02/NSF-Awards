This research project investigates three classes of questions in probability
theories. One class concerns lattice gauge theories, which are discrete
approximations of quantum field theories. Quantum field theories are central to
the modern understanding of particle physics but do not yet have a firm
mathematical foundation, and a proper mathematical understanding of quantum
field theories has long been a goal of not only mathematicians, but also of
theoretical physicists. This project aims to shed light on some fundamental
mathematical questions in this area. A second class of questions involves
theoretical properties of importance sampling and various applications of these
properties. Importance sampling is central to development of a strong foundation
for computational statistics; the results of this work are anticipated to be
useful in a wide variety of research areas outside mathematics in which
scientific computing is used, including computer science, physics, chemistry,
computational biology, and a variety of engineering disciplines. The third class
of questions centers on probabilistic techniques for establishing properties of
dynamical systems. The questions under study connect several areas of
mathematics, including number theory, microlocal analysis, and partial
differential equations. The project includes training of graduate students in
probability theory and its applications.

The project will study several questions in probability. One class of problems
concerns the evaluation of Wilson loop expectations in lattice gauge theories,
which has important applications in physics. The project aims to provide a rare
rigorous result in this topic, giving the first proper mathematical
justification for the famous 1/N expansion of lattice gauge theories. A second
class of problems involves theoretical properties of importance sampling and
various applications of these properties. The project aims to solve the
mathematical problem of determining the minimum sample size required for good
performance of importance sampling in any given setting. Lastly, a third class
of problems centers around probabilistic techniques for proving that small
perturbations of Dirichlet Laplacians are quantum unique ergodic.
