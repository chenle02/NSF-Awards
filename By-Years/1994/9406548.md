With funding from the Organic Dynamics program Professors Garst, Stickney, and
Anderson at the University of Georgia will study the mechanism of Grignard
formation with particular emphasis on surface effects that occur during the
dissolution of magnesium metal as it reacts with various organic halides. This
study will help to delineate mechanisms of Grignard reagent formation, provide
knowledge about the metal-solution interface and corrosion process, relate
Grignard reagent formation to classical theories of corrosion, reveal aspects of
the roles of polar solutes, and contribute to a knowledge base that will support
rational approaches to both synthetic problems and the problems of the
mechanisms of other dissolving-metal reductions. This project will explore how a
reactive metal like magnesium reacts with organic halogen compounds to produce a
reactive intermediate called a Grignard reagent. In addition, the specific
effects that occur on the surface of the magnesium during the reaction will be
studied and compared with the corrosion of metals that occurs in commercial
products such as cars, boats, and other consumer products.
