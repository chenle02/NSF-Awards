The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a computational model of
prosody for speech synthesis and analysis, and (2) evaluate this model in speech
synthesis and as a potential knowledge source for speech recognition and
understanding. The approach is multidisciplinary, combining linguistic theory,
speech knowledge and statistical modeling technique. The initial model is based
on FM radio newscasting speech. The research effort includes: design and
collection of an appropiate database, hand labeling of prosodic units and
measurement of their acoustic correlates in part of the database, development of
techniques to automatically segement and label prosodic units, implementation
and evaluation of the model for analysis and synthesis.
