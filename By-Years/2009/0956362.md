The research objective of this award is to explore the hypothesis that
mechanical symmetry governs the evolution, production, and comprehension of all
natural and constructed language. Initial work will focus on an analysis of
mechanical symmetry in written Arabic numerals. A preliminary study has already
shown that these numerals constitute nine of twenty characters that are unique
up to affine transformation when represented in the canonical seven-segment
projective space used by a digital clock. This study will be extended to
consider symmetry in the generation as well as perception of numerals using a
model of handwriting production derived from the fields of robotics and motor
neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
may ultimately transform the way scientists and engineers think about language
by establishing a common set of mechanical properties that all spoken, written,
or signed alphabets must share in order to be easily produced and comprehended.
This set of properties may allow the systematic construction of new languages
that are not spoken, written, or signed, for example to enable communication
through neural sensors in a brain- machine interface. It may also have
application to speech therapy, to natural language processing, and to diagnosis
and treatment of learning disabilities like dyslexia. These research goals are
aligned with a broader K-to-PhD education and outreach plan that will integrate
systems engineering and neuroscience and will target underrepresented students
for involvement in multi-disciplinary education and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
