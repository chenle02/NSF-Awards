Data science research advances society globally through new knowledge and
methods. Research collaborations that cross international boarders allows the
best ideas to emerge from wherever they exist. The US-Serbia and West Balkan
Data Science Workshop, co-funded by the National Science Foundation and partners
in West Balkans region, brings together the best minds in data science. The
workshop focuses on four timely areas of research: mathematical foundations, big
data processing including security and privacy, data science in biomedical
informatics, and data science in computational
archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science
Workshop is structured in such a way as to have a lasting impact on data science
collaboration between the US and the West Balkans region through facilitated
interaction and follow through on high impact research topics in data
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
