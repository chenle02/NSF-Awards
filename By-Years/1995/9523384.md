EEC-9523384 Howes This award provides funding for a one year extension to the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Grinding at the University
of Connecticut. The Center will continue to develop research activities and to
advance the state-of-the-art understandings on grinding through several major
core fundamental research activities:1.) Vibration, Control, and Dynamics; 2.)
Truing and Dressing; 3.) Grinding Fluids; 4.)Materials and Surfaces. In
addition, the Center will continue to develop testbed research projects in
cooperation with its company members to conduct the proof-of-concept
implementation and prtotyping. The Center currently has 13 industrial members.
In the past few years, the Center has established a strong research program and
has achieved tremendous success in terms of research, technology transfer,
industrial collaboration, and spin-off activities. Through the Center's
activities, university faculty, and students, industrial members have enjoyed a
very close and mutual beneficial working relationship. This University of
Connecticut requests a one year renewal of the Center to capitalize on these
success and help expand the impact onto other U.S. manufacturing industries.
