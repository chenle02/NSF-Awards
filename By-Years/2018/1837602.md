The University of Texas Austin proposes a project -- AWSM in CS (Accelerating
Women's Success and Mastery in Computer Science, pronounced "Awesome in CS") --
that develops a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) to improve the
recruitment, retention and success of females in high school computer science
(CS) courses. There is a growing consensus on the importance of K-12 CS
education as the CSforAll movement gains traction across the country, and this
has resulted in increased access for many students. In Texas, overall student
enrollment in K-12 CS has increased substantially over the past five years (124%
increase), as has the participation for students of color (154% increase) and
for low-income students (156% increase). Similar gains, however, have not been
seen for female enrollment (104% increase). AWSM in CS aims to change that.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;AWSM in CS researchers and practitioners will engage in a
root cause analysis to examine the primary drivers for the underrepresentation
of women through the context of recruitment, instruction, and school/community
culture/policy. It will then implement and test a holistic, research-based
approach to tackling female underrepresentation with three years of PDSA (Plan-
Do-Study-Act) cycles to iterate on interventions to build their effectiveness.
NIC practitioners will be supported through virtual and in-person professional
development and network building experiences. Outcomes including female
enrollment and completion of CS courses, Advanced Placement (AP) test taking and
performance, and subsequent CS course enrollment will be measured. The role of
the NIC in addressing teacher and student needs will be researched
qualitatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
