The goal of this project is to design metrics of online reputation that are both
robust to gaming agents and efficiently computable. This will be done through
development of an axiomatic framework for reputation together with novel
algorithms that make the framework useful. This work will be grounded in
practical online reputation systems of contemporary interest, and issues arising
in real systems will guide axiomatic and algorithmic
developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To navigate the complex web of information
and agents on the Internet, society has increasingly come to rely on automated
systems that assess reputation. Some prominent examples of such reputation
systems are the PageRank mechanism used by the Google search engine, the
feedback based rating scheme for the online auction site eBay, and the incentive
scheme used by the popular file sharing system KaZaA. All these reputation
systems are vulnerable to gaming by selfish agents trying to improve their own
rating. Fundamentally, these reputation systems suffer from a misalignment
between economic incentives of individual users and aggregate value to society.
This research program will have a significant impact on several important
problem domains such as ranking of web pages and blogs, online marketplaces, and
peer-to-peer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online services such as search
engines and auction sites have become an important part of our national
infrastructure and need to be protected against greedy or malicious tampering.
This research will contribute to the robustness of such systems. Additionally,
the purpose of reputation systems is to gather highly imperfect information from
many sources, and to process it into a comprehensible prediction of outcomes
(e.g., whether a vendor will be reliable). Certain national security needs could
conceivably be met with variants of reputation systems. One of the great
challenges of intelligence assessment is to determine what information is
reliable and what is not. The proposed research should help in addressing this
challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elements of the research will be integrated into
undergraduate and graduate courses on optimization, game theory, Markov chains,
public policy, and Internet technology.&lt;br/&gt;
