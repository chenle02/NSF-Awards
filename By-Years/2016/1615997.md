This program will study the clustering properties of galaxies with the primary
goal of testing dark energy models. "Dark energy" is the name given to the
mysterious cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe. Broader impacts
include training of graduate students. In addition, the PI will work on
improvements and extensions of the existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV Plates
for Schools program. The simulation and mock catalog tools developed will be
publicly released and have application to other science investigations using
several existing and future spectroscopic sky surveys. The software developed
for the analysis of multiple dark energy and modified gravity models will be
publicly released.

The investigators will use eBOSS galaxy survey data and produce mock galaxy
catalogs to examine 3D clustering statistics with goals including distinguishing
among dark energy models, testing statistical homogeneity with the observed
large-scale structure, improving systematic weights, and improving the realism
of mock catalogs by including tidal fields.
