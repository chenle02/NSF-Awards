Research will be conducted on how to model numerically the collision of two
black holes. In particular the application of cutting edge numerical analysis
techniques will be considered in order to obtain codes that are long term
stable. Investigations will also be carried out on how to use&lt;br/&gt;the
recently introduced consistent discretizations of the Einstein equations for the
purpose of quantizing the theory. The two areas of research mentioned are
nominally quite distinct thematically but surprisingly have several elements in
common due to the use of discretizations in both approaches.
