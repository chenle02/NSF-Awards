This project provides a curriculum for introductory Anthropology, Archaeology,
and Prehistory Courses that emphasizes scientific procedures of analysis in five
principal topical areas. These topical areas include primate and hominid
evolution, methods in prehistory, technological evolution, and migration. Within
each topical area, the program also focuses on a series of teaching and learning
tasks such as modules and group, laboratory and field activities. It is expected
that the students will enhance their knowledge of evolution and prehistory, as
well as acquire skills in the scientific process, data collection, and
evaluation.
