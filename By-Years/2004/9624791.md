This research will formulate and develop a method for controlling the traffic
carried on a broadband communication network, specifically for the case of
carrying diverse real traffic sources with difficult to model and analyze
queueing properties; inter-source correlation; slowly varying statistical
properties; diverse heterogeneous source types; mis-specified traffic
descriptors; and inadvertent network traffic shaping. The focus is the case when
the traffic sources are given quality of service guarantees and the goal is to
maximize utilization of network resources. The method is based on statistical
classification techniques that use historical data as to what were acceptable
combinations of carried traffic and what were not. Problems addressed include
efficient representation and storage of historical data; choice and modification
strategy of classifier model; noise on the data; confidence intervals on
decisions; directed and undirected exploration of the decision space; filtering
out uninformative data; and implementations. The effectiveness and advantages of
the methods developed will be experimentally tested against alternative methods
on simple models and real traffic traces such as ethernet data; variable rate
video; and ISDN traffic.
