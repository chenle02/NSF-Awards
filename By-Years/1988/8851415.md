St. Mary's College will purchase an optical bench, a 5 mW He-Ne laser and
associated optics, a photodiode array, an interferometer system, a fiber optic
system, and a holographic system. This equipment will be used to improve
instruction in the advanced physics laboratory course by permitting the addition
of several new experiments in modern optics. These experiments are designed to
give students training in the use of modern optical equipment as well as
improving their understanding of the basic physical phenomena. St. Mary's
College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
