The institution acquired an Infowindow System to expand and improve its learning
Center. This enabled the college to promote an appreciation and understanding of
chemistry in the community as well as strengthen the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum. The developed for the system are used for chemical technicians
employed in area industry, for middle and high school students in the area, and
for curriculum students at the college. This project extended the educational
opportunities to chemists working in the industries, allowed middle school and
high school students to come in contact with more elaborate and sophisticated
applications in chemistry, and allowed more interesting and challenging
laboratory experiences for the college's curriculums students. This project also
resulted in the development of new video programs in chemistry, reduced health
hazards, allowed new experiences for students, and permitted students with
disabilities to perform some labs that otherwise they would not have been able
to accomplish. The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to
the NSF funds.
