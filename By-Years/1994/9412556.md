9412556 Stack Research will be conducted in theoretical elementary particle
physics. The primary purpose of this work will be to gain a physical
understanding of how quarks are confined inside nuclear particles or hadrons.
Quantum chromodynamics is the theory describing quarks and their interactions,
and the proposed work will involve supercomputer simulations of quantum
chromodynamics. These simulations provide data unobtainable by other means,
which can be used to provide a physical picture of the forces confining quarks.
The forces underlie all the phenomena of nuclear physics, and rank in importance
with the more familiar forces of gravity and electromagnetism. ***
