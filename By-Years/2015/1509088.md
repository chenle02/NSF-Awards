This award will support research in the structures, called phases, which emerge
in systems with many components as the number of components grows. We will study
complex networks, simple models consisting only of abstract nodes and edges
between them. These models are simpler than those traditionally used to analyze
phases, and the simplicity will allow us to better understand how phases
transition between one another as control parameters vary, a study of wide
application in the sciences and technology. Possible applications range from
management of urban construction projects to astrophysics computations and
understanding behavior of granular media, such as sand and grain
piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototype of emergent systems are the phases in
molecular materials in thermal equilibrium, and they have been studied
intensively, but only special sorts of phases and transitions have been
successfully modeled; in particular there has never been a satisfactory model of
the emergence of the solid phase, or the fluid-solid transition. We will modify
the microcanonical ensemble of statistical mechanics to study complex networks,
which exhibit phases analogous to solid and fluid phases, and we will exploit
the relative simplicity of these models to better understand such phases and the
phase transitions between them.
