This research program focuses on the measurement of differential s-wave
scattering phase shifts to determine cold collision cross-sections for the
cesium atom. The measurement relies on the technique of juggling atoms in a
laser-cooled fountain clock to avoid the necessity of determining atom
densities. Accuracies better than 10 mrad are anticipated.
