&lt;br/&gt;The project will support the development and implementation of a
workshop/symposium, held by the College of Engineering of Tuskegee University,
in partnership with a number of engineering departments and engineering
colleges, professional organizations, and individual experts. The event will
facilitate the gathering of information to establish the methods used by the
HBCU engineering schools to achieve success in degree production among
underrepresented minorities, especially African-American students. The symposium
will also address the development of a vision for strengthening HBCU engineering
institutions, determining what strategies might assist the further development
of students, and improving corporate partnerships, governmental service, and
collaboration with majority institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By identifying
successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of the proposed
collaborative website and other participant-based communications through
participating institutions, the PI anticipates that engineering
departments/colleges will be motivated to consider ways to improve their
academic programs through use of the best practices established in the symposium
(and documented by participants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
