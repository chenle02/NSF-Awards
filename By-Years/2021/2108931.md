Upcoming surveys of high-redshift galaxies and the neutral hydrogen from which
they formed will offer an unprecedented glimpse into the epoch of Cosmic Dawn.
These surveys offer an opportunity to discover, or at least constrain, new
physical phenomena in a previously unexplored era in the history of the cosmos.
This project takes advantage of this opportunity by demonstrating the potential
for observations of Cosmic Dawn to be a uniquely effective probe of dark matter
particle physics. While dark matter is broadly understood to be an essential
element of our cosmic environment, its fundamental nature as a physical
phenomenon is still not yet known. Modeling the high-redshift galaxy luminosity
function and 21cm power spectrum will allow us to set new constraints on the
properties of dark matter. To enhance the public impact of this project, the
researchers will initiate a program of “video abstract” productions for students
describing their published work for a non-technical audience. These video
abstracts will be produced by the students themselves and will be posted on a
dedicated public YouTube channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will model
the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function and 21cm power spectrum, two
complementary probes of reionization-era astrophysics, to set new constraints on
the properties of dark matter. The results will address the possibility,
suggested by a wide range of theoretical models, that dark matter might self-
annihilate in regions of high density. In the course of this project, novel
semi-analytic and numerical codes to incorporate dark matter annihilation
physics in galaxy formation and reionization will be
published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
