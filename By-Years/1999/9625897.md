DMS 96-25897 Christensen The investigators study methods for evaluating the
independence assumption in standard normal theory linear models and in
generalized linear models. The research develops both formal tests and informal
graphical procedures for evaluating independence. The methods are based on the
formation of rational subgroups of observations that were collected under
similar circumstances. The formal tests for independence are based on models
that incorporate the subgroups into the linear structure. For normal theory
linear models the procedures can also be used to provide tests for variance
component models. The researchers study the properties of these tests.
Statistical models are widely used in the physical and social sciences for
prediction and for understanding the relationships among factors in complex
systems. Statistical models are used in environmental evaluation, to improve
industrial processes, and to develop chemical processes. An important assumption
made in most statistical models is that observations are obtained
``independently'' of one another. This assumption has important ramifications
for the validity of statistical procedures. Assuming independence, when it is
not true, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Unfortunately, this assumption has
traditionally been very difficult to evalute. The investigators develop new
methods for evaluating the validity of the independence assumption and study the
behavior of those methods.
