9504084 Kamber The proposed research is in index and foliation theory with
applications to mathematical physics. The proposed problems are central problems
in the abstract index theory and have significant applications to gauge theories
and anomalies. Foliation reduction techniques introduced earlier by the
investigator may prove to have interesting connections to the newly discovered
Seiberg-Witten monopole equations. Foliation theory seeks to understand the
global behavior of spaces of solutions to ordinary differential equations; index
theory assigns integers and other easily identifiable quantities to these spaces
and aims to distinguish different spaces by means of their indices. The
techniques and results developed here continue to find applications in various
parts of mathematical physics.
