This US-Slovenian mathematics project between B. A. Sethuraman of the California
State University, Northridge, and his partner, Tomaz Kosir of the University of
Ljubljana, examines concrete and computational problems concerned with commuting
sets of matrices. Together they intend to study varieties that are a
generalization of determinantal varieties with some emphasis on determinantal
varieties of invariant subspaces and varieties of commuting matrices. These are
fundamental questions associated with geometric properties of matrices that have
relevance to graphing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joint research plan employs a
mix of classical algebraic geometry, computational algebra, combinatorial
commutative algebra and representations theory. Junior researchers from both
universities will participate in portions of the research. This collaboration
builds upon initial work by Sethuraman and Kosir on commuting triples of
matrices and utilizes complementary strengths of the U.S. side in algebra and
Slovenian expertise in matrix and operator theory. Results should lead to
refined models for using linear algebra in numerical computations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
