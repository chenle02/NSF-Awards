The principal investigator studies numerical methods for the solution of
nonlinear equations and optimization problems with a focus on continuation
methods, nonsmooth problems, and multilevel methods for integral equations. The
main topics of the research are (1) the development and analysis of multilevel
continuation algorithms for optimization problems with integral equation
constraints and the application of those methods in simulating atomic and
molecular fluids, (2) the design and analysis of continuation/quasi-Newton
methods for nonsmooth nonlinear least squares, with applications to calibration
of models of blood flow, (3) continued study of the conditioning of the linear
systems and eigenproblems that arise when pseudo-arclength continuation is used
in bifurcation analysis, and (4) multi-model methods in which one physical
model, based on differential or integral equations, for example, is used as a
preconditioner for a solver which is based on a more accurate, more expensive to
evaluate model, such as a molecular dynamics or stochastic simulation.

Nonlinear equations and optimization problems are commonly encountered in
science and engineering. Motivated by applications in chemistry and medicine,
the principal investigator studies equations with multiple solutions, the
challenge being to determine which of those solutions represents the real world
and which cannot be seen in actual physical systems, and optimization problems
for which standard methods and computer codes fail. This work should lead to new
approaches useful in many branches of science and engineering.
