This project will investigate the degree and order of importance of the many
parameters affecting the management decisions concerning the operation and
maintenance of water supply/wastewater collection systems. Parameters include,
technological, economic, risk assessments, scheduling operational, and
maintenance considerations. The results of this investigation will be useful to
managers and decision makers concerned with the opeation and maintenance of
public works systems. These systems have been in place for decades and are
showing signs of deterioration. A management system is needed in order to plan
and schedule the required repairs, strengthening or replacement of portions of
the system.
