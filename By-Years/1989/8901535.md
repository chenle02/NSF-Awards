This award supports an international workshop on Andean biology to be held at
the University of Cerro de Pasco in Peru from October 14 to 21, 1989. The U.S.
organizer is Cynthia Carey of the University of Colorado at Boulder and her
Peruvian counterpart is Carlos Monge whose specialty is high altitude
physiology. Other participants were chosen for having various kinds of
expertise, including systematics, biogeography, ecology, limnology and animal
behavior. Because this range of interests is represented by both the U.S. and
Peruvian scientists, there is an unusually good opportunity for the exchange of
ideas and for the possibility of future scientific cooperation. In this way the
goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program will be fulfilled.
