9505551 Hakimi Effective communication in networks is emerging as a critical
factor in improving the performance of distributed systems including
multiprocessor computers and computer networks. Research in this project will
focus on three classes of problems: 1) the design of effective sequential and
parallel algorithms for certain common communication functions in networks, such
as all-to-all broadcast or "gossiping"; 2) the study of gossiping in a faulty
environment and its application to the problem of automatic identification of
the faulty units; and 3) the investigation of gossiping in wireless (radio)
networks and the channel assignment problem in cellular telephone systems. Work
will also include extending the PI's previous work on effective information
dissemination in networks with emphasis on devising efficient approximation
algorithms for known difficult problems and extending work on distributed
gossiping algorithms in a faulty environment to make it applicable to automatic
identification of intermittently faulty units in a network. The principal
investigator will also study problems in wireless networks and cellular systems
using generalizations of graph coloring problems. ***
