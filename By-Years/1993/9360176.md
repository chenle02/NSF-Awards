ABSTRACT: 9360176, PI-Sokol: In the materials industry, the product design is
documented using hard copy material specifications. Whereas the majority of
discrete manufacturers have the availability of computerized tools like Computer
Aided Design, material suppliers are primarily paper based. Since the material
specification is the "hub" of all engineering activity, the totally paper based
specifications have been a major obstacle to implementing concurrent engineering
in the material industry. This research will seek to define a conceptual design
for the implementation of a computerized material specification system i.e., a
concurrent engineering design system for material suppliers. The six month
technical effort is structured to formulate the design with the assistance of
two "industry partners" (a major titanium suppler and a major composite material
supplier). The proposed solution has strong commercial application at material
suppliers such as steel, nickel, titanium, and composites companies; as well as
the basic industries such as forging and casting companies.
