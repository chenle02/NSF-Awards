This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at Stanford University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will search for very rare decays of the K-meson. Previous
searches by this group have established the present world limits on
nonconservation of lepton number. The new experiment should improve those limits
by over a factor of ten. Within the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, such
decays are forbidden. If observed, such decays would open a window on physics
beyond the Standard Model.
