How do females pick a mate? Do social interactions modify innate preferences?
Understanding how genes and social environment interact to produce mating
patterns is important for understanding how the spectacular diversity in animal
morphology evolves and is maintained. This proposed work aims to determine
whether social interactions and visual and olfactory communication are
associated with the maintenance of animal morphological diversity by determining
whether mate preferences for physical appearances can be learned and mediated by
the presence of olfactory signals in one of the most diverse groups of animals:
butterflies. Having determined that females can learn to like specific male
physical appearances, the chemical signals of male butterflies will be modified
to 1) determine whether female innate preferences for male odors facilitate
female learning preferences for physical appearance, and 2) determine whether
females can learn preferences for specific male odors. Male-male interactions
during female mate choice trials will also be observed to determine how male-
male competition mediates female preference. This will be the first study
examining 1) the role of pre-mating female experience on the relative importance
of male appearance and odor in any animal; and 2) the combinatorial role of male
activity and male appearance in non-vertebrates, illuminating how social
interactions and multiple signals influence mating patterns and drive the
evolution of diverse animal forms.&lt;br/&gt;This research will train an
undergraduate researcher, and will be used to engage non-science majors in
scientific thought processes during mentoring sessions and social interactions
via the graduate affiliate program at an undergraduate dorm. Findings from this
project will be displayed on a public website on the biology of Bicyclus
anynana, in the form of reader-friendly multi-media web-pages accessible to
high-school students, the public at large and the scientific community.
