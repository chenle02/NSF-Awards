The goal of this proposal is to greatly improve the detection sensitivity and
reduce the cost of biosensors for detecting biological entities. Genetically
engineered yeast strains will be developed to enable highly specific detection
while maximizing sensitivity. Application to clinically relevant proteins that
are below the current detection limit will be investigated. Application of the
biosensors are expected in the fields of food safety, biological security,
monitoring environmental pollution, and detecting disease
indicators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the work is to develop a cost-
effective technology that enables extremely high sensitivity immunosensing by
applying genetically engineered cells as an immunoaffinity reagent and signal
amplification. The approach will be tested for detecting a model biomarker in
the diagnosis early indication of neurodegeneration. Genetic engineering
approaches allow generation of cells with pre-designed biological functionality
which can be mass-produced at low cost. In this work, specifically designed
yeast strains that "capture" a target antigen will be made, and others that
"detect/amplify" the target binding signal will also be incorporated. Since the
engineered cells contain thousands of both reporter (e.g. fluorescent protein)
and/or immunosensing entity (e.g. antibody fragment), multilevel signal
amplification after immunoreaction can be realized, which facilitates the
detection of ultra-low concentration. To ensure specificity of detection,
control cells expressing a distinct reporter and control antibody fragment (not
binding to the target) will be included in each sample, enabling ratiometric
quantitation of specific signal over non-specific background. Since both
"capture" and "detection/amplification" reagents can be produced by culturing
modified yeasts, the immunoassay cost can potentially be reduced. The major
research objectives are: generation and characterization of engineered "capture"
and "detection/amplification" yeast cells; optimization of expression level and
accessibility for maximizing detection sensitivity; and finally, application of
the novel multifunctional signal amplifiers for immunoassay of human Tau protein
(an Alzheimer's disease biomarker). The proposed genetically engineered
multifunctional signal amplifiers are not limited to the proposed specific
application, and can be generalized as a universal platform for monitoring any
biomolecule of interest. The work also integrates research aims with educational
activities, via the development of a new graduate course and undergraduate
research.
