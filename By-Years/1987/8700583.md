This research program addresses the high temperature deformation of boron-doped
nickel aluminide. Fundamental mechanisms responsible for high temperature creep
and superplastic deformation will be studied. The unusual temperature dependence
of the yield strength of this material, i.e., an increasing yield strength with
increasing temperature up to a maximum, makes it a particularly interesting
material for high temperature applications. Mechanisms causing creep and
superplastic behavior are not well understood. The nature of the ordered
lattice, including anisotropy of antiphase boundary energy and details of the
cross- slip process, make the creep properties quite different from those
observed in solid solution alloys. This project will investigate the rate-
controlling micromechanisms of elevated temperature deformation in this ordered
alloy.
