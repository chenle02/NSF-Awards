ABSTRACT CTS-9321876 Pennsylvania State University P. I.: Gita Talmage This
work consists of numerical and analytical research on the effect of magnetic
fields on the Czochralski crystal-growth process. The unique feature rests with
the examination of magnet fields flow instabilities that affect crystal growth.
There are two principal problems to be examined. The first consists of the
transition from steady laminar to unsteady, periodic laminar flow within an
interior. The second focuses on flow instabilities due to thermocapillary
effects. These problems are posed in terms of the equations of
magnetohydrodynamics in which added to the usual Navier-Stokes equations are
terms that model the production of momentum due to the electromagnetic filed.
Czochralski crystal-growth is a widely used microelectronics. The melt is an
electrically conducting fluid and, is often in the presence of a magnet field
which strongly influence the bulk flows and hence the quality of the final
product.
