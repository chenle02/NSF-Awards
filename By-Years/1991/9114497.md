This proposal is for support of the Eight Optical Fiber Sensors Conference,
Monterey, CA, January 29-31, 1992. This conference serves as the principal
international forum for reporting advances in the development and applications
of optical fiber sensors, guided wave optical sensors, and the underlying
fundamental technologies and components. Optical fiber sensors have important
applications to many commercial technology areas, such as in industrial control,
building structures, avionics and medicine. The increasing diversity of
applications of this sensor technology is the main impetus for this request of
conference support from the IEEE. Funds are sought to provide partial support
for travel and conference expenses of graduate students and faculty who may be
relatively new to the field.
