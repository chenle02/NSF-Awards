9308476 Pejcinovic The proposed research will concentrate on investigating noise
in photodetectors: its sources, magnitude, and effect on performance. The
research tool for this study is the Monte Carlo method tailored for the
simulation of realistic devices. This has the advantage that new device designs
do not have to be manufactured before their performance can be examined;
instead, their characteristics are simulated on a computer. The Monte Carlo
method is a statistical method used to solve the Boltzmann transport equation
and noise is directly calculated from the fluctuations of the underlying
physical quantities: velocity and number of electrons or holes. The method will
first be calibrated on some simple devices and then applied to progressively
more difficult and complex cases, including p-i-n photodiodes, avalanche
photodiodes, and quantum well infrared photodetectors. The advantages and
disadvantages of each design will be examined and possible ways of improving the
performance investigated. Since noise can be very sensitive to the details of
the physical models used in simulation, this study can also be used to learn
more about properties of materials used for photodetectors. ***
