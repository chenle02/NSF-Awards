9413719 Kang This Academic Research Infrastructure Program (Instrumentation)
grant is to partially fund the acquisition and development of an ultra-high
vacuum apparatus that couples high temperature stress testing with chemical
materials science measurements. Multi- disciplinary materials research involving
high temperature structural materials development will be carried out on Ni-
based alloys, metal matrix composites, carbon based composites and thin film
coatings on fibers and surfaces. ***
