This is a proposal to carry out Phase II of a project re- sponding to Program
Solicitation No. NSF 89-30 of the SBIR Program. In Phase I, a simplified model
that calculates the complex of phy- sical processes that locally modulate large
scale meteorological fields (forecasted, e.g., by operational numerical weather
predict- ion models at the National Meteorological Center), was developed and
tested for feasibility in local forecasting applications. This differs from
conventional procedures, which use statistics derived from past weather records
to link local weather with large scale model variables. These have the
disadvantages that they are biased toward specififying average conditions, and
that they cannot be applied at sites with short periods of historical weather
data. It was demonstrated in Phase I that the parameters of the model can be
objectively adjusted to minimize expected forecast errors at a site. In Phase II
it is proposed that the complete model be deve- loped, together with its
complementary set of algorithms to search for sets of model parameter values
that will minimize some measure of the difference between model-generated and
observed values. The result can then be tested with real data in a variety of
situa- tions. If successful, this phase of the work should lead to a weather
forecasting system that can be tailored to the needs of local users (utilities,
airports, agriculture, construction proj- ects, etc.) and implemented on a local
workstation-size computer.
