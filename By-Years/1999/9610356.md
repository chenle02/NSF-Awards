9610356 Weisman Cyclones and frontal systems associated with inverted troughs
have been found to be a frequent occurrence in the Central United States. A
6-year survey has shown 247 cases involving inverted troughs in the Central U.S.
between the lee of the Rockies and the Mississippi River. This relatively
frequent phenomenon is not accounted for in current polar front models. The goal
of this project is to build upon prior research by determining the dynamic
support for the precipitation distribution during inverted trough cases. The
preliminary survey of inverted trough cases has determined that there are two
primary precipitation distributions in cases involving an inverted trough: 1)
most of the precipitation falls downstream of the trough in the older, modified
polar air mass (Ahead cases) and 2) most of the precipitation falls upstream of
the trough in the fresh supply of arctic air (Behind cases). In the 6-year
survey of inverted troughs, 42% of the cases fell into the Ahead category, while
only 9% fell into the Behind category, but several of the Behind cases were
major blizzards. The remaining cases were a combination of the two categories.
This project will involve compositing the Ahead and Behind cases for comparison
of forcing mechanisms. Calculations of lifting mechanisms such as warm
advection, frontogenesis, and quasi-geostrophic forcing will be performed for
each composite in order to identify the relative importance of these processes
in the two categories and to enable comparisons between the two precipitation
signals. It is hoped that the results of this project will provide a conceptual
model for forecasters to use in real time to improve rain and snow forecasting
during inverted trough cases. ***
