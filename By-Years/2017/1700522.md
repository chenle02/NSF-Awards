The primary goal of this project is to develop a stackable certificate in
precision agriculture that will combine the technical and general education
courses need to educate workforce ready graduates. The State of Arkansas
currently has no programs to address these needs at the community college level,
and the skills and education needed are not something available to most high
school graduates. Because of the stackable nature of the certificate, portions
of the coursework will be applicable to the college's associate degree in
agriculture and this will allow some students to pursue a higher degree in
agriculture. The project is anticipated to attract a new pool of students who
previously would not attend college. This project will, at a minimum, allow
individuals to acquire skills in high demand within the agriculture industry and
potentially create an interest to pursue higher education. Additional goals are
to establish valuable relationships within the agriculture community and provide
professional development for faculty that will allow the agriculture program to
evolve with the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black River Technical College
will develop new academic programs that enable students to become precision
agriculture technicians, a vital industry to feed a growing world population.
Not only does precision agriculture allow for greater efficiencies in crop
production, it also contributes to more efficient resource utilization and
pollution reduction. Most agricultural production equipment now integrates
computer systems to control performance. Although equipment manufacturers have
embraced these innovations, educational programs have not concurrently
maintained pace to properly utilize new technologies. This project will address
the lack of skilled labor for the agriculture industry and will provide the
needed education to individuals desiring to enter the precision agriculture
workforce.
