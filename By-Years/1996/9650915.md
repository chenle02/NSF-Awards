This project involves the purchase of equipment to implement investigative
laboratories in Cell Biology, the first course for biology majors. The project
moves laboratory science teaching in the introductory course away from a highly
structured format toward investigation and exploration. Students, working in
pairs, develop technical and analytical competence through projects they have
planned in consultation with their instructors. Students are able to design
experiments, think critically about their work, read and understand primary
literature related to their work, and publicly present and discuss their work.
The Cell Biology laboratory experience can result in enthusiasm and expectation
for more challenging investigative work in upper-division courses employing
cellular and molecular approaches, including Microbiology, Developmental
Biology, and Molecular Biology. Comprehensive program evaluation will include
assessment of the work of students in upper-division courses and independent
projects, as well as compilation of information from graduates, employers, and
mentors concerning the effectiveness of the investigative approach with respect
to subsequent employment or education.
