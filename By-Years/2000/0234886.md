With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University will acquire a Superconducting Quantum Interface Device
(SQUID) magnetometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
studies on a) synthesis and characterization of molecule-based magnets; b)
magnetic targeting of drugs in vivo; c) development of ferromagnetic,
ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials; d) properties of alkyl-substituted
metallocenes and indacenes; and e) the synthesis of stable and persistent
organic radicals that are capable of chelating transition metals. &lt;br/&gt;A
SQUID magnetometer is critical for studying the magnetic properties of
materials, particularly for weakly magnetic/small moment samples. In a DC
magnetization measurement, one measures the magnetic moment as a function of
applied DC magnetic field (and/or temperature). Using DC magnetization
experiments, one can determine magnetic moments or a hysteresis curve, or
identify magnetic phase transitions. In such a fashion, complete magnetic
characterization of single crystal samples and films is possible. These types of
measurements are essential in order to understand polymers and thin
films.&lt;br/&gt;
