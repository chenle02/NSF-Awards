This is a project to develop a powerful yet intuitively comprehensible language
for the generation and processing of sounds. The goal is to provide flexible
control over the most comprehensive set of audiocomputational methods possible.
The language is to be efficiently embedded in a UNIX/C processing environment
for maximum portability to using laboratories. The personal computing
workstation and a burgeoning industry in musical audio synthesizers have already
had an impact on research in audio processing, psychoacoustics, human-computer
interaction, and audio cognition. Until now, however, the impact has been
limited by reliance on computationally simple models of sound production,
lacking both the diversity of our cultural aural experience and the methods of
control that would support its systematic investigation. If this project is
successful, every investigator will be able to explore the most subtle nuances
of sound and audition.
