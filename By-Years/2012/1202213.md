Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1202213, Principal Investigator: Daniel
C. Isaksen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will carry out computations in motivic
homotopy theory, i.e., the homotopy theory of algebraic varieties. The main
point of motivic homotopy theory is to import the powerful methods of homotopy
theory from topology to algebraic geometry. The PI would like to turn this
relationship around by using results from algebraic geometry to discover new
information about classical homotopy theory. For example, the PI has used
motivic homotopy theory over C to completely reconstruct the classical
2-complete Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in a large range. Similarly, motivic
computations over R have revealed new information about equivariant stable
homotopy theory. Specifically, the PI is interested in the motivic version of
the Adams spectral sequence, with base field R or C, where thorough computations
are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is a technique for studying
geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations. Homotopical approaches
often allow for concrete calculations that are otherwise inaccessible.
Computations of stable homotopy groups have been a major topic of research in
topology since the middle of the 20th century. Although tremendous progress has
been made, much remains unknown. In the 1990's, Fabien Morel and Vladimir
Voevodsky developed motivic homotopy theory. In analogy to classical homotopy
theory, motivic homotopy theory allows us to study algebraic objects up to
certain kinds of deformations. Their goal was to import the techniques of
homotopy theory into the realm of algebra. The PI's goal is the reverse: to use
algebraic results to obtain new information about classical homotopy theory.
