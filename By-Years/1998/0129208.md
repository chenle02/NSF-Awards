PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS IN
PLANT DIVERSITY THROUGH GEOLOGIC TIME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: Hallie J. Sims,
Patricia G. Gensel, and Scott L. Wing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants first appeared
on land roughly 410 million years ago. Since then, there clearly has been a
massive increase in the number of plant species, the spatial complexity of
terrestrial vegetation, and the range of habitats that plants occupy. The
taxonomic composition of terrestrial vegetation also has changed completely.
Although major trends and events affecting terrestrial plants have long been
identified in a descriptive way and quantitative data exist for many local sites
and short time intervals, there has been only one attempt to quantify the major
Phanerozoic trends in plant diversity and floral composition. Recent advances in
the statistical analysis of diversity data, increasing recognition of the
importance of spatial scale for interpreting diversity data, and growing
acceptance of bioinformatic databases as important tools for maximizing the
value of published data, make this the right time for a new quantification of
long-term trends in the ecology of terrestrial plants. We have formed a working
group of fifteen paleobotanists whose specialties span the temporal and
biological spectrum to collect high-quality data on Silurian to Paleogene fossil
plant localities, occurrences, and taxa as part of the Paleobiology Database
(http://flatpebble.nceas.ucsb.edu/public/). The result will be a public, web-
based repository for fossil occurrence data- a "GenBank" for the plant fossil
record. With these data, we will assess the effects of sampling biases on
changes in estimated global plant diversity, examine environmental correlates of
diversity change, and track changes in diversity at local, regional, and global
scales.&lt;br/&gt;
