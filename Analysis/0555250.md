ABSTRACT

The investigator proposes a program of research, education, and outreach on
problems in combinatorial ergodic theory. The setting is the study of the long
term behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or too chaotic to be
understood locally. Dynamical systems are used to model problems in natural and
social sciences and their study leads to an understanding of the evolution of
the modeled phenomena.

The proposed research builds on results obtained over the past few years in
multiple recurrence and convergence, The PI has proven the existence of certain
multiple ergodic averages and plans to study several related averages. Nilpotent
groups and the dynamical systems that can be defined on their homogeneous spaces
play a key role in understanding the mixing properties of dynamical systems.
This area of ergodic theory has strong relations to problems in additive
combinatorics and the PI will continue to explore these deep links.
