9455403 Shaffer The GeoSim Interface Library (GIL) provides a common set of
Graphical User Interface functions for programs running under the MS-
DOS,Macintosh and X Windows programming environments. Application program
software is written to access GIL. In this way, programs need only be written
once to run under these three programming environments. GIL handles most typical
GUI tasks, such as window display; backing store management for overlapping
windows; mouse interaction with buttons, drag regions, lists and sliders. GIL
supports help screens and alert boxes. GIL also includes additional support for
non-typical applications development features such as log files, data file
processing, and time-driven functions independent of user interface objects and
actions (used for discrete event simulations). Existing GUI development systems
do not provide the multi-platform capability necessary for our diverse student
population. Fortunately, GIL has proven to be easy to use by students and
researchers alike, and can easily be adapted to class use. This proposal seeks
to obtain the modest manpower resources necessary to make GIL a tool that can be
used by undergraduates in introductory programming courses. GIL provides a GUI
library for use in writing class programming assignments. Use of a GUI in
introductory programming classes allows students to begin early practice in
writing applications programs more like what they will do in their jobs.
Enhancements to the GIL system include a Graphical Interface Developer that
allows students to interactively place user interface elements on the screen,
better support for fonts and window backing store, and classroom ready
documentation and examples. GIL, including source code and documentation, will
be freely distributed via tabsInternet.
