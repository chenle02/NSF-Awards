9303913 Sylvester, Arthur G. This project is to resurvey a precise level line
across the Teton Fault, Wyoming, to characterize the interseismic activity of a
major normal fault, to compare the results of that survey with previous surveys
of the line in 1988, 1989, and 1991 to determine if aseismic displacement we
observed in the three previous surveys is still continuing. The significance of
the research is that it will show if aseismic vertical creep, previously unknown
on dip slip faults, at least in the United States, is occurring along one of the
master, active faults in western North America. If it is occurring, then that
conclusion would affect interpretations of paleoseismic slip inferred from
trench excavations across dip slip faults, especially along Basin and Range
faults.
