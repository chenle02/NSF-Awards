Research applying intelligent systems technology to problem in molecular biology
is expanding rapidly. Techniques such as artificial intelligence, neural
networks, object-oriented databases, large-scale computer modeling, and robotics
are being successfully applied to problems in genetics, protein structure,
development, evolution, and many other aspects of biology. The rapid growth in
this interdisciplinary research has created a need for infrastructure
development and program planning. The preposed meeting will bring together about
two-dozen active researchers in the field with representatives of NLM and NSF to
discuss issues such as coordination of conferences and publication venues,
distribution of research support, interdisciplinary training programs, and the
sharing of data and other resources. In addition to facilitating communication,
the goal of the meeting is to produce a report describing community needs and a
set of standing committees to help address those needs. Intelligent systems
technology is relevant to several key problems in the HPCC Program. Directly,
advanced software technology and algorithms require intelligent systems
technology; and indirectly high performance computing systems will be developed
based on novel intelligent software algorithms. This proposal addresses some of
the key issues in the problem domain of molecular biology, which have
implications in many other problem domains of the HPCC Program.
