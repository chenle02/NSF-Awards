The proposed research is directed towards finding classification algorithms that
are trained from examples and achieve good generalization performance. A new
training procedure is investigated that adjusts the complexity of the classifier
to the problem at hand in order to optimize the tradeoff between perfect
memorization and good generalization. The new algorithm applies to a large
variety of classification functions, including polynomial classifiers, two layer
neural networks, or radial basis functions. Initial experiments on optical
character recognition problems demonstrate both its performance relative to
other learning algorithms, and its efficiency regarding time and memory
requirements. Topics for investigation include the estimation of the VC
dimension of the resulting classifiers, and the study of the relationship
between VC dimension and generalization performance on a wide variety of
problems in order to obtain a robust algorithm that performs well even when no
expert knowledge in the training procedure to further improve performance will
be considered. the ability of the algorithm to find atypical, misclassified, or
meaningless, or misclassified patterns will be investigated to automatically
clean databases.
