Mathematical programming has had important applications to broad classes of
engineering design problems which can be modeled by means of equilibrium
equations in a continuum. The aim of this research is to develop a conceptual
connection between many diverse finite element methods which are numerical
methods used to attack problems in continuum physics. The technique proposed to
make this connection belongs to that field of mathematical programming called
semi-infinite programming. It is expected that making such a connection will
yield new computational methods for solving problems in a wide class of
engineering problems such as elasticity plasticity.
