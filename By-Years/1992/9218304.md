The goal of this research is to characterize a series of silver halide
chalcogenide compounds for the purpose of deducing transport mechanisms from the
patterns and trends observed. The effect of chemical substitution on ionic
motion also is examined. Several solid mixtures are prepared by mixing silver
halides and silver chalcogenides. Techniques such as x-ray diffraction,
calorimetry, and electrical conductivity are used to characterize the prepared
solid mixtures. Solid-state electrolytes are being investigated for their
potential use in high-power, light-weight batteries. Among the array of possible
electrolytic materials, those containing silver typically are found to be good
conductors, and thus they are of interest as potential battery electrolytes. In
this work, fast ion conductors are prepared from silver halides and silver
calcogenides. In a systematic survey, crystal structure, thermal properties, and
electrical properties of the cited class of ionic materials are determined to
access their suitability for eventual use in batteries.
