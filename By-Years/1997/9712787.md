9712787 Bardet This action is to support the establishment of an Internet World
Wide Web (WWW) site for the NSF project "Resolution of Site Response Issues from
the 1994 Northridge Earthquake (ROSRINE)". The ROSRINE project brings together a
strongly-coordinated group of geologists, geotechnical engineers and
seismologists from a number of organizations to address geotechnical site
characterization and ground response issues resulting from the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. This project is funded by the National Science Foundation, with
cost-sharing from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the Southern California Earthquake
Center (SCEC), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The project is performed
in cooperation with the California Department of Mines and Geology (CDMG). Two
critical elements of ROSRINE are (1) the data exchange between the research
teams, and (2) the data dissemination to a large number of researchers and
practicing engineers. This is now to be achieved through the creation of an
Internet WWW site in order to exchange and disseminate ROSRINE-generated data in
an efficient and timely manner.
