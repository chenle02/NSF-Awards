This is a proposal to replace a transmission electron microscope which is worn
out and limited in quality and state-of- the-art features. The new microscope
requested provides greater magnification and resolution and includes features to
protect samples from electron beam damage, enabling the acquisition of greater
informational content from observations of cells. A goniometer stage permits
structures obscured in normal orientation to be tilted and rotated until seen
clearly. Whole cell or organellar three-dimensional reconstruction from thin
sections is possible with the computer aided image analyzer. The instrumentation
package will be used to identify features of the cell surface, developmental
processes, organellar arrangements, and organellar functions valuable in
systematic and cell biological considerations of algae, aquatic fungi and higher
plants. Moreover, and ecological study focuses on translocation of heavy metals
in mycorrhizal associations between fungi and plant roots grown in sludge.
Procurement of a new, improved instrument will significantly improve the quality
and quantity of research from these research programs.
