The conference "Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications" will
take place in Newcastle NSW, Australia, on July 21-25, 2014. The meeting will
attract the world's leading researchers in geometric and asymptotic group
theory. This award is for support of some of the American participants, invited
speakers and graduate students. The technological and societal impact of the
proposed conference stems from potential wide applications to electronic
communication and information security. There are also applications to computer
science and complexity theory. The educational impact comes from the involvement
of students and young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Geometric
and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications" conferences are devoted to the
study of a variety of areas in geometric and combinatorial group theory,
including asymptotic and probabilistic methods, as well as algorithmic and
computational topics involving groups. In particular, areas of interest include
group actions, isoperimetric functions, growth, asymptotic invariants, random
walks, algebraic geometry over groups, algorithmic problems and their
complexity, generic properties and generic complexity, and applications to non-
commutative cryptography. The meeting is timed to precede the ICM in Korea in
August, with two satellite meetings held in Japan and Korea starting Jul 30 that
will be of interest to some participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information
