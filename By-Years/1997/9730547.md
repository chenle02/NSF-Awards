This collaborative research is concerned with understanding the impact of
redistricting on legislative elections. The standard wisdom holds that
redistricting has only a minimal effect on elections; producing tiny changes in
partisan gain or doing little to protect incumbents. While a great deal of
research has been undertaken on this problem, the researchers argue that
previous work has improperly modeled the effects. Using a formal model of
strategic redistricting, the PIs show that a variety of actors, ranging from
state legislators to state judges have important effects on how redistricting
lines are drawn. While this is well known, they also show the conditions under
when their strategic behavior will have an impact on partisan gains and
incumbent advantage. The researchers test crucial features of their model by
examining the array of redistricting changes that occurred in the 1960's. This
was a key period in American politics and has often been associated with the
rise of an incumbency advantage. The researchers find that redistricting is an
important strategic tool to change partisan advantage and to protect incumbents.
