As is evident from the effects of adding alcohol to aqueous solutions of nucleic
acids or globular proteins, structures of large molecules depend on solvation
forces. A changing solvation is also one of the factors that determines the free
energy changes associated with reactions occurring in water. If a correction
could be made for differences in free energy of solvation between reactants and
products one would be left with the free energy change for conversion of
reactants and products in the absence of solvent. This intrinsic equilibrium
constant would be interesting from a theoretical standpoint and useful in
considering changes in the positions of chemical equilibria that could occur if
reactants were removed from water into the vapor phase or into a nonpolar
environment. It is also clear that solvent water plays a role in the function of
biological receptor molecules, most spectacularly in the catalytic action of
enzymes. Dr. Wolfenden plans to complete a survey of the solvation by water of
functional groups that are common to many compounds occurring in intermediary
metabolic processes and to assess the role of solvent water in determining the
positions of equilibria of oxidation-reduction reactions. The results will be
used to analyze the influence of solvation on the structures of biopolymers, the
affinities of receptors for ligands and the positions of equilibrium of
metabolic processes.
