The goal of this project is the study of collisions between
relativistic&lt;br/&gt;nuclei and ultimately the determination of the properties
of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;matter over a wide range of temperatures and densities.
Extremely hot or&lt;br/&gt;dense objects which are made of nuclear matter exist
in the cosmos;&lt;br/&gt;however, without the possibility direct study of the
interiors of neutron &lt;br/&gt;stars, or of the first moments of a supernova,
or of the earliest moments &lt;br/&gt;of the Big Bang, one resorts to the
challenging studies of finite and &lt;br/&gt;transient systems as provided by
nucleus-nucleus collisions. It&lt;br/&gt;has become clear that in order to
understand the nuclear equation of state&lt;br/&gt;or to identify a transistion
to a new state of matter, the quark-gluon&lt;br/&gt;plasma, it will require a
comprehensive and correlated set of measurements&lt;br/&gt;as well as extensive
calculations which relate the observables to the&lt;br/&gt;nuclear matter
variables. This project focuses on the acquisition and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of
such a set of data using the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC
(STAR)&lt;br/&gt;experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
located at&lt;br/&gt;Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and using the
Compact Muon &lt;br/&gt;Solenoid (CMS) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
located at the European &lt;br/&gt;Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva,
Switzerland. The &lt;br/&gt;collection of detector systems which make up both
the STAR and &lt;br/&gt;CMS experiment provide detailed information about
individual&lt;br/&gt;collision events. The UCD group will use data from these
detectors to&lt;br/&gt;reconstruct the events and infer, from the recorded
debris, both the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and the thermodynamics of the collision. By
scanning from &lt;br/&gt;injection energy at RHIC to the full energy for ions at
the LHC, the &lt;br/&gt;energy range from twenty to six thousand times the rest
mass will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
