Most data of ecological and evolutionary interest are located in geographic
space. This spatial context of data such as patterns of birds' nests, genetic
variation patterns, or tree distributions leads to interesting problems in
ecological and evolutionary theory, and, at the same time, requires allowance
for these spatial patterns in statistical analyses that involve such data. The
latter have largely been ignored to date, and Dr. Sokal's work will contribute
to a recognition of their importance among ecologists and evolutionists. Dr.
Sokal will examine, by a variety of analytical (mathematical) and computer
simulation approaches, the validity of a number of tests that have become
popular in recent years. The results of this research should greatly facilitate
inferences from patterns to processes in a wide variety of problems in
population biology. These procedures have considerable practical application
since virtually all environmental problems have a spatial dimension. Thus, tests
of the effects of pollutants, such as acid rain, need to take the spatial
relationships of the data into consideration before evaluation of those results.
This is an approach that has so far rarely been followed in either environmental
or epidemiological work.
