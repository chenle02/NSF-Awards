The University of South Alabama will purchase an automated X-ray diffractometer
which will be used to improve instruction in the analytical methods course for
geology, biology, and chemistry students. In addition to being used to train
students in the methods of solid state organic and inorganic phase analysis, the
equipment will be used by advanced undergraduate students to carry out research
projects in environmental science. The University of South Alabama will match
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds plus $1,000.
