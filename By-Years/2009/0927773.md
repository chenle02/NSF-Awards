The compositions of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and related volcanic rocks
are one of the primary observational datasets used to illuminate melting
processes that ultimately lead to formation of ocean crust and processes like
global geochemical cycling and plate tectonics. Most MORB, however, is modified
by processes that occur in the upper mantle and oceanic crust. To constrain the
processes that modify the composition of MORB during its residence and transit
from the mantle through the oceanic crust, this research will carry out a
geochemical and textural study of plagioclase-rich MORB from ultra-slow and
intermediate spreading-rate mid ocean ridges. The focus of the work will be on
plagioclase from plagioclase-ultraphyric basalts. This mineral is a potentially
rich and largely unexploited recorder of magma temperature, composition, mass
balance and time. Analytical work will include a combination of in situ
analytical chemical and isotopic analysis techniques, analyses of major and
trace element compositions of the lavas, textural studies, determination of
trace element diffusion profiles, crystal size distributions, and other
approaches. Broader impacts of the work are support of a student and an early
career faculty member.
