9360469 Becker There is an urgent, growing need for Tactual (Paperless Braille)
Display Units (TDSUs) that serve the blind the way Visual Display Units (VDUs)
serve sighted computer users. But today's "dot" technology is complex,
expensive, limited to single display lines and inherently unable to furnish the
MULTILINE, realtime, "monitor screens" needed to provide the blind access
equality with the sighted. TACTILICS new and different dot technology can
provide multiline monitors of any practical size that can simultaneously
communicate with the sighted. Screens of individually addressable "cells" will
make editing fast and easy. Dramatically reduced costs, will allow TACTILICS
realtime, multiline, braille monitors to be made and sold at prices far below
today's prohibitive (singleline) levels. The research performed by this project
will lead to cost effective, one on one teaching systems that provide the blind
with direct access to data bases, bulletin boards, CD ROMs and other low cost
sources of information. The elimination of Braille/sightprint "barriers" will
open many doors. Being able to work directly with the sighted will create new
employment opportunities. Consequently, the tasks of learning, growing, and
gaining independence will be made easier. ***
