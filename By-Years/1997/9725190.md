9725190 Pati(o Douce The research to be performed consists of determination of
the melting relations, melt fractions, and melt and restite compositions of
crustal rocks at conditions characteristic of ultra-high pressure metamorphism.
The bulk of the experimental work will be conducted at pressures of 30 and 40
kbar which is the most relevant pressure range for UHPM. A few experiments at 20
kbar will also be performed, with the objective of tying the 30 and 40 kbar
results to lower pressure ((15 kbar) experiments on the same starting materials
already completed by the PI in previous projects. The starting materials to be
investigated are the felsic metapelite from the Himalayas and the calc-alkaline
tonalite from the Sierra Nevada. These two starting materials are suitable
models for the most abundant sedimentary and igneous rocks in continental crust,
respectively. Experiments will be performed both without added H2O (dehydration
melting) and with small amounts of added H2O.
