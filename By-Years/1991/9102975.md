In this project the principal investigator is proposing a new numerical method
for the study of the behavior of solids suspended in a viscous fluid. The method
combines finite difference approximations to solve the field equations with
Lagrangian fluid markers to track the positions of the solid particles in the
fluid. The suspended material is replaced with an appropriate force-density term
in the equations of fluid motion. This method is capable of handling a large
number of particles since there is no need to specify boundary conditions on the
surface of each particle and since one set of equations obtains in the whole
flow field. The behavior of particles suspended in a viscous fluid is an
interesting physical phenomenon that has wide-ranging biological and
technological importance. In this project the principal investigator will apply
a novel numerical method in order to solve approximately the coupled fluid-solid
equations that describe the motion of solid particles suspended in a fluid under
realistic general conditions. The need for accurate simulations of such
suspension flows arises in areas as diverse as medicine (blood flow), civil
engineering (control of sedimentation in rivers) and design manufacturing
(ceramics and composite materials).
