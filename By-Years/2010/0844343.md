&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support the CAREER
research and education program of Prof. E. Charles H. Sykes from the Department
of Chemistry at Tufts University. Prof. Sykes and his students will exploit the
unique properties of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) to
investigate molecular rotors and motors. The simplicity and tunability of their
chosen thioether skeleton will allow for the systematic measurement and eventual
control of key factors that currently prevent molecular machines from doing
useful work: thermal fluctuations, lack of molecular ordering, dipolar coupling
and nanoscale friction. Prof. Sykes will introduce several scanning probe
experiments into the undergraduate laboratory that focus on key concepts of
nanoscience. He will also host high school teachers at Tufts during the summer
to develop live demonstrations for high school students. At the broadest level,
short movies about Prof. Sykes research will be broadcast on YouTube TM to
increase public awareness of his cutting edge research in the area of molecular
machines. &lt;br/&gt;
