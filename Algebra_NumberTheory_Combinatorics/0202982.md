The investigator will continue his study of L-functions. Specifically the
problem of a 'subconvex' estimate for general automorphic L-functions. These
have wide applications to classical problems in number theory (e.g. Hilbert's
11-th problem on representing integers in a number field by a quadratic form)
and to eigenfunctions on arithmetic surfaces. The use of the families of
L-functions and symmetries associated with them is crucial.

This project is concerned with the study of mathematical objects called zeta
functions. They encode deep information about the arithmetic and geometry which
lie at their definition. Understanding the functions has far reaching
applications to the theory of whole numbers (and prime numbers) and more
surprisingly to some foundational problems in quantum theory.
