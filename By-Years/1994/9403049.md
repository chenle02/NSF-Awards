9403049 Loehman The compositions and structure of polynary oxide glasses free of
classical network formers and containing high-atomic-number cations will be
investigated and related to selected properties, including efficiency of dopants
for optical upconversion or amplification, nonlinear refractive index, and
suitability for fiber formation. This proposal aims to explore in greater depth
the existence, preparation, structure, and selected optical properties of oxide
glasses free of the classical network formers boron oxide, silica, germania,
phosphorus and arsenic oxides. The two primary motivations for this work are: 1)
to increase our basic understanding of glass formation and structure, and 2) to
generate optical data for new glass forming systems. Based on the
characteristics of the component oxides, the physical and chemical properties of
the new glasses are expected to be suitable for practical applications. Glasses
made from these oxides are of interest as hosts for optically active dopants
because currently available glasses have either good mechanical and chemical
properties or desirable optical properties, but not both. %%% The compositions
