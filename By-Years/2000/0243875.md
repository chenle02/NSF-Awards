Proposal ID: AST-0243875&lt;br/&gt;Institution: AURA/NOAO/KPNO&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Mould, Jeremy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Optical Astronomy Observatory
(NOAO) will continue its existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site at the offices of Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in Tucson, Arizona.
Each year six students will be hired as full-time research assistants to work
with KPNO astronomers on selected research projects for a period of twelve weeks
over the summer. As part of their research activities, REU students will gain
first-hand experience with KPNO's state-of-the art telescopes and
instrumentation, and develop expertise in the tools of data analysis specific to
astronomical research. In addition to the research project, the REU program at
KPNO features weekly scientific lectures and colloquia by NOAO and visiting
astronomers, informal lunches and group discussions, field trips to other
telescope facilities in the Southwest, and a variety of recreational and social
activities. All REU students will be encouraged to attend the American
Astronomical Society winter meeting following their program to present a paper.
Students will be recruited nationally, with special emphasis placed on
recruiting qualified applicants from minorities underrepresented in science and
engineering, including women, as well as students from institutions lacking
access to research facilities or opportunities for paid research employment for
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
