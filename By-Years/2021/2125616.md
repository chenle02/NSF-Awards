Food insecurity surged in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and
still exists. A major challenge to addressing food insecurity has been a lack of
timely, integrated, and accessible information about fluctuations in the food
system and the risks these pose to food security. This project brings together
scientists, local government, and community and private partners to co-develop a
new approach to monitor and understand food systems, food access, and food
security in the most populous county in the United States: Los Angeles County,
California. Community perspectives are combined with novel data sources and
analytics to build a comprehensive data portal that connects stakeholders in the
county with rich information about the food system, and flags the issues most in
need of intervention. This approach will ultimately help communities across the
country to develop smart, connected, and resilient food systems that support
food security for all.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this project
are to: (i) develop a conceptual model of food insecurity within the Los Angeles
County food system; (ii) use this model to identify and analyze novel data
sources that represent important features of the local food system, and generate
new insights about this system, especially during a crisis event that interrupts
the expected flow of food to people; and (iii) build a data portal to share this
information and insights in a timely way with stakeholders who have an interest
in food security and food justice. The results will advance our understanding of
robust and fragile aspects of food systems during a crisis. This new paradigm of
monitoring the complex and dynamic nature of community food systems is a
prototype that can be adopted across cities and counties in the U.S. to optimize
food system resilience, and better support food security and equity in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
