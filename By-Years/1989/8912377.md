The chronology and sequence of climatic changes during the deglaciation must be
well constrained in order to understand the climatic system at that time. In
order to achieve this goal it is necessary to acquire high precision AMS dates
in both marine and continental sediments and to understand the distribution of
14C in the ocean. This project requests support to determine the apparent 14C
age of surface waters in the North Atlantic during the Younger Dryas event of
the last deglaciation. The PI will measure the radiocarbon ages of organic
carbon and marine carbonate deposited coevally with Ash Layer 1 in North
Atlantic deep sea sediments. By comparing their ages with Ash Layer 1, the PI
will determine the apparent age of the surface water, which will provide
important constraints on the circulation of the ocean during the deglaciation
and constraints on the exchange of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere.
