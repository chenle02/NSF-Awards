Lee 9610229 This grant provides funding for the development of algorithms to
solve a new class of scheduling problems. In contrast to classical scheduling
problems with a one-machine-one-job pattern where machines are available at all
times, this new class of problems contains jobs with one-job-on-multiple-machine
or multiple-job-on-one-machine patterns in addition to machine availability
constraints. Optimal algorithms based on a large-scale integer programming
formulation will be developed. A six node Silicon Graphics Power Challenge
Deskside server, purchased in large part with a grant from the National Science
Foundation, will be used as the computational platform to address these
problems. Dynamic programming based methods that can efficiently solve certain
classes of restricted problems will also be developed. Local search techniques,
especially tabu search and genetic algorithms, will be developed and tested for
effectiveness and efficiency. Empirical work and theoretical error bound
analysis for the approximation methods will also be conducted. The primary goal
of this work is to extend the current scheduling theories to include new models
that are motivated by industrial problems and have greater potential for
application. If successful, the results of this research will broaden the field
of machine scheduling and elicit deeper insights into the structure of many more
realistic scheduling problems. The research will lead to new computational
developments in optimization methods for solving complex scheduling problems.
Academically, it will not only contribute new and interesting results in the
scheduling field but also contribute to the computational tools and
methodologies for integer programming problems. Practical applications of the
proposed work will lead to effective methods in solving real-life scheduling
problems in the manufacturing and service industries, and will eventually enable
managers to achieve the goal of cost saving, lead-time reduction, quality
improve ment and customer satisfaction.
