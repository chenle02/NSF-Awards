The following project is an effort to re-conceptualize what it means to study
computer science at the undergraduate level. Based on years of research and
curriculum development, the project team at the Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT) is collectively building on prior work to design a sequence of
computer science courses that integrate the use of a network of robots to
facilitate student learning. In this project, the co-robot teams share space and
tasks with humans and are used as a teaching platform in an introductory
context, and as a laboratory platform for projects in intermediate and upper-
level courses in which students can develop and even invent new services. This
approach enhances a traditional approach to teaching computer science and
provides ample opportunities for students to design, test, and evaluate using
co-robot systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on three main goals:
(1) Develop a co-robot platform that can be used by undergraduates of all levels
within the existing curriculum and is adoptable by other universities; (2)
Improve student engagement and learning of core CS concepts through modules that
use the co-robot platform; and (3) Develop undergraduate students with a
thorough understanding of co-robot systems and their potential applications. The
project team is developing modules aimed at an introductory sequence, data
management, and networking. Coupled with module development, there is heavy
emphasis on building suitable hardware that will serve the needs of students,
giving them the flexibility to develop new applications (code) to operate and
manipulate the co-robotics systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project measures
the impact of the new approach on student outcomes through both qualitative and
quantitative measures, with the intent of disseminating the model and technology
beyond the context of RIT. As such, the project will enhance the knowledge base
about the effective use of co-robotics systems in traditional undergraduate
computer science courses.
