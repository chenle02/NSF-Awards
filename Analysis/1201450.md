We plan to extend Thurston's model of the Mandelbrot set onto polynomials of
higher degrees (e.g., describe a model of the boundary of the cubic
connectedness locus) and generalize onto higher degrees Thurston's results about
unlinked quadratic minors. We want to extend the one-dimensional
spectraldecomposition for topological polynomials. In addition, we study
expanding polymodials, including c-tent plane maps (which combine properties of
tent maps with properties of complex quadratic maps and should play the same
role for quadratic complex maps as tent maps play on the interval) and seek to
replace holomorphic tools by tools based upon the expansiveness of maps.
Finally, we plan to describe all points such that small perturbations around
them change the dynamics of the interval map (this is a pointwise version of
stability) and to further develop rotation theory for interval maps, complex
quadratic maps, and billiards.

The results on laminations may have a strong impact on other areas as they
should lead to a model of a higher dimensional self-similar set analogous to the
Mandelbrot set; moreover, this set appears in a natural fashion. The analog of
spectral decomposition for topological polynomials may provide examples of limit
behavior for complicated non-invertible systems from applications (e.g., from
population dynamics). Structural results on expanding polymodials would give
another class of maps for which analogs of well-known complex dynamical results
hold. Finally, topics in one-dimensional dynamics should yield a better
understanding of stability of one-dimensional maps and the way different types
of limit behavior of a one-dimensional map coexist. The project can have an
educational impact as well as impact upon human resources development as some of
the topics (such as new results/tools on cubic laminations, on spectral
decomposition for topological polynomials and on dynamics of expanding
polymodials) could serve as the basis of new courses for graduate students and
could be developed by students in their dissertations (in fact, a local seminar
is devoted to laminations).
