Through this project, the Computer Technology Department is establishing a
Novell network system, which is currently the industry standard. The newtwork
resembles a real-world local area network, consisting of 18 IBM PCs and 3 Power
MAC workstations, as well as several printers. The laboratory supports four core
courses in a new 1-year certificate program: Introduction to Networks, Network
Administration, Advanced Network Administration, and Fundamentals of Internet
Work. The college also offers a 62-credit associate degree program in Computer
Networks. Eligible students include: currently employed computer operators
requiring training for career advancement, high school graduates, and clients
under the Job Training Partnership Act. Information about the project and its
outcomes will be widely shared through the American Association of Community
Colleges, the New England Board of Higher Education, Internet, and a summer Tech
Prep institute for high school teachers.
