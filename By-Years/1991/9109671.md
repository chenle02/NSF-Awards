This project continues research on nonlinear regularities that emerge from
apparently chaotic daily and weekly movements in financial asset prices. The
research focuses on intriguing regularities in the behavior of stock market
indices and foreign exchange markets discovered earlier by the investigator. The
results of the research should improve our understanding of the way institutions
for processing information affect the stability of financial markets. It should
also provide better statistical techniques based on chaos theory for studying
nonlinear relationships in economic time series. The project addresses the
connections between correlations and volatility in stock returns series at the
daily and weekly frequencies. These correlation patterns are shown to change
with changing market volatility levels. Correlations are larger at smaller
volatility levels. The robustness of the results is determined by analyzing data
for individual firms. Some possible causes for the results are explored.
Transactions costs and costs of acquiring new information may cause prices to be
less informative during quieter periods. If these costs are unrelated to the
level of volatility then periods of low volatility may appear less "efficient"
in the sense of positive correlations. New information may take several days to
get impounded into prices. These correlations may also be the result of market
maker interventions. In their attempts at maintaining price continuity market
makers actions could show up as positive correlations. During volatile periods
information and prices are changing so fast that the actions of the market maker
are not observed over the daily horizon. A closely related issue is how quickly
limit orders are being eliminated and if these also carry across the daily
boundaries.
