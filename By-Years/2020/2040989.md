Explaining machine learning (ML) models have received increasing interest
because of their adoption in societally-critical tasks, ranging from health
care, to hiring, to criminal justice. It is crucial for the relevant parties,
such as decision makers and decision subjects, to understand why a model makes a
particular prediction. This proposal argues that explanations represent a
communication process. In order to improve the effectiveness of explanations,
explanations should be adaptive and interactive based on the subject being
explained (subgroups of interest) as well as the target audience (user
profiles), whose knowledge and preferences may be evolving. Therefore, this
proposal aims to develop adaptive and interactive explanations of machine
learning models, which will allow people to better understand the decisions
being made for and about them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has three key
areas of focus. First, this proposal will develop a novel formal framework for
generating adaptive explanations which can be customized to account for
subgroups of interest and user profiles. Second, this proposal will facilitate
the explanations as an interactive communication process by dynamically
incorporating user inputs. Finally, this proposal will improve existing
automatic evaluation metrics such as sufficiency and comprehensiveness, and
develop novel ones, especially for the understudied global explanations. The
team will embed these computational approaches in real-world
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
