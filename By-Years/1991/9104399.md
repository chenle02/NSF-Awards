This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Genetic analysis of the developmental responses of
Arabidopsis thaliana to mechanical stress" is to be carried out in the
laboratory of Dr. Ronald W. Davis, Stanford University. This represents a
significant change in the field for this Fellow who studied the molecular
genetics of Yeast. During the tenure of this fellowship, her research will focus
on the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals in
Arabidopsis. The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to
increase the number of outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
