In a career advancement award Dr. Fautin will learn modern methods of molecular
phylogenetics, including restriction endonuclease analyses of mitochondrial DNA
and nucleotide sequencing in the laboratory of Dr. Deborah Smith at the
University of Kansas. The focus of the work is on the phylogeny and taxonomy of
selected sea anemones, including those that are symbiotic with clownfishes and
some that harbor algae internally. Mitochondrial DNA mutations among the several
species of sea anemones will be compared and used for the reconstruction of
phylogenetic relationships among these marine animals. Molecular data will be
integrated with traditional morphological characters used to distinguish species
and genera of anemones. One long term goal is to compare the pattern of species
divergences in sea anemones with that for their symbiotic fish associates, on
the one hand, and with the associated symbiotic algae on the other, in order to
explore mechanisms of coevolutionary change. %%% Symbioses are biologically
challenging phenomena, including those between sea anemones and their internal
(algae) and external associates (clownfishes or anemonefishes). Dr. Fautin in a
career advancement award is adding new molecular data (DNA mutations) to
traditional morphological knowledge of sea anemones in order to improve the
taxonomy of these marine organisms and to explore patterns of phylogenetic
relationship among the several genera worldwide. A robust phylogeny for the sea
anemones will then permit study of the pattern of coevolutionary divergence
among the algae and fishes associated with these fascinating creatures.
