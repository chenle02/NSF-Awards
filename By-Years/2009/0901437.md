&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this collaborative research project is to address
the key quality of service (QoS) issues related to wireless body sensor networks
(BSNs) to make them practical and efficacious for continuous, non-invasive
monitoring of individuals in a variety of healthcare applications. The approach
is to develop new system modeling and analysis techniques for design-time
optimization and run-time management of application fidelity, network latency
and throughput, and energy. The key feature of this project is the multi-scale
approach to QoS, enabling designers to explore how techniques at each system
level impact the other levels. This work will be validated and improved upon
based on experimentation with physical BSN systems deployed in real BSN
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this
research address the problem of achieving high levels of QoS under severe
resource constraints, in complex environments, and with varying application
semantics and contexts. While a layered approach to QoS management is
appropriate for resource-heavy systems, BSNs require an integrated, multi-scale
approach capable of finding operating points across system levels to maximize
QoS metrics based on application-specific requirements and dynamic operating
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the QoS issues
addressed in this research are central to the ultimate acceptance of BSNs in the
healthcare applications for which they have such promise. This project includes
interactions with doctors and nurses to ensure that BSNs are addressing the
requirements of real applications, including deployment in home healthcare and
assisted living settings. The project also seeks to get young students excited
about engineering through hands-on demonstrations and clear links to compelling
applications.
