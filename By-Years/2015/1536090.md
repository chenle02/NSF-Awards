GENI, the Global Environment for Network Innovations, is a suite of research
infrastructure that spans facilities across the United States. GENI aims to
transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well
as emerging research into very large social-technical systems, by providing a
suite of infrastructure for "at scale" experiments in future internets.
Nationwide experiments began in Summer 2010. In the intervening five years, GENI
has shown rapid growth in adoption by experimental researchers and is now
expanding to over 50 GENI-enabled campuses. In addition, via programs such as
Campus CyberInfrastructure and US Ignite, GENI technologies are being actively
used to advance national science capabilities and to imagine and design next
generation applications that address national priorities. Via commercialization
of technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function
Virtualization GENI has had a significant economic impact.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the transition of GENI from a building phase
overseen by the GENI Program Office (GPO) to an operational status managed by
community organizations. As part of the project, the GPO will broadly engage the
U.S. computer systems research community to develop a community consensus-based
plan for transition. In conjunction with NSF the organizational structure
identified by this plan will be established and GENI operations transferred with
the project supporting operational expenses during the transition period.
