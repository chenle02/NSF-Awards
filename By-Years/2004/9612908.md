9612908 Porod The Fifth International Workshop on Computational Electronics
(IWCE-5) will be held at the University of Notre Dame on May 28- 30, 1997. As in
previous meetings, the workshop will cover all aspects of advanced simulation of
electronic transport in semiconductors and semiconductor devices,particularly
those which use large computational resources . IWCE-5 will focus on the
following three themes: (i) The need of large scale simulation in
optoelectronics, (ii) Monte Carlo simulations, and (iii) Nanostructure
simulation including atomistic processes in conventional devices (such as
degradation effects). Specific workshop agenda and a preliminary list of invited
speakers will be discussed at a planning meeting to be held at the Beckman
Institute. ***
