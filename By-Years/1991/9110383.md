Biological diversity within and among species can contain genetic, physical,
behavioral, and cultural variation. Most organisms show geographic variation of
these kinds, and tolerate a diverse array of ecological conditions. While
biological diversity is of interest to a broad group of people, few actually
study the geographic patterns of that variation or the processes which give rise
to it or maintain it. The deserts of western North America hold an enormous
amount of biological diversity, as measured by the number of species. The 24
species of kangaroo rats are one clear example of this diversity. These seed-
eating kangaroo-shaped rodents are divisible into over 110 geographically
distinct forms. This is based simply on their appearance. Variation in genetic
material, behavior, ecology, and life history will be studied using cytological
and molecular techniques. A understanding of that variation and studies of the
processes which produce and maintain that variation will enable us to understand
some of the biological diversity which comprises our natural heritage.
