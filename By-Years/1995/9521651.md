Research program and involves the collection of perishable data following the
January 17, 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan. In collaboration with the Disaster

examine interorganizational coordination of emergency response and focus on
response activities including search and rescue, fire suppression and the
interaction of fire services with water and gas utilities, traffic control,
damage assessment, utility restoration, sheltering and mass care, and emergency
medical assistance. Data will be obtained through interviews, documents and
