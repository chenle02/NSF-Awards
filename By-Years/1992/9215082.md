In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the
Division of Chemistry the nature of nonadditivity of energies in a variety of
systems is being explored by quantum mechanical methods. Both the supermolecule
method and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory are being employed. A wide
variety of types of systems are being studied, including nonpolar systems, polar
systems, and mixed polar-nonpolar systems (such as rare gas - water aggregates).
Analytic potentials are being obtained which explicitly include multibody
effects and which are thus suitable for simulations of the behavior of both
condensed phases and clusters. %%% The energies of very large molecules and
solids are often assumed to be approximated well by the sum of the energies of
the smaller molecules, or even the atoms, making up the system. In this project
theoretical methods are being used to assess the accuracy of such assumptions
and to develop more accurate energies of large systems.
