This award funds a twelve-month effort to hold workshops to engage cell
biologists in activities to assess needs for the development of a community of
advanced computing users. It is anticipated that this activity will help to link
basic cell biology researchers to cyberinfrastructure resources. The Principal
Investigator will collaborate with the Minority Affairs Committee of the
American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) to identify hosts for a series of
workshops in order to maximize the opportunity to reach smaller academic
departments and institutions in addition to reaching researchers from population
groups underrepresented in the field of computational cell biology.
