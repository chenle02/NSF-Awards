The proposal intends to study the Hubbard model of itinerant magnetism in order
to ascertain the effect of electron correlation on the energy bandwidths of
simple metals. A very strong coupling model will also be investigated to explain
the large energy gaps observed in high Tc superconductors. A theory of the
piezoelectric constants will be investigated for ionic solids. The localized
states of the minority charge carriers in semiconductors will also be studied.
The investigtor also plans to continue his investigations of quantum wells.
Further, work will be done on the Kapitza thermal boundary resistance in
insulators and phonon drag in simple metals.
