Histerid beetles are conspicuous members of the arthropod microfauna. As
predators of numerous insect pests, especially flies and bark beetles, they have
forensic and economic significance. Some are specialist predators of social
insects, and have evolved remarkable ecological integrating mechanisms. Despite
their ecological and economic importance, our knowledge of their diversity is
poor. This project will clarify the taxonomy of approximately 400 Neotropical
species in the Exosternini, resolving their evolutionary relationships using DNA
and anatomical characteristics, describing hundreds of new species, providing
illustrated identification guides, and developing species pages for the
Encyclopedia of Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will strengthen
international scientific collaborations. Our fieldwork will be done in
collaboration with Latin American research institutes, who will serve as
specimen repositories, provide local expertise and support, and benefit through
project workshops. This research will open up an important component of beetle
biodiversity to further study, provide greater understanding of the evolution of
the most diverse group of animals on the planet, and will help develop human
resources in biodiversity science.&lt;br/&gt;
