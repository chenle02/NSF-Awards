A necessary part of language understanding by people or computersis to determine
the meaning of ambiguous words. Efforts at automatic disambiguation of text have
so far been evaluated by ad hoc, manual checking of their results. As more
disambiguation systems are developed and put to use, a rigorous method of
evaluation becomes necessary. This work will study text disambiguation by human
informants, to aid in developing both a formal model of the process and a metric
or correctness for automatic disambiguation. The study will include the
selection of representative texts and development from these of a disambiguation
test to be administered to a large sample (over 100) of informants, from
university students to professional lexicographers. Analysis of the test results
will provide insight into the human disambiguation process that will contribute
to the evaluation and refinement of current models of disambiguation, both human
and computation, and eventually to thedevelopment of new models. The test
results themselves will form a statistical profile of the disambiguation of
English text, as a benchmark for efforts at automatic disambiguation.
