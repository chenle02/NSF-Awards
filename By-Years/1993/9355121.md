9355121 Goff Many highly specialized parasites such as ant parasites, fungi that
parasitize other fungi, and red algal parasites may have evolved from their
hosts. Dr. Lynda Goff of University of California at Santa Cruz is testing this
hypothesis in a group of red algae (Rhodophyta). Because of the extreme
morphological reduction that occurs frequently in parasites, key morphological
features required for detailed evolutionary analyses are often missing in
parasites. In such cases, molecular data from DNA sequences promise abundant,
comparative evidence for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships and thus
inferring evolutionary origins. Red algae in various groups of the orders
Gigartinales and Ceramiales are being studied, to test whether host-parasite
pairs are also phylogenetic sister-groups, with major evidence expected from
nuclear ribosomal DNA. The research will provide a direct test of what has been
called Emery's Rule in biology, the hypothesized evolution of parasitic forms
from their host species. In addition, the new molecular data when integrated
with traditional morphological characters will help improve the taxonomy of
several groups of marine red algae.
