This award is in support of the 2017 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research
Forum (TCORF) at the 71st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) to be
held on March 14 -16, 2017 at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Science, in Miami, FL. The TCORF/IHC brings together representatives from
Federal agencies and the academic research community to discuss the latest
research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as: 2016
hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they
offer, research priorities of the operational centers, observations and
observing strategies, tropical cyclone model development, transitioning research
to operations, and advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products
and services.

This conference is important to the Nation because it brings the academic
research community, together with Federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming
hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and
warning program.
