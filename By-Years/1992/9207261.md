This is a three year cooperative project proposed by Dr. Fa Wu, Northeastern
University, and Professors Lin Keh-Ying, National Tsing Hua University and Hu
Chin-Kun, Academia Sinica. This study plans to develop models of critical point
phenomena and phase transitions in condensed matter physics. Results of this
research can improve our understanding of the critical point phenomena such as
freezing and magnetization occurring in materials research. This project is
jointly supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program, NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.
