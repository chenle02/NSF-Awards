This project expands the capacity of SBU and UH to produce high-quality
professionals in information assurance and computer security that can make a
definitive contribution towards the problem of protecting our nation's critical
information infrastructure. SBU has put together one of the nation's strongest
research programs in Information Assurance. SBU has been designated by the
National Security Agency (NSA) as a Center of Academic Excellence in IA
Education (CAE/IAE). Its IA education and research activities are coordinated by
the Center for Cybersecurity. SBU currently offers several graduate level
courses in IA, and offers information assurance concentrations at the Master's
and Ph.D. levels. Moreover, these programs have been certified to meet the
National Training Standard 4011 for Information Systems Security Professionals
set by the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS). This project expands
the reach of the IA curriculum to the undergraduate level, and serves to train
faculty from other institutions to develop similar educational programs in IA.
Specifically, the objectives of the SBU component of this collaborative proposal
are: (1) curriculum and educational material development, (2) faculty
development at UH and other institutions, and (3) laboratory development. At UH
capacity building occurs on several fronts: (1) building an outstanding
concentration in computer security and information assurance by adapting and
implementing the exemplary education materials, curricula, and courses in
security and assurance already developed at SBU, (2) development of a computing
environment similar to the one proposed to be built at SBU for teaching and
research in computer security and information assurance, (3) development of new
courses and course modules for computer security and information assurance
courses, and dissemination through the World Wide Web, and (4) faculty
development at regional institutions in the second year of the program.
