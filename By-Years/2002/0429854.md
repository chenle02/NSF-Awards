Collaborative Coherence: Streamlining Shared Memory
Performance&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research investigates collaborative coherence, a novel approach for
building high-performance shared-memory multiprocessors. In this approach local
cache memories collaborate to minimize the occurrence and detrimental
performance effects of costly off-chip communication due to permission and data
requests. Several problematic behaviors in conventional multiprocessors can be
avoided or mitigated by exploiting global knowledge about sharing and reference
patterns. This research will result in a deeper understanding of the
interactions between processors in shared-memory multiprocessors, and will lead
to system designs that have dramatically higher performance and lower power
consumption, but are simple, intuitive, and easy to
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have a broad impact on the
computer architecture community as a whole, by its development of representative
commercial workloads, realization of state-of-the-art simulation infrastructure,
and invention of powerful and useful evaluation methodologies. The techniques
and methods created will be applied towards the development of increasingly
powerful and ubiquitous computing devices whose utility will have a substantial
impact on the productivity and creativity of countless end
users.&lt;br/&gt;2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
