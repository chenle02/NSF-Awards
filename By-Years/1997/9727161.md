Shaffer 9727161 This research program uses the analysis of DNA sequence
variation to quantify levels of population differentiation in freshwater and
terrestrial turtles from three continental regions: the central United States,
the western and northern Amazon basin, and eastern Australia. In each of these
regions, there have been severe climate changes during the past 15,000 years,
and these changes have had impacts on the past and current distribution of all
plants and animals, including turtles. For example, about 17,000 years ago most
of North Dakota and Minnesota were under glacial ice, whereas today they are
fully inhabited by species that have migrated north from warmer areas. DNA
sequence data from at least two genes will be used to quantify the extent of
these post-glacial migration patterns, focussing on turtles because they have
very long generation times, and should show the maximal impacts of these past
events in their current populations. More generally, these data will provide
information on how one can use molecular genetic data from long-lived species to
understand levels of migration, population fluctuations, and population
stability. Such data are frequently utilized in disciplines ranging from
conservation and managment to basic ecology and evolution, and they hinge on the
assumption that past climatic fluctuations have has a negligable impact on
current populations. These data will inform us on whether such assumptions are
valid, or are in need of revision.
