This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research collaboration between U.S. investigators Carlos Kenig of the University
of Chicago and Luis Caffarelli of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,
with Nestor Aguilera of the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Santa Fe,
Argentina; Julio Bouillet of the Universidad de Buenos Aires; Eleonor Harboure
de Aguilera of the Universidad Nacional del Litoral; Jose Lami Dozo of the
Universidad de Buenos Aires; and Carlos Segovia Fernandez of CONICET. The
project will focus on mathematical analysis, particularly modern theory of
partial differential equations and singular integral operators. Through this
award, the U.S. side will have an opportunity to collaborate with young
Argentine mathematicians on topics of mutual interest in mathematical analysis.
