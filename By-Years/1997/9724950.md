9724950 Black This eighteen month project would develop a tool to help K-8
teachers use the Internet as a resource tool in their classrooms. The
overwhelming and disorganized nature of the sites found on the WWW makes it
unusable for many younger students. KidSearch! is specifically designed to help
eliminate superfluous links, and those that might be inappropriate. It provides
both the searching and the filtering capabilities of existing software while
adding some significant features. It supports teacher-built indexes of links
that have been previewed by teachers; the interface is designed for children; it
is available to anyone for free; it has no advertising. Cost sharing is 7% of
the total cost.
