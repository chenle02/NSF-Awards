The Computing Research Association (CRA) proposes to build a website, called
the"BPCNet Resource Portal" to be hosted at CRA. BPCNet will support and amplify
the efforts that the Computer and Information Systems and Engineering (CISE)
Directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently undertaken to
engage more of its Principal Investigators (PIs) in broadening participation in
computing (BPC) activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BPCNet Resource Portal will
provide resources for CISE PIs, allowing them to search for best and promising
practices in BPC. More importantly, it will allow them to find and connect to
collective impact efforts by providing exemplars of (1) departmental BPC plans,
and (2) scaffolding that lets CISE PIs participate in existing Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and BPC programs run by a range
of organizations. CRA will participate in a series of workshops to further plan
the role of the website and obtain feedback on its design and deployment. It
will convene two committees to maintain and curate the portal: an Evaluation
Committee that includes representatives of the Center for Evaluating the
Research Pipeline (CERP) and the National Center for Women and Information
Technology (NCWIT); a Steering Committee that includes CRA Board members and
committee members from its Subcommittee on the Status of Women in Computing
Research (CRA-W), and representatives of diversity-oriented organizations, that
will guide the direction of the portal and interface with the community.
Finally, CRA's reach and its convening role in the community will make this
resource visible, leverage its staff and Committees for curation, and exploit
its existing dissemination avenues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
