Wulf This project is building and measuring experimental memory systems that
match the high data rates of processors with the low random access data rates of
memory parts. The goal is to detect streams of memory references at compile time
and use a smart memory controller to prefetch the streams at run time. The
memory controller can use features of the memory system such as page mode,
nibble mode, or Rambus to maximize the data rates of the memory parts. It then
buffers the streams until the processor asks for the data. The project includes
compiler research as well as research into the architecture of the memory
controllers. This is similar to the vectorization efforts on such machines as
the Cray supercomputers, but more general since a smart memory controller can be
designed for any combination of processor speeds, memory features, and program
characteristics.
