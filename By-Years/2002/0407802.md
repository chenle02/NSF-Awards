DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Field study: Do steroid hormones cause rapid changes in
the behavior of a vocal teleost?

Luke Remage-Healey and Andrew H. Bass

Abstract

Like many vertebrates, human beings experience rapid fluctuations in plasma
steroid hormones in response to environmental stimuli, such as winning a chess
match or watching a favorite sports team lose a critical game. Despite this, the
psychological and/or behavioral impact of rapid hormonal changes is poorly
understood. Animal models provide a way to experimentally test how neural and
hormonal mechanisms regulate rapid changes in behavior. This proposal outlines
experiments that will test how rapidly-changing hormone levels may directly lead
to rapid changes in vocal communication behavior in a teleost fish. In this
study, experimental manipulation of the internal hormonal and external social
environments will aid our understanding of the neural, behavioral and endocrine
interactions that are common to all vertebrates, including humans. This project
will also continue to train field assistants according to a strong commitment to
advancing students from a variety of backgrounds and origins.
