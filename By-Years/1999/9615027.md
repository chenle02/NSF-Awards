9615027 Rogers Researchers at MIT-Haystack Observatory, in collaboration with
researchers at Seagate Tape Technology Inc., will design an improved head-tape
interface for use in linear magnetic tape recorders. Improved thin film head
technology is necessary for applications in which vast amounts of data must be
stored in a fast and inexpensive means. Current thin-film tape head design will
be improved through experimentation to investigate wear at low contact
pressures, and through the computer-modeling of the head-tape interface. ***
