Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0125631&lt;br/&gt;Vallance and Stix&lt;br/&gt;Michigan
Technological University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to advance the
accuracy and application of scaled analogue models of caldera formation. Until
recently, experimental models have struggled to accurately reproduce the caldera
forming process. While new models illustrate that the collapse process is
starting to be understood, they do not address the complexities that are
inherent in real calderas. We have already developed a basic experimental setup
which investigated the effects of varying the magma chamber depth, pre-existing
topography, magma chamber pressure, and cross-sectional symmetry. The crust is
scaled as sand in these and earlier experiments. Due to compaction effects, the
sand appears to deform in a time-dependent fashion. Therefore, our improvements
to this basic model will include: (1) scaling the rheological variability of the
wallrocks and the magma chamber by using a sill-like, water-filled chamber
contained within a silicone jacket; (2) measuring the pressure fluctuations
within the chamber; (3) varying the timescales of eruption (chamber evacuation)
relative to tectonic and intrusion processes; and (4) gradually adding material
to the surface of the collapsing block so as to model emplacement of
intracaldera ignimbrites. Experimental calderas that are produced purely from
the collapse of a homogeneous subsiding block may have limited application to
the complex structural relationships observed at actual calderas. This proposal
will model four structural elements that are critical to the caldera-forming
process but are poorly understood: 1) precursory tumescence; 2) pre-existing
faults; 3) extension and transtension; 4) resurgence.&lt;br/&gt;
