Science communication is now recognized as an important skill for career
advancement and for public understanding of science. Early career scientists
(undergraduate, graduate, within two years of graduation) who are entering the
workforce must be prepared to communicate science to a wide range of audiences,
from the general public to lab groups to research conference scientists.
Effective communications require scientists to visually and verbally translate
scientific information for those with limited backgrounds in science as well as
for scientists whose expertise varies from the presenter. Unfortunately, very
few programs offer communications training to early career scientists. This
project will provide such professional development to early career scientists
via a combined virtual and in-person workshop focused on verbal and visual
science communication skills. The half-day virtual programming will be held
several weeks prior to the one-day in-person workshop. The in-person workshop
will offer participants an opportunity to practice their presentations prior to
a major ocean science conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will build
upon previous workshops (2019 through 2021) and incorporates requests from
participants of prior years to modify the workshop content. For example, the
workshop now contains more international-focused awareness in the verbal
sessions and poster/presentation skills for a scientific conference in the
visual components. The workshop will include presentations from two experts in
visual communications and verbal communications. Some work will be held
virtually in advance of the conference, and the in-person workshop will be held
in conjunction with the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and
Oceanography (ASLO) meeting in June 2023, a meeting that many ocean scientists
regularly attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
