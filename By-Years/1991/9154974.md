The State University of New York at Binghamton will initiate a six- week,
summer residential, Young Scholars project in Chemistry for 15 students entering
grades 11 and 12. The immediate goal of the Young Scholars Research Program
(YSRP) will be to enable qualified high school students, principally women and
minorities, to acquire the prerequisite skills, career awareness, philosophical
and ethical attitudes necessary to encourage them to pursue successfully
preprofessional or professional education studies in scientific, technical and
health- related fields via a consortium that includes SUNY-Binghamton, Broome
Community College and various local companies. Students' views of numerous
career opportunities in the sciences and related fields will become broadened
with exposure to a wide variety of seminar topics, laboratory activities,
university interactions and industrial experiences. They will have a unique
opportunity to become an integral working member of a research team.
