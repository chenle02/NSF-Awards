The parasitic plant dodder has a remarkable ability to communicate with its host
plants. During parasitism it develops a structure called a haustorium, which
penetrates the host, establishes vascular connections, and serves as a conduit
for obtaining water and nutrients from the host. This is all the more striking
because recent research has demonstrated the movement of specific messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) from the host into dodder. The project will investigate mRNA trafficking
in the host-dodder system, focusing on tomato and Arabidopsis as model host
species. New mobile mRNAs will be identified by sequencing mRNAs from dodder and
host tissues adjacent to the haustorium, and these mRNAs will be characterized
with respect to their cellular localization and fate using fluorescent tags and
probes. These experiments will provide insight into how mobile mRNA movement is
regulated and whether cross-species movement of mRNAs function to convey
information from one plant to another. Because mobile mRNAs have been implicated
in the regulation of plant growth and development, this project will contribute
to the fundamental knowledge needed to improve plant productivity. The project
will foster student training at several levels, including graduate,
undergraduate, and high school. For the latter, a high school teacher will
collaborate on the project to develop an aspect of the research that can be used
for student project. These students will gain a valuable perspective on research
by participating in an open-ended project, one whose outcome is not known and
that holds potential for making a genuine contribution to the larger project.
