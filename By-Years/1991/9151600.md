An existing Cary 14 Spectrophotometer is being upgraded to a modern instrument
for student instruction and research by a complete rehabilitation of the
photodetectors and electronic circuits, and the addition of a computer
controlled data acquisition system. The upgraded instrument is serving as the
focus for student research projects, now required in the SUNY Plattsburgh
Physics curriculum. Faculty are supervising student research utilizing the
upgraded instrument in two research areas, semiconductors and meteorite
reflection spectroscopy. In addition, the upgraded Cary 14 is being used for
student laboratory experiments in the Intermediate Laboratory and Physical
Optics courses.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal
sources.
