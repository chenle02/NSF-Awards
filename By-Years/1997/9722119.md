A group of physicists at Stanford University, conducting a research program
called Galileo, proposed an Engineering Test Facility Vacuum System. The vacuum
system will complete the facility that includes an existing high bay area with
two 15 ton cranes, an assembly area, a clean room space and supporting offices.
The facility will be available to collaborative groups working with LIGO (the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory currently under
construction). It will be used for the testing and the rapid prototyping of
subsystems to be used in future interferometers at LIGO. This action is partly
supported by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program.
