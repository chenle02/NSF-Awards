In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division
Professor Kent M. Ervin of the Chemistry Department of the University of Nevada
at Reno will undertake a series of investigations to measure the binding
energies of adsorbates on transition metal clusters. These will be determined as
function of cluster size, element, charge state, and adsorbate identity. The
experimental methods use guided ion beam reaction and laser photodesorption
dynamics techniques. Surface science studies have provided adsorption energies
for many adsorbates at various sites on single crystal metal surfaces. For metal
cluster systems, however, such data are extremely limited, especially for
strongly bound adsorbates and reaction intermediates. Such data are, however, of
extreme importance when cluster reactions are to be used for selective chemistry
and for the interpretation of reaction mechanisms taking place at surfaces. This
research project is designed to provide the data necessary for the
characterization of the adsorption sites on the clusters and to interpret
kinetic data on cluster reactions in terms of mechanisms and product formation.
