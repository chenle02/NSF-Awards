9527754 Sites This award will support the incorporation of 4.5 million specimens
of aquatic invertebrates collected over 33 years by the Missouri Department of
Conservation into the Wilbur R. Enns Entomology Museum of the University of
Missouri. These specimens are the basis for a database that associates
invertebrate species presence and density with a suite of habitat
characteristics. The specimens and the associated database are an extremely
important resource for systematic, faunistic, and ecological studies of Ozark
Plateau wetlands; for analysis of water quality; and for documentation of the
invertebrate biota. Funds from this award will provide specimen housing and
curation, as well as updating of the database. Both specimens and database will
be used by the University of Missouri Entomology Department (in both research
and education), the USDA Biological Control of Insects Laboratory, the Missouri
Departments of Agriculture, Conservation, and Natural Resources, and the
National Park Service. Funding of this project is by NSF in partnership with the
University, the Missouri Department of Conservation, and the National Park
Service.
