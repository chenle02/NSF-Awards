9724689 Hicks This award supports a 12 month National Science Foundation
Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. David Hicks at the Chiba University
Department of Cultural Anthropology, Chiba, Japan. Dr. Hick's student, Ms.
Jennifer Callans, will work with Dr. Hideo Takei, Professor of Anthropology, on
a research project entitled, "Meiji Era Art Motifs and Contemporary Japanese
Conceptions of Identity." The proposed research seeks to illuminate how art
stimulates cultural identity by determining whether natural or technological
motifs associated with the Meiji Era (1868- 1912) serve as a foundation for
Japanese collective identity. Although the Meiji Era is considered a crucial
period in Japanese history, there has been no attempt to examine the association
between Meiji art and a contemporary Japanese sense of collective self, that is,
"Japaneseness" (Nihonrashisa). The proposed research builds on current
historical and anthropological studies to analyze how the Japanese people create
and sustain a sense of collective identity and how diverse interpretations of
the identity potentially undermine existing attitudes and induce social change.
