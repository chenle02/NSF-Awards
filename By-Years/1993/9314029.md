9314029 Davies This award will support the U.S. contribution to a cooperative
project with British scientists which will integrate and synthesize data from
Ocean Drilling Project and Deep Sea Drilling Project sites in the circum
Antarctic basins, the south Atlantic and the southern Pacific and Indian Oceans.
The basic objective of the project is to determine the history of bottom water
formation around Antarctica and to trace the development of the Circum Polar
Current in response to the breakup of Gondwana. This will be accomplished
through the preparation and interpretation of maps showing changes in sediment
distribution in the southern oceans through the Cenozoic. These data will be
integrated with stable isotope and other time-series and faunal data from
drilling sites. In addition to further defining Cenozoic paleoceanography, the
data and interpretations from this project will be important in defining future
ocean drilling objectives in the region. ***
