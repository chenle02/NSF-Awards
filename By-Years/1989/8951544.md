This funding provides a laboratory resource for education in modern automated
testing concepts and techniques. The project consists of the acquisition of six
automated test stations, each constructed around a CompuAdd 386 PC. The
necessary supporting equipment was already in existence. Automated testing is
integrated in all of the institution's design courses and laboratory equipment
was upgraded using design tools similar to those students encounter in industry.
Students receive instruction in modern experiment design, modern testing
techniques, data acquisition and data analysis techniques. The institution is
providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provides by the Foundation.
