Dr. Juan Gilbert, a professor at Clemson University, has single-handedly
impacted the representation of an underrepresented group in an entire discipline
within the past decade. Specifically, from 2006 to 2009, Dr. Gilbert mentored
more than one-third of the nation's African American Ph.D. graduates in computer
science. He has increased the number of African Americans actively engaged in
STEM through personal mentoring. His mentoring model is spreading now that some
of his mentees are becoming mentors themselves. This snowball effect will
continue to broaden participation in computing among African Americans and other
underrepresented groups. Dr. Gilbert was recently named the Pioneer of the Year
by the National Society of Black Engineers and a National Associate of the
National Research Council of the National Academies.
