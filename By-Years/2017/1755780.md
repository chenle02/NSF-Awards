Wrist-worn wearable devices provide rich sets of pulsatile physiological data
under various modalities and circumstances. An unexploited capability is that
the pulsatile physiological time series collected by wrist-worn wearable devices
can be used for recovering internal brain dynamics. The goal of this project is
to present wearable machine-interface (WMI) architectures related to mental
stress and their potential applications for tracking fatigue and arousal states.
Decoding brain states using wrist-worn wearables will transform how mental-
stress-related diseases are diagnosed and treated. The research is integrated
with education and outreach activities with an emphasis on increasing the
participation of minorities in science and engineering. These activities include
hosting hands-on STEM events for elementary school and high school students,
hosting undergraduate research interns, and creating educational videos.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents two design classes of WMI
architectures related to mental stress: (1) A decoder that recovers undesired
stimuli-triggered brain pulses from wrist-worn wearables and a controller that
delivers closed-loop intermittent stimulation to reverse the adverse effect of
undesired stimuli; and, (2) a decoder that recovers undesired stimuli-triggered
inhibition of pulsatile physiological profile from wrist-worn wearables and a
controller that delivers closed-loop intermittent stimulation to generate the
desired pulsatile physiological profile. The proposed methods will be validated
by analyzing electro-dermal activity as well as concurrent cortisol and
adrenocorticotropic hormone pulsatile data in the context of mental-stress-
related arousal and fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
