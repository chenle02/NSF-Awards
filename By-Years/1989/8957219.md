This research effort addresses deficiencies in our understanding of Ostwald
ripening phenomena in elastically- stressed solids. The kinetics of the
morphological development of misfitting coherent particles in solids is under
examination. The mechanisms responsible for the experimentally observed highly
nonuniform spatial distribution of misfitting particles are investigated through
a detailed numerical solution to the equations describing the dynamics of the
coarsening process. It is expected that the research will provide new insights
into the dynamics of first-order phase transformations in coherent solids.
