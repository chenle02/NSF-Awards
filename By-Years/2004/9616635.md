The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Andreas Albrecht of Cornell
University in his continuing studies on the use of `noisy` light to achieve
femtosecond scale time resolution in condensed phase spectroscopy using
nanosecond pulses. The noisy light-based timing is formally generalized to
nonlinear spectroscopies using a new diagrammatic technique. Focus is on second
and third order nonlinear electrical susceptibilities. Two-dimensional array
detection of the noisy light interferograms will be incorporated to shorten data
acquisition by nearly two orders of magnitude. These new spectroscopic
techniques will potentially lead to more accurate measurements of vibrational
frequencies and shed light on relaxation processes and coherence transfer in
polyatomic molecules in condensed phases. The very practical advantage of this
technique is that noisy light spectra in the nanosecond time domain can probe
dynamics approaching the femtosecond regime, without the need for (expensive)
coherent femtosecond pulses.
