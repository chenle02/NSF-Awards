This research will measure rates of homogeneous nucleation for a variety of
vapors at various temperatures and supersaturations using a thermal diffusion
cloud chamber. The influence of photo-induced ions of controlled sign and
concentration on the nucleation rate also will be measured. The theory for
thermal diffusion cloud chambers will be extended to account for vapor depletion
and latent heat release associated with droplet formation and growth in order to
allow data interpretation at significantly higher nucleation rates than obtained
heretofore by this technique. Acquisition of an extensive and consistent data
base should enable a critical test of theories for homogeneous nucleation rates
which sometimes differ from experimental rates by many orders of magnitude and
will guide modifications where necessary to these theories. Nucleation is an
important phenomenon in a wide variety of engineering and environmental
applications.
