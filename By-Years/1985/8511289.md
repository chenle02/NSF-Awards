Fundamental laboratory experiments will be performed to study the development of
internal waves and the transition to turbulence in uniform sheared and
stratitied flow. Techniques are developed by which both the velocity shear and
the density gradients can be measured with sufficient accuracy to determine a
significant range of Richardson numbers. These measurements will be used to
investigate the details of internal wave breaking, and other mechanisms of
instability, and also to test fundamental theoretical ideas developed by
mathematicians and numerical modelers.
