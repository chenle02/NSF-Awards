The long term goal of this fundamental bioengineering proposal is to produce a
means to detect incipient failure in biomedical devices. The approach is to
introduce acoustic waves non-evasively into a person at position where a heart
valve implant can be properly monitored. By measuring the response of the
acoustic echo, a determination will be made concerning the potential for
mechanical failure of the heart valve.
