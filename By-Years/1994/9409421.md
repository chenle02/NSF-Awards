9409421 Rabelo The objective of this project is to develop and bring to
engineering students and industry personnel a program for utilizing artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques for scheduling and sequencing of manufacturing
systems. The materials to be packaged for deployment purposes are the results
and outcomes of prior research efforts by the principal investigator (PI) in the
same subject area. The program will involve the development of a series of
teaching/learning modules. The PI, along with a team of graduates students,
consultants, academia and government personnel, and production and systems
managers will be engaged in the development. The development of the series will
be based on multimedia approach and is expected to provide a rich learning
experience and promote better learning experiences and understanding. The
modules to be developed will be incorporated into introductory manufacturing and
control courses, applied AI courses, and training and re-training seminars for
production and research and development personnel in industry. Ideas will be
solicited from professors at different universities to build, update, and modify
the modules to ensure wide acceptance.
