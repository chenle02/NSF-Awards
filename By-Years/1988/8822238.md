P.I. will collaborate with W. Sturges of Florida State Univ., and J.D. Thompson
of the Naval Oceanographic Research and Development Activity (NORDA) to model
time-dependent response of the Gulf of Mexico to forcing by winds and Loop
Current Rings, and the compare model output with existing data from the western
Gulf and the Yucatan straits. the primary objective is to determine whether
there is an identifiable western boundary current (WBC) in the Gulf, and define
and resolve the effects of the two forcing mechanisms. Two different numerical
models will be used to model different aspects of the circulation for comparison
with observations.
