This award provides funds for the purchase of an automated peptide synthesizer
and associated purification equipment. This instrumentation will complement
existing instrumentation in an interdisciplinary molecular resource center at
the University of Rochester School of Medicine. The core facility will serve
active research in DNA and cDNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, regulation
of gene expression and structural and functional characterization of proteins.
Specifically the instrumentation will benefit ten primary and fifteen secondary
faculty as well as nine newly recruited faculty. The investigators are engaged
in high-quality research, are productive, and have excellent extramural funding.
