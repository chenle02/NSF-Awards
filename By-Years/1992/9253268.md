The grant continues the work of the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow into extended
projects to do teacher enhancement in three school districts. The classrooms are
located in Cupertino, California, Nashville, Tennessee, and Columbus, Ohio.
These districts range from 35% to 54% minority students. One of the districts,
Nashville, has considerable experience with ACOT and training and will be the
lead district in most activities. The project helps a large number of teachers
gain experience in the use of technology in instruction. The focus is on
"inquiry-based, collaborative and knowledge building tasks" in mathematics,
science, history and language arts. Week-long practice are used during the
school year, up to two per month per site. These involve two groups of four
teachers in each serving 48 teachers per site per year. Summer 4-week long
institutes include 24 teachers per site per year.
