This project examines the phenomenon of investor-state arbitration provisions in
bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The project addresses two important and
understudied questions. Why are states increasingly choosing to relinquish one
of their fundamental sovereign rights under international law: immunity from
suit by foreign direct investors before international tribunals? And does
relinquishing that right actually help to attract foreign investment? The
proposed project will provide one of the first systematic and theoretically
informed empirical analyses of the BIT/arbitration phenomenon. In particular,
the project will develop a unique dataset that systematically evaluates the
relative strength of each BIT's dispute settlement and other substantive
provisions. The dispute settlement measure will serve alternately as the
dependent and key explanatory variable in a series of statistical models testing
the project's core predictions: that weakly democratic capital importing states
will tend to conclude BITs with strong pro-investor dispute settlement
provisions, and that BITs with the strongest investor protection provisions will
have stronger positive impacts on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows than
will BITs with weaker provisions.
