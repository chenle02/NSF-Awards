9410683 Songer The objective is to develop an automated prediction tool for
public sector agencies to select appropriate projects for design- build facility
acquisition. At the core of the tool is a analytical model which predicts the
probability of success for projects selected for design-build. The model will be
built using two techniques, multiattribute analysis and logistic regression. The
model will be built using case studies from previous design-build projects of
Building Research Board members. Rigorous testing of the model and tool will be
performed by comparing predicted to actual project performance. Design-build
acquisition methods are relatively new to public sector agencies. Providing a
tool to select appropriate projects for design-build will significantly enhance
current selection processes. Appropriate project selection will greatly improve
public sector competitiveness in facility acquisition. ***
