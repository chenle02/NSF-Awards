0072217 Pisztora The investigator proposes a number of inter-related projects to
study spatial random systems which are of interest both in probability theory
and statistical physics. The projects are concerned with regular, invasion and
FK percolation, Ising-Potts models and network flows. In percolation and
invasion percolation certain structural properties of large clusters will be
studied at or near the critical point in two or higher dimensions. In a further
project the relation between characteristic length and renormalization will be
investigated. A project focuses on phase coexistence in Ising-Potts models and
it is concerned with the microscopic properties of the Wulff droplet and of
other interfaces, and with the analysis of phase coexistence in the presence of
several phases. Decay of correlations and the relaxation of boundary effects in
FK percolation (and indirectly in Potts models) is the target of two further
projects. The study of capacitated networks is proposed by using sophisticated
large deviation methods which have proven to be decisive in other context.

The aim of this project is to gain insight and achieve understanding of certain
fundamental systems having their origin in statistical and condensed matter
physics, materials science, chemistry and earth sciences. Success in solving
some of the proposed problems would lead to some of the following benefits: 1)
the derivation of rigorous knowledge about fundamental physical systems of
theoretical and practical relevance, 2) a deeper insight into the mechanisms
responsible for the behavior of such systems, 3) the development of new
mathematical methods and tools which, apart from yielding answers to questions
raised in other fields, might benefit and enrich probability theory itself.
