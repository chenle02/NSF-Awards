This project examines the economic and social dynamics of subsistence hunting
and fishing among young adult Inuit in two Canadian Arctic communities: Holmon
and Clyde River. Both husbands and wives will be interviewed to construct an
accurate picture of dietary patterns, food-sharing networks, Inuit self-
identity, harvest activities and wage-employment. These data will be used to
examine how subsistence hunting fits into the overall economic strategies of
young adult households, an important issue with respect to the future direction
of northern society in Canada, Alaska and much of the Arctic world.
