The purpose of this research is to continue the principal investigator's study
of arithmetic applications of capacity theory. Previously he has developed a
theory of capacity for adelic sets on algebraic curves over global fields,
yielding existence and finiteness criteria for algebraic points and rationality
criteria for power series. The proposed research will seek to quantitatively
sharpen known applications, pursue connections with other fields, and search for
generalizations to higher dimensions.
