With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of
Chemistry is funding Professor George Shields of Bucknell University to
determine structures and energies of molecular complexes relevant to atmospheric
aerosols. These complexes are formed from water molecules, sulfuric acid
molecules, and other trace molecules found in the atmosphere. These complexes
are important because they are relate to the fundamental basis of how clouds
form, and the mechanism for cloud formation is currently not known. The project
is also having a broad impact through its model of a sustained and productive
undergraduate research experience involving the same students, including
minorities and women, throughout their undergraduate
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor George Shields and co-workers are purusing
a joint computational/experimental study toward establishing the minimum energy
structures and the thermodynamics for formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes.
These studies allow for the assessment of the ability of state-of-the-art
computational chemistry methods to model water clusters that can be directly
compared, and help guide state-of-the-art microwave spectroscopy experiments.
The Shields group is determining the structures and thermodynamics of molecular
clusters containing sulfuric acid, bases, and water, that are believed to serve
as neutral and ionic cloud condensation nuclei. These methods are expected to
allow for the prediction of the relative abundance of all potentially relevant
complexes, providing insight on which ones are of atmospheric importance in the
cloud nucleation process. In a much broader sense, the techniques being
developed here may provide atmospheric scientists with new ways to relate air
quality/composition to cloud nucleation/pattern development.
