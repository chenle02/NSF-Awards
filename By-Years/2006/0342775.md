This action funds a Minority Graduate Student Travel Award. These awards permit
minority graduate students who plan to apply for an NSF Minority Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship to make visits to prospective sponsoring scientists prior to
submitting a fellowship application.

Ms. Austin will visit the laboratory of Dr. Denise Dearing at the University of
Utah the fall of 2003. Her research interests are in metabolism and
pharmacology. This visit will permit her to formulate a program for postdoctoral
research that adds an ecological perspective to her research by examining plant-
animal interactions.
