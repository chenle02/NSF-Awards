The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a benchtop gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer system for use by students in several advanced undergraduate
chemistry courses and in Organic, Analytical, Inorganic and Biochemistry
undergraduate research. Biochemistry students are using the instrument to
identify the amino acid compostion of polypeptides. the instrument is also being
used to analyze air quality, characterization of reaction products, and organic
structure determination.
