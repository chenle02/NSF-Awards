Mammalian high molecular weight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are associated in a
multi-enzyme complex in contrast to the free soluble enzymes in lowere
organisma. The objectives of this award are to elucidate the structure and
function of these complex entities and to establish the principles which govern
the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Three lines of inquiry are
planned. The first is analyze the structural and functional interactions of the
synthetase complex with the protein biosythetic machinery. The second is to
determine the structures of the individual synthetases and associated proteins
in the complex through molecular cloning and sequencing of the respective cDNAs.
The last is to develop a protein foot-printing method to determine the
structural elements involved in the protein-protein and protein-RNA
interactions. Supramolecular protein-RNA complexes are extremely important in
the function of living cells. The results of these studies will lead to a better
understanding of how such complexes in general, and the synthetase complex in
particular, are assembled and endabled to function in mammalian and other living
systems.
