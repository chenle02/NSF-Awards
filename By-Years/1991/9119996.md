This is a proposal a 300 MHz solid state NMR spectrometer that will be used for
research which addresses important topics in the fields of biomolecular
structure and surface and polymer chemistry. The biophysical projects will
investigate the structure and mechanism of membrane proteins, with the aim of
understanding the role of conformational changes in signal transduction and the
role of membrane inserton in the gating of channels. The instrument will also
enable high field studies which will compoement an existing zero field NMR
program to investigate the chemistry of catalytic surfaces. Finally, this
instrument will enhance a strong program in polymer science, with projects
ranging from the investigation of structure and dynamics in polymers with
powerful new two dimensional solid state NMR techniques ot the characterization
of an exciting new class of materials, biopolymers. This is an ideal environment
for expanding the application of solid state NMR to answer biological questions,
because of the confluence of several soid state NMR spectroscopists and numerous
investigators in the bioligical science who already participate in an
interdisciplinary graduate program in molecular and cellular biology.
