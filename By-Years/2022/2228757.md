The changing climate is leading to increased extreme weather events that cause
excessive damage to the electric power network (EPN). This creates prolonged
outages with serious social and economic consequences, especially to rural
utilities with limited resources. To alleviate such adverse impacts, this
project will introduce a new digital infrastructure that transforms the
resilience of the EPNs that serve rural communities, allowing appropriate
preventive and corrective actions with a focus on climate adaptation. There is
currently a high priority among underserved utilities to address the absence of
high-fidelity platforms capable of representing real power system performance
during natural hazards and connecting current and future hazard data to the
measures of risk and resilience at the community level. Thus, the overarching
goal of the projectâ€™s tasks and activities is to introduce, test, and establish
a novel digital infrastructure that will enable utilities in rural communities
to plan for changing climate, minimize the consequences of natural disasters,
and recover from them as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will generate new knowledge with three major advancements in the field of EPN
resiliency: (1) Linking physical assets and power network models. Specifically,
this project will use a multi-source data-based approach to create the key
physical properties of EPN infrastructure assets based on the climatic factors
that capture extreme weather events. (2) Improving the data sources required for
the risk assessment of EPNs under weather-related events. For this purpose, this
project will generate the data and supporting models for the types of hazard
observed in the study region (e.g., tornados, derechos, blizzards, and floods).
(3) Establishing a dynamic simulation platform to account for climate change
effects and climate adaptation strategies. The outcome will open new frontiers
in quantitative decision-support tools enabled through efficient data-enabled
analyses. This will pave the way for effective short- and long-term resilience
investment strategies based on the needs and priorities of the
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;his project is part of the CIVIC Innovation
Challenge which is a collaboration of NSF, the Department of Energy's Vehicle
Technology Office, and the Department of Homeland Security's Science and
Technology Directorate and Federal Emergency Management
Agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
