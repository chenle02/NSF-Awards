This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at the
Florida Institute of Technology for Project LABS, which involves the development
of a conservationist curriculum for the biological sciences. The LABS project
will develop skills and analytical techniques that involve least-impact
sampling, and emphasizes computer-assisted descriptive techniques. Funds will be
used to purchase computer workstations and appropriate field- sampling
equipment. The program will emphasize 1) Least- destructive field sampling
techniques, 2) Optimized field and laboratory analysis; 3) Descriptive field and
laboratory skills, enhanced by the use of video- and computer-based techniques
appropriate to modern biology; and 4) Student preparation of computer
simulations of biotic systems. The project's goal is to train undergraduate
students in skills that will provide additional capabilities for graduate
research, as well as skills useful in public-contact biology careers. In
particular, the project should encourage students to pursue careers in taxonomy
and life-history studies, to supply anticipated national and international needs
for documentation of biodiversity. Student participants in the program should
also gain significant appreciation of the ethics of biological conservation. The
grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
