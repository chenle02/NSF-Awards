The project is an initial exploratory research effort in segmentation of range
images and the development of a robust method to recover symbolic descriptors of
surfaces from those images. The surfaces will be represented as polynomials,
whose coefficients will be obtained from a number of explicitly determined
surface points, obtained using existing techniques. Appropriate descriptors will
be derived from the terms of the representing polynomials. A search will be made
for more powerful and general surface descriptors. The project will also study
the efficacy of the segmentation program in recovering symbolic descriptors from
images containing several objects, some of which may be only partially visible.
