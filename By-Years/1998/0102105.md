This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Effects of energy, environmental
variation, and dynamic constraints on the structure of experimental microbial
food webs." A lab-based microbial system, comprised of bacteria, autotrophic
algae, heterotrophic protozoa, and rotifers, is being used to determine the
effects of environmental variability and energy on the emergent structure of
food webs. Webs of varying complexity are experimentally perturbed and changes
in web structure are compared to stability measures to assess how perturbations
and stability-complexity interact to generate community organization.
