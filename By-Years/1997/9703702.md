Conditional branches constitute a significant fraction of instructions executed
in a typical program. In modern pipelined processor implementations, branches
cause wasted processor cycles, due to the unpredictability of the next
instruction. This project is exploring an alternative to branch prediction and
speculative execution, which is to decouple the branch computations from the
basic blocks they control. Branches, and the instructions that compute branch
conditions, are peeled out of the main program and executed on a separate
processor. Both compiler backend development and processor implementation are
affected by this alternative, and the project takes an experimental approach to
both.
