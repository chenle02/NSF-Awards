9633346 Glicksman This study is directed toward developing a firm experimental
basis and deeper understanding of microstructural evolution in two-phase alloys.
The focus is to integrate and test several theories that describe
microstructural coarsening kinetics. Specifically, "snap-shot" calculations,
based on distributions of point sources and sinks to represent diffusional
interactions in dilute microstructures, are extended to higher volume fractions.
Kinetic studies on binary alloys are pursued which are found to exhibit temporal
exponents in ultra-dense microstructures that, curiously, decrease from the
classical Ostwald ripening value of 1/3 to a value of 1/4. This is attributed to
an as yet unexplained kinetic behavior from the influence of particle shape
accommodation and strong spatial correlations. In summary, the research focuses
both theoretical and experimental efforts on integrating and validating
fundamental elements of coarsening theory to achieve progress toward a more
unified kinetic description of microstructure evolution over the volume fraction
range 0- 1. %%% The core subjects of this grant include determining kinetic laws
for alloys processed over the full range of compositions and explaining them
through basic kinetic principles. Properties of metal alloys depend on their
microstructure, and the microstructural behavior depends primarily on time,
temperature, and composition. Temperature controls the rate of atom diffusion,
whereas, at a fixed temperature, the average chemical composition determines the
volume fraction of dispersed phases, and, indirectly, establishes the
microstructural length scales for diffusion and interfacial processes. ***
