This project is establishing a Regional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Facility in the central Shenandoah Valley. The facility enables students to
experience, first hand, the capabilities of a fully equipped, high-field, NMR
spectrometer. Through the use of a computer network, students can use the
instrument remotely for data acquisition from their individual home
institutions. The facility is used by chemistry majors and non-majors throughout
selected levels of the chemistry curriculum. In addition, undergraduate research
is being enhanced at each of the institutions in the consortium. The
instrumentation in the facility enables users to perform more sophisticated
experiments that stimulate new projects and collaborations among the
participating students and faculty. The addition of the high-field NMR
spectrometer also enhances the university's NSF/REU program, which provides
meaningful summer research experiences for groups traditionally underrepresented
in the sciences and their faculty mentors. The facility allows them to perform
higher quality research, and attract additional students and faculty to the
program.
