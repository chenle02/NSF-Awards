At present, there are no universities in Chicago that are designated as a Center
of Excellence in Information Assurance Education (COE/IAE). This proposal is
designed to provide the necessary support for the Illinois Institute of
Technology to become the first COE/IAE in the third largest city in the United
States. To ensure that we do not reinvent the wheel, the proposal is a
collaborative effort with Mississippi State University, a school well recognized
as an innovative COE/IAE with past experience in assisting other universities in
establishing COE/IAE programs. This project implements the following key
changes:&lt;br/&gt;1. Migrate a key course on information security to the
undergraduate program.&lt;br/&gt;2. Modify existing graduate-level course on
Cryptography so that it will also be suitable for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;3.
Modify existing undergraduate courses in operating systems, database systems,
information retrieval, data mining, networking, software engineering, and
computer ethics to include information security and information awareness
topics.&lt;br/&gt;4. Evaluate all of these courses to ensure they are meeting
objectives, using a new evaluation methodology recently developed for other
courses.&lt;br/&gt;
