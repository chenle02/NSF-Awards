With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Maria Buthelezi from Wheaton College and colleagues John Collins and Xuesheng
Chen will acquire a pulsed laser/detection system with a tunable dye laser
system, a detection system, and a cryogenic refrigerator system. The award will
enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in the areas
of (a) studies of host/guest interactions of photochromic molecules, and (b)
luminescence properties of solid state materials.

A tunable laser is a laser whose wavelength of operation can be altered in a
controlled manner. The dye laser uses an organic dye as the lasing medium giving
a system that can be used over a broad range of wavelengths. Some of the dyes
can be large molecules that emit light via fluorescence. The tunable dye
laser/detection system will enable excited-state lifetime and time-resolved
fluorescence measurements that are important to the investigation of several
processes that occur in molecular complexes: radiative decay that leads to
conformational states, non-linear energy transfer processes, and fluorescence
quenching mechanisms. This instrumentation will also foster the
interdisciplinary curricular and research interactions between chemistry,
physics and biology at Wheaton College.
