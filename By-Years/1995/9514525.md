Ball 9514525 Numerous animals integrate various cues from the environment to
predict the arrival of improving conditions associated with spring. Arguably the
most critical cue is changing daylength, which is responsible for enhancing
numerous behaviors including communicative behaviors. Increasing daylength also
fosters marked chemical changes in the brain associated with the behavioral
changes. In these receptive animals, secondary features may potentiate the
positive aspects of increasing daylength. However, increasing daylength after a
period of time precipitates the development of refractoriness which terminates
behavioral enhancement and brain neurochemical changes. Dr. Gregory Ball is
assessing the interplay between daylength and secondary characteristics in
fostering seasonal behavioral changes. The studies include an identification of
the neuronal circuitry responsible for mediation of the behavioral changes in
the animals, as well as a demonstration of the specific secondary cues to which
the animals respond. Studies to this point have not identified specific features
of the environment other than daylength as enhancors of behavioral activity.
These studies will be useful to understanding the survival of species in their
nature habitats and the environmental cues to which they are most responsive.
