In this project, PI's will study the dispersion of Mediterranean Water into the
North Atlantic by seeding the Mediterranean Undercurrent near its source with
lagrangian drifters. Forty RAFOS floats will be tracked for a period of eighteen
months, with the principal objective of distinguishing between the formation of
Mediterranean mesoscale eddies (Meddies), and simple advection/ diffusion. In a
collaborative study, scientists from Portugal will carry out hydrographic
surveys and maintain an array of current meters in the region.
