NER Proposal #0210428&lt;br/&gt;PI: Faquir Jain&lt;br/&gt;Nanochannel FETs and
Quantum Dot based Nonvolatile Memory Cells using &lt;br/&gt;Site-Specific and
Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly
Techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims
at forming nanochannels (10-30 nm length with ~100nm &lt;br/&gt;width), using
SiOx-Si nanomasks deposited via site-specific self-assembly, &lt;br/&gt;to
fabricate FETs with enhanced performance. In addition, it seeks to
&lt;br/&gt;develop quantum dot based nonvolatile memory cell structures in
floating &lt;br/&gt;gate and floating trap configurations. These nonvolatile
memory cells are &lt;br/&gt;proposed to be grown using layer-by-layer self-
assembly of ZnS-cladded CdSe &lt;br/&gt;or ZnCdSe quantum dots (with core
diameter ~3-5nm). The final goal is the &lt;br/&gt;integration of FETs with
nonvolatile memory cells to design programmable &lt;br/&gt;circuits.
