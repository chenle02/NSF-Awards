This project is concerned with various areas of noncommutative ring theory. The
principal investigator will study PI rings and their representations focusing on
applications to linear groups, the behavior of normalizing elements and the
embeddability of PI rings into matrices. Affine prime rings with Gelfand-
Kirillov dimension two will also be investigated with the goal of determining
when they are primitive. Finally, rings of invariants of reductive groups on
certain noncommutative algebras will be considered. This research is in the
general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation
satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to
do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication is not commutative is the
collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings
has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance
to other branches of mathematics and physics.
