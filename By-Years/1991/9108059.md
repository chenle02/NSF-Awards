This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of a microscope, image analysis
system, and computer which will be used by eight scientists working
independently or collaboratively on five different projects to expand and
technically enhance ongoing basic research in plant molecular, cellular, and
developmental biology. This research is experimental in approach and focused on
cellular and molecular biological interests, such as, chloroplast dna molecules,
ultrastructural responses to heat shock mechanisms controlling abscission,
bacterial gene expression, and the formation of pit membranes in woody dicots.
An image analysis system capable of performing quantitative morphometric and
stereological measurements is essential for the successful completion of the
research. Also, proposed research investigating various cellular responses
require fluorescence microscopy. For example, immunofluorescence microscopy will
be used for the localization of specific cytoskeletal proteins and to visualize
and quantify subcellular features associated with target cell differentiation in
abscission zones of soybean.
