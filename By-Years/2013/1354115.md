This collaborative research project contributes to theories of rights
mobilization and claims making through consideration of how local political and
civic context shapes rights mobilization and implementation. Research is based
on in-depth interviews with federal, state and local government officials,
representatives of advocacy groups and other civil society organizations, and
persons making labor rights claims to ascertain how variation in political and
civic context affects legal consciousness, willingness to mobilize around rights
claims, implementation strategies, and government accountability.

Several broader impacts will result from this research. First, research findings
will inform debates over how best to implement federal rights initiatives that
seek to improve educational and occupational mobility as well as civic
engagement. Second, this research will inform the work of various community
organizations and government institutions responding to rights claims and their
implementation. Finally, this project will inform course development and
research training of graduate students in two public universities.
