The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria mathematics research project between
Dr. Richard Ewing of the University of Wyoming and Dr. Raytcho Lazarov of the
Institute of Mathematics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, is to devise, implement
and test various schemes for the numerical solution of systems of reaction-
convection-diffusion equations. The work will be based on discretization methods
such as finite elements, finite differences, mixed elements, method of
characteristics and discontinuous Galerkin method. Results may yield efficient
and accurate numerical methods useful in modeling contaminant transport, energy
conversion systems, groundwater hydrology and heat and mass transfer. This
project in applied mathematics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe
to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
