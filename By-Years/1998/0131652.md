The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a behavior that stabilizes visual images on
the retina during head movements. It has been demonstrated that Cartilaginous
fishes have an eye muscle innervation pattern and VOR circuitry that is
different from most vertebrates. The lungfish are more closely related to
tetrapods than to other vertebrates, but they are believed to have an eye muscle
innervation pattern similar to that of Cartilaginous fishes. It is therefore
hypothesized that lungfish have a VOR circuitry like that of Cartilaginous
fishes. Testing this hypothesis requires that the organization of the oculomotor
nuclei and VOR circuitry be determined in a representative of the lungfish. The
African lungfish is chosen based on its commercial availability. Two sets of
experiments are proposed. In the first set of experiments, retrograde transport
of biotinylated dextrans amines (BDA) will be used to reveal the organization of
the oculomotor nucleus. In the second set, injections of BDA into the oculomotor
nucleus will be used to reveal the organization of the VOR connections. This
research will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of eye movement
control systems in the vertebrate brain. Additionally, the research project will
provide experiences for undergraduates in basic neuroscience research.
