This project, building on a planning grant, provides a practical, theory-based
approach to developing high quality assessments of science inquiry. The project
will produce: (1) a system for developing reusable assessment-task templates
organized around schemas of inquiry; (2) generally stated rubrics for
recognizing and evaluating evidence of inquiry skills; (3) an organized set of
assessment development resources; (4) an initial collection of schemas, exemplar
templates and tasks produced in the contest of the BioKIDS and FOSS projects;
and (5) a statistical model that supports rigorous analyses of student learning.
Rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to document the
process. A "quality of evidence" study will be conducted to determine if the
information yielded by these assessments provides more useful and descriptive
information of student learning than traditional assessments.
