During the first phase of this Small Business Research project, ARACOR
demonstrated the feasibility of the concept of using x-ray transmission anode
films mounted on diamond substrates to enhance the brightness of x-ray sources.
Phase II research will include: (i) the design, fabrication and evaluation of
select metal film/diamond heatsink structures to determine their performance
under the protracted thermal and radiological stress of an intense microfocal
x-ray source electron beam; (ii) studies to understand failure mechanisms, such
as film delamination, diamond fracture, and radiation damage; and (iii)
reliability and performance comparison tests of the ARACOR reflection
configuration targets relative to convential microfocus reflection targets. It
is expected that the results of this research, if successful, will have enormous
impact on the international market for industrial x-ray imaging systems.
