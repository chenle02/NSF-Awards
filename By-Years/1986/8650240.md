The Physics Department at Indiana University at South Bend will improve its
laboratory program and provide its students hands-on experience with laboratory
equipment which is so much a part of a scientist's life. In order to offer a
more effective and up-to-date program, the Department will purchase equipment in
three specific areas: 1) Computerization of the introductory physics
laboratories; 2) Utilization of telescopes and accessories in astronomy courses;
and 3) Creation of a modest intermediate-level (mostly modern) physics
laboratory. The equipment will provide both physics majors and non-majors
worthwhile laboratory experiences and help develop the excitement needed for
learning and self-discovery beyond the classroom.
