This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
develop a novel, monolithic external-cavity to tune near-UV laser diodes now
commercially available between 375 and 440 nm. The external cavity will provide
electro-optic control over both the lasing wavelength and the cavity optical
path enabling single-mode, mode-hop-free tuning over 5-10 nm sections. The
entire optical package will be centimeter sized, environmentally robust, and
deliver 2-10 mW of optical power. Tuning speeds are proposed to be in
millisecond time scales. Tunable blue and visible laser diodes with these tuning
characteristics would be useful for spectroscopy-based sensors of many light
molecules, elements, and biogenic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tunable diode
lasers from the violet to the IR would have broader impacts to scientific
education, the research community, and to the economy. Educators should welcome
low-cost alternatives to dye lasers allowing sophisticated atomic and molecular
spectroscopy experiments to be performed with modest budgets. Researchers should
be able to use a wider variety of wavelengths in their experiments. Tunable blue
and visible laser diodes would find early commercial success in the scientific
research markets where they would replace troublesome dye-laser systems and
expensive frequency-doubled Ti-Sapphire lasers. The robust and compact form
factor of our laser, combined with decisive control over the output wavelength
should enable a wide variety of in-situ spectroscopy-based sensors for hand-held
devices, engine exhaust sensors, and combustion monitoring, &lt;br/&gt;
