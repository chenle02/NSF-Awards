The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Flow &amp; Transport in Permeable Media
has been continually successful in gathering a distinguished group of top
researchers in the field for 30 years. This convergence of scientists,
mathematicians, and engineers from diverse geographic and ethnic backgrounds,
includes both formal and informal gatherings, results in the free flow of ideas
that is necessary to tackle the most challenging interdisciplinary problems of
flow and transport in porous media. The associated Graduate Research Seminar
(GRS) on Flow &amp; Transport in Permeable Media will be held prior to the GRC.
The GRS brings together early-career investigators for a two-day seminar of
scientific sessions and informal discussions organized and executed by the
junior members of the associated GRC community
