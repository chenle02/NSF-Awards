This award provides support for purchase of equipment to establish an integrated
laboratory for high-throughput processing of DNA samples in environmental
research. Establishment of the laboratory will give scientists at the Marine
Biological Laboratory (MBL) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
access to high-throughput capabilities that are typically restricted to
biomedical or industrialized genomic research centers. Equipment to be purchased
include several robotic workstations, a real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction device and a pulsed field gel electrophoresis) system. This new
equipment will permit scientists at both institutions to achieve optimum use of
an existing high capacity DNA sequencing and microarray facility. This robotic
equipment will completely automate management and processing of DNA samples, and
thus enable scientists to sample genetic diversity in the environment at a level
previously unimaginable. Research questions to be pursued address issues in
genome evolution, biodiversity, and environmental influences on gene expression.
The equipment will allow precise measurement of changes in gene expression in
response to external factors (e.g. toxins, other chemicals) and as a result of
symbiosis, and will also be used to measure specific DNA sequences in
uncultivable environmental populations. The new high-throughput capabilities
will also directly impact the training and education of visiting and year-round
scientists, students, and postdoctoral fellows at the two institutions in Woods
Hole, MA.
