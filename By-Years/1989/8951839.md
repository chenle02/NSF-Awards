A new series of exciting, semi-research-level possibilities in the Advanced
Physics Laboratory is being developed. Equipment for work in two new areas --
digital image acquisition and processing, and temperature-dependent properties
of matter using closed cycle refrigerators is provided by this grant. The
digital imaging equipment will make possible projects on fractal aggregates,
dynamics of swimming organisms, chaotic behavior in oscillating chemical
reactions, and rapid optical spectroscopy. Some properties of matter that will
be explored using the close cycle refrigerators are temperature-dependent
conductivity in high Tc Superconductors, quantum oscillations in magnetic
susceptibility, temperature-dependent optical properties of solids, and specific
heats of solids through magnetic phase transitions.
