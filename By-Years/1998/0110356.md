This award to WTEC, Inc. is for organization of a workshop at NSF in February
2001 that will provide a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international
research activities in quantum information science. Quantum information science
(QIS) is an emerging field of science and technology that draws on the
disciplines of physical science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering.
Its aim is to understand how fundamental laws of quantum mechanics can be
harnessed to dramatically improve the acquisition, transmission, and processing
of information. The exciting scientific opportunities offered by QIS are
attracting the interest of a growing community of scientists and engineers, both
nationally and internationally. Although the U.S. maintains a leadership role in
this research, major centers of excellence exist abroad, principally in Japan,
Europe, and Australia. The goal of the workshop is to gather information by a
panel of U.S. experts for the purposes of planning a more extensive global study
of QIS. Its scope is to identify the leading individuals, institutions, and
centers of excellence in international research and development in the field. A
full international technology assessment study may then be organized separately
to complete the major study. Several Divisions in the Directorates for
Engineering, for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering at NSF are supporting this award.
