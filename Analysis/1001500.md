The focus of this project is the study of the local and global behavior of
solutions of geometric hyperbolic PDE arising in general relativity and models
used in gauge theories. In general relativity the full nonlinear system of the
Einstein equations will be considered in both weak and strong gravitational
field regimes. The principal investigator will continue his work on the bounded
curvature conjecture, asserting that a metric solution of the Einstein vacuum
equations can be locally extended as long as its curvature tensor is bounded in
the square integrable norm. A strong gravitational field regime will be studied
in the context of extensions and developments of the short pulse method recently
introduced by Christodoulou in the problem of formation of trapped surfaces. The
project will continue a rigorous mathematical study of linear and nonlinear
waves on black hole backgrounds, where the stability of the Kerr solution
remains an outstanding open problem. It will also pursue further study of the
stable regime of singularity formation for the Wave Map and Yang-Mills
equations.

The Einstein equations of general relativity provide the main classical
description of evolution of the physical space-time continuum. The study of
mathematical and physical phenomena arising in general relativity is of the
fundamental importance. While the physical understanding of the subject has made
rapid advancement and generated a number of outstanding conjectures, the
rigorous mathematical picture has yet to emerge. The latter fact is, to a large
extent, due to the highly nonlinear nature of the Einstein equations and a lack
of the mathematical tools to deal with it. The development of a satisfactory
mathematical approach lies on the interface between analysis, geometry and
partial differential equations.
