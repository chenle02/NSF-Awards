Funds from this award will provide the advanced undergraduate student in
nutritional sciences with a combined research methods/research project
experience. Presently, the number of students that can enroll in "independent
research" is severely restricted due to limited available faculty time. This
award will create a course structure that will permit up to 12 students to
simultaneously participate in a complete research experience. This will be
accomplished by incorporating the theory and applications of a variety of
nutrition research methods and techniques into the investigation of relevant
nutritional biochemistry topics. The purchase of a ultracentrifuge, and
fluorescence spectrometer, in combination with existing Department equipment and
resources, will be used to 1) expand the students' understanding and
appreciation of the use of basic instrumentation in research, 2) expose
students, that have already completed biochemistry lab course, to more advanced
research techniques and concepts, 3) provide the Department with the necessary
equipment to permit undergraduates to complete an advanced research project in a
formal course setting, and ultimately 4) improve student interest in, and
qualifications for, research careers and graduate schools. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non- Federal sources.
