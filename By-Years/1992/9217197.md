This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in climate
dynamics and paleoclimatology and involves Douglas Martinson and William Howard
of Columbia University's Lamont- Doherty Geological Observatory and Laurent
Labeyrie of the Centre des Faibles Radioactivites, the French National Center
for Scientific Research. The investigators will study problems of Quaternary
climate dynamics and geochronology in Antarctic deep- sea cores. The objectives
of their research are to integrate and synthesize data sets and to advance
knowledge of the temporal and spatial patterns of physical climate and the
geochemical changes. Researchers in the U.S. and France have made significant
progress in understanding the role of the Southern Ocean in Quaternary climate
change and in modulating atmospheric chemistry. Deep-sea cores in the French and
U.S. collections are well suited for complementary studies. The French group has
extensive experience with cores which cover the last 160,000 years at
resolutions of 1000 years and less. Whereas, the U.S. researchers have analyzed
and studied paleoclimate records which cover the past 400,000 to 500,000 years
at resolutions of 3000-5000 years. Through the proposed program, the
investigators will have access to new French cores with a range of age intervals
and resolutions. Their efforts will place both the French and U.S. records on
common time scales, and provide a synthesis of the paleoecological and
geochemical records.
