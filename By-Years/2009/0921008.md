The recent introduction of empirical biological and genetic methods into
political science necessitates the need for training the larger political
science community in these new methods. However, despite large scale data
collection efforts, and the numerous publications in politics and genetics, very
few political scientists have been exposed to the specific methodologies needed
to review, evaluate, or take part in this new area of research. For established
faculty members interested in this growing area of political behavior there are
few avenues to pursue training. The central goal of this project therefore is to
offer training to political scientists in applied statistical genetics to be
used on political behavior analyses. Training political scientists in new
methods and theories that are unavailable in their training programs will
improve future scholarship and expand knowledge about the relationship between
genetics and political behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year the Behavior
Genetics Association hosts a workshop at the University of Colorado Boulder,
aimed at training junior and advanced faculty, across disciplines, in
introductory behavior genetics. This project would send 20, mostly mid career
associate professors or experienced assistant professors, to the 2010
International Workshop on Methodology of Twin and Family Studies. The project
will cover travel, lodging, and tuition for attendees, and a portion of the
expenses for one extra faculty member of the workshop (to accommodate the
overload). The long term impact of sending faculty to the workshop is that it
will undoubtedly spawn new interest in these areas, create a long term interest
in sending future students to BGA workshops, and generate more human capital in
the area of genetics and political behavior.
