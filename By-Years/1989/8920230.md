ABSTRACT This proposal from the University of Pennsylvania requests funds to
establish a Science Technology Center for Research in Cognitive Science. The
Director of the Center will be Professor Aravind K. Joshi. The Center for
Research in Cognitive Science unites a diverse and richly interconnected group
from many traditional disciplines (computer science, linguistics, mathematics,
philosophy, and psychology). The goal of the research is to understand the
processes and mechanisms by which human beings acquire knowledge about their
environment, store and retrieve that knowledge, communicate it to others, and
apply it to carry out actions and manipulate their environment. The research is
organized into three separate but highly interrelated themes: perception and
action, language learning, and language processing. Research in the area of
perception and action spans the processes involved in the first stages of visual
and auditory representation of spatial and spectral information, to higher order
representations of more complex attributes, to the storage and retrieval of such
representations by the organism as they are used in goal-oriented actions. The
study of language learning focuses on how children develop the abstract
representations of language on the basis of their visual and auditory
perceptions. The research in language processing combines investigation of
formal systems with investigation of computational models, all in the context of
empirical study of a wide range of natural languages. Significant features of
the perception and action research are its increasing fidelity to actual neural
computation and its sophisticated computational modeling and related potential
for contributing to artificial intelligence technology. The language learning
research has significant potential for technological spin-off in machine
learning and automatic acquisition of lexical and grammatical information for
language systems, crucial to the development of grammars sufficient for the
robust analysis of unconstrained text. And the language processing research will
have significant impact on the technological base for human- computer
interaction, in particular the design of natural language interfaces for data
base and expert systems and knowledge-rich systems in general. This Center will
stimulate enhanced activity in precollege education and in the development of
human resources.
