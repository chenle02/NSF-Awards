This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008.
The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for
the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology through
mentorship. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Irene G. Newton is "Investigating host genes that control growth of an
intracellular bacterial symbiont." The host institution for this research is
Tufts University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Ralph Isberg.

Wolbachia are parasitic bacteria that are estimated to inhabit the cells of
15-20% of insect species. Given that these bacteria are harmful to insect host
cells as they can change male hosts into females or even kill male offspring, it
is surprising to find Wolbachia regularly residing within host cells without
harming the host. This research is investigating how the host may limit the
growth of this bacterial symbiont. Using host cell lines, factors contributing
to control of parasite densities are being investigated, and the function of
proteins in the context of parasitism are further characterized in the whole
host organism.

The training objectives include techniques in intracellular bacterial lineages
and host interaction, handling both adult insects and cell lines harboring
Wolbachia, as well as RNA interference (RNAi). The results will impact research
on Wolbachia, and show insight on persistent symbiotic bacterial infections
through understanding why these invading bacterial lineages can be stably
maintained in the insect hosts without generating disease.
