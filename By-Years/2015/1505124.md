This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics,
including research projects in classical general relativity, cosmology, and
quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The main aim of this research is to
obtain a deeper understanding of the implications of Einstein's theory of
general relativity for phenomena involving black holes, strongly self-
gravitating stars, and the large scale behavior of our universe. The nature of
quantum phenomena in strong gravitational fields will also be explored. The
research will involve the direct participation of graduate students and a
postdoctoral research associate in all aspects of the research, and it will
thereby contribute to their training. The areas of research associated with this
award are of considerable interest to the public, and activities will be
undertaken, such as giving public lectures, that aid in the dissemination of
scientific knowledge to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research
topics to be investigated include: The development of a variational principle to
determine black hole and black brane stability and obtain exponential growth
rates in the case of instability; possible extensions of this variational
principle to rotating, relativistic stars; the use of canonical energy to
provide bounds on gravitational perturbations of black holes; an analysis of
black hole stability in asymptotically AdS spacetimes; the relationship between
extrema of entropy and stationarity in general relativity; the memory effect in
cosmological spacetimes; gravitational lensing effects on the CMB at very small
angular scales; self-consistent equations of motion for particles that take
account of second-order gravitational self-force corrections; the formulation of
interacting quantum field theory in curved spacetime via an operator product
expansion; and an analysis of the self-adjointness properties of nonlinear field
observables in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.
