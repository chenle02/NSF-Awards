Diary Note&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0819615, John
Carter, Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided for the 14th annual IEEE
Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-14). HPCA is one of
the top conferences in the field of computer architecture, with an acceptance
rate of under 20%. The conference addresses a broad spectrum of concerns,
including micro-architecture, cache and memory system design, parallel
architectures, embedded and reconfigurable architectures, I/O systems, and
performance evaluation. The conference includes four workshops and three
tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding in the amount of $10,000 is being
provided to support travel for 20-40 students to attend the conference. Priority
is given to student authors who are presenting papers, then to non-presenting
authors, and then to other students. Students must apply for the travel grant
and write a post-conference summary of their experience. Grants will fund or
partially fund travel to Salt Lake City and hotel costs during the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
