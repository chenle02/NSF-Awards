The investigator will study relations between the mod Z and rational cohomology
of a finite H-space. New information obtained by the investigator about the mod
Z cohomology should severely restrict the rational cohomology and also the
action of the Steenrod algebra. The investigator will also study various
relations between homotopy associativity and homotopy commutativity. These are
significant topics in algebraic topology, a discipline which seeks a calculus
for treating qualitative geometric properties such as connectedness and
knottedness. It underlies much important work in other fields, e.g. the analysis
of stability of solutions to differential equations.
