2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current electric power grid is
undergoing transition due to the rapid penetration of distributed energy
resources (DERs) including renewable energy systems, energy storage systems, and
electric vehicles. However, new cybersecurity threats arise. It is still
challenging to model and manage a cross-layered security perimeter in
multiparty-involved DER systems. Maloperation or malicious control of DERs will
be caused by advanced attackers (e.g., hackers and insiders) as seen the real-
world attack cases using the expanded attack surfaces. Besides, quantum era is
coming soon and it is anticipated that quantum computing attacks will be
possible within 5â€“10 years. In addition, many inverter-based DERs exposed to the
public are vulnerable to physical attacks. To address major threats facing the
cyber-physical DERs, this project aims to develop a resilient cyber-physical
security framework with a collaborative partnership across multidisciplinary
team members from two minority serving institutions, Texas A&amp;M University-
Kingsville and University of Illinois Chicago, and Sandia National Laboratories.
Moreover, this partnership supports an integrative research and education
program of the MSIs for training skilled next-generation workforce in the cyber-
physical power and energy systems areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal
of this project is to launch a major research direction to develop an innovative
resilient cyber-physical security framework that addresses imminent challenges
in both future cyber-physical security requirements and power engineering
designs and resilient operational strategies for DER-rich power systems.
Specific integrated research thrusts are as follows: (a) developing a blockchain
security governance model for DER systems operating under multiparty and system
of systems environments; (b) developing a quantum secure DER network by studying
a lightweight post quantum cryptography against quantum computing attacks; (c)
realizing DER inverter hardware hardening by investigating a new DER smart
inverter security design; and (d) achieving controlled resilience at grid edge
using event-triggered resilient self-learning control with retrieval strategy
ensuring reduced dependency and susceptibility to communication during security
breach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
