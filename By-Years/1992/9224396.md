The investigators will explore promising geologic deposits in the Madagascar for
the remains of Cretaceous mammals. If the expedition is successful, the
discoveries could revolutionize our understanding of: (1) the origin,
biogeography and evolution of the Madagascar mammalian fauna, which id highly
endemic and unbalanced; (2) the biogeography of mammals on other Gondwanan land
masses; (3) the pattern and timing of the separation of the Madagascar from the
African mainland; (4) the pattern and timing of mammals faunal migrations to (?
and from) the island. Of especial interest among the mammals in the origin and
evolution of Madagascar's unique primate (lemur) fauna, groups which are known
only from the sub-fossil Quaternary record.
