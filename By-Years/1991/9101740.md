This project concerns research on generalized special functions, defined on
matrix spaces and on domains of positivity. Part of the project will be to
develop the fine structure of the scalar- and operator-valued generalized
hypergeometric functions defined on general domains of positivity. The other
part of the project will be to develop applications of the generalized special
functions to the theory of total positivity and to mathematical statistics. This
research deals with the general foundations of the hypergeometric functions on
the space of matrices. The work has applications to combinatorics in the
classical invariant theory and the development of polynomial identities,
applications to physics in the hypergeometric functions in the matrix arguments
in quantum field theory, and applications to statistics in statistical inference
for the 'natural exponential family' of probability distributions.
