The area of research to be undertaken is in the general field of bridge
engineering. The first topics to be studied are: the estimation of prestress
losses in existing bridge members and the fatigue of tendon anchorages and
coupling joints. The results of the research will be useful to upgrade and
rehabilitate existing bridges.
