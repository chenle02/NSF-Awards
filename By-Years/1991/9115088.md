This award will support a workshop organized by Professor Chaim Poran of the
University of North Carolina, Charlotte, in collaboration with Professor E.
Retamal of the Institute for Research and Testing of Materials (IDIEM) at the
University of Chile. The aim of the workshop is to assemble U.S. and Chilean
experts in geotechnical earthquake engineering and strong ground motion, in
order to review critically the geotechnical instrumentation and associated
research needs for seismic hazard research in Chile. The workshop aims to
examine the risk of damage and loss of life associated with facilities in Chile,
which are constructed in highly seismic environments. It will also focus on the
urgent need for geotechnical instrumentation and research in populated areas and
at sites planned for development. The Chileans will benefit from U.S. expertise
in this field. The U.S. side will gain an opportunity to apply lessons learned
in Chile to promote earthquake hazard reduction efforts in the United States.
