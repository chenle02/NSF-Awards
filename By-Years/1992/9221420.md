This project is an ethnographic study of the process of cultural identity
construction by native Hawaiian activists involved in a movement for
sovereignty. During an eighteen month fieldwork period the researcher will
investigate two Hawaiian grassroots organizations. One is currently involved in
a land dispute over geothermal development, while the other is engaged in
representing the past at an archaeological site. The research will examine how
activists groups define and construct group identity on three levels public,
group, and private) through demonstrations, rituals, ceremonies, and
performances. This research will contribute to ongoing debates in anthropology
concerned with cultural constructions and objectification, representation, and
the invention of tradition.
