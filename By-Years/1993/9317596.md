9317596 Burns New X-ray, optical, and now radio observations have demonstrated
that clusters of galaxies are not simple related structures as once envisioned,
but rather dynamically evolving systems that have undergone dramatic
cluster/subcluster merging. This research will support a multiwavelength
observational study of clusters and cluster merging coupled with sophisticated
hydrodynamical and N-body numerical modelling, centered around radio galaxies in
clusters. It will investigate how mergers influence the creation and evolution
of wide-angle tailed radio sources, cluster radio halos, and steep-spectrum
radio galaxies. Numerical hydro/N-body simulations will be used to explore the
evolution of the gravitational potential well and the gas in clusters during
merging. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations will be used to model the cluster
gaseous environment including nonspherical cooling inflows and thermal
instabilities, and the propagation of radio jets through cluster atmospheres.
