9411728 KOCHER Transposons are discrete genetic elements which can move from
site to site in the genome. Transposition is a significant source of spontaneous
mutation in most, probably all, organisms. It is widely supposed that transposon
insertions in coding regions cause loss-of-function (knock-out) mutations. This
paradigm is the product of the genetic methods (detection of phenotypic mutants)
which have been used to monitor transposon activity. Recent discoveries suggest
that many transposons are efficiently spliced from transcribed messages, and so
do not induce phenotypic mutations. The proportion of transposon insertion which
have no visible phenotypic effect is unknown. Molecular methods will be used to
detect transposon insertions based on their DNA structure. A large number of
insertions in a target gene will be isolated, and each characterized to
determine its phenotype and pattern of splicing. The results will have general
implications for understanding the structure of eucaryotic genomes, as well as
applied benefits for the use of transposon tools in molecular biology, and the
detection and treatment of transposon-induced mutations.
