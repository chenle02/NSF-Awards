One four-channel acoustic emission system, one acoustic emission simulator and
two 80386-based computers will be used to study advanced ceramic matrix
composites and laminated safety glass. Acousto-ultrasonic stress wave factor
measurements of undamaged and damaged ceramic composites and laminated safety
glass will be related to their corresponding fracture strengths. The eventual
objective of these studies is to develop a nondestructive testing procedure for
ceramic composites and safety glass.
