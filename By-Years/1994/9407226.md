Stephan 9407226 Studies of genetic variation and differentiation of natural
populations are of critical importance for understanding the origin and patterns
of biological diversity. One cause of genetic differentiation between
populations is thought to be natural selection. In particular, directional
selection may lead to rapid differentiation between subpopulations in a large,
partially fragmented population. Drosophila ananassae, which exists in numerous
semi-isolated subpopulation, will be used for testing this hypothesis. The
degree of variation within and differentiation between subpopulations is
determined at the molecular level by methods of DNA technology. The impact of
selection (causing the observed pattern of variation and differentiation) is
then inferred from these data by computer simulation and mathematical-
statistical analyses. This study of genetic variation and differentiation is of
direct interest to biodiversity and to variation in response to conditions of
the environment.
