This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Hope College to acquire a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas that include the preparation and characterization of reduced mono-Cp
zirconium compounds for use in C-C bond forming reactions, the use of chiral
tin(II) complexes for asymmetric syntheses, the synthesis of derivatives of
poly(m-xylylene) to investigate the thermal processing of coal, the preparation
of novel polymeric material, and the use of enzymes for the synthesis of
asymmetric lactones. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology.
