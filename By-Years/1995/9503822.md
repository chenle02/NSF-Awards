The value of many important applications of survey data in academic research and
public policy-making hinges on the accuracy of the assessments provided. This
Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will collect data from the 1994
state-wide elections in Ohio as part of a field experiment to examine the impact
of questionnaire format on the predictive value of mail surveys versus telephone
interview methods for forecasting election results. Previous analyses of
statewide elections in Ohio have demonstrated that self-administered mail
surveys provide more accurate forecasts than telephone surveys. One possible
explanation for this surprising result is that the mail surveys employed a
different questionnaire format than the telephone surveys. This research will
examine the impact of questionnaire format on accuracy by manipulating the form
of the questionnaire administered by both mail and telephone modes immediately
prior to the 1994 Ohio elections. In addition, this research will explore the
impact of enhanced call-backs to telephone respondents on accuracy. This
research effort should both advance basic survey measurement theory and provide
a set of practical recommendations to analysts interested in maximizing
measurement accuracy.
