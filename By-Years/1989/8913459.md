The PI proposed to examine short period GaAs/A1As quantum well, with emphasis in
the type I to type II transition. Two related structures will be examined. (i)
GaAs/A1GaAs quantum wells in which the conduction subband separation is tuned in
the infrared, by the presence of a narrow barrier grown at the center of the
well. (ii) Shallow GaAs/A1GaAs quantum well structures in which the application
of an external magnetic field will tune the electronic states outside the GaAs
layers. The proposed research will be carried out in collaboration with Dr.
Mitra Dutta (ETDL). The samples will be grown at the U.S. Army ETDL facility
using MBE. A graduate student from SUNY will travel to ETDL and participate in
the TEM characterization of the structures.
