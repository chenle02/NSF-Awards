This award is for a planning grant to determine the interest of industry in
joining a satellite I/UCRC to the established I/UCRC for Optoelectronic
Circuitry presently in operation at the University of Arizona. This satellite
I/UCRC is planned for the University of Maryland and will complement the
activities of the I/UCRC at the University of Arizona. The focus of the proposed
I/UCRC at the University of Maryland will be Optoelectronic interconnect and
packaging. The Program Director recommends an award of $10,000 for one year be
awarded to the University of Maryland for the planning grant.
