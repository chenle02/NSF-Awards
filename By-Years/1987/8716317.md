This project will study the processing of stable superconducting thin films of
yttrium-barium-copper oxide and its rare-earth analogues. The work will be based
on a new laser-driven vapor deposition method for preparing superconducting thin
films. The focus of the work will be maximizing the critical superconducting
current and on stabilizing the thin films of yttrium-barium-copper oxide.
