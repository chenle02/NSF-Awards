This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on
developing novel network routing techniques that provide power-conserving,
latency-minimized, throughput-maximized data delivery in mobile ad-hoc network
(MANET) environments. It is well known that existing shortest path algorithms
used for optimal routing tend to yield routing topologies, where a small number
of the available paths and the available network nodes are heavily used. This
tendency induces both path contention (and associated increased latency and
reduced throughput) and disproportionately heavy loads on a small number of
critical nodes (which yields premature ad hoc network failure when the batteries
on one of those critical nodes become drained). The approach introduces a
retroactive accounting mechanism in the core dynamic programming-based shortest
path algorithm to establish balanced, parallel pathways through a MANET in order
to avoid these problems. Preliminary results using a pair of crossing flows have
shown a factor of two improvements in throughput and latency, and a factor of
three improvements in network lifetime. The key objectives for this effort are
exploring the performance bounds of this approach on a larger scale, where the
investigative team expects the differences between traditional techniques and
the proposed approach to emerge as even greater than they are now.

The commercial goal for this effort is developing a highly responsive,
critically needed, enabling technology to provide situational awareness for the
first responders and emergency management teams in large-scale emergencies and
crisis situations. The proposed effort directly supports the ongoing thrust into
this commercial area, which provides a natural conduit for technology
transition. Standardization of this technology, as needed for interoperability,
will also lead to licensing opportunities with other suppliers.
