This award provides funds to improve the imputation method used by the Bureau of
the Census for the annual survey of research and development spending by U.S.
industry. It has been several years since some companies have reported their
basic research, applied research, and development spending separately. Changes
in the imputation are necessary to reflect current spending patterns. New data,
tables, and diskettes will be produced for 1986 through the present.
