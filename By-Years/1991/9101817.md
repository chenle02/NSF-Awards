This research is concerned with the noncommutative differential geometry of the
deformations of commutative algebras; algebras of differential operators;
symbols of pseudo-differential operators; coordinate algebras of quantum groups
and spaces; and differential operators on quantum manifolds. The principal
investigator will develop a Riemann-Roch theorem for quantum manifolds through
his work on the cyclic homology theory of quantum groups and spaces.
Applications of these results to arithmetic and conformal quantum field theory
will also be explored. The research in this project is an outgrowth of calculus
on manifolds. Roughly speaking, manifolds are surfaces and their higher-
dimensional analogues. Differential operators, which come from calculus, see the
manifold only in small pieces, but nevertheless contain information about its
overall shape and conformation. One strategy for extracting this sort of
information from differential operators involves assembling the operators into
algebraic structures and then using algebraic machinery. This project is
concerned with the development of this machinery.
