A torsional Kolsky (split-Hopkinson) bar will be used to investigate the
behavior of elastohydrodynamic lubricants which are subjected to high shear
rates while they are in the glassy state. Short duration shear stress pulses
will be used and the lubricant will be maintained below its glass transition
temperature for the hydrostatic pressure in question. The effects of temperature
and shear rate will be studied. The results will be used to model the
fundamental behavior of hydrodynamic lubricants.
