The conferences on Stochastic Processes and their Applications have become the
principal annual forum for scientists studying stochastic processes and their
applications. The twentieth meeting will be held in June, 1991 in Israel, under
the auspices of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and
Probability. This grant will partially support about eight US invited speakers
and ten young researchers, including graduate students. The atmosphere of this
conference series has been very conducive to interaction between new researchers
and established senior scientists. Participation in this conference should have
a significant, positive impact on the development of research careers.
