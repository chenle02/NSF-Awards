A study to determine the feasibility of depositing photochromic-polymer coatings
is performed. Because it has been proven possible to deposit intrinsically-
colored-polymer coatings and because the system so well behaves the physics of
colloidal chemistry, an attempt is made to extend the science of photochromic
materials. The program is designed to demonstrate the science of photochromic
materials. The program is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of a
photochromic-polymer coating and then optimize the colloid-particle size and
density in the host polymer based upon system time for reversibility and light
absorption in the dark mode. A hybrid-solid-deposition process is proposed which
involves depositing the polymer material by plasma polymerization and depositing
the photochromic material by thermal evaporation from a thermally-shielded
source.
