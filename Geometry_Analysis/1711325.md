This project investigates topics at the confluence of geometric analysis,
topology, and mathematical physics. The overarching goal is to develop and
relate the analysis and topology of singular geometric objects. Many questions
in geometry and related areas of physics, such as general relativity and
holography, involve singular spaces and can be profitably understood by
introducing smooth manifolds with corners, which capture the nature of
singularities. Often one can recast the questions in a manner adapted to the
manifold with corners and subsequently apply a toolbox of strong techniques
known as "geometric microlocal analysis." One aspect of this project is to
contribute to the development and application of these techniques to a large
class of singular spaces (stratified spaces), allowing analytic tools to be
brought to bear on algebraic and topological questions. Another aspect of the
project is to promote the entry of new investigators into this active area of
research. The investigator will further develop a research monograph on the
subject and organize courses and conferences to disseminate these techniques and
results. An important example of a question at the confluence of geometric
analysis, topology, and mathematical physics is to understand the signature of
stratified spaces, such as those arising as the zeros of polynomials in several
variables. The investigator and collaborators have extended the class of spaces
on which the signature can be understood analytically and have shown that it
satisfies some of the main properties of the signatures of smooth spaces. In
this project explicit formulae will be established for the signature and its
twisted analogues. The project also aims to develop a topological surgery theory
for singular spaces and show that the signature operator naturally defines maps
from this sequence. Other projects involve understanding an invariant of
representations of the fundamental group of a locally symmetric space by
changing the usual algebraic perspective to a geometric one.
