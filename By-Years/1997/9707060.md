Koester Columbia University This workshop will bring together Russian, American,
German, and Canadian researchers who have been studying the environments and
cultures of the Kamchatka peninsula on the Russian far east coast. Until 1991
this area was closed to foreign researchers and restricted for Soviet citizens.
There has been no organized opportunity for these researchers to meet, share
results, or plan cooperative projects. The results of the workshop should help
avoid redundancy in the research designs being planned and executed, lead to
enhancement of data gathering and sharing, and provide greater opportunity for
comparative research.
