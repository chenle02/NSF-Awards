This project establishes a power electronics laboratory in support of the
institutions coursework in power semiconductor electronics. This allows the
students to expand their knowledge while at the same time gain "hands-on"
experience. The laboratory experience addresses semiconductors and their
characteristics, power conversion, DC and AC motor drives, and study of circuits
using microprocessors and smart power circuits. The equipment includes IBM
compatible computers, oscilloscopes, color plotters spectrum analyzers, and
supporting electronic measuring equipment. The institution is providing matching
funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the
Foundation.
