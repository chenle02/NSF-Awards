Funds are requested in support of a research conference for the summer of 1989
on the subject of signal perception and transduction in higher plants to be
organized by the Phytochemical Society of Europe and held at the Universite Paul
Sabatier, Toulouse, France. The area of second messengers currently is one of
the most rapidly growing areas in plant biology. Our goal is to bring together
investigators in the area of plant second messengers worldwide to discuss
critically the second messenger concept in plants. Since plants are immobile, it
is expected that they have developed specific strategies that allow them to
resist sudden changes in their external environment. Better knowledge of these
processes is one of the major goals for plant improvement worldwide. For
example, polyphosphoinositides have quite clearly been shown to occur in plants
and to be modulated under certain developmental conditions. However, a second
messenger role remains to be proven for plants and the entire field of second
messengers is certainly very much in need of critical evaluation. The conference
will be designed to foster interaction among participants with a view toward the
emergence of new paradigms for second messengers in plants, and their role in
plant growth and development and applications to crop improvement.
