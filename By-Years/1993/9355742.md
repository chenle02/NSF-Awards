GET REAL The Get Real! science strand will model and reinforce positive
attitudes towards,and involve in, science and technology. It will seek to affirm
for children the value of their ideas, and the importance of asking Why? It will
tell stories about kids involved in science-related activities (such as science
camps, inventors' fairs and wildlife rehabilitation programs), and connect
science concepts to children's known experiences and activities. These ideas are
basic to constructivism-that people grow based on what they already understand,
adding levels of knowledge-and are central to Get Real! It will enforce viewers'
active connection to the science content by making suggestions for projects to
get involved with, and by encouraging children to discuss and question their
knowledge of science and the world around them. We will also direct students to
appropriate informal science education organizations (such as science centers
and zoos) and to their teachers, for further discussion and information.
(Teachers guides will be developed as part of this project.) ***
