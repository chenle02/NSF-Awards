ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Siu, Yum-Tong&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
DMS-0204043&lt;br/&gt;Institution: American Institute of
Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A conference at Princeton
University will be held in September 2002 to&lt;br/&gt;study geometric
applications of D-bar estimates which have appeared in the&lt;br/&gt;past
decade. The conference will bring together researchers in
D-bar&lt;br/&gt;estimates and mathematicians in related fields to survey the
techniques&lt;br/&gt;and problems of D-bar estimates and their geometric
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One special feature of the conference is an
emphasis on the participation&lt;br/&gt;of young and women mathematicians.
Moreover, for the benefit of young&lt;br/&gt;researchers (and mathematicians in
other fields) interested in learning&lt;br/&gt;to get into the topics of the
conference, a formal session of open problems&lt;br/&gt;is planned for the
conference and, after the conference, a website will be&lt;br/&gt;put together
and maintained under the umbrella website of the American&lt;br/&gt;Institute of
Mathematics (http://www.aimath.org).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
