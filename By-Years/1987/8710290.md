The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
will be used to isolate ADH2 and ADH4 amplifications in a single selection step
and estimate primary amplification rates for ADH2 and ADH4. A duplication of
ADH2 (Paquin and Williamson, unpublished data) and an amplification of ADH4
(Walton, Paquin, Kaneko and Williamson, 1986) have been isolated. The ADH
system, in conjunction with the tools of genetics and molecular biology
available in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, will provide a unique opportunity to
investigate primary amplification mechanisms at the single cell level in a
simple, eukaryotic organism. An understanding of the mechanisms utilized for
gene amplification is of obvious fundamental importance but there are also
practical ramifications. There have been demonstrations that in some cases the
acquisition of drug resistance is the result of gene duplication. It is also
true that in other examples, the phenotype of an organism is related to the
number of gene copies. Thus, insight into the mechanisms involved can suggest
approaches to practical problems as well as increasing our understanding of
genetic mechanisms.
