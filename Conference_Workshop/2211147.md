This award supports travel for US-based participants in the conference ?New
Developments in Four Dimensions? held at the University of Victoria, British
Columbia, Canada, during June 13-17, 2022. The meeting will focus on the branch
of low-dimensional topology concerned with understanding four-dimensional
manifolds. Low-dimensional topology is the mathematical study of spaces
(manifolds) of dimension two, three, and four. Two-dimensional and three-
dimensional spaces are intuitive: The surfaces of tables, bagels, or the earth
are all examples of two-dimensional spaces and the spatial world we inhabit and
the inside of a bagel are examples of three-dimensional spaces. Four-dimensional
spaces are considerably more difficult to imagine (and study) with the most
salient example being the spacetime conceptualization of the universe. In this
sense, four-dimensional topology is the study of the possible shapes that our
physical universe might realize. Surfaces have been well-studied classically,
and major advances in the late 1900s and early 2000s have given researchers a
clear understanding of three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds
represent the unknown frontier of low-dimensional topology, and there remain
myriad open conjectures and unanswered question in this field of mathematics.

There has been an explosion of activity within four-dimensional topology in the
last few years, particularly in the study of diffeomorphism groups of four-
manifolds, the construction and detection of exotic structures and embeddings,
and the introduction of trisections as a new tool in the field. The purpose of
this conference is to gather an international group of experts to explore these
recent developments in the study of four-dimensional manifolds, disseminate
contemporary research in the field, promote the research of early-career
mathematicians working in the field, include and promote the research of
mathematicians from underrepresented groups, and to give a venue for new
collaborations to occur and old collaborations to continue.
