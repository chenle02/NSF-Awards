9452395 Johnson The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a FT-IR for use in
sophomore organic chemistry laboratories and higher level courses including
undergraduate research. In addition to the characteristic uses in identifying
functional groups and characterizing products, following reaction progress,
studying kinetics and for obtaining data to calculate force constants and bond
lengths the instrument is being used in environmental studies and in
undergraduate research program. Among the research activities is the long term
monitoring of mountain lakes, analyzing dye residues in textile water treatment
effluents, and air pollution studies.
