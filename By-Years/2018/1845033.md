The study of conformal geometry has always been a fundamental subject in
differential geometry. It has a tight relationship to partial differential
equations and mathematical physics. In this research project, the PI will
conduct study on conformal invariants, and investigate important roles of
conformal invariants in geometric inequalities. The PI also plans to push the
theory to the field of Cauchy-Riemann geometry, another important field of
differential geometry. The award also includes support for educational
activities for students of different academic levels. The PI will organize the
first-year graduate mini-courses in geometric analysis, create research programs
for undergraduate students, and expand the MADGS workshop to increase the
participation of graduate students, especially of those from underrepresented
groups. Those activities aim to provide opportunities to early career
researchers and encourage their collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
direction of this research project is to understand conformal invariants and how
they control the asymptotic behavior at the ends of noncompact manifolds, and
thus affect geometric inequalities including the isoperimetric inequality.
Another direction is to study the relationship between conformal invariants and
Monge-Ampere equations, one of the most important equations that arises
naturally in mathematics and physics. The PI will continue her work on the
construction of fully nonlinear functionals so that they shed light on both
geometric and analytic features of the equation. The methods will incorporate
those from conformal geometry, harmonic analysis and partial differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
