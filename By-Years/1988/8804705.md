This exploratory project will undertake to build and test a radial flow
chromatograph, and to show the feasibility of this new technique. A pancake-
shaped bed, 3-inch diameter and approximately 1/2-inch thick, will be
constructed. The bed will be packed with 300 mesh fine particles of activated
alumina compacted under 5000 psi pressure. The chromatographic response from the
bed (upon the challenge of a pulse of adsorbate) will be compared with that from
an axial flow column. These data will be used to judge the feasibility and, if
positive, the performance of large radial flow chromatograph. This innovation
could lead to the practical development of (1) compact hand-held chromatograph,
and (2) high-performance, small-size (hence savings in sorbent and equipment
cost) chromatograph for industrial applications.
