The objective of this research is to develop a Peierls perspective on the
atomic-friction mechanisms from the spatiotemporal evolution of interface defect
structures. Despite a quantitative experimental capability of examining
nanoscale frictional behavior, existing modeling efforts, such as Tomlinson-type
models or molecular simulations, are still unable to quantitatively explain the
effects of lattice incommensurability, rate- and temperature-dependence, etc. A
Peierls-type framework will be established to replace singular defect model by
the inhomogeneous slip field on the interface. Experimental observations, such
as structural lubricity, frictional anisotropy, and contact size dependence, can
be explained as a consequence of initiation and multiplication of interface
dislocations and their interactions with pre-existing interface defects. From
the kinetics standpoint, the proposed work will examine the spatially
inhomogeneous nature of the rate-determining process, accurately calculate the
activation energy with respect to the interface defects, and thus explain the
thermally activated frictional behavior.

The uniqueness of the proposed work, as compared to a vast literature in this
field, is the ability to quantitatively predict the atomic processes that govern
the spatiotemporal evolution of the interface defects during friction. This
viewpoint enables quantitative experimental comparisons and resolves drawbacks
and difficulties of existing modeling efforts. It will open a broad door for
both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in a multi-disciplinary
education/research environment, and thus advances and enhances focused research
and education activities in the PI?s institute. The PI will develop new
instructional materials and hands-on computational demonstrations for
incorporation into a variety of outreach and diversity programs, and thus
promote the interests of high school and college students in science and
engineering careers, as well as the engagement of public awareness.
