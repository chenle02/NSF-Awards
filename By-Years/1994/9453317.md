This Presidential Faculty Fellow award funds research and teaching activity of a
neuroscientist. Research concentrates on how large assemblies of neurons
function, using as an the retina of the eye as a model system to study the
complex interactions for collective signaling. Novel instrumentation is used to
monitor the simultaneous activity of many nerve cells at once, to determine how
a visual image is processed into a signal to be sent to the brain by neural
pathways to visual centers. The role of correlated neural activity also appears
to be important in development of a properly functional retina, and these
studies explore how such mechanisms may be important in the adult retina.
Teaching emphasizes to undergraduates and to graduates how the nervous system
acts to integrate complex functions, with an outreach component into the local
high schools. The impact of this project will be strong on visual neuroscience
and computational neuroscience, and likely to other areas of brain information
processing; the teaching component will be important to the scientific
development of students over a wide range of ages and potential careers.
