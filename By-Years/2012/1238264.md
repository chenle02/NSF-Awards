&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center for Freeform Optics aims to advance
research and education on the science, engineering and applications of freeform
optics through a dedicated, continuing industrial partnership. The research
efforts will be anchored by the University of Rochester (UR) as the lead
institution, partnered with the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed Center will focus on three main research thrusts that include:
Fundamentals of Freeform Optics, Advanced Materials for Fabrication and
Manufacturing of Freeform Optics, and Optical Testing for Freeform Optics. This
Center constitutes a unique research environment combining the strengths of
three top-tier research universities with the experiences, insights, and needs
of international industrial talent specialized in building systems supporting
the manufacturing, integration, and implementation of advanced optical systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical systems with freeform surfaces will usher in the
next generation of innovation in sensing, imaging, visualization and diagnostic
instrumentation by directing light in not 1-D, but 3-D. Novel designs with 3-D
light paths will allow compact optical systems to replace the current in-line
designs (packaged by flat fold mirrors) using freeform optics. Applications are
emerging that require innovative surface geometries with tight form-accuracy to
increase imaging and sensing capabilities and overall optical performance. The
participating universities in CeFO are dedicated to the recruitment and
retention of female and students from under-represented groups. The aggressive
recruitment of students from under-represented groups is one of the Center's top
priorities. The primary goal of active student involvement in the Center's
research activities is to accelerate the understanding of this new horizon in
optical technology by advancing research and education on the engineering and
science of freeform optics. Students will work directly with Center industrial
members to communicate and transfer key enabling technologies including design,
fabrication, assembly, testing, and integration.
