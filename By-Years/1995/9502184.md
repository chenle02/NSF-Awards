9502184 Przybycien This project is on research to study protein aggregation. One
area of focus is on the structural characterization of protein aggregates. This
will include the development of new information on the mechanism of aggregate
formation, the impact of environmental conditions or process parameters on
aggregation, and the ease of reconstitution of aggregates. Another area of focus
is on the identification of specific interaction sites in protein aggregates.
The ultimate goal is to obtain predictive ability for the propensity of proteins
to aggregate and protein- specific strategies for the promotion or inhibition of
aggregation in cellular, production and storage environments. In addition to
this research activity, the investigator will enhance education by engaging in
activities to produce instructional innovation, curricular synergy, and
educational excitement. ***
