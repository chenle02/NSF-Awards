This project will equip the polymers and coatings laboratory with
instrumentation for modern thermal analysis. The Chemistry Department has
developed a new undergraduate polymers and coatings concentration in the
chemistry major, including two new polymer laboratory courses and several new
lecture courses. The instrumentation will be used routinely by all students in
the concentration to characterize the polymers they synthesize, perform testing
on these polymers, and conduct research on new polymeric materials. This
instrumentation will also be used by advanced undergraduates from the Materials
Engineering Department in several materials testing and analysis laboratory
courses and in undergraduate research. A combination of differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) and thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) will be used so that all
types of polymers and coatings can be investigated.
