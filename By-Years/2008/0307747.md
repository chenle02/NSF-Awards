AST-0307747&lt;br/&gt;Sheth&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop a formalism
and physical models to describe the substructure and shapes of dark matter
halos. Analytic models have assumed that the mass in the universe is bound up in
halos which are both spherical and smooth, but numerical simulations now have
sufficient resolution to show that they are actually triaxial and rather lumpy.
This work will use gravitational lensing observations to constrain the small
scale end of the cosmological mass power spectrum, to constrain halo profiles,
and to interpret measurements of the cosmic shear field. It will support
modeling the luminosity function of galaxies and its evolution, predicting the
distribution of galaxies and gas in clusters, and the use of higher order
statistics to break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters associated
with measurements of two point statistics. The wide range of applications makes
this work a good unified framework within which to introduce graduate and
undergraduate students to topics in large-scale structure.&lt;br/&gt;***
