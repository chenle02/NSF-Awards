Under the direction of Dr. William Kretzschmar, Mr. Lamont Antieau will collect
linguistic data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct dialectology
research on Western American English with particular focus on Colorado due to
its status as the cultural center of the Rocky Mountain region. The project will
elicit speech from representative speakers of various parts of the state and
then analyze the linguistic forms found therein. A combination of tools used by
dialect geographers will inform the research (e.g., more traditional methods
like maps, as well as more recent innovations like computers and statistical
testing). The newer tools will enable researchers to examine all levels of
language, including syntax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has broad
significance. Since the collected speech will be transcribed and made publicly
available via the Linguistic Atlas website (http://us.english.uga.edu),
researchers will be able to use the data for a wide range of investigations into
language change. These include comparing the data collected for this project to
older data sets, and studying dialectal variation between Colorado and other
regions in the United States as well as variation within the Colorado corpus.
The interviews will elicit names for objects because this is an area in which
there is a great deal of variation between regions. So the data may also be
useful to anthropologists and historians. In addition to what the project will
teach us about the speech of Colorado and how it compares to speech elsewhere in
the United States, this research will contribute to a better understanding of
dialect in general and inform theoretical models of language and
culture.&lt;br/&gt;
