9358138 Ziegert This research project will consider the dual problems of
accuracy assessment and accuracy enhancement. In principle, if the positioning
errors at each location in the workspace of the machine are known in advance,
they can be corrected in software. To accomplish this, the causes of the errors
must be isolated and studied. These error sources include manufacturing
tolerances of the machine slides, deformations caused by heat, and deflections
due to gravity. Software based error correction offers a large potential
economic payback. Commodity grade machine tools may be able to achieve
substantially higher accuracy levels at a very modest cost, thus making them
competitive with more expensive machines specifically designed for high
precision work. Successful completion of this research project may help the US
machine tool companies to regain a competitive advantage.
