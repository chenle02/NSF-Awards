This research considers whether price guarantees can be used as market signals
to coordinate prices and maintain monopoly level prices in the market. The
researchers have developed a data set on grocery prices of five stores, one of
which undertook to match the prices of another store, and initial results
indicate that price matching guarantees might lead to a higher degree of
collusion. The possible collusive effect of price guarantees is an important
research question and could have major implications for anti trust policy and
the structure of competition in packaged consumer goods industry.
