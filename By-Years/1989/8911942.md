Active computer vision exploits control of foveation, focus, and stereo vergence
to generate surface maps of complex scenes, in much the same way that humans
control gaze direction, lens deformation, and eye vergence. This grant will
support two graduate students developing algorithms for real-time control of an
active stereo range-mapping system. The work is motivated by Sperling's model of
biological vision, and will augment a testbed system in which plausible
techniques of active vision may be tested.
