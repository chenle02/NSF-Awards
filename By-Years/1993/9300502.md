This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG) submitted in response to NSF 92-90,
Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and
Engineering. The objective of this project is to conduct preliminary research on
the suitability of using fluidized bed combustion ash produced during processing
of hazardous wastes as a binder for solidification and stabilization of
resultant metal-bearing sludges. Conclusions from this study are expected to be
used in formulating a project to investigate the mechanisms of metal-fixation by
the ash from the fluidized bed combustion process. These mechanisms are expected
to provide insight into the rate at which metals would leach from landfills and
the long-term fate of the metals when placed in landfills.
