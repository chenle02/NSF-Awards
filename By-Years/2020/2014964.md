The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve job-site safety of dry-stacking
installation of masonry walls without binding mortar through the use of novel
Aerated Interlocking Masonry Units (AIMU). The AIMU multi-component wall system
combines the advantages of wood and those of concrete and is potentially
applicable for mid-rise multi-family housing, a key component of affordable
housing stock in the US and worldwide. These AIMUs can be laid quickly, safely,
and accurately, reducing time and labor for cost-effective construction in the
US and globally. The proposed construction platform will improve durability and
offer lower lifetime costs than standard wood-based wall
construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase I project will further develop a construction technology using
masonry blocks via dry-stacking without binding mortar. Aerated Interlocking
Masonry Units (AIMU) are made of cellular lightweight concrete (CLC) and an
activated adhesion. The proposed work will conduct testing to confirm the AIMU's
ability to fill incursions and block irregularities, evaluate interfacial shear
resistance between the interlocking features, and evaluate the interfacial
adhesion activated through pressure or moisture. These fundamental properties
are critical to resolving the primary barriers for translation of dry-stack
masonry construction technology. The project will also demonstrate rapid outdoor
dry-stacking AIMU installation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
