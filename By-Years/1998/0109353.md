This proposal requests support for the U.S. involvement in the operations of an
optical high-resolution spectrometer at the University of Canterbury's Mount
John Astronomical Observatory (44 S, South Island, New Zealand), and is part of
the US/NZ Cooperative Science Program. Mount John is a member of the Austral
Alliance, i.e. the Southern Hemisphere's international collaborative program for
the investigation of the austral upper atmosphere, and includes optical and
radar stations in New Zealand (Mount John and Birdlings Flat), Australia
(Beveridge and Adelaide) and Antarctica (South Pole, Scott Base, Mawson, Davis,
Syowa, Arrival Heights, and Halley Bay). Mount John is the only full-time
optical experiment at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes already in the process of
investigating the long-term mesospheric, lower-thermospheric and ionosphere
(MLTI) dynamics and thermodynamics. Further, when these proposed ground-based
observations are combined with observations from satellite-borne experiments, as
well as the results of both modeling and simulations, they will increase out
understanding and knowledge of the Southern Hemisphere's upper atmosphere.
