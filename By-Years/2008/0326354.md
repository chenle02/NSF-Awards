The purpose of this project is to make readily accessible seismic reflection
shot data, acquisition information needed for processing, stacked binary data
and images, and capabilities to locate these data with graphical and keyword
searches. The system will provide services by restoring old data, collecting
newly acquired data and preserving both for future use. Shot data, and some
processed data, will be served at Lamont Doherty Geological Observatory, and
processed data and seismic-specific search and display tools will be served by
the University of Texas.
