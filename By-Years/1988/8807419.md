This is a collaborative interdisciplinary program (with Yaacov Shapira at Tufts
University and Aaron Wold at Brown University) to study physics and crystal
chemistry of semimagnetic semiconductors, specifically manganese, iron, nickel
and cobalt- doped stannite crystals, II-VI compounds containing manganese and
iron, and manganese-chalcopyrites. Emphasis will be on large polaron effects in
stannites, metal-insulator transition, magnetism and polaron formation in iron-
alloys, nonlinear properties and novel states of mercury-cadmium-iron-selenium,
and crystal chemistry to determine how magnetic ions are incorporated in
covalently-bonded semiconductors. Experimental techniques will include Raman
scattering, magnetoreflectance, luminescence, magnetization, susceptibility,
electrical transport and nonlinear optics.
