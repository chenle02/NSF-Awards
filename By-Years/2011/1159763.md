Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1159763&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Adrienne R.
Minerick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological
Separations program supports the acquisition and installation of a BioForce Nano
eNablerTM Instrument to facilitate bioparticle and proteomics separation
research at Michigan Tech and in the Upper Peninsula region. The microprinting
tool will enable work by Professors Adrienne Minerick, Caryn Heldt, David
Shonnard, Wan Jin Jahng, and others. Specifically, we will explore high
sensitivity, high-resolution electrokinetic protein separations, molecular
recognition blood cell separations, optimizing cellulosic enzyme catalysis for
separations, and isolating proteomic biomarkers of retinal degenerative disease.
The Nano eNablerTM is essential equipment infrastructure for the Biotechnology
Research community (BRC) and will be utilized to make innovative contributions
to chemical and biological separations. The PI's proposed projects all harness
the versatile, femtoliter printing of biological materials to defined locations
with nanoscale accuracy offered by the Nano eNablerTM. The potential bioparticle
separations applications range from hemoglobin variant diagnosis, exploiting
peptides for specialty viral/pathogen capture, optimizing cellulase activity and
separations, to proteome isolations and are fully compatible with fluorescence
or quantum dot-based indicators. Common advantages with each application include
significantly smaller sample consumption, higher sensitivity, lower detection
limits, as well as faster and higher separation efficiencies. This shared
instrumentation will enable the PI's research to meet the demand in the
scientific and industrial communities for smaller scale bioseparations, with
concurrent simpler preparation, simpler operation, and versatility.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nano eNablerTM will transform research capabilities,
enhance research graduate and undergraduate student education and training, and
augment course instruction. The PIs have strong mentoring track records and are
committed to actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from
underrepresented groups to participate in research activities. Minerick's
surface isoelectric focusing research has the potential to impact protein
separations, hemoglobinopathy diagnosis, and thus health care practices on a
global scale and contributes to the philosophies of sustainability by decreasing
resource utilization for chemical analysis. The PI team has a strong publication
record of intellectual contributions in their respective fields and acquisition
of this instrument will facilitate innovative and ongoing bioseparations
research projects.
