MESSENGERS is a distributed programming system based on the principles of self-
migrating threads, which carry their own identity and behavior in the form of
programs. This enables them to navigate freely in the underlying computational
network, communicate with one another, and invoke native- mode C functions. Thus
MESSENGERS is a general coordination paradigm for distributed applications
development. Its main advantages are dynamic composability of applications,
enabling an interactive and incremental development of arbitrarily extensible
applications, and the ability to exploit clusters of heterogeneous workstations.
This project investigates the capabilities of this new technology primarily in
the context of individual-based simulation, that is, simulation where the
application is modeled as a collection of autonomous individuals (e.g. particles
in physics), each having its own state and behavior. It focuses on issues of
performance and scalability by developing new techniques for load balancing and
dynamic resource utilization that exploit the self-migration nature of the
subcomputations.
