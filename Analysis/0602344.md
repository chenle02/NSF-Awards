Abstract Zhou

This proposal project covers, perturbation theory for focusing NLS, multiple
orthogonal polynomials, oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems with nonanalytic
phase, zero dispersion of focusing NLS, orthogonal rational functions, and
Janossy densities in the random matrix theory. All these problems require
Riemann-Hilbert problem techniques to study.

This project is an effort to develop further the analytic aspects and the
interdisciplinary applications of the fruitful field of the Riemann--Hilbert
problem method, with the balance between its intellectual and educational
merits. The study of Riemann--Hilbert problem has applications in several areas
of mathematics and mathematical physics, including partial differential
equations, statistical mechanics and combinatorics.
