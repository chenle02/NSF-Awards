The main goal of this research in low- and middle-level computer vision is to
develop new algorithms for the acquisition of 3-D sensory data for robotic-
vision systems. The work will investigate: -- new passive vision techniques for
obtaining surface orientation and curvature information about surfaces in the
3-D world; candidate techniques include: polarization-based stereo, color
stereo, direct photometric curvature calculation, and shape-from-specularity --
improvements in both the accuracy and efficiency of stereo-matching and surface-
reconstruction techniques from depth and orientation information. These
improvements will result from a theoretically unified treatment of matching,
surface reconstruction, and surface segmentation. The work will include
theoretical analysis and experimental verification. It differs from previous
research in that the new algorithms are to be derived from the general theories
of stereo processes, which are to be finalized as part of this research. The new
algorithms will either use different types of information (e.g., images under
varied source polarization) or treat standard information under more-realistic
assumptions (e.g., that the disparity surfaces should be smooth, but not
necessarily constant or planar).
