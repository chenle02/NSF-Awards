The aim of this project is to increase the relatively low usage of computers in
the entire range of upper level physics courses taken by undergraduate physics
majors at schools across the nation. A group of 27 physicists has been assembled
to write computer software and associate texts for use in nine advanced
undergraduate physics courses. The software is intended for use by instructors
during in-class demonstrations and by individual students outside of class. It
will be disseminated in the form of nine short texts and accompanying diskettes
by the publisher John Wiley and Sons. The project has to-date received NSF
yearly funding since August 1990.
