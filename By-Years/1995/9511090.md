between movements in the macroeconomy and changes in the economic behavior and
well-being of low-income populations. In particular, a growing research
literature has investigated the relationship between poverty, inequality, and
aggregate economic growth. Less studied has been the relationship between
economic growth and the use of public assistance programs. Recent trends
indicate the value of such research, however. Public assistance caseloads
exploded in the early 1990s. While at first this was ascribed to the economic
slowdown and the rise in unemployment, the increase in program participation was
unduly large relative to the magnitude of unemployment changes, and caseloads
did not fall rapidly once unemployment began to decline. his project studies the
determinants of public assistance caseloads and benefit expenditures over time,
bringing together the literature focusing on individual decisions to participate
in public assistance, and the literature that investigates the role of the
macroeconomy on poverty and inequality. This project will focus on four primary
questions: How are public assistance caseloads and benefit expenditures related
to macroeconomic movements and how has this changed over time? How have changing
demographics among low-income families affected these trends? 1. How have
changes in program eligibility and benefit rules impacted public assistance
usage? 2. How do these three factors relate to changes in eligibility versus
changes in take-up rates among the eligible?
