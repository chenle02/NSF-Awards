This grant will support an assessment of information technologies relative to
on-line voting and ballot design. This is a particularly relevant topic given
the confusing processes and outcomes of the 2000 national elections. The project
will bring together social/political scientists with computing/information
scientists to study ability of voters to accurately express their intentions,
voter ease in completing ballots, user interfaces, and impact on voter turnout.
A variety of data collections methods will be used: laboratory experiments,
expert reviews, and field tests. The project will be guided by interactions with
practitioners who administer voting process, and with companies which build and
market electronic voting machines.
