Bunge &lt;br/&gt;0106651 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geodynamicists have made
substantial progress over the past years in developing sophisticated mantle
convection models, including chemical heterogeneity, temperature and strain-rate
dependent rheology, realistic 3-D spherical shell geometry and convective vigor
that is nearly Earthlike. In to apply the new modeling capability to study the
flow history of Earth's mantle, mantle convection models must be properly
initialized, i.e. one must constrain initial conditions into the past. This is
an inverse problem and the PI proposes to evaluate the potential of adjoint
fluid dynamic inverse theory to track mantle heterogeneity back into the
relatively recent Cenozoic and Mesozoic history of our planet. To this end, a
novel 3-D spherical high-resolution adjoint model of mantle convection will be
developed. The PI will apply the adjoint method in idealized mantle convection
models for time periods of less than one convective overturn, in order to
explore the feasibility of the method to estimate unknown initial conditions
back in time. The PI will constrain unknown initial conditions in mantle
convection calculation through a series of coupled forward-in-time and adjoint
backward-in-time integrations, a difficult task facilitated by the rapid advance
in supercomputer capabilities. The outcome of the work will be to explore the
utility of adjoint fluid-dynamic inverse theory in retrieving flow structure
back in time in mantle convection models. (Code benchmark is available at
