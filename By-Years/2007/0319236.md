This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to use innovative
co-encapsulation processes to enhance infectivity and efficacy of the biocontrol
agent, Colletotrichum capsici, for control of the noxious weed "pitted morning
glory". The enhancing components to be examined in this project include
germination stimulants, conidia protectants, moisture retainers and nutrient
supplements that are encapsulated with conidia of C. capsici inside a sprayable
and biodegradable microcapsule. This co-encapsulation technology will lead to
commercial development of mycoherbicides and other biocontrol agents that are
expected to be economical, practical and biocompatible. The commercial
application of this project is in the area of weed control agents for use in
agriculture.
