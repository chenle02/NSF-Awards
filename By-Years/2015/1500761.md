Most of the biological diversity on Earth is thought to result from adaptive
radiation, an evolutionary phenomenon where many new species are rapidly formed
through colonization of and adaptation to new environments. The work of many
researchers over the last fifty years has resulted in an emerging understanding
of the broad-scale evolutionary patterns associated with adaptive radiation.
Despite these advances, we have little understanding of the genetic processes
that take place during adaptive radiation. For instance, it is not known how
often new mutations are uniquely favored in one environment alone versus being
beneficial to multiple species living in different habitats. This proposal
addresses this gap in our knowledge using one of the most iconic examples of
adaptive radiation, Anolis lizards from the West Indies. This research will
focus on two Anolis species that reside on tree trunks?one living in a hot, dry
environment, the other in a moist, cool forest. In a small area of the Dominican
Republic, these different habitats are immediately adjacent to one another.
Here, the two species interbreed and form hybrid offspring. These unique
circumstances provide an opportunity to identify what gene variants are
associated with adaptation to the two distinct environments and what variants
are beneficial to both species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the genomic
nature of adaptation in Anolis lizards, the co-investigators will use next-
generation sequencing technologies to collect transcriptome data from
individuals of each species as well as hybrids. The genotypes derived from this
sequencing will be used to perform genomic cline analyses, which identify
parental alleles that are over- and underrepresented among hybrids. The results
of genomic cline analyses will be combined with population genomic analyses to
identify the frequency of global and local adaptations and provide a first
insight into the microevolutionary processes associated with adaptive radiation.
