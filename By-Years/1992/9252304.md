The acquisition of a scanning electron microscope(SEM) will permit the
department to: (1) develop a new course on the theory and practice of scanning
electron microscopy, (2) to support and facilitate interactive student-faculty
research, and (3) to enrich and extend laboratory opportunities for students and
faculty in Cell Biology, Advanced Cell Physiology, Developmental Biology, and
Micropaleontology. The SEM will be central to a number of independent study
projects that range from changes in leukemia cell membrane morphology to the
microanatomy of spider web "silk". This project will augment an ongoing program
with a philosophy of providing curricular and research opportunities that
stimulate professionalism, encourage minority education, and maintain the
interests of students considering graduate study and careers in science.
