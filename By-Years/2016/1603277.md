The Langlands program is a mathematical framework that unifies questions in many
different areas of mathematics, especially number theory and linear algebra. The
traditional arithmetic Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty
years, and this research has resulted in significant applications to solving
classical Diophantine equations, for example, the proof of Fermat's last
theorem. The geometric Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under
rapid development thanks to powerful tools from algebraic geometry. This
geometric formulation has led to a precise conjecture known as the global
geometric Langlands conjecture that encodes deep connections between number
theory and geometry. This research project is devoted to verifying a refined
version of this conjecture.

In more detail, this project focuses on two topics in the general area of the
geometric Langlands program: verifying the global geometric Langlands conjecture
in the de Rham setting and duality for the Hitchin fibration. In previous work,
the investigator introduced a corrected formulation of the global geometric
Langlands conjecture, which led to a detailed roadmap towards the proof of the
conjecture. The first goal of the project is to verify the refined conjecture.
The second part of the project studies a new approach to the duality of the
Hitchin fibrations for Langlands dual groups based on the study of classical
limits of the Hecke functors.
