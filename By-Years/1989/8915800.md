This award provides funds for the continued development of X-ray fiber
diffraction techniques for structural analysis of macromolecular assemblies.
Typical such assemblies include virions, other nucleoprotein complexes, and
cytoskeletal filaments. The technique has been used for years and has already
played a key role in biology through, for example, the discovery of the
structure of DNA by Watson and Crick. However, there remain significant
challenges with respect to sample preparation and data analysis which these
studies will address. The use of X-rays to analyze molecular structure at the
atomic level has been key to the recent, rapid advance in our knowledge of the
structure of molecules of biological importance. Much of the information has
come from crystallographic studies in which the subject molecules are
crystallized from solution prior to the analysis. The use of fiber diffraction
techniques eliminates the need for this difficult, time consuming, and often
impossible task. However, because the methods for sample preparation and
analysis of large biological molecules are as yet poorly worked out, the fiber
diffraction techniques has not been widely adopted. Progress in development of
these methods can be expected to play an important role in understanding the
structure of large macromolecular assemblies, many of which are poorly suited to
analysis by more conventional analyses.
