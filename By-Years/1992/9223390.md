9223390 Miller Three recent developments lead to this proposal. 1. The
electrochemical preparation of a polymer with highly anisotropic conductivity.
2. The first example of self-assembly of ion- radicals into delocalized pi-
stacks in solution. 3. The formation of aromatic (not aliphatic) self-assembled
and Langmuir-Blodgett films. Using imides and their anion radicals, it is
proposed to construct three types of unusual materials: conducting polymer films
organized by pi-stacking; organized aromatic surface layers; and nanoscale
dendrimers with conducting surfaces. These materials will be studied using
electrochemistry, VIS, NIR, IR, XPS and ESR spectroscopy, grazing angle IR, VIS
NIR linear dichroism, X-ray diffraction, DSC and conductivity measurements. The
results promise to be significant in several regards. These new material types
have little or no precedent, and the intermolecular organization provided by pi-
stacking should provide unusual electrical and optical properties. It is
expected that fundamentally new approaches to the synthesis of anisotropic bulk
polymers and nanoscale materials will be revealed. ***
