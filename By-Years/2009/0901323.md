Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this effort are to develop
systematic understanding of dissipative solitons in fiber lasers, and to use
that understanding to design femtosecond-pulse lasers with unprecedented
performance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern femtosecond-pulse lasers are based on soliton
formation, in which nonlinear phase accumulation balances the effects of linear
group-velocity dispersion. A group from Cornell University will perform
theoretical and experimental studies of a new approach to the generation of
ultrashort optical pulses in lasers. The pulses are referred to as dissipative
solitons, which balance phase and amplitude changes as they traverse a laser
cavity. Research will investigate limits to the pulse energy and duration, and
the development of practical lasers for a range of applications. Theorists from
the University of Washington will collaborate in this effort.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissipative solitons are scientifically important as a new
example of a nonlinear wave. Fiber lasers offer an ideal setting to study them
systematically, and this should greatly increase our experimental knowledge of
dissipative solitons. Lasers based on dissipative solitons counter two decades
of conventional wisdom by generating femtosecond-duration pulses without
intracavity dispersion control or anomalous
dispersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact
of short-pulse fiber lasers has been limited, because their performance has
lagged behind that of solid-state lasers. Dissipative solitons fundamentally
allow order-of-magnitude increases in the pulse energy over the current best
fiber lasers. The resulting instruments will match or exceed the performance of
solid-state lasers while offering the advantages of fiber (the waveguide medium,
stability, and reduced cost ) and therefore should have major impact on
ultrafast science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the nonlinear
wave equations that underlie short-pulse propagation, the concepts developed in
this project will be relevant to topics ranging from nonlinear dynamical systems
to the propagation of nerve impulses in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students
will gain experience ranging from theory and numerical simulations to technical
aspects of fiber optics. The proposed effort will also be coupled to
undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching through demonstrations based on
the developed instruments.
