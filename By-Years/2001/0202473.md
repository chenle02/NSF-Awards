Funding is provided to continue partial support for the ICES/GLOBEC North
Atlantic Regional Program Office within the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES is an intergovernmental organization
designed to coordinate scientific research, fisheries assessment, environmental
concerns, and oceanographic matters of common interest to countries bordering
the North Atlantic. The ICES/GLOBEC program is the North Atlantic regional
component of the International GLOBEC Implementation Plan. GLOBEC (Global Ocean
Ecosystem Dynamics) is an international research program intended to improve
forecasts of the responses of the marine ecosystem to physical forcing and
global change by developing our understanding of its structure and functioning
under varying physical conditions. The project office is responsible for
coordinating efforts to keep interested research communities informed about
ongoing work, design means for data exchange, plan cooperative research,
organize workshops for the collective appraisal and analysis of information, and
publish results in a timely and adequate way.
