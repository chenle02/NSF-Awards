This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on mixing,
turbulence, instabilities, and coherent vortex structures in fluid flows. The
principal tool will be computational fluid dynamics (CFD), so that the research
also contains a strong component towards developing accurate and efficient
computational techniques and computer architectures. Better and faster methods
in CFD will permit the prediction of more complex flows, heretofore not
simulated but accessible only to experiments.
