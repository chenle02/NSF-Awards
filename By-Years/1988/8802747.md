This project in gravitational physics will apply numerical techniques to
investigate three dimensional fluid dynamics near black holes. Of special
interest will be the development of nonaxisymmetric instabilities that threaten
black holes accretion disks. Also of interest will be the effects of "frame
dragging" by rotating black holes. The effects of magnetic fields will be
included.
