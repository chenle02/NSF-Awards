This project improves the academic performance and retention of first-year
engineering students through the development and widespread implementation of a
model "Introduction to Engineering" course. Faculty from ten universities come
together with individuals who have successfully delivered orientation courses to
minority engineering students and other orientation course experts to develop a
model curriculum and text material for the proposed course. Each of the faculty
participants teach this course at their institution to a randomly selected group
of engineering first-year students, and the academic performance and freshman-
to-sophomore retention of those students is compared to that of the non-
participating control group. A disssemination conference involving the
participating faculty and several California community college engineering
faculty is held as a finale to the project.
