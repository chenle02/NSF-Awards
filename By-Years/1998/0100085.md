This award provides funds to aid in purchase of a hybrid quadruple time-of-
flight mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI-MS). The instrument
will be used by 30 basic science faculty and by approximately two hundred
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for diverse research in neurobiology,
biological sensors, and nanotechnology. The instrument will be located in the
Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in the school of chemical sciences where is will be
managed and maintained by dedicated technical staff. Students and postdoctoral
associates who require instruments of this type in their research have the
option of having professional staff run their samples, or of being trained to
use the instrument and then running the samples themselves.
