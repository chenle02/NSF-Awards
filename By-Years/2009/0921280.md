Flowers have been of keen interest to humans throughout history, owing partly to
the multitude of ways in which they stimulate our senses. Their brilliant
colors, unusual patterns and shapes, and alluring fragrance enthrall humans and
play a pivotal role in plant pollination. Surprisingly little is understood
about why flowers are so complex, consisting of multiple components in multiple
sensory modalities. In this project, the function of the multi-component floral
signal in pollination is explored, using an integrative approach that addresses
the pollinator's sensory and cognitive abilities and limitations. The main
thesis of the research is that complex, multi-component signals convey
information from plant to pollinator more reliably than simpler signals. To
address this thesis, a laboratory-based model system involving bumble bees
(Bombus impatiens) learning to forage for nectar rewards associated with color,
shape, pattern and odor stimuli will be employed. Tests of learning and floral
choice are guided by predictions, based in psychological and economic theory,
about how signal complexity will affect the speed and accuracy of a bee's
foraging behavior. Although the proposed work uses bees and flowers as a model
system, the insights furnished by the work will contribute broadly to the study
of animal communication and cognition. Additionally, results will contribute to
a body of knowledge used to address an ongoing national crisis in crop
pollination by bees. The project aims to mentor undergraduates from
underrepresented groups and will include a bumble bee-oriented workshop on
science careers targeted at high school students.
