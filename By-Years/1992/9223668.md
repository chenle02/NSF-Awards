Trends and volatility in primary commodity prices present policy makers in
developing countries with problems of both macroeconomic and microeconomic
management, problems that will not be resolved until there exists a coherent and
empirically supported theory of the determination of the prices of primary
commodities. The leading theoretical explanation of agricultural crop prices
rests on a combination of supply and demand together with storage and profit-
maximizing speculators. This story is consistent with several stylized facts,
but formal empirical analysis has only become possible with recent advances in
the econometric analysis of nonlinear dynamic programs. Results have been less
than encouraging, at least for simple versions of the theory. This research
builds on previous analysis by the investigators and will enrich the basic model
to the point where it is either consistent with the evidence, or is clearly
rejected. The theory will be extended to accommodate growth in output, more
complex supply patterns, and the flow of information between crop years.
Empirical work will extend pervious analysis to higher frequency data and will
use extensive historical data on production, stocks, and future markets to test
fuller versions of the theory.
