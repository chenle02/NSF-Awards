This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses this
problem: with the explosion of data and apps, it is ever harder to find
information in context. How can information be found if it was lost or not
captured in the first place? The proposed solution enables to 'capture the
moment' : the connections among pieces of disparate information across apps and
the human mind, while people keep working with familiar tools. Captured
information is globally addressed, persistent in time, and hyperlinked based on
the user's work: hence, it can be found -as it was- via searches or navigating
the links. This project will involve research and development to beta test the
technology with selected professional users while they use familiar tools, and
to validate the benefits with respect to the status
quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is to significantly improve personal and collaborative information
management and search, and to solve inefficiencies in information technology
that affect productivity. The initial target users for the product are
researchers that perform studies using disparate information and data from
various sources of information and compile documents: the product has the impact
to enhance scientific collaboration. The technology can be expanded to
significantly improve personal and collaborative information management for a
worldwide user base, with specialized products in many information intensive
professions, resulting in a leap in actionable knowledge production and
productivity.
