The subject of this research is the processing and characterization of
nanocrystalline alumina and yttria stabilized zirconia ceramics. Two approaches
will be taken for the processing of nano-sized powders, namely consolidation by
plastic deformation and consolidation by wet-processing. For plastic deformation
green bodies will be subjected to high shear stresses at moderate temperatures
to accomplish pore closure without extensive grain growth. In wet-processing the
focus will be on particle-particle interactions and the resulting domain cluster
size as related to the final grain size of the consolidated ceramic. The
resulting materials will be tested for superplasticity, ionic conductivity, and
other properties of interest. This research will develop the scientific and
technical understanding necessary to produce bulk nanocrystalline ceramics for
electronic and structural applications.
