The Cariaco Basin is a unique locality to study the low-latitude counterpart of
climate change. The PI will study the varve sediments of the Basin to
investigate tropical paleoenvironmental changes in key intervals over century
and millennial time scales for the past 12.6 Ky., including the Little Ice Age
and the onset of industrial revolution. Additional objective is to study abrupt
climate change associated with last deglaciation. The PIs will use the varved
sediment cores collected during a 1990 cruise.
