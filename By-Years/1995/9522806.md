9522806 Shapiro Solid modeling technology is rapidly becoming the primary means
for creating, exchanging, and maintaining information across all engineering
functions and applications. Existing solid modeling systems have been developed
in response to specific applications, and hence rely on a variety of
representation schemes as well as new representations and engineering languages
that combine elements of distinct representations in ad hoc fashion. The goal of
this research is to develop a comprehensive, mathematically sound, and standard
technology for maintenance of solid models, representations, and systems in
support of diverse engineering applications. The proposed approach and methods
are based on the established and experimentally verified theory of space
decompositions. In the short term, the results of this research should further
the acceptance, integration, and standardization of solid modeling technology in
mechanical design and manufacturing. It should lead to significant productivity
gains and improvements in feature-based and parametric design methods. More
generally, the establishment of rigorous computational connections between
different solid model representations has been cited by a recent National
Research Council report as a key component of the information technology that
will be needed for manufacturing in the future. The work will potentially lead
to more efficient methods for designing and representing parts. Such a method
will allow the interchange of design data among different design systems.
