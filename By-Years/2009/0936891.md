The Substrate Working Group is one of five Working Gropus driving the technical
work to develop the architecture and design of a suite of experimental network
infrastructure that is currently in its planning stages. The working groups hold
three workshops each year that, on a continuing basis: 1) identify and resolve
design issues, 2) identify areas of technical risk, 3) review documents prepared
by the GENI Project Office, and 4) engage in outreach.

By having an open, transparent, well-managed design process, the community will
have ample opportunities to comment and contribute to the design of a suite of
experimental network infrastructure. Engaging the community early in the design
process will ensure that the infrastructure will have the functionality and
capabilities required by the research community. Workshop topics will include:
detailed open design issues and tradeoffs, risk assessment and mitigation,
common vocabulary and models, design and integration activities, use cases, and
the evaluation of software and services, for example.

The chairs will be responsible for workshop preparation, chairing workshops,
results dissemination, and progress reporting. These funds will enable the
chairs to recruit attendees, attend three workshops, and disseminate the
results.
