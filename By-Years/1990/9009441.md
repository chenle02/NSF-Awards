This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from the
Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). This project is to collect, analyze, and
interpret the technical and hazard mitigation data related to the performance of
unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in response to the Loma Prieta Earthquake.
The collected performance data will be applied to the improvement of the
"SEAOC/CALBO Joint Unreinforced Masonry Technical Strengthening Provisions."
These provisions have been recently approved by the Structural Engineers
Association of California (SEAOC) as a submittal for inclusion in the Uniform
Code of Building Conservation (UCBC). If approved by the International Council
of Building Officials they will provide unified design criteria for the hazard
mitigation of URM buildings This data base can provide valuable improvements to
these new provisions in the form of additions, clarifications, and changes
necessary for their effective implementation. These improvements will be
formulated to provide the related supplementary commentary and example
applications. This project will make an important contribution to the
improvement of seismic code provisions.
