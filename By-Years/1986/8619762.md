Support is requested for 9 American engineers to attend an Engineering
Foundation Conference on "Fluid-Particle Interactions" on May 3-8, 1987 at
Davos, Switzerland. This conference is organized with the intent of bringing
together a variety of researchers from the U.S. and Europe to exchange knowledge
and information in this field. The interchange would be about equal in each
direction. Europe-U.S., and the principal investigator will prepare a summary
for program use at the National Science Foundation. A grant is highly
recommended.
