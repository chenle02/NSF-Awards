The statistical physics of nonlinear chains is used to describe a large range of
dynamical systems including charge density wave materials, Josephson junctions
and low-dimensional conductors. Nonlinear chains can exhibit kink or soliton-
like solutions to their equations of motion. The presence of these intrinsic
nonlinear excitations is crucial to understanding the response of these systems
to external stimuli. In this research program, Dr. Miller is concerned with the
nonequilibrium statistical physics of the sine-Gordon and sine-Toda systems as a
function of external driving forces and various internal configurations.
