The proposed project is to support participation by USA-based mathematicians and
physicists, graduate students, and post-docs, in the conference on
representation theory, quantization, and supergeometry to be held in Bialowieza,
Poland, during the week of June 26 - July 2, 2011. The topics of the conference
include representations of local current groups and other infinite-dimensional
groups and Lie algebras, together with supergroups and Lie superalgebras,
formality theorems for Hochschild cochains via transfer, construction of
differential graded categories for compact symplectic manifolds using the
microlocal theory of sheaves by Kashiwara-Schapira, "monstrous moonshine" and
vertex operator algebras, quantization of three-dimensional quantum gravity
based on the quantum universal Teichmueller space, odd symplectic geometry and
the Batalin-Vilkovissky formalism, and relations between the chiral de Rham
complex and generalized complex structures, vertex algebroids and supergeometry.



The conference brings together researchers who have made significant
contributions to representation theory, quantization, and super-mathematics. The
interaction between these three fields has been one of the major driving forces
of the modern mathematical physics. The format of the conference, its location
and facilities provide an intimate research environment for the interaction of
established researchers with each other and with graduate students and post-
docs, and give an opportunity to younger researchers to present their work to an
international audience. Additional information can be found on the conference
