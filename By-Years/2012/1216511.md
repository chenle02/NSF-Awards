Current wastewater treatment methods consume significant amounts of costly
energy, and the efforts to recover energy during treatment have severe
limitations. As a result, there is a demand for an integrated system that can
simultaneously remove contaminants and produce bioenergy. The proposed
technology has the potential to meet this demand by taking advantage of two
biological methods: 1) Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) oxidization of organic
compounds to generate bioelectricity; and 2) algal bioreactors removing
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) to produce biomass that can be further
converted to biodiesel. The project is based on a successful proof-of-concept of
the proposed system in the laboratory. The team will assess the commercial
viability of the technology through business and engineering development.
Successful completion of the project will result in better understanding of key
factors needed to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the
proposed technology, and help to further engage strategic industrial
partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology has economic benefits,
including decreased energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels (coal), and
societal benefits including decreased greenhouse gas emissions from energy
production and improved water quality. Potential customers for this technology
such as publicly-owned water treatment plants, engineering consulting firms, and
environmental equipment companies, will help bring the proposed system to
market, and will profit from new business opportunities in system design and
construction (consulting and equipment), and in reduced operating expenses.
