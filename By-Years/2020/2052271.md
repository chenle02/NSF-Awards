The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accelerate the aviation industryâ€™s adoption
of more efficient aircraft and sustainable fuel sources. This project proposes a
carbon calculator algorithm to effectively calculate scientifically valid and
accurate carbon emissions for the consumer travel and air cargo markets. This
research will lead to the first publicly accessible data on flight carbon
emissions for air cargo and air travel as a point of booking decision support
tool. This will enable travelers to make flight decisions based on carbon
emissions and sustainability, as they do price and schedule. Airlines can use
this for important flight operations decisions in support of their
sustainability goals. This can be applied to other modes of
transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to the development
of a predictive per-passenger carbon emissions algorithm to be used as a
decision support tool before booking a flight. Research and development of this
type have never been done for air travel carbon emissions, and currently, no
external certification and verification system exists for aviation carbon
emissions. Econometrics modeling and principal component analysis will be used
to develop and train a predictive carbon emission algorithm, after which
software engineering will be used to develop an Application Programming
Interface product to link this with consumer behavior and travel decisions. One
inherent technical risk for this project is the ability to obtain and maintain
consistent access to accurate, curated data describing aircraft and flights. The
ability to process such a vast amount of data from disparate sources in real-
time, with the required speed and accuracy, is another major
challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
