The goal of this project is to integrate computer applications into the
laboratory through the use of cost-effective workstations. The equipment
purchased includes eight, 80386 based computer workstations with General Purpose
Interface Bus (GPIB) controllers that share four sets of computer controlled
laboratory equipment. The test equipment includes a digital multimeter, a
synthesized waveform generator, a multiple output power supply, and a digital
storage oscilloscope. Hardcopy output is provided by four shared laser printers
with plotter capability. This equipment supports and enhances the laboratory by
providing fast, automatic data acquisition and analysis capabilities, and
graphical display and hardcopy functions. Laborious repetitive measurements are
eliminated, allowing valuable laboratory time to be spent investigating various
designs, options, and results. Student acquired data is compared to computer
simulations with the immediate feedback used to improve experimental techniques.
Previously unavailable transient response and waveform analysis methods enhance
the overall learning experience. The award is being matched by an equal amount
from the principal investigator's institution.
