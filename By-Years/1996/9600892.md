9600892 Grodzicker Study of the biological bases of learning and memory is among
the most exciting fields in neuroscience. Progress is currently very rapid,
particularly at molecular, cellular, neural systems and computational levels.
Commonalities of mechanisms appear to be emerging from studies of gene
expression, synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) and processes of memory storage in
invertebrate and vertebrate systems. This meeting is planned to bring together
representatives from the major laboratories, along with a large number of
younger scientists, including may women, in all areas of learning and memory
research. To achieve this requires substantial funding.
