*** 9760541 Radparvar This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses the development of a wide-bandwidth SQUID-based amplifier chip for
cryogenic particle detectors. A novel approach for implementing a wide bandwidth
and inexpensive SQUID readout scheme was recently proposed and demonstrated by
Welty and Martinis at NIST. This SQUID amplifier chip integrates a single analog
SQUID coupled to an array of SQUIDs. The firm is presently producing and
marketing this SQUID amplifier system with associated room temperature
electronics which exhibits a sensitivity of better than 2 pA/(Hz and bandwidth
of 2 MHz, dissipates approximately 1W), and has low cost. To improve upon the
bandwidth, a single-stage version of the SQUID amplifier chip integrated from
144 analog SQUIDs was recently designed, fabricated, and evaluated. This project
proposes to assemble and demonstrate a complete amplifier system based on this
single-stage SQUID chip and to continue its optimization for better noise
characteristic and current/magnetic sensitivity. This system enables a more
efficient application of the SQUID amplifiers to x-ray and particle detector
readouts. In developing the two-stage SQUID array amplifier system for
commercialization, the firm collaborated with Dr. John Martinis (NIST),
Professor Blas Cabrera (Stanford University), and Dr. Richard Welty (formerly
with NIST). These collaborative efforts will be continued to ensure development
of a system suitable for x-ray and particle detector applications. The
availability of such low-cost SQUID amplifiers would result in their use for
nearly all high energy physics research experiments, high-resolution x-ray
spectroscopy, imaging detectors, particle identification systems,
biomagnetometry for the mapping of brain functions, and detection of corrosion
and cracks in aircraft. ***
