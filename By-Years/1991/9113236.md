The objective of the proposed work is to develop, test and demonstrate a new
generation of numerical methods to solve the pdf equations for turbulent
combustion. In several major industries, there is an increasing use of turbulent
combustion models to aid the design and development of combustion devices. The
usefulness of these methods has already been established, but it can be
significantly enhanced through improvements in the modelling and computational
implementation. PDF methods provide the needed capability to handle finite-rate
kinetic effects, such as the formation of NOx and the burning of CO. However,
the focus is not on modelling issues, but on the computational implementation of
pdf methods. Industry requires methods that are much more accurate, robust and
economical than those currently available. A radically new Monte Carlo method
will be developed to solve the pdf equations. It will be second-order accurate
in space and time; it will include a PISO-type mean pressure algorithm
applicable both to low-speed and high-speed flow; it will incorporate advanced
variance-reduction techniques (to reduce statistical errors); and, it will be
structured for implementation on vector and parallel architectures.
