The award covers development of protocols and working code to facilitate the
operation of distributed information services. The initial goals are to automate
the acquisition, conversion and mounting of information from a variety of
autonomous sources onto a common Web platform. Ultimately, the architectural
model and protocols will provide the basis to implement additional information
services across any distributed environment.
