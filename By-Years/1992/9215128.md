We have established the feasibility of observing non-equilibrium fluctuations
in liquids subjected to a temperature gradient by small-angle Rayleigh
scattering. We propose to apply this technique to study non-equilibrium
fluctuations in liquid mixtures, macromolecular systems and colloidal
suspensions. Concomitant with the light-scattering work, Soret phenomena will be
investigated with an optional beam-bending technique.
