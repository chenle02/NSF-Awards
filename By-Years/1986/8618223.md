This project is a renewal of DPP-8315452, work to study a number of chemical
species and radionuclides that have been transported from mid-lattitudes to the
Greenland ice sheet. The specific goals of the research are to learn how various
species are removed from the atmosphere during snowfalls, to learn how the
concentrations change as the snow ages, to determine the changes in
concentration throughout the year, to identify the source regions of the
chemicals and to apply the findings to ice core data.
