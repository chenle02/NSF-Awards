ABSTRACT The principal investigator (PI) observed that holes smaller than the
diameter of a laser beam could be created during high-intensity laser ablation
of copper and aluminum. The PI postulated that the holes were caused by self-
focusing of the laser beam when it interacted with the induced plasma. This
proposal seeks to study the self-focusing phenomenon through a combined
experimental and analytical effort. The temporal and spatial profiles of laser
beams interacting with a plasma will be measured using different laser pulse
rates. The experimental results will be used with analyses to give estimates of
heat flux and investigate the fundamental mechanisms of self-focusing of laser
beams. The PI's educational plan includes using laser demonstrations to
stimulate interests among primary and high-school students to learn science and
engineering.
