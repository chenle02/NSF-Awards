9419021 Levander In 1995 the Canadian Lithoprobe program plans a continental
scale active source expanding spread seismic profile to probe the Archean upper
mantle beneath the Alberta Plains, with the midpoint of the probe over the
Medicine Hat Block, a crustal block which has been high standing since the
Proterozoic. This DeepProbe profile, centered near Calgary, has a 2500km
aperture along the front and interior of the western Cordillera. The Canadians
will shoot into 2 dense receiver spreads, each roughly 600km long, extending
from Calgary southward into the US to the Colorado-Wyoming border. This project
is a component of a suite of 3 integrated US seismic experiments which will
complement the Canadian effort, making use of similar experimental
methodologies, but addressing different tectonic and geologic problems within
the US. The 3 experiments are: 1) an active source expanding spread large-
aperture mantle probe; 2) passive teleseismic recording and 3) a crustal
refraction profile. The wide-range of scales examined permits geodynamic
evaluation of a complete crust-mantle system. The US experiments will
investigate Phanerozoic asthenosphere and Archean-Proterozoic lithosphere
modified by Phanerozoic tectonism beneath the Colorado Plateau/Southern Rocky
Mountains. ***
