The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Robert Tengerdy of Colorado State University and Dr. Jeno Toth of the
Technical University of Budapest is to isolate and characterize lactic acid
bacteria for ensiling to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose. These
efforts will address fundamental questions underlying the theoretical
possibility of simultaneous ensiling and saccharification of lignocellulose such
that, eventually, agricultural wastes and residues might be efficiently utilized
on the farm for highly digestible animal feed. This project in biomass
engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
