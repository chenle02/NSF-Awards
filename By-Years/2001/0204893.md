The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is held yearly
at&lt;br/&gt;different locations in the world. The 2002 ISIT will be held at the
Palais de&lt;br/&gt;Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday, June 30, to
Friday, July 5,&lt;br/&gt;2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support
for the travel expenses of ISIT participants from&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. These
participants would be individuals whose papers have been&lt;br/&gt;selected for
presentation at the Symposium, but who lack funds and would not
be&lt;br/&gt;able to attend without travel support.
