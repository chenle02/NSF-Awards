This project addresses fundamental processes and atomic level details of oxygen
induced defects in compound semiconductors such as aluminum gallium arsenide
(AlGaAs). Epitaxial crystal growth by MOCVD with unique introduction and control
of oxygen content by aluminum alkoxides, characterization of the epitaxial
layers by optical, electrical, and ion channelling chemical reactions, and
assessment of the thermal stability of GaAs:AlO epilayers are included in the
research. The information gained from these studies is expected to provide new
scientific understanding and is relevant to semiconductor materials of
significant technological importance; AlGaAs and GaAs epitaxial layers are used
in heterojunction devices such as solid state lasers and transistors.
