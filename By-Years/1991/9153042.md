This project aids in the implementation of an undergraduate interdisciplinary
curricular program in design with plastics and composites. The program is
intended for majors in mechanical, chemical and materials engineering and in
chemistry. A major component of the curriculum program is the development of a
new laboratory course in Practical Polymer Processing, which includes mechanical
and structural design, material and manufacturing process selection, mold
construction, component manufacture and final product functional testing.
Included in the course is a series of processing experiments designed to
introduce students to essential elements of polymer and composite processing
appropriate to each discipline.
