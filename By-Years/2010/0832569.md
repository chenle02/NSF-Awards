This award will partially support the 3rd International SF-ICP-MS Workshop on
September 8-12, 2008 at Rutgers University. The workshop will attract up to 100
scientists with approximately 20% international participation. The main goal of
the workshop is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise from
senior to early-career scientists. Objectives of this meeting, beyond building
collegial ties and collaborative relationships between early-career and senior
scientists, are to 1) discuss state of the art instrumentation, 2) present novel
techniques, 3) host within-meeting work shops and training sessions, 4) promote
interdisciplinary exchanges, and 5) evaluate future development of
instrumentation. NSF funds will be used specifically to attain this goal and
will be awarded as travel stipends to 12 early-career scientists and 6 senior
scientists.
