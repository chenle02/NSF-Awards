This investigator will develop integrated approaches to the determination of
evolutionary relationships, the dating of evolutionary events, and the
establishment of quantitative methods for distinguishing real from artifactual
patterns in the fossil record. Molecular data collected in my laboratory,
computer and mathematical models, and classical paleontological data will be
used. This work will be done at the University of California, Los Angeles.
