The proposal outlines two activities both of which are aimed at a study of
decays of heavy quarks through the weak interaction. The investigator has joined
a collaboration in an experiment at Fermilab (E791) aimed at the production from
pion nucleus collisions of large numbers of mesons containing the charmed quark.
Her role in this is to study form factors in semileptonic decays of these
mesons, and also the possibility of D0 anti D0 mixing - a phenomenon which has
already been observed in the strange and bottom quark mesonic counterparts. The
PI also proposes to continue her involvement in the research and development
required in the possible evolution of an experiment aimed at a study of CP
violation in the weak decays of b quarks. This experiment would center about an
asymmetric e+e- accelerator facility producing large numbers of B mesons known
as a B Factory. She is already involved in detector development relevant to the
use of such a facility, and proposes to continue to evaluate Helium gas drift
chambers in particular.
