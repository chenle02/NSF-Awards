This project is concerned with integral representation theory. The principal
investigator will focus on the application of pullbacks to orders. He will
examine group rings for finite groups with cyclic p-Sylow subgroups over the
p-adic completion of the integers. He will also study arbitrary finitely
generated modules over certain types of orders. A ring is an algebraic object
having an addition and multiplication defined on it. The most familiar example
is the ring of integers. These objects occur in many different settings in
mathematics and theoretical physics. This particular project is concerned with
group rings and is of interest both in ring theory and in group theory.
