The objective of this research is to improve spatial and temporal sensor arrays
that yield increased signal-to-noise ratio. Theoretical research includes
modeling signals from multiple emitters, statistically evaluating parameter
estimation algorithms, and assessing time-bandwidth interchangability. The array
processing applications extend to areas as diverse as radar, sonar, and
communications in addition to radio-astronomy and bioengineering.
