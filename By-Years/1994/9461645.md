This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is proposed by American
Superconductor Corporation (ASC) to establish the feasibility of a novel, low-
cost process for manufacturing the robust superconducting wires required for
commercially viable magnet components capable of operating at temperatures that
are accessible by inexpensive refrigeration technologies. Most of the
potentially large-scale commercial applications of high temperature
superconducting wires in magnet components require high sustained current
densities at temperatures above 50 K in magnetic fields up to 5 Tesla. The
proposed process is an innovative combination of the metallic precursor process
pioneered by ASC and its partners for the economical production of robust high
temperature superconducting wires, and film processes that produce the highest
demonstrated critical current densities above 50 K in fields above 5 T. The
Phase I project will establish the feasibility of a metallic precursor wire
manufacturing process that employs the texturing processes utilized in thin film
processes for attaining highly aligned grain microstructures. The inherent
formability of the metallic precursor alloys presents a unique opportunity for
manufacturing complex, geometrically precise, chemically homogeneous precursors
similar locally to those used in thin film processes.
