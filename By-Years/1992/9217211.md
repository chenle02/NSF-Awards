This project is concerned with glacier and climate variations in the low
latitudes, focusing on climatic forcing-response processes. Given the global
nature of climate, interest is in the tropics as a whole, with a regional
emphasis on East Africa. The project components include glacier area-change
detection from satellite for selected mountains with suitable "ground truth";
ice volume-change detection from an areo-photogrammetric re-mapping of Mount
Kenya's glaciers; a quantitative analysis of the various kinds of climatic
forcing that have driven the changes of Lewis Glacier, Mount Kenya, from the
latter part of the last century to the 1990's; and with lower priority, a
comparative climatic forcing and retreat history of glaciers in New Guinea, East
Africa, and the South American Andes. Overall, the project shall follow
promising leads in the development of "tropical satellite glaciology" for
climate purposes, in combination with the analysis of existing field
observations, while requiring only limited field work. Particular attention
shall be given to the quantitative evaluation of the climatic forcing of recent
glacier changes that may be relevant to the "greenhouse" issue.
