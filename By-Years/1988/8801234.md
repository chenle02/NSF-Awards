The separations of oil/water and oil/water/mud emulsions are serious and
expensive problems in oil field operations. The separations are presently
performed by using chemical additives and beating. The P.I. will investigate the
effects of microwave radiation on the zeta potential at the oil/water interface,
in order to understand the mechanism of the microwave separation of oil/water
emulsions. Exploratory experiments will be conducted to see if oil/water/mud can
be separated into three phases by microwave radiation. This research, if
successful, could result in savins in oil production costs.
