Spanos 9412576 This project Supports travel to the Second International
Conference on Computational Stochastic Mechanics to be held in Athens, Greece on
13-15 June 1994. this conference aims to be a forum for bringing together the
two fields of computational and stochastic mechanics. It will provide a unique
opportunity for exchanging ideas on the status of computational methods as they
are applied to stochastic analysis of a broad spectrum of problems of
theoretical and applied mechanics. the conference theme encompasses: Boundary
Elements Aerospace Engineering Control Earthquake Engineering Differential
Equations Environmental Engineering Fatigue and Fracture Geotechnical
Engineering Finite Elements Hydraulic Engineering Monte Carlo Simulation Marine
and Offshore Engineering Optimization Structural Engineering Random Fields
Transportation engineering Reliability Vehicle Engineering Vibrations Wind
