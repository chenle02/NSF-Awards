Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) is a federally-designated Hispanic-Serving
Institution, and is the largest single campus of California's 112 community
colleges. The campus is located about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. Two factors
speak to the need for the preparation of more and better science and mathematics
teachers in this area: student mathematics and science test scores for several
of Mt. SAC's top feeder high schools are in need of improvement and there is a
predicted dramatic attrition among the population of middle-school and high
school teachers. To address the need for more and better science and mathematics
teachers, Mt. SAC is developing a sustainable multidimensional program to
recruit, counsel, and direct likely students that have the desire and potential
to become highly-qualified middle school and high school mathematics and science
teachers. The project, titled Mt. SAC STEM Teacher Preparation Program (STEM
TP2), is providing the students with (1) a cluster of academic support, (2)
enrichment activities, (3) teaching opportunities, and (4) authentic research
experiences designed to promote student success.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a sustainable,
multidimensional program that will recruit and retain students with the
potential and desire to teach. The PI team is working with the existing Mt. SAC
Teacher Preparation Institute to develop the process through which students will
be recruited. The project is also articulating with the teacher preparation
programs at the California State University, Fullerton and the University of
California, Irvine so that Mt. SAC students can transfer seamlessly into a
baccalaureate teacher preparation program. Student participants are selected
from among students majoring in science and mathematics areas and particular
emphasis is focused on recruiting students of color, females, Hispanics,
veterans and first-generation college students that have a desire to teach.
