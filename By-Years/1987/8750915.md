The Physics Department at the University of Northern Iowa will improve
experiments in two courses, Holography Laboratory and Lasers and Optics. It will
add new experimental capabilities in the areas of holography, lasers and fiber
optics. These improvements will also support work by students registering for
Undergraduate Research which is required as part of the new Bachelor of Science
Program. New instrumentation to be used includes open-cavity lasers, an
electronic driver for a laser spectrum analyzer (previously purchased), a fiber
optics lab instruction system, fiber holders, a laser power meter, a fiber
cleaver/splicer, a holography table with vibration isolation, and an
interferometer useful for characterizing aberrations of lens and holographic
optical elements.
