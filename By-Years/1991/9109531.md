This research will investigate the application of data flow testing to
integration in order to assist in validating procedure interfaces and procedure
interaction for programs written in procedural languages such as Pascal,
Modula-2, and Fortran. This work will include the development of techniques to
compute interprocedural definition-use information, techniques to determine
whether a particular test case exercises a definition-use pair, and techniques
to incrementally update both the interprocedural data flow information and the
test coverage information for regression testing. Issues such as handling
reference parameters, global variable, aliases, nested scoping and recursion
will be considered. A prototype system for integration data flow testing will be
implemented and used to perform experiments to study the efficiency and
effectiveness of interprocedural data flow testing. The main benefit of the
proposed work is that it will provide significant advances over existing
integration test data selection techniques for both initial and regression
testing.
