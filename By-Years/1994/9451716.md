9451716 Chaderjian Scripps College is creating a new mathematics department to
specifically meet the needs of its students. A selective liberal arts college
for women, Scripps is one of the five undergraduate colleges in Claremont.
Because of an open cross-registration policy among the Claremont Colleges,
Scripps students have always had access to mathematics courses taught at the
other colleges. Over the past decade the College has grown in the areas of the
social and physical sciences. This change in emphasis has created an increased
need for mathematics courses specifically for Scripps students. In response to
this need, the College created a new mathematics department. The College is
committed to the notion that the knowledge of mathematics is increasingly
important in our society, and is dedicated to encouraging women to pursue
studies in mathematics. Matching funds are provided by a grant from the Ralph M.
Parsons Foundation.
