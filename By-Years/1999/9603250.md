The goal of this collaboration between the PI and Martin Goebel at the German
National Research Center for Information Technology near Bonn is to create
transatlantic distributed Virtual Reality (VR) sites connected by high-speed
networks. The German and U.S. groups have each developed their own VR sites and
the current research will allow the creation of a shared virtual environment in
which people at separate locations can collaborate in real time, seeing and
interacting with the same virtual objects. The project would coordinate
activities to make the German and U.S. systems compatible. The project will
allow young scientists from the United States and Germany who have recently
completed their degrees to work together toward common research goals.
