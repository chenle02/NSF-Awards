This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate researchers in
mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty advisors. The
research at this site will be on topics in algebra and number theory. The
program will run for eight weeks. The students will be expected to make oral
progress reports throughout the summer and a final written report at the end.
