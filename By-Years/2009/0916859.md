Partial or complete disk failures are becoming so common and frequent in modern-
day large-scale data centers that they are now considered the norm rather than
the exception. It is thus of paramount importance to develop novel approaches to
effectively and significantly supplementing and improving the existing RAID
protection mechanisms, with the goal of providing high reliability and
availability for RAID-structured storage systems so that they are capable of
tolerating partial, complete, and multiple disk faults while delivering
acceptable, non-stop services to the users. This project seeks to develop a
holistic framework, called a RAID protection activator (ProActive), to address
the fundamental and ever-increasing availability challenge facing RAID-
structured storage systems. ProActive exploits application workload intensity
and data/parity management and intelligently leverages rich available spare
storage resources in large-scale data centers to address the efficiency problem
of the existing state-of-the-art availability mechanisms for RAID. ProActive
will develop solutions to handle the increasingly more frequent partial and
complete disk failures in RAID-structured storage systems based on the design
goals of significantly supplementing and improving existing fault-detection,
fault-tolerance, and fault-recovery mechanisms. The broader impact of the
project lies in its (1) research development that impacts and enriches fields as
diverse as high-performance computing, availability and reliability in high-end
computing systems; (2) infrastructure development that enhances research and
education at UNL and, through accessibility via public domain, the high
performance and data-intensive computing community; and (3) educational
development that exposes graduate and undergraduate students to cutting edge
research in highly available storage systems.
