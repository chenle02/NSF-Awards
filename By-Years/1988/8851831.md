This project is aimed at establishing a permanent optoelectronics laboratory
which will 1) immensely improve the quality of the current laboratory 2) provide
facilities to establish a new lecture/laboratory class in fiber optics 3)
provide a permanent setting for undergraduate research projects, and 4) motivate
students to consider careers and graduate education in optoelectronics. The
equipment includes optical, electronic and computer equipment for establishing a
flexible laboratory. Two stations will be computer- interfaced, the others
manual or partly computer-controlled. The laboratory will reinforce the lecture
material and also allow students to duplicate current research work from the
literature. This facility is the only optoelectronic teaching laboratory in
Oregon which is rapidly becoming a center for optoelectronic companies. Adequate
facilities are needed to meet the needs of students and to provide retraining
for industrial scientists and engineers. Stimulated students are also much more
likely to pursue graduate education.
