The goal of this research is to investigate atomic structures, defects,
vacancies, and chemical reactions on surfaces induced by atoms/ionss with
thermal energies up to several hundred eV as a function of ion kinetic energy
and substrate temperature. Thermal atomic beams are produced by effusion cells
while ion beams are generated by a new pulsed, mass-selected, low-energy ion
beam system. In situ structural analysis are conducted by Time-Of- Flight
Scattering and Recoiling Spectrometry and Low Energy Electron Diffraction. In
situ X-ray and UV photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy (PS, UPS and AES) and
conventional ex situ structural analysis methods such as x-ray diffraction,
Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy also are used
for material characterization. Studies on ion trajectory simulations and
molecular dynamics calculations augment structural determinations and atomic
scale processes in film growth. These studies are important because they enhance
understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical processes involved in
low-energy ion-surface interactions. Also, the proposed synthetic routes have
potentials for growing unique, previously unknown materials because of the
judicious manipulation of the ion energy and substrate temperature.
