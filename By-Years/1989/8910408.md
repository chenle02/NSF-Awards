During normal postnatal development, mammalian skeletal muscles undergo an
orderly process of synapse elimination, whereby each muscle fiber loses all but
one of the multiple synapses with which it starts at birth. Dr. Van Essen will
study several aspects of synaptic specificity and plasticity in the soleus
muscle of the rabbit, using a variety of anatomical and physiological
techniques. One objective is to ascertain the way in which two distinct
populations of motor neurons (fast or slow) innervate their respective
populations of muscle fibers. He will determine the incidence of mismatched
connections (fast motor axons onto slow muscle fibers and vice versa) during the
stage of extensive polyinnervation, and he will test for differences in the
number of synapses initially made onto fast and slow fibers. Another objective
is to study the regional distribution of muscle fibers within individual motor
units and to ascertain whether this distribution within the muscle changes
during the period of synapse elimination. Finally, Dr. Van Essen will determine
whether there are changes in neuromuscular connections during a period of late
postnatal development, when many muscle fibers are known to convert from fast to
slow contractile type. These studies may provide valuable insights concerning
the cellular basis of synaptic plasticity and the rules governing orderly
rearrangements of synaptic connections.
