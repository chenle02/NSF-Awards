This research project in theoretical computer science focuses on problems in two
interrelated areas: algorithms for graph problems, and the design of data
structures. The common theme is the investigation of efficient computation in
these areas. The goals are to generate improved techniques, and characterize
significant complexity relationships. A central issue will be the efficient
coordination of the acquisition of information during a complex computational
task.
