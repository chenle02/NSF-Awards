The research team is developing a shrinkage reducing admixture for application
in portland cement-based materials such as concrete. This technology focuses on
reducing the surface tension of the pore solution by disrupting the hydrogen
bonding of water molecules in the liquid phase at the vapor-liquid interface.
The basis of this technology lies in the team?s ability to predict new
structures using an intelligent computer aided molecular design methodology that
utilizes quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) and inverse design
logic. This is one of the first demonstrations of the use of computer aided
molecular design using QSPR to discover new admixtures for
concrete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete is one of the major building blocks of
roads and structures across the globe, and each year billions of dollars are
spent replacing concrete damaged due to cracking-related issues. The admixture
developed by this research team would serve to help reduce shrinkage of
concrete, which is one of the main causes of concrete cracking, damage and
failure. Concrete that is less prone to damage would result in less cost for
repair and overall, stronger, more durable structures and roadways.
