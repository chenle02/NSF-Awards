This research program will investigate the generation mechanisms of small scale
(1 to 10 km) irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere. The focus of the
research will be to develop an analytical and numerical three-dimensional model
of one of the main structuring mechanisms in the high latitude ionosphere,
referred to as the E cross B instability. The methods to be employed will
include both analytical and numerical three-dimensional models. The models
proposed in the past have been unable to explain many characteristic features of
the small scale structure. The previous two-dimensional simulations of the
instability indicate development of large scale structures that disrupt the
gradients driving the instability. However, three dimensional treatments
indicate long scale length stabilization for these modes due to parallel
dynamics. The analytical and numerical results for the small scale irregularity
generation and their impact on the long scale processes will be compared with
observations, and new experiments will be suggested to test the theoretical
results.
