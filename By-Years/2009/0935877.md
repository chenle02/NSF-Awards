&lt;br/&gt;This award provide funds for the National Academy of Sciences?
Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the
Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among
university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.
FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 120 academic institutions,
nine federal agencies and five professional societies, offers a forum for
members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline
and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the
current phase, FDP will develop targeted demonstrations that address and provide
guidance for several activities such as: modifying regulations involving effort
reporting that correspond with the Office of Management and Budget circulars,
developing a government-wide professional profile, identifying opportunities to
share administrative infrastructure among categories of research institutions,
and continuing efforts to reduce faculty time utilized on research-related
administration. The organization continues to improve the relationship between
federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and
integrity of STEM administration. &lt;br/&gt;
