Many speculate about physiological and reproductive consequences of age and
social status but few have done more than speculate. With the powerful new
technique of DNA fingerprinting, this relationship can now be systematically
studied. By combining hormonal measurements of estrogen, testosterone and
prolactin with DNA paternity determination and direct behavioral observations,
Dr. Bercovitch will gain new insights into unraveling the association between
social status, reproductive maturation and reproductive success in male rhesus
macaques. Using these primates as a biological model for human physiology and
behavior, he will use this information to develop paradigms for understanding
male life history strategies. Dr. Bercovitch will also explore factors promoting
paternal care and determine the role that hormones and actual paternity have on
this important function. This project represents an integration of molecular
genetic data with hormonal life history theory and behavioral ecology and
provides a innovative framework to understand the mechanisms underlying
variation in male reproductive success.
