A combined numerical modeling and laboratory study will be conducted to simulate
flow in ice covered rivers and channels. Velocity distributions, shear stresses,
and macro turbulence features will be explored for flow under an ice cover and
over an alluvial sediment bed and the dunes which are generated on such a bed.
The computations will use a model which has recently been utilized in a study of
turbulence over a wavy surface. The laboratory experiment will use an existing
sediment flume with simulated ice. Improve accuracy in the prediction of flow
rates, free surface height, and sediment transport under freezing conditions
will have an important impact on environmental and structural issues related to
the hydraulics of ice covered waters.
