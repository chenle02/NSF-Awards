Ninety seventh and eighth grade American Indian students participate in summer
science camps offered at three different locations in the Upper Midwest: Duluth,
Minnesota, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Tama, Iowa. The camp curriculum focuses on
natural resource management issues and American Indian traditions. Participants
conduct scientific research projects in cooperative groups and discuss
scientific research with professional scientists (including American Indian role
models). The program integrates science, mathematics and communication skills
through this informal camp setting. Project follow-up includes participant
newsletters that discuss school science and math topics and their relevance to
the summer camp experiences as well as visits to camp locations for seminars
with parents and participants.
