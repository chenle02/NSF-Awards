The proposed research suggests investigations in the area of Harmonic Analysis
and applications of its methods to Partial Differential Equations and to the
Theory of Integrable Systems. The proposer will apply Littlewood-Paley methods
to develop a unified theory of matrix-weighted function spaces and will also
develop the method of level sets to characterize the estimates on Fourier
Integral Operators with singularities. She will apply the above techniques to
study the solutions of semilinear hyperbolic PDEs in the situation when caustics
appear and to study analytic properties of the Riemann-Hilbert problem that
arise in the Scattering Theory, in the context of completely integrable systems.

Harmonic analysis investigates complex behavior of a system by representing it
as a sum of basic elements (wavelets, atoms, Fourier modes, etc.) behaving in a
simple way. This decomposition becomes the central object of studies in Modern
Analysis. The tools of Harmonic Analysis are widely used in applications which
describe natural phenomena in optics, scattering theory, quantum physics, and
combinatorics. Results in this direction will have immediate applications in
other areas of mathematics and other natural sciences, primarily engineering,
physics, and biology. Central achievements of Harmonic Analysis are widely
embraced in medicine and other disciplines directly benefitting well-being of
humankind.
