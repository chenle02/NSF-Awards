Coarse garnet peridotites that are the principal rock type in the Kaapvaal
craton, southern Africa, have bulk and modal compositions that differ from
oceanic preidotites in being richer in Mg and in enstatite. This distinction is
fundemental in that it implies a difference in the igneous processes through
which continental and oceanic lithospheres have formed. Both continental and
oceanic peridotites appear to be residues and the difference is speculated to
reflect a greater depth of formation for the craton peridotites. In contrast,
the high-temperature peridotites underlying the Kaapvaal craton have
compositions similar to oceanic lithosphere and may have been subducted.
Heterogeneities in mineral distribution in the continental peridotites on a
scale of several centimeters are common and are believed to be caused by
exsolution of diopside and garnet from primary enstatite or pigeonite. Study of
variations in bulk composition that are igneous in origin and that exclude these
subsolidus features requires analytical specimens weighing 0.5-1 kg. This sample
size requirement has limited acquisition of desired data. Collection of
additional large xenoliths, however, is practical. This project will extend
these studies to investigations of the igneous origins of the spinel peridotites
from the top of the lithosphere within the craton and of the the low-Ca garnet
harzburgites that form the root. The high- temperature peridotites underlying
the craton appear from preliminary data to be more fertile towards the north
than are those (subducted?0 beneath the southern margin. This possibility will
be investigated. Bulk, modal and mineral analyses of xenoliths weighing at least
several kg will be combined with isotopic studies at the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism. Determinations of the areal distribution and depths of
origin of Kaapvaal ecligites are planned.
