9351418 Mtenga The objective of this project is to establish facilities for an
undergraduate instructional laboratory in engineering mechanics and structural
engineering courses. The major items requested in this project include: - A
universal test/demonstration frame, together with its attachments. This is
intended for experiments in vector statics and strength of materials. Students
are able to work on this frame on their own as part of laboratory experience. -
A reduced-scale model loading frame, including loading electo-mechanical
actuators and data sensing devices, i.e., load cells, strain gauges and dial
gauges. With the acquisition of these loading frames students are able to build
models and test them in the laboratory, and thus appreciate structural system
performance. - Computer software required for the design courses. Student
performance in the courses that are affected by the facility is monitored and
documented. In addition, performance in other areas of study are monitored,
since some of the courses affected by the facility (vector statics and strength
of materials) are pre-requisites in other areas of the civil engineering
undergraduate program. ***
