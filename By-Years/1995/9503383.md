Polymorphism is a key feature of modern, strongly-typed programming languages
including Ada, C++, and ML. This research program investigates a new approach to
implementing polymorphism, based on associating type information with each
activation of a polymorphic function, rather than with data. This approach
permits type information to be utilized effectively at runtime or link-time, not
just at compile-time. It enables compilers to generate polymorphic object code
from parametrically polymorphic source code, while still using specialized,
space-efficient data formats that can be shared with other software components.
The approach also supports a large variety of powerful non-parametric features
in the source language and in the development and runtime environments. The
focus of the research will be on generating prototype compiler implementations
and language extensions, that can be evaluated using performance benchmarks. The
underlying aim of the research is to make polymorphic programs easier to develop
and to integrate into existing systems, thereby, hastening the acceptance of
modern languages by industrial and commercial users as well as by academics.
