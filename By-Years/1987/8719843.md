This renewal grant, funded jointly by the Special Projects and Inorganic
Chemistry programs, provides for the support of Professors O'Neal, Ring and Tong
at San Diego State University, a predominantely undergraduate institution. The
research is directed at providing fundamental kinetic data for the decomposition
of chlorinated silanes, which is the basis for the production of epitaxial
silicon films, useful in the production of microelectronic devices. The
Principal Investigators propose kinetic techniques which circumvent handling
difficulties of chlorosilanes by integrating two laser-based techniques: Laser
Powered Homogeneous Pyrolysis to induce reaction under wall-less conditions, and
Laser Excited Fluoresence to monitor in-situ the reactions of the intermediates
produced in the pyrolysis. Downstream chromatographic and mass spectroscopic
analysis of the product gases will provide complete kinetic and thermodynamic
data. Three co-principal investigators with complementary backgrounds applicable
to the proposed research (gas phase kinetics and thermodynamics, inorganic
synthesis and mechanisms and laser diagnostics and spectroscopy) will
collaborate in directing this integrated research program. Two undergraduate
students will participate in the research.
