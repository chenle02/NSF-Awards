This project is developing a series of more than 40 videos centered on physical
demonstrations that are ideal for use in introductory astronomy courses. The
short videos are being made publicly available on the web in a variety of
formats and resolutions and easily played or downloaded. The videos are high-
quality and contain overlays of graphics and computer simulations to illuminate
the underlying concepts. Each video is narrated from a script developed by
experts, and thus can be useful in distance education courses as well as in the
classroom. Each video is accompanied by interactive instructional materials to
engage students in the video. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Concepts
from introductory astronomy are identified and ways to illustrate these concepts
using demonstration equipment are being developed. Video scripts clearly
illustrate the phenomena in a time efficient manner while maintaining the
excitement of science. Interactive materials accompany or are incorporated into
each video, based on the recommendations of educational research to maximize
student learning from demonstrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
videos and supporting materials are being made available on the web and on DVD
images that can easily be downloaded and burned. The videos are hosted on the
Astronomy Education web site at the University of Nebraska, a site that is
already widely-used by astronomy faculty. Videos are also being hosted on
Youtube, Vimeo, and incorporated into the web-based homework system of Norton
Publishing. The videos are brief and so are the interactive materials that
accompany them. Thus, astronomy faculty can easily incorporate them into an
existing instructional structure without disruption. Students respond favorably
to the highly-visual nature of the videos, linkages with social media sites, and
the brevity of the videos. These videos are being widely adopted and are widely
useful in the astronomy classroom and in distance education courses.
