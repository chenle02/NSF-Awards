The observation of astrophysical very high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays provides a
window to probe the physical processes of some of the most extreme environments
in the Universe. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located
in the Sierra Negra of Mexico, is one of the world’s most sensitive continuously
operating wide field-of-view VHE gamma-ray telescopes. HAWC observations explore
the origin of cosmic rays, study the acceleration of particles in extreme
physical environments, and search for new TeV-emitting gamma-ray astrophyical
sources. This award to the University of Maryland College Park supports the
continued operation of HAWC, including maintenance of the US data archive and
providing public data access to the observatory’s sky maps and real-time
astrophysical transient alerts. The award also supports HAWC’s public outreach
programs, broadly aimed to provide access to HAWC and astrophysical gamma-ray
science to all age groups, from elementary school students through senior
citizens, and supports activities and resources within the Hispanic-American
community, including bilingual videos and websites.

The HAWC Observatory in the high mountains of Mexico consists of 300 large
water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) surrounded by an outrigger array of 350 smaller
WCDs that extend the energy reach. The Observatory’s wide field-of-view provides
over 95% on-time simultaneous monitoring of two-thirds of the sky each day. This
delivers a continuous deep survey of the TeV-sky that provides sensitivity to
discovery observations of extremely high-energy sources such as galactic
PeVatrons, TeV Halos, and micro-quasars. HAWC provides crucial input to a global
multi-messenger program that searches for transient phenomena like active
galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts, favored sources of gravitational waves,
detected by LIGO/VIRGO, and IceCube Neutrino Observatory-detected high-energy
neutrinos.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
