Physics majors need to know that they will be prepared to perform near the
frontiers of physics after graduations. Chemistry and biology majors need to
know about the physics techniques that will diffuse into their working lives in
the form of new measurement appliances. Non-science majors need to decide
whether they want their taxes (and the price of their telephone service) to pay
for continued exploration of the frontiers. Physics majors will benefit most
obviously from the new equipment: They will probe lower temperatures, shorter
times, and weaker signals than ever before at Millersville. They will measure
the lifetime of the muon, the critical current and critical field of
superconductors, and determine the structure and orientation of crystals. We
plan to set much of our equipment up in mobile stations, for use by advanced
laboratory students, and (in a new step for us) for demonstration in lecture to
introductory students. Introductory students will see the superconducting
transition; see superconductivity destroyed by a magnetic field. They will see
Bragg x-ray diffraction peaks generated in the lecture hall and compare them to
the optical diffraction that they observed in laboratory (and through a slit
formed by their first and second fingers). They will see metal evaporate, travel
through a vacuum, and form a film. They will estimate that thickness using the
same idea (conservation of mass) that connects the slow water inside a hose to
the fast water squirting from its pinched end. We mean to lead introductory
students to believe that they can use the physics they know to understand
reports from the frontiers of physics. If they believe they can understand, then
science has a chance to convince them of the beauty and value of work at the
frontier. We will extend our reach with summer workshops so that teachers can
take the story back to their high school students.
