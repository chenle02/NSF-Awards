The proposed program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an
emphasis on many-body problem in nuclear structure physics, fusion reactions
below the Coulomb barrier, reactions involving heavy-ions, multifragmentation
and phase transitions in nuclei, solar and supernova neutrinos, nucleosynthesis
and other neutrino astrophysics. Theoretical research in these areas is chosen
to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the United
States and abroad. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Work: Successful
completion of the proposed projects will lead to i) A better understanding of
nuclear equation of state for applications in nuclear reactions and nuclear
astrophysics; ii) Understanding dependence of nuclear reactions on the isospin
of the reacting partners through the recently developed techniques of
isoscaling; iii) A better understanding of the neutrino masses and mixings; iv)
Understanding neutrino propagation through dense media and in strong
gravitational fields; v) A better understanding of various aspects of core-
collapse supernovae; vi) A better understanding of the origin of elements,
especially those produced in rapid neutron capture; vii) A better understanding
of fusion in astrophysical environments, and viii) A better understanding of
pairing and elaboration of its role in nuclear many-body problem. Broader
Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Proposed research contributes to
the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed
National Underground Science Laboratory and Rare Ion Accelerator. The proposed
research involves collaboration between University of Wisconsin-Madison and
Michigan State University, University of California at San Diego, and University
of Washington as well as international collaborations between University of
Wisconsin-Madison researchers and those from Brazil, China, France, Italy,
Japan, and Turkey. The principal investigators participate in multidisciplinary
research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and
astrophysics. Both principal investigators are involved in exposing physics to
broader audiences. Balantekin plans to continue playing a major role in
developing National Underground Science Laboratory. In addition to enhancing
research and education infrastructure of the Nation in underground science, this
proposed laboratory will provide outreach to the visitors in general and
regional Native American colleges in particular.
