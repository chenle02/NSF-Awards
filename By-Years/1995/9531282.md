*** 9531282 Chenausky This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will fabricate and demonstrate a prototype air cooled, sealed-off, 33-cm
gain length carbon dioxide laser, having a 40-watt average output power and a
peak output of 1 kilowatt. To achieve this output, the laser will use an
innovative excitation geometry that generates a rectangular cross section
transverse RF discharge between a pair of narrow, low area, closely spaced
ceramic side walls, that transfer heat by collisions from the discharge and
guide the intra-cavity mode in the small transverse dimension. The widely
spaced, low capacitance electrode permits efficient RF discharge pumping with 27
or 13 MHz excitation. This moderates standing wave effects with longitudinal
discharge uniformity but without the use of intra- or extra-vacuum inductive
elements. This unique excitation geometry forces the gas discharge into a shape
that naturally suppresses the tendency of the discharge to transition into the
undesirable gamma or high current mode of operation. Potential commercial
applications are expected in emerging medical-dental procedures using a simple,
low intra-vacuum part count, low cost laser device approach. ***
