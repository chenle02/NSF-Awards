This award supports research in algebraic K-theory, particularly with regard to
the structure and computability of the K-theory of varieties with singularities.
The principal investigator will investigate the relationship between K-theory,
etale cohomology and cyclic homology, via the etale chern character, the
cyclotomic trace and secondary chern character. He also will study the Adams
operations on K-theory, with an eye toward vanishing conjectures for motivic
cohomology and negative K-groups. This research is concerned with algebraic
K-theory. In a broad sense, algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of
concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space. This work has
significant implications for number theory and algebraic geometry, and promises
to make exciting connections between a number of different areas in mathematics.
