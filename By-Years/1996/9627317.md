This proposal requests funds to develop analytical techniques for the platinum
group elements (Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) in oceanic rocks at ultra-trace (as
low as one part per 1012 parts) levels. The ability to make accurate and precise
measurements of the platinum group elements in oceanic rocks at the ultra-trace
level is critical in order to refine models for mantle evolution, mantle
oxidation state, crustal recycling at subduction zones, and other first-order
processes. Further progress in this field requires that laboratory techniques be
improved to lower the elemental detection limits to, in some cases, below one
part in 1012 parts. Recent improvements in instrumentation have made these
ultra-trace element measurements possible in principle, but significant
refinements such as those proposed by the principal investigator are needed in
the associated laboratory techniques in order to make these measurements
practical.
