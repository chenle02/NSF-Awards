This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a
basic understanding of a new machining process called Electrochemical Orbital
Abrading (ECOA). Advanced materials, such as high temperature metal matrix
composites, have properties affording advantageous performance parameters but
which are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to machine. The ECOA machining
process combines several materials removal processes to achieve a viable,
economic machining technology for complex shapes and advanced materials. Phase I
will determine feasibility of the ECOA process as measured by dimensional
accuracy, surface integrity assessments,and surface finish measurements.
Research will focus on basic factors which influence ECOA. Electrolyte, tooling,
and process parameters will be optimized, and the effort will examine more
complex configurations. The electrochemical removal mechanism, electrochemical
grinding characteristics, and the orbital abrasion action will be investigated
in a combined configuration to establish feasibility of maintaining a balance
among these actions. By virtue of anticipated advantages in fast, low-stock
removal with excellent surface finish and integrity, ECOA is expected to find
applications for a very broad cross section of traditional materials and
configurations as generic as tool and diemaking for casting, forging, stamping,
plastic molding, etc. An important application is machining of advanced
materials in industries such as advanced propulsion engines where serious
machining problems are likely to emerge with advanced materials.
