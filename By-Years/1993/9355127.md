9355127 Armaly In this proposal, a five member machine tool research group of
the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics
at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) is requesting funding to support five
NSF traineeship positions per year over five years in the area of machine tool
research. The NSF funding will help to attract capable students, including
minorities and women, into the program. Brief discussions of the identified five
major research projects are given. Opportunities for the trainees to interact
with the Machine Tool Development Group at Lawrence LIvermore National
Laboratory and Cincinnati Milacron, through Cincinnati Milacron Midwestern
Regional Technical Center, have been established. ***
