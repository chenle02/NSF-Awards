Ten evolutionary biologists and ten philosophers of biology will meet for one
week to discuss issues in the foundations of evolutionary biology. The
conference will be broken into ten sessions, each dealing with a particular
topic. No papers will be presented. Instead, a biologist and a philosopher will
be assigned to a particular topic and asked to prepare position papers to be
distributed in advance of the conference. Each session will then be led by these
two. All biologists to be invited are aware of the foundational problems in
their science, and all philosophers to be invited are aware of the empirical
warrant for present-day scientific theories. Differences between the two groups
tend to be in training and emphasis. The purpose of bringing these philosophers
and biologists together is to promote the interdisciplinary investigation of the
fundamental issues confronting evolutionary biology today.
