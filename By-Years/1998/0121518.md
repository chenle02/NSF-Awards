This award is establishing the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL) as a
Collection in the NSDL. An Internet web site is being developed that classifies,
catalogs, links and references information or discovery&lt;br/&gt;material
pertinent to innovations in curricular development and supporting resources in
the analytical sciences. Due to the diverse and multi-disciplinary nature of the
subject, the site is accessible to a wide audience of users, teachers, students,
and practitioners interested in the teaching and delivery of educational
material to improve the literacy, skills and thought processes of analytical
scientists. Of special interest to ASDL is material pertinent to classroom and
laboratory instruction based or inquiry-driven and problem-based learning. A
Review Committee is assuring quality control of material submitted and accepted
into ASDL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
