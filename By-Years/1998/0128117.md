This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will conduct research
to design a system for the unit testing of modules. This system will operate by
automatically capturing events at the boundary of the module under test while a
client of the module executes test cases. These events will be logged to a file
so that they can later be replayed to the module in isolation. It is proposed to
use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) techniques to implement this tool and to
use a third-party open-source licensed tool named AspectJ to implement this tool
for Java. Unit testing solutions offer considerable cost-savings by automating
the recording and playback of events for testing by organizations that either
develop or use software.
