9527364 Arias The goal of these studies is to better understand how the
expression of protein-encoding genes of plants are regulated by environmental
stimuli. A central hypothesis to be tested here is that defense gene expression
in plants is modulated by a phosphorylation-dependent change in the
transcriptional activity of G-box binding factors. Aside from understanding a
process of general importance to all higher eukaryotes the proposed studies may
ultimately lead to the development of novel and sustainable forms of crop
protection. Changes in the transcription activity of plant GBF's in response to
defense cues (eg., nonhost bacterial species or biotic elicitors) cDNA's of
these factors will be fused to a novel DNA-binding domain and expressed in plant
cells containing a reporter gene. Changes in the phosphorylation of these
chimeric GBF's will be assessed by phosphopeptide mapping. Protein kinases that
phosphorylate GBF's in response to defense stimuli will be biochemically
purified to obtain N-terminal sequences for cloning GBF-protein kinase cDNA's.
Cloned putative kinases will be tested in vivo for their ability to
phosphorylate GBF and act in defense-signaling. To identify potential mediators
of plant GBF-dependent transcription a far-western screening of plant cDNA
expression libraries with labeled GBF as probe will be performed. Cloned
proteins will by functionally characterized by standard protein binding and
transfection techniques. %%% Higher plants resist microbial infection in part by
synthesizing phytoalexins. The rapid and transient activation of "defense" genes
that encode for enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis largely determines the
timing and magnitude of this response. Recent evidence suggests that protein
kinases couple defense signal perception to enhanced gene expression. For
example, inhibitors of protein kinases block the expression of plant defense
genes, whereas agents that stimulate protein kinase activities in other metazoan
systems both enhance pla nt defense gene expression and result in the transient
phosphorylation of a few cellular proteins. How plant gene building factors
function in signal-dependent transcription is currently unknown but, like in
animals, may involve changes in the phosphorylation state of the factor. ***
