Narrative generation is the process of generating textual descriptions of action
in dynamic environments such as movies, sports events and educational programs.
On-line narration of a dynamic environment is beneficial in a wide range of
contexts, from entertainment to training and education. For example,
successfully narrating a video would allow blind and visually-impaired people to
follow visual cues that are important to understanding the video. Key to
attaining this goal is the ability to translate natural language into a form
that is understandable by computers. A particular challenge is to do this not
for a specifically chosen domain, but in a general way that is suitable for
adaptation to a wide range of natural dynamic environments. This project
explores new directions to tackle these extremely challenging, yet crucial,
issues, undertaking exploratory research towards building essential components
of a domain-adaptive framework that learns to understand and generate narratives
on-line for natural dynamic environments with minimal supervision by human
experts. This research explores methods to generate narratives on-line by
learning the natural dynamics of the environment, automatically forming
templates, and deciding when and what to mention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many
natural language applications are concerned with recognition of paraphrases and
semantic understanding. The software and data resulting from this project are
potentially useful for semantic analysis in natural language processing, and is
being made available for research purposes. This work is designed for
significant social impact through a broad range of applications including
educational, entertainment, and accessibility. A narrative generation system
could be beneficial to visually-impaired people to better understand videos over
the internet. In addition, such a system can help broadcasting companies to
report news or sports events with customized commentaries for different users.
This project also provides research and collaborative work experience to
undergraduate and graduate students including under-represented and minority
groups. &lt;br/&gt;
