Dr. Patricia M. Takahara has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Takahara received the doctoral degree from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor Stephen
J. Lippard. Dr. Takahara will continue research at the California Institute of
Technology under the sponsorship of Professor Douglas C. Rees. The postdoctoral
research will focus on the determination of the X-ray crystal structure of
succinate quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) from Paracoccus denitrificans. SQR is
important to understand because loss of SQR function has been implicated in
aging and degenerative diseases, and the 3-dimensional crystal structure is
critical for investigating these problems at the molecular level. The work
contributes to techniques and knowledge in metalloprotein crystallography. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
