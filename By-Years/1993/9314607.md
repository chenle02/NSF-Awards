9314607 Zannis This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in genetics between Vassilis Zannis of Boston University and Jean Chambaz of the
Department of Cellular Biology, Hotel Dieu. The Hotel Dieu is a major hospital
located in Paris. The objectives of their research are to isolate and
characterize the tissue specific transcriptional regulators of the ApoA-II
(apolipoprotein) gene from mice. The regulation of apolipoproteins is important
since they determine the cellular recognition and catabolism of lipoproteins by
cell receptors. They also play a role in the maintenance of cellular cholesterol
homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The U.S. investigator,
who is a biochemist, brings to this collaboration expertise in lipoprotein
research, including structure and function of the apolipoprotein and gene
regulation. This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in cell
biology and gene expression. The project also takes advantage of a transgenic
mouse facility at the Hotel Dieu where most of the testing will take place. ***
