Tuscaloosa Dr. Lowell Kispert and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa are being supported to continue a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1996-98, thirteen undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer
actively engaged in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of
chemistry and biochemistry, with one student specializing in ethical issues. In
addition to individualized research projects and seminars in chemistry, the
program features an ethics component in which participants develop a teaching
module with ethical issues that would be pertinent to students in chemistry.
Participants are recruited primarily from small colleges located east of the
Mississippi River including predominantly minority institutions.
