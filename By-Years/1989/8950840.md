This project implements the use of NMR in the undergraduate curriculum at
Arkansas College. This instrument impacts on the Physical, Instrumental and
Organic laboratories. The instrument is utilized in instrumental chemistry by
emphasizing how the instrument works, its capabilities, spectral interpretation
and elucidation of structures. In organic chemist the NMR is used in conjunction
with the FTIR and UV- Visible spectrometers to elucidate structures, to
determine unknowns, and to analyze products form syntheses. For Physical
Chemistry, the NMR is used for the investigation of a 3-component phase diagram.
Each student in advanced chemistry benefits from hands-on experience with the
NMR. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
