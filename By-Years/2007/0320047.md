This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a novel
cell therapy using adult stem cells to treat diseases of the central nervous
system. A specific stem cell (CD34 "Lin") within adult bone marrow has been
isolated that can be induced to express a neuronal phenotype and specifically
home to the brain. This project hypothesizes that the multipotential nature of
these cells will enable cell replacement and drug delivery therapies to treat
diseases or injury of the nervous system, including Parkinson's and stroke. The
Phase I project will address isolation and characterization, in vitro
differentiation, and in vivo differentiation of CD34 "Lin" cells. The commercial
application of this project is in human healthcare. The technology could lead to
potential therapeutic treatments for devastating diseases such as Parkinson's
disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Each of these diseases represents a
substantial number of patients and therefore, a substantial market opportunity.
Furthermore, particularly for diseases such as stroke, Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's, there are few, if any alternative strategies currently available.
Other cell therapies are being developed, but most of these are derived from
fetal tissue or xenogeneic sources, which introduce safety or ethical concerns.
