Over the past 15 years, processor speeds in modern computers have increased at
a much faster rate than main memory speeds. Thus, relative memory latencies in
both sequential and parallel computers have become quite large, and continue to
increase rapidly. Such trends form the motivation for this research, which
attacks the issues of how to monitor, analyze and improve computer performance
in the face of a large processor-memory performance gap. Because of this
performance gap, it becomes increasingly important to develop performance
monitoring systems that allow programmers, compiler writers, and system
designers to identify and tune portions of their design where memory overhead is
limiting performance. To accomplish these goals, this project focuses on several
area: (i) exploring hybrids of compile-time and run-time software-based
techniques for application memory performance analysis, (ii) combining these
hybrid monitoring techniques with dynamic compilation to implement flexible,
low-overhead, detailed performance tools, (iii) designing and implementing
novel, software-aware, hardware performance monitoring techniques, and (iv)
designing software tools based on this novel hardware support. By studying both
hardware and software solutions concurrently, one gains insights into the strong
and weak points of each approach. The end result of this research is a suite of
performance tools that span a range in the level of monitoring detail provided
and the level of hardware support required.
