Nitrogen fixation rates are generally lower in estuaries and coastal marine
ecosystems than in freshwater lakes; this difference is a major reason that
phosphous limitation is more likely in lakes and nitrogen limitation is more
likely in marine ecosystems. Two hypotheses to explain this difference are
prominent in the literature: 1.) trace meals required for nitrogen fixation
(molybdenum, iron) are less available in seawater than in freshwater; and 2.)
nitrogen fixation is favored by anoxic microzones, and these zones are more
likely in lakes because of lower turbulence and higher dissolved organic carbon
concentrations. Howarth proposes to directly test these two hypotheses with
ecosystem-scale experiments and observations. He will also investigate other
possible interactions among physical and biogeochemical factors in regulating
nitrogen fixation, such as the influence of turbulence on stratification (and
therefore average light intensity) in regulating nitrogen fixation. His approach
consists of mesocosm and whole-lake experiments and of ecosystem-scale
observations in a diverse set of systems, including salt lakes and turbulent
freshwater lakes. He will use models (conceptual, statistical, and simulation)
to focus and guide the research. Howarth is a leader in the area of
biogeochemistry and the facilities provided by Cornell University are
outstanding.
