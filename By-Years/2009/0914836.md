ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Rojkovskaia, Natalia Proposal Number: DMS - 0914836
Institution: Kansas State University Title: Graduate Research Conference in
Algebra and Representation Theory

The Second Graduate Research Conference in Algebra and Representation Theory
will be hosted by Kansas State University (Manhattan) at the end of the Spring
semester, 2009. The dates of the event are May 23-May 25, 2009. The conference
features two one-hour lectures by keynote speakers in the fields of algebra and
representation theory. The rest of the talks will be 20/40 minutes in length and
will be presented by graduate students. The organization of the conference is
also taken by graduate students from the hosting university.

The topics of the conference cover interactions between algebra and
representation theory, in particular, ring theory, commutative algebra and its
applications to algebraic geometry, homology theory, representations of finite
groups, Hecke algebras, algebraic groups, quantum groups, Lie algebras, vertex
operator algebras. One of the main goals of the conference is to increase the
interaction of graduate students from different universities. The participants
will communicate on the research progress, develop presentational skills, get
aquainted with future collegues and find the connections for future
collaboration. Women and minorities are encouraged to particiapte in the
conference.
