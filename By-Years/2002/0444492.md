This conference, Advancing Knowledge and the Knowledge Economy, will bring
together a large body of research for the first time in a way that gives
participants and audience a coherent high-level perspective on what is known
about how information and communications technologies (ICTs) and economic
context are affecting knowledge processes and activities, how the economics of
knowledge are changing with the emergence of distributed systems of innovation
and learning, and the challenge of crafting public policies to advance the
generation and effective utilization of knowledge. The conference will convey
the importance of emerging issues in the management and economics of knowledge,
including the design of cyberinfrastructure, to the international science and
technology policy community.
