This project is devoted to understanding physical phenomena in liquids at small
length scales. One main challenge is to characterize the dynamics of contact
lines through novel applications of asymptotic and variational techniques. The
role of surfactants, surface defects, and electrostatic control will be
explored. Instability-driven pattern formation and coarsening behavior will be
another focus of study. Finally, numerical methods based on boundary integral
and finite element techniques will be developed both for experimentation and
technological applications.

The behavior of fluids at small scales poses a set of challenging scientific
problems, with applications to subjects as diverse as industrial coatings,
microscopic mechanical devices, and collective bacterial motion. The proposed
projects are intended to not only extend fundamental theoretical knowledge, but
to develop models and algorithms that have predictive capabilities. These will
be crucial for engineering present day and cutting edge microfluidic
applications.
