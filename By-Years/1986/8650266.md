In order to meet the needs of laboratory courses in mechanical engineering by
introducing new and sophisticated data acquisition methods, additional equipment
has been acquired to complement the single data acquisition system previously
available. The needs of three laboratory courses are now being met, and the
laboratory experiences of the students are modernized and updated.
