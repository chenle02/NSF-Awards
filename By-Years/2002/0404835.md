0102565&lt;br/&gt;Egami&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Complex electronic oxides that
show remarkable properties, such as the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR)
manganites and the high-temperature superconductive cuprates, have atomic and
nano-scale local structures that are distinct from the average crystal
structure, and these local structures more directly influence their electronic
properties than the average structure does. The goal of this project is to
determine the local structure of complex electronic oxides using pulsed neutron
scattering, synchrotron x-ray scattering and modeling. We directly determine the
distances between atoms using the method of the atomic pair-density function
(PDF) analysis of the total scattering data including diffuse scattering.
&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge obtained by this project would form a
scientific basis for the rapidly developing technology of highly sensitive
oxides, and would suggest ways of improving their performance. This project is
also related to the effort to upgrade a pulsed neutron powder diffraction
beamline, NPD, at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, supported by the NSF
and DOE.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
