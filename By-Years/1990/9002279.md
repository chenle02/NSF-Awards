This proposal is aimed at providing a comprehensive experimental study of
condensed phase dynamical processes using femtosecond to microsecond time
resolved spectroscopic techniques. Phase transitions and intermolecular or
interionic vibrational motions will be studied in liquids at various
temperatures and pressures to elucidate the nature of liquid state molecular
motion, the extent of inhomogeneity in simple liquids, and the persistence of
local liquid structure.
