This award provides funds for Dr. James Feathers to purchase equipment for the
thermolumenescence laboratory at the University of Washington and to analyze a
series of samples of archaeological significance. In early 1996 Dr. Feathers
conducted geological fieldwork in South Africa and collected sediment samples
from a series of sites which contain Howieson's Poort and Middle Stone Age
industries. Because these materials lie beyond the range of radiocarbon dating
and rest in sediments not amenable to other potassium-argon dating, their age is
very poorly known. Dr. Feathers will utilize thermolumenescence dating to
address this problem. Anthropologists want to know when, and in what conditions,
anatomically and behaviorally modern humans first appeared and recent fossil and
genetic evidence points to sub-Saharan Africa. However relevant hominid remains
are extremely scarce and the question remains unsettled. Dr. Feathers and other
archaeologists have noted an extremely unusual stone industry which appears for
a relatively brief interval of time and which may be coincident with the first
evidence of anatomically modern humans in the paleontological record. Known as
the Howieson's Poort it contains types of tools which did not occur outside of
South Africa and which reappear only much later in the archaeological record. In
this latter period they are clearly associated with anatomically modern humans.
The Howieson's Poort and the Middle Stone Age industry which both proceeds and
follows it are very poorly dated. Dr. Feather's work should change this
situation. The thermolumenescence (TL) technique is of great potential
significance to archaeologists because it can date types of materials and time
periods which lie beyond the scope of radiocarbon. However the approach is not
developed enough to apply on a mechanistic basis and no laboratory in the United
States has a focus on TL dating of archaeological significant materials. Dr.
Feathers research is important not only for the archaeological question it
addresses but also for its methodological and infrastructural contributions.
