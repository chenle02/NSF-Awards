Fundamental questions of programming language semantics will be examined through
the utilization of algebras, categories, and monads in an effort to provide a
systematic and conceptual approach to their interpretation and solution. Areas
of investigation include algebraic fixed point semantics, categorical models
with strong closure properties, axiomatic domain theory, monadic and comonadic
computation, partial data types, invariant objects, and categorical iterators.
