Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to develop mechanism-
based multiscale modeling and simulation to understand dislocation behavior in
strained heteroepitaxial layer structures, which has been of central interest in
developing high-speed microelectronics in the semiconductor industry. Discrete
dislocation nucleation, motion, and interaction will be studied by incorporating
atomistic information into a variational boundary integral method in the
Peierls-Nabarro framework. Critical conditions for dislocation nucleation from
the perfect surface and surface heterogeneities such as ledges, defects,
microcracks, and quantum dots will be determined by solving the embryonic
saddle-point dislocation configurations and their associated thermal activation
energies. Short-range dislocation interactions and the effect of lattice
resistance to dislocation motion will be evaluated as well. Collective behavior
of dislocations will be investigated by incorporating the obtained mechanisms of
dislocation nucleation, interaction, and motion into a finite element enhanced
dislocation dynamics simulation, which has been developed in collaboration with
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The emphasis will be placed on
fundamental mechanisms of threading dislocation density reduction and
dislocation pattern formation in strained heteroexpitaxial layer
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education plan consists of the
development of the new laboratory and curriculum that emphasize mechanics and
materials at the small scale and interdisciplinary education at UC Riverside.
Extra efforts will be made to enhance undergraduate students' interest in
science and engineering. The objective is to develop a first-rate new mechanics
and materials education program that meets the future demands of nanoscale
science and engineering. The proposed education and research plans are
integrated to reinforce each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
