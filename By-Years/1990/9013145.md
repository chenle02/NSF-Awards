The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important tool available to
organic and inorganic chemists for structure determination and it is becoming a
significantly useful technique for analytical chemists and biochemists. This
award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to the Department of Chemistry
at Florida Institute of Technology, an undergraduate institution, will improve
the ability of the Department to educate undergraduate students and will enhance
chemical research on the following projects: 1. "Annulated Dewar Benzenes and
Ä±n!Paracyclophanes" 2. "Asymmetric Inverse Electron Demand Diels-Alder Reactions
Between Furan and Chiral Vinyl Ethers" 3. "Addition of Diazocarbonyl Compounds
to Furans: Mechanism, Scope, and Synthesis of Lipoxygenase Products" 4. "The
Search for Drugs from the Sea."
