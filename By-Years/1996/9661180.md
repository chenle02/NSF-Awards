*** 96-61180 Djuth This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop solid state transmit/receive modules that are optimized for
remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. Such
units would pave the way for a new generation of UHF phased array radar having
greatly improved system performance and flexibility. Projected system costs are
significantly less than those of traditional radar. Phase I will develop a new
solid-state power amplifier, complementary antenna design, and an improved low-
temperature transmit/receive switch. A shift away from high-power tube
amplifiers to distributed solid-state units will be examined. The new radar can
be configured for rapid tracking of dynamic geophysical events from the zenith
to low elevation angles. Because the system architecture is modular, it is well-
suited for radar interferometry and can be incrementally expanded to sizes
characteristic of a powerful incoherent scatter radar. A very high sensitivity
radar would require 4000-5000 modules. Potential commercial applications include
incoherent scatter radar development, radar tracking and imaging of airborne
"hard targets," meteorological aids, radar wind profiling in the stratosphere
and troposphere, high-power ground penetrating radars (for hydrological studies,
detection of hazardous waste, oil/gas reserves), pagers, cellular telephone
systems, and military communications. ***
