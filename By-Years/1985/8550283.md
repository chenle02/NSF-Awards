The University of California, Santa Barbara, will develop and implement
classroom curricula, both content and methods of instruction, through site-based
change over a period of three years. During the first year, the project will
initially involve seven schools from Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. This
will be expanded to 13 in year two and to a total of 19 schools in the third
year. Teaching specialists, classroom teachers who have been selected and
trained to act as resource persons and trainers for their colleagues, will serve
for one year on a rotating basis. The project provides an opportunity for
administrators, parents, the community and teachers to work together. It
provides training and ongoing support for a cadre of lead teachers, to develop
methods that assess student understanding. The activities of the Tri-County
Mathematics Project and the UCLA Partnership have been incorporated in the
project. Much of the in-school activities will be carried out during one
released day each month and six hours per month of after- school meetings.
