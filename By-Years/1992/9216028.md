The global environment is a major issue between industrial and developing
countries. The proposals advanced by the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro during June 1992 relating the environment with international debt,
investment and technology policies are properly regarded as general equilibrium
phenomena, centering on the behavior of markets. This is because the
environmental actions of a country affect the others, and the markets for
environmental resources affect all other markets. This project addresses the
following unanswered questions: Why do developing countries specialize in the
production and the export of goods which overuse environmental inputs such as
rain forests? What is the role of international trade in global environmental
issues? Is it possible to protect resources without interfering with free
markets? When is market intervention required? Will taxes on the use of
environmental resources improve the pattern of trade and of resource use? The
research is based on the analysis of a general equilibrium model of North-South
trade where the environment appears as a renewable common property resource such
as aquifers, fisheries and forests, whose by-products are used as inputs to the
production of traded goods. The data will be provided by simulating the model
for representative examples, and used as a foundation for evaluating two
alternative policies. The first is levying taxes or imposing quotas on the use
of the environmental resources. The second is promoting changes in property
rights for the environmental common property resources. The simulations use
parameters obtained from innovative arrangements involving property rights in
the case of the US and UK pharmaceutical industries and Central and South
American rain forests. Illustrative case studies are given by two pharmaceutical
companies in the US: Shaman Pharmaceutical of California, and Merck and Co. of
New Jersey. Both use biodiversity from Latin American and Central American
forests to develop medical products.
