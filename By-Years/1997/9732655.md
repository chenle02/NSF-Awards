This is a planning award to investigate systems and software aspects of RAID
systems in which system development can benefit from theoretical research. The
goal is to formulate research problems that combine theory and systems efforts
to affect the design and performance of the next generation of RAID systems. The
focus will be in four areas: data layouts that tolerate multiple faults; on-line
extendibility of disk arrays, in which new disks are added to a running system;
efficient implementation of data-layout mappings; and the effect of system-level
optimizations such as large read and write optimizations. Collaborations with
experimental RAID groups (such as Carnegie-Mellon University, UCSD, and IBM
Almaden) will be pursued, with the goal of obtaining new research topics and new
metrics.
