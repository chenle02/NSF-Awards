This is an experimental investigation of photonic band structure and its effects
on localization of light in disordered optical superlattices. Photonic band
structure will be measured in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum
in colloidal crystals. In crystals with high refractive index contrast, photon
localization will be pursued by introduction of appropriate disorder. Picosecond
time-of-flight, coherent backscattering, and speckle spectroscopy will be among
the probes used to examine photon transport in these materials. The results of
this research will advance the understanding of localization and transport
properties of classical waves in random media as well as electron localization
in disordered conductors.
