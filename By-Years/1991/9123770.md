This is an award to provide support for a project, the objective of which is to
devise and verify mathematical models that characterize the removal of soluble
manganese from natural water by filter media that have become coated with oxides
of manganese. The mathematical models to be devised will be based upon
fundamental principles of surface chemistry and mass transfer. Model parameters
will be experimentally evaluated at laboratory-scale, and the models verified by
conduct of field-scale research at the City of Durham, North Carolina's Williams
Water Treatment Plant and at the Blacksburg-Christiansburg- Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University Water Treatment Plant. Results of this project
are expected to provide a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by
which manganese in solution is removed from water by contact with filter media
coated with the contaminant's oxide. This knowledge may be applied to improving
the engineering design of water treatment processes for removal of soluble
manganese.
