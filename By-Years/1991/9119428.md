The research will extend the time scale concepts to cover long range dynamics,
develop new numerical techniques such as multi-rate integration technique and
also investigate new numerical algorithms for parallel processing. The conjugate
gradient approach which is widely used in solving linear equations in other
engineering systems on a parallel mode will be intensely investigated to achieve
high speed simulation of transients in power systems. In addition a
theoretically sound and complete study of voltage collapse study will be done
based on a new form of linearized analysis. Just as in the case of previous
proposals where we provided an update on the "Energy Function Analysis In Power
Systems" through a research monograph, we plan to write a research monograph on
at least one of the following topics (i) small signal analysis or (ii) voltage
stability. We consider this as one essential element in development of education
and human resources in power engineering community.
