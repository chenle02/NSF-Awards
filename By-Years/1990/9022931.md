This project supports a cultural anthropology student investigating the role of
values in the career choices of nurses in the Chicago area. The project will
investigate how female student and professional nurses conceptualize and talk
about their values and relate their values to their reasons for entering,
remaining in, and leaving nursing. Using the methods of intensive interviewing
and textual analysis of transcripts, the student will use computer text
management programs to identify and analyze key concepts and terms relating
values to career choices. This research is important because the relation
between values and decisions is assumed to be direct and important, in that
decisions flow directly from values. Research using powerful computer methods of
analysis such as used here can help reveal the structure of the relationship and
help understand job satisfaction in general, and help identify ways to make
nursing a more attractive profession in particular.
