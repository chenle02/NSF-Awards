9417446 Carter This award provides funding to the NOAA Geosciences Laboratory,
Table Mountain, Boulder, Colorado for three years of support of an absolute
gravity measuring facility which will be operated for the use of the
academically based U.S. geophysics research community. The NOAA Geosciences
Laboratory will house a new absolute gravity meter system recently acquired by
the University of Colorado, periodically calibrate the instrument and keep it in
repair as needed, and provide field engineering assistance to users of the
facility during field deployments of the instrument package. The instrument will
be used primarily in basic and applied studies of global sea level, mountain
building, crustal deformation, earthquakes, and the detection of underground
movement of water and magma. ***
