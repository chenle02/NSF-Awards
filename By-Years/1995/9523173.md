Japan earthquake is being funded through the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research program. The investigator will visit Japan to collect, consolidate and
evaluate casualty data available to date and develop contacts for future
research collaboration. The impacts of such patterns as structural failures and
the behavior of residents on casualty rates will be assessed, along with the
implications of the Kobe experience for at-risk communities in the U.S. ***
