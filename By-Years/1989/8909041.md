The objective of this research is to characterize the relationship between
synaptic structure and function in the cardiac ganglion of the frog >Xenopus
laevis.> Each parasympathetic neuron in the ganglion is innervated by an axon
which deposits several synaptic boutons on its cell body. Extracellular
recording techniques will be used to monitor the release of transmitter from
individual synaptic boutons. Voltage clamp techniques will be used to measure
the quantum content, >m,> and to calculate the number of quanta available for
release, >n,> which will be compared to the number of active zones. The total
number of synaptic boutons on the ganglion cell body is correlated with target
cell size in adults. Voltage clamp techniques will be used to learn whether
inputs with more synaptic boutons elicit proportionately more synaptic current
when stimulated. The functional significance of the observed parallel increase
in both cell size and bouton number during postmetamorphic growth will be
assessed, again with voltage clamp techniques. If transmitter release from
individual boutons elicits a constant amount of synaptic current, regardless of
the stage of growth, then synaptic boutons presumably represent functional units
of synaptic growth. These studies should increase our understanding of the
relationship between the structure, function and growth of interneuronal
synapses.
