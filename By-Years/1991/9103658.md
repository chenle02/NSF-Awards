The proposed study is part of an on-going project to determine the cellular
basis of cytoplasmic inheritance in alfalfa. This species is one of a few in
which there is a predominance of male plastid transmission to the offspring, and
for which considerable genetic data are available. Plastid transmission is under
genetic control, and genotypes have been characterized as strong,intermediate or
weak male or females, according to their plastid transmission frequencies. To
date the PI's laboratory has used quantitative, three dimensional
ultrastructure, along with a DNA-specific fluorochrome, to analyze generative
cells and sperm cells of strong and weak male lines. The first objective of the
proposed research is to compare the egg cells of strong and weak females to
determine whether egg composition before fertilization is a determining factor
in plastid inheritance, as preliminary data suggest. Further studies will
analyze fertilized eggs (zygotes) and early embryos in order to follow the
specific fates of male and female plastids during these critical stages of
embryogenesis. This research will complement other studies utilizing techniques
of classical and molecular genetics, and promise to be invaluable for providing
cytological explanations for observed patterns of cytoplasmic organelle
inheritance in an economically important plant.
