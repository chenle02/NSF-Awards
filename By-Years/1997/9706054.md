9706054 Wiedenbeck This grant provides $160,000 as two years of facility support
for the University of New Mexico/Sandia National Laboratory Ion Microprobe
Facility. This grant is a renewal of current EAR/IF support (EAR-9506611) of
this facility. The UNM/SNL facility provides access to a Cameca ims 4f secondary
ion microprobe (SIMS) for 50% of the operational time of this instrument. The
remaining instrument time is allocated to DOE/SNL researchers as DOE provides
laboratory space and originally purchased the instrument. Specifically, funds
will provide half-time salary support and associated fringe and indirect costs
for a senior researcher and a research associate and laboratory consumables.
This facility provides high spatial resolution trace element analyses of
geologic and planetary materials for studies in igneous and planetary petrology
and geochemistry. Development of analytical techniques for isotopic measurements
are underway. ***
