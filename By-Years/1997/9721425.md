Experimental research will be carried out on the basic physics of dense plasmas.
The intention is to diagnose these plasmas by measureing the thermally excited
electron density fluctuation spectrum using light scattering, by measureing
transport and by examining spetral line profiles on laser produced plasmas to
obtain information on electric field fluctuations.
