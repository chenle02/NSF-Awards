This award supports cooperative research on Isolation of Iron Binding Protein
of Reticulocyte Coated Vesicles between Jonathan Glass of Louisiana State
University and Marco Tulio Nunez of the University of Chile. These two
scientists have had a long and productive collaboration and in addition,
interactions with other researchers in both countries. Because of Glass's
expertise in cell biology of iron metabolism, the first two tasks, development
of an assay to detect an iron binding protein and its isolation will take place
in his laboratory. Rapid progress is expected. Nunez will participate in this
phase and then take the assay to Chile where the role of electrochemical
gradients on translocation of iron across coated vesicle membranes will be
studied. The Chileans have expertise in conduction across lipid bilayers and
transport across vesicle membranes not available at LSU. Much of the preliminary
work on this project has already been carried out. The collaboration has been
productive and it is likely that significant data will be generated. This will
add to the small amount of knowledge about iron transport across membranes in
reticulocytes. Because the assay development will take place at LSU, work will
be carried on in Chile which could not otherwise. This will benefit the
university in Chile and the students there while LSU benefits from an
experienced Latin American scientist.
