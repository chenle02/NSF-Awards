Theoretical research will be conducted on materials for which electron
correlations play a fundamental role, focusing on heavy fermion and high-
temperature superconductors. The heavy fermion system will be attacked using
both phenomenological techniques and fundamental studies of microscopic origins
with an emphasis on the coupling of the superconducting order parameter with the
staggered magnetization. For high-temperature superconductors, analysis will be
conducted on the theoretical basis for photoemission experiments. Variational
Monte Carlo techniques will be used to study the interplay between correlation
and disorder in both of these systems. %%% Theoretical research will be
undertaken on fundamental issues relating to two very important systems of
current interest: high- temperature superconductors and heavy fermion
superconductors. Insight into both of these systems will affect basic concepts
of condensed matter and materials physics, yet has the potential to have
significant payoff in the commercial arena.
