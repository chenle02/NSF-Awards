This project provides partial support for young investigators, postdoctoral
researchers, graduate students, and scholars from underrepresented groups to
attend the second International Conference on Industrial and Applied Mathematics
in Washington, D.C. in July of 1991. This international conference is being
sponsored by Gesellschaft fuer Angewandte Mathematik and Mechanik (German
speaking countries), Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications (United
Kingdom), Societa Italiana de Matematica Applicata e Industriale (Italy),
Societe de Mathematiques Appliquees et Industrielles (France) and the Society of
Industrial and Applied Mathematics (United States). The conference will focus on
timely topics in applied and computational mathematics, computer science,
applied probability and statistics, scientific computing, and applications of
mathematical and computational methods in engineering and biological, chemical,
and physical sciences.
