This award will support U.S. participation in the Third Internation- al Meeting
on P4 and P2-related Phages to take place in Gargnano, Italy on May 17-19, 1990.
The meeting is being jointly organized by Professor Richard Calendar of the
University of California- Berkeley and Professor Gianni Deho of the Universita
degli Studi di Milano. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together
scientists from the major laboratories invoved in P2/P4 phage work, in order to
share experimental results of the last three years and to plan future research
and collaborations. Due to the small number of laboratories working in this
field, many of them European, collaborative efforts have proven extremely
valuable in the past and arise naturally out of the close interaction provided
by these meetings. Previous meetings have significantly furthered productive
interactions in the P2/P4 community. This meeting also will provide an
opportunity to plan future research efforts so that progress will continue in a
wide variety of areas and, at the same time, prevent duplication of effort.
