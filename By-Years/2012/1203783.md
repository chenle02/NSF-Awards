Records of baseline ocean-atmosphere variability provide critical context for
understanding changes in mean climate state. However, ocean-atmosphere
variability is not well understood during the time between the anomalous
Medieval Warm Period/Little Ice Age and the present (the last ~500-800 years).
This project-- a collaboration between Columbia University's Lamont Doherty
Earth Observatory and Stanford University-- will develop a proxy record of
variability in the western tropical Pacific over the past 500+ years. Coral
cores collected from giant Porites colonies in Ta'u Island, American Samoa, will
be analyzed for interannual- to centennial-scale variability in temperature and
salinity (Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes), indicating changes in the extent of the
South Pacific Convergence Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will
partner with the National Park of American Samoa to construct an exhibit
illustrating the use of long coral cores to study environmental change. This
exhibit, displayed at the park's information center, will include Ta'u coral
core material and data associated with this study. The project will support a
post-doctoral researcher at Lamont and a graduate student at Stanford.
