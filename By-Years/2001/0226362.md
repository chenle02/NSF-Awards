EAR-0226362&lt;br/&gt;Waychunas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience and
nanotechnology have emerged as major national goals as evidenced by the
requested FY 2002 federal budget. The Earth science community has clearly
identified nanoscience in the environment as an emerging field (National Academy
of Sciences BROES report, Jordan et al. 2001). Earth science researchers have
recognized the potential importance of studies of nanophase materials and have
begun to develop specific research targets. Accordingly, this award will co-fund
(with the National Research Council) an invitational workshop of approximately
50 people to assess the opportunities and challenges in the field, as well as
the pertinent connections between nanogeoscience and more traditional chemical
or materials-based nanoscience, and write a report of no more than 15 pages in
the course of a 2.5 day meeting in June 2002 at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
