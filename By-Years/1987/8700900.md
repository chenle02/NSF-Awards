Professors W. P. Pratt, J. Bass, and P. A. Schroeder propose three research
projects. Using their ultralow temperature, very high precision transport
measuring system, they will continue their study of the alkali metals. Because
the electronic structure of such metals is very simple, the proposed
measurements can be used to elucidate a number of transport phenomena important
for electric conduction in metals. In particular, the nature of electron-
dislocation scattering and the possible effects of Charge-Density-Wave effects
will be studied. The transport properties of silver and other metallic sinters
will be studied so as to obtain information about electron behavior in a system
with complex geometry. A variety of layered metallic superlattices will be
fabricated and transport and other measurements will be made.
