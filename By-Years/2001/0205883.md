The Educational Develpoment Center (EDC) and National Institute on Out-of-School
Time (NIOST), in collaboration with science centers in AZ, MA, TX, NY, NC and
CA, will develop and implement a science curriculum for informal audiences
targeting children ages 8-12. Each science center will work with six community
centers that serve youth in after-school programs. Science center staff will
train after-school program leaders from the 36 community centers at monthly
sessions, in addition to holding monthly events for families. Curriculum
development will use interesting topics aligned with national standards and
structure investigations as games using simple materials. The units will enable
children to work in teams, and include follow-up, discussion and extended
investigations using websites. It is anticipated that each child will complete
4-6 related investigations. While the six science centers will provide the
content expertise, EDC and NIOST will develop the training and assessment
program and provide additional technical support for the community centers. The
result will be a model to support out-of-school programs that combines science
centers and community resource people, centered around an activity-based
curriculum focused on inquiry. Up to 1,000 children will be involved in field
tests each summer. This proposal builds on "Design It!" (ESI 98-14765), which
created an informal science curriculum focused on engineering principles.
