In this project, the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Science at Case
Western -. Reserve University (OEC) further realizes the potential of World Wide
Web to be a major ". resource for learning and practice of responsible practice
in science and engineering. The OEC, which is staffed primarily by students, has
become the foremost Web site for science and engineering ethics. It serves a
wide audience ranging from pre-college students to distinguished senior
practitioners and research investigators This project builds on and advances the
ease of navigation, accessibility, responsiveness to users, and organization of
content for which it is already known. Through a multi-site collaboration, the
OEC advances learning and understanding of science and engineering ethics in the
following areas: .Social and Ethical Implications of Information and
Communication Technology, led by Joseph Herkert, North Carolina State
University. Computer Ethics for Software Engineers and other Computing
Professionals: led by Keith Miller, University of Illinois at Springfield.
Academic Integrity: Cases and Commentaries for Scientists and Engineers, led by
Elizabeth Kiss, the Kenan Institute for Ethics, Duke University and Daisy
Waryold, The Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University. .Ethical Issues in
Genomics and Biotechnology: Cases and Commentaries,1ed by Elizabeth Kiss, the
Kenan Institute for Ethics and Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy, Duke
University. .Ethics Education in Conjunction with Senior Design Projects or
Thesis, led by Elysa Koppelman, Oakland University

Through further indexing, organizing, and adding key words to materials on the
site, the OEC will greatly aid those seeking to find information on the topics
addressed on the OEC s pages. The organization of information extends to
indexing of our introduction to materials maintained by others. This project
sets the stage for still wider collaboration through the development of pilot
collaborations between junior scholars in the U.S. and their colleagues in other
countries.
