This project addresses the issue of functionality placement in virtualized
networks. Functionality placement is the mapping of virtualized functions onto
the network substrate and is a key part of using network virtualization to
create sophisticated multitenant applications on top of virtualized network
"slices". Prior work only considered virtualizing of communications links via
methodologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN). This project will
demonstrate how one can implement network virtualization by utilizing only the
edge of the physical network (which would make deployment much simpler) and how
one can apply these ideas to higher-level functions (e.g., firewalls, proxy
caches) and not just L2/L3 switches as are typically
considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud Computing is rapidly changing the face of
computing infrastructure and is a major economic driver in the technology
sector. This project will benefit the cloud computing industry by informing the
design of future cloud computing infrastructure and contributing prototype
implementations the research community as open-source code.
