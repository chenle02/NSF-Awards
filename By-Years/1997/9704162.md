9704162 Ben-Amotz A Near-IR-Raman-Imaging Microscope (NIRIM) instrument for 2-D
spectro-chemical analysis of micro-composites and bio-materials will be
developed and constructed in the Purdue University Department of Chemistry
Departmental Laser Facility. The proposed instrument builds on recent advances
in micro-Raman and "optical tweezer" technologies to produce an instrument with
capabilities that significantly surpass current commercial or research
instruments. In particular, the proposed NIRIM instrument will simultaneously
collect 3-D data cubes of x, y and wavelength information from micro-composites
and particles (with sub-micron spatial resolution and 4 cm-1 frequency
resolution). The near-IR Raman excitation laser will be capable of functioning
as an "optical tweezer" used to grab, separate and hold micro- and bio-particles
for chemical analysis. This new instrument will be used in a wide variety inter-
disciplinary applications ranging from studies of molecular wires, zeolite based
sensors, self-assembled composites, semiconductor microstructures and novel
optical data storage schemes, to chemical mapping of clay and ice particles,
drug suspensions, model membranes and living cells ***
