This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility a world wide web based library on machineable process simulation
in Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM). It will develop robust and well-defined
interfaces between web protocols and CAM modules. A reliable security scheme
will also be developed to offer adequate protection for the transmission and
storing of sensitive design data. An innovative feature of the concept is early
involvement of actual floor personnel from over one hundred small- and medium-
sized businesses to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The research
will also develop an adequate on-line, self-paced training facility with
extensive design and analysis examples, application, and utilization notes. A
low cost, pay-per-use, machinable process design and manufacture service is
expected to have widespread use in the commercial manufacturing sector.
