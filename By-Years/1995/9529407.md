9529407 Gross The PI requests funding to purchase a physical and geophysical
survey system for coastal and inter-coastal waterways. This system consists of a
specially designed catamaran hull outfitted with an Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP), a CTD, a sidescan sonar, differential GPS and a data logging
computer. The system will be used to provide detailed data on currents,
dissolved and suspended particles and the geomorphology of the seabed in shallow
water environments. Two-thirds of the funding required for this system will be
provided by the Georgia Research Alliance.
