There is an ever-increasing interest in the ability to manufacture to
dimensional accuracies in the nanometer range and to attain surfaces with atomic
level smoothness, free of residual stresses and metallurgical defects. One
process used to achieve sub-micrometer accuracies is single point diamond
turning (SPDT). This project is to build two highly-specialized instruments
which will allow cutting with single-point diamond tools down to depths of cut
approaching atomic dimensions (less than 1 nm). These instruments will be used
in a series of experiments on ductile and brittle materials to provide a more
fundamental understanding of nanometric cutting. The work will enable
investigation of the physics of material removal at the nanometer scale and, in
addition, could provide the basis for tribological studies at this scale.
Ultraprecision machining technology will allow manufacturers to produce more
precise components for mechanical systems and to produce higher quality
substrates for semiconductor materials and devices.
