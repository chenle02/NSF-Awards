A new Materials Research Group is established to investigate surface kinetic
processes such as adsorbate diffusion, faceting, crystal growth, and etching by
explicitly addressing the role of surface steps in these processes. The
experimental techniques being utilized include scanning tunnelling microscopy,
surface infrared absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution low-energy electron
diffraction, and low energy electron microscopy. Theory being applied includes
molecular dynamics and energy minimization with semi-empirical potentials, Monte
Carlo simulation, dynamic modeling of step motion and reaction rate theory.
Simple atomic adsorbates such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are being
studied on vicinal nickel (100) and silver (110) single crystal surfaces. The
research is organized in three integrated general areas: equilibrium structure
and energies of surfaces, adsorbate- and self-diffusion on surfaces, and
dynamics of step motion.
