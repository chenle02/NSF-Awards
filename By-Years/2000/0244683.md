This proposal describes a set of numerical studies in general relativity and
string theory related, primarily, to singularities. Part of the proposed
research is the numerical exploration of the singularity in vacuum gravity for
generic spacetimes with no symmetries. Specifically, the PI presents a plan to
numerically investigate singularities in spatially dependent models in general
relativity (models lacking symmetry). A second part of the proposed research is
to apply the PI's harmonic gauge numerical relativity code to the two black hole
problem. A third portion of the proposed research has to do with further aspects
of critical gravitational collapse. The PI intends to perform numerical
simulations of interacting branes in low energy string theory. The PI also
intends to study Ricci flows, looking for analogs of critical collapse.
