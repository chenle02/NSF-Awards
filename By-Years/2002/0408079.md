Ectomycorrhizal fungi are abundant, diverse, and ecologically important
microorganisms in forest soils throughout the world. Through intimate
connections they form with tree roots, they trade essential nutrients obtained
from the soil for carbon acquired by trees through photosynthesis. Tree growth
in nutrient limited forests can be greatly enhanced in this manner, making the
ectomycorrhizal fungal community an important determinant of forest
productivity. Increasing amounts of nitrogen produced by the burning of fossil
fuels are being deposited in forests of the northeastern U.S. The resulting
increases in acidity, aluminum mobility, and N concentration in soil are all
factors that can potentially influence ectomycorrhizal fungal communities and
their tree hosts. Field research will identify species using DNA-based molecular
techniques and measure changes in their abundance and distribution in response
to nitrogen pollution. Laboratory experiments will be conducted to examine
consequences for tree performance. This will lead to a better understand of the
dynamics and consequences of changes in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities
of northeastern forests.
