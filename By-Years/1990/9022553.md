ABSTRACT The annual CUNY sentence processing conference will take place at the
University of Rochester this year. This conference assembles 100-200 researchers
active in the study of language processing, including linguists, computational
linguists, psychologists and philosophers. The conference typically has had
invited papers and a fairly open poster session, primarily for graduate
students. This year, the organizers are emphasizing increased participation,
including a special university-sponsored fund for about 30 graduate student
fellowships, several sessions open to competitive submissions and invited
posters from senior investigators. There will be three didactic symposia, each
devoted to presenting a current area of research which should have a large
impact on future sentence processing research. (1) A second wave of
connectionist modelling offers new ways of thinking about how to model
processes; (2) recent research has coalesced around three different kinds of
methods for studying on-line sentence processing, word reading time, on-line
probe responses and evoked response potentials on the skull; (3) fresh ideas
about lexical concepts and how they are accessed at different levels may lead to
models which better integrate the processing of conceptual and structural
information. In each case, the symposium will have a main presenter whose charge
is to lay out the issues, theories and current results in a way which sentence
processing specialists can understand. Commentators have been chosen to explore
specific directions and to make specific proposals about the implications for
processing research.
