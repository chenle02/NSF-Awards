This project speeds the uptake of an important technology: constraint
satisfaction programming. Many large-scale, real-world problems in areas such as
design and configuration, planning and scheduling, and diagnosis and testing are
readily understood, represented, and solved as constraint satisfaction problems.
Despite a wealth of good, general-purpose methods, each new, large-scale
constraint satisfaction problem faces the same bottleneck: scarce human experts
must select, combine, and refine the various techniques currently available.
This project increases the ability of both people and machines to address new
constraint satisfaction problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a
system that is both an experimental tool for researchers and a problem solver
for real problems. It learns and plans to solve particular classes of constraint
satisfaction problems. It combines and adapts a broad range of known constraint
methods, and explores new ones, to reason about solving hard problems. Learning
supports adaptive solvers that tailor themselves to a problem class. Planning
supports stronger solvers, and embodies higher-level insights into the solution
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses, both in its design and its
implementation, important questions in the discovery and application of
knowledge to problem solving. Expected outcomes include a database of
interactions and plans, a development environment that facilitates the
integration and evaluation of new methods and plans, and a tool for learning new
methods and developing new plans. Broader impacts include improved scheduling
algorithms, upgrades to the computation infrastructure for constraint
programming worldwide, and the training of students in a predominantly female
and minority institution.&lt;br/&gt;
