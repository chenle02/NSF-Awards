Technical Narrative: These US-Turkey scientific visits involve researchers from
the University of New Orleans (UNO) and Middle East Technical University (METU)
in Ankara, Turkey. The first visit entails a two-person team from UNO travelling
to METU in order to complete the first phase of a joint research project in the
area of pulse width modulation (PWM) for electric power rectifiers. The primary
objective of this visit is to use METU laboratory facilities to test the
efficacy of PWN rectificiation in eliminating power system harmonics. A second
visit involves a METU researcher travelling to UNO. These two visits will result
in the development of a large-scale, cooperative research proposal on PWM
involving UNO and METU faculty researchers; these two universities anticipate
signing a formal inter-University researcher exchange agreement. This
cooperative science activity in electrical engineering fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
