Dr. Laurie Butler is supported by a Presidential Young investigator Grant form
the Physical Chemistry Program to study photofragmentation of gas phase
molecules which have been electronically excited with laser radiation. Dr.
Butler is studying the rapid dipole-dipole induced transfer of electronic energy
between two chromophores in a molecule. In particular, she is studying the
nature of this energy transfer in 1,2-C2F4BrI fragmentation in which C-I and
C-Br fission compete following initial excitation to the C-Br repulsive surface.
This work is particularly important since, if this intramolecular energy
transfer could be suppressed, one might conceive of selective excitation and
fragmentation of individual bonds. Dr. Butler is also utilizing emission
spectroscopy of dissociating molecules to study intersections between repulsive
electronic states which alter the dissociation pathways of polyatomic molecules.
Measurements made in Dr. Butler's laboratory provide detailed data on such
nonadiabatic dissociations thus permitting the determination of internuclear
separation, relative velocity, and electronic energy at the crossing as well as
the time required to reach the crossing. Dr. Butler's research is addressing
fundamental questions regarding the process by which an initial electronic
excitation may result in specific dissociation channels among many energetically
allowed ones. By measuring product velocities, internal energies, and angular
distributions of products, she can directly address qustions regarding the
redistribution of electronic energy produced by laser excitation.
