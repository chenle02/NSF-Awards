This work proposes a four course sequence during the first two years of the
engineering curriculum to simulate the concepts of vertical integration. This
sequence will be implemented within existing curricula and is thus cost
effective and not resource constrained. The goals and objectives of this work
are to provide an alternative procedure for vertical integration of material
that works within current frameworks, to increase student retention between the
first and second year of engineering curriculum, to enhance the educational
experience of engineering students through the integration of mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and engineering science, to produce engineering students
that are creative, critical thinkers and mature independent learners, and that
are aware of the engineering role in society as a whole. The main contribution
of this work will be the development of an integration scheme that can be
implemented within existing curricula without taxing budgets or resources and
without political concerns. The results of this project will also be
transferable to other schools and to science and non-technical divisions as
well.
