*** 9660797 Matthews This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop a novel magnetic sensing technique that can be used in a variety of
robotic and virtual reality operations to sense local positional accuracy to a
very high degree of precision. By fixing an array of inexpensive magneto-
resistive sensors to a nearby reference surface and attaching small transmit
coils to the moving parts, robotic (or human) actions can be very accurately
tracked, monitored and stored for future review. The position and orientation of
each transmit coil with respect to the reference surface can be independently
measured, with an expected positional accuracy of about one millimeter and
rotational accuracy of better than one degree. The Phase I effort would be
directed toward building a prototype system to further define the operational
parameters and expected performance of such a system. Commercial applications
include robotic control, virtual reality, telepresence (i.e., the combination of
robotics and virtual reality), monitoring human performance (e.g., head, hand
movements), and training. In the military, training systems and man-in-the-loop
targeting applications would benefit from such a low cost, robust capability.
With further development, detecting and tracking of larger objects such as
concealed weapons (law enforcement need), cars/trucks (Intelligent
Vehicle/Highway System applications) and airplanes over hundreds of meters will
be possible. ***
