Theoretical treatments of the deformation of fold and thrust belts and
accretionary wedges are based on a number of simplifying assumptions. This
project will refine and utilize a coupled mechanical-hydrologic finite-element
model that will incorporate complications such as irregular geometry, various
fluid parameters and variable mechanical properties. Results should help develop
and test hypotheses concerning wedge mechanics.
