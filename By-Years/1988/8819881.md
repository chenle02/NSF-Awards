Separate neurophysiological experiments have shown that neurons responsive to
taste and smell stimulation are coextensive within a circumscribed area of the
orbitofrontal cortex. Other experiments have shown that this area receives
substantial projections from established gustatory and olfactory areas of the
brain. Because these previous neurophysiological studies did not test both
gustatory and olfactory stimuli, it is not known whether functional integration
of taste and smell occurs in the orbitofrontal cortex. This project will use
electrophysiological and anatomical techniques to address the following issues:
(1) Do the chemosensory neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex comprise a single
convergent population, a mosaic of independent olfactory and gustatory elements,
or two contiguous, but functionally distinct areas, and (2) Which areas of the
brain project to the chemosensory area(s) within the orbitofrontal cortex? These
experiments will contribute important information about the functional
organization of orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the forebrain that may be
relevant to certain pathological types of ingestive behavior (e.g. anorexia
nervosa and bulimia) that require cortical involvement.
