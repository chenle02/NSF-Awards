This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is to explore
foundational research to study logical, timing, and probabilistic properties of
a discrete state model, which is quite challenging because it is a strictly
symbolic approach that combines algorithms from diverse areas, ranging from
logical verification to numerical analysis and statistics. The work could lead
to radically new approaches for modeling and analyzing today?s increasingly
complex computer-based systems, with broader impacts from efficient techniques
for achieving higher software reliability.
