&lt;br/&gt; This half-hour video documentary highlights Earthscope's goals and
mission and provides a timely education and outreach resource as Earthscope gets
off the ground. Containing film footage of current and past experiments,
geologic landforms, and action scenes of earthquakes and volcanoes, plus
plentiful 3D animations, the video (working title: Earth Live!) is a vehicle for
introducing Earthscope to the public through nationwide broadcasts on
educational television, and through dissemination of a DVD and video to the
educational community for use as a classroom learning resource and Earthscope
recruitment tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The video's storyline places Earthscope
in the broad context of the historic and future advancement of knowledge of
Earth processes operating on the North American continent. Watching the video on
television and in the classroom, viewers learn about the latest Earth science
theories and research on earthquakes, volcanoes, and continental growth, and how
earth science knowledge contributes to geohazard reduction and wiser land and
resource use. The video's portrayal of women and scientists from
underrepresented groups in important research roles helps Earthscope E&amp;O
representatives recruit a diverse group of participants into the Earthscope
research effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This documentary is being produced by
Earth Images Foundation, collaborating with Earthscope scientists and education
and outreach representatives, a PBS television production director, and with
input from a formative evaluation process that informs concept development and
production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
