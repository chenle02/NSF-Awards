This project is concerned with the expansion of a course of work in which
nonparameteric smoothing and the bootstrap are applied to several real work
problems in biomechanics and robotics. The motivation and many of the future
applications come from gait analysis, ie, the study of free-speed human walking
on a level surface. We utilize a model whose main aspect is a scalar or
vectorial function that describes motion of a "subject". After fitting data from
a learning sample, and applying the bootstrap, prediction regions for the curves
of a subsequent "test subject" are computed. The prediction regions are to be
studied numerically and theoretically. Other aspects of the project involve
approaches through kernel methods, using data to pick bases and models, and
conditional versions of the prediction regions. We also will study multivariate
problems of the prescribed type as they apply to robots and numerically
controlled milling machines.
