This research will focus on dynamic programming. Algorithmic solutions of
certain important recurrences with applications to molecular biology, geology,
and speech recognition will be investigated. These recurrences can typically be
solved with a simple dynamic program: in this work more sophisticated algorithms
will be developed so as to solve these problems more quietly and with lower
storage requirements. In addition, parallel computation techniques will be
developed and applied to these problems.
