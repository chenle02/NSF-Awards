This is a Dissertation Research proposal by Aram Yengoyan (PI) and Alison
Rukeyser (CoPI), UC Davis, to do linguistics research on Yup'ik Eskimo spatial
language and its use as a symbolic system. The research project is divided into
two parts; the first will examine the grammar and lexicon of Yup'ik as it
relates to spatial concepts. The second portion of the research will focus on
spatial language as a symbolic system. This is the first time in over a decade a
young researcher has done research on Yup'ik in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,
Alaska. In addition, the researcher will investigate the broader cultural
implications of the complex Yup'ik linguistic system, adding much to the
intellectual understanding of linguistic representations of cultural
relationships to the physical environment.
