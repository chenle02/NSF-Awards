CTS-9523249 Fernando This work will be a laboratory study, augmented by
theoretical analysis, of turbulent flows that are of interest to environmental
and climatic forecasting. Specifically the proposed work addresses two processes
that are vital for the understanding of small-scale phenomena in oceans and the
atmosphere. The processes identified for study are: a) the sinking of negatively
buoyant fluid masses in the presence of background stratification and mean shear
and b) the entrainment at the base of a turbulent mixing layer in the presence
of vertical velocity gradients. The first study has application to the
generation of strong gusts and horizontal wind shears close to the ground. A
better understanding of these phenomena is paramount to aviation safety. The
second study is aimed at improving the mixing parameterizations of mixed layer
models. These models are in use for short term forecasting.
