9310529 McCormick This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in applied mathematics and advanced scientific computing among U.S. and
French research teams at the University of Colorado (Denver and Boulder), Texas
A&amp;M, and INRIA Rocquencourt (French National Institute for Research in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics) and ONERA. The objective of the
research is to investigate domain decomposition and multilevel techniques for
parallel numerical simulation of fluid flow and structural dynamics. The idea
behind this approach is to develop new methods in a parallel computing
environment to allow modeling of more sophisticated engineering problems. They
will focus the research on four applications: (1) flow transition to turbulence;
(2) zoning-coupled flow modeling; (3) transport phenomena; and (4) fluid-
structure interaction. The proposed areas arise in many civil and aerospace
engineering applications. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
expertise in parallel computing, multilevel and domain decomposition techniques.
This is complemented by the French team's experience in domain decomposition,
fluid flow and parallel computing. Their joint efforts could lead to improved
algorithms for large scale parallel computing. ***
