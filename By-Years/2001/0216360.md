This MRI proposal requests support for several university groups for the
development of new components for the trigger of the D0 experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron antiproton-proton collider. This facility is at the energy
frontier of experimental particle physics. The primary goal of the experiment is
to search for the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs field.
Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides a means
of generating the particle masses and spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the
electroweak interaction. There are many indications that the Tevatron collider
could produce the Higgs boson, provided that enough antiproton-proton collisions
are delivered to the experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned luminosity
upgrade of the Tevatron will require the experiments to be even more selective
than in the past and thus an efficient trigger system is essential. Selection
algorithms giving background rejection factors of more than 105 with high
efficiency must be implemented in real time. This proposal would support the
development of the hardware and algorithms necessary for the D0 experiment to
cope with the higher interaction rates produced at the upgraded
luminosities.&lt;br/&gt;
