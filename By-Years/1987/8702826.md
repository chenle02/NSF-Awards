In recent years, statistical data and inference have played an important role
in establishing the basic facts used for public policymaking in a variety of
areas, such as estimating the unemployment rate, determining the risk of cancer
from occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, and the evaluation of the
accuracy of screening tests for AIDS antibodies or for drug use. In the legal
area, statistical methods are used to examine hiring and promotion data for
evidence of discrimination, and also to appraise the fairness of tax
assessments. Indeed, methods originally developed for the analysis of medical
data have been used to analyze hiring and promotion information -- and the
principal investigators of the current project have been active in researching
problems arising in this area as well as some of those indicated in the
paragraph above. In particular, motivated by the AIDS crisis, the investigators
will use funds to be provided under the recommended award to pursue further
research into estimators of the prevalence of a disease and the predictive value
of screening tests in populations with low prevalence (less than one in one
hundred). They plan to adapt confidentiality techniques originally designed for
economic data to suggest procedures for obtaining a reliable estimate of AIDS
prevalence while still preserving the anonymity of the individuals tested. Under
the recommended award the investigators also plan to adapt methods used to
evaluate medical screening tests to evaluate an apparent response bias in the
Census Bureau's major unemployment survey, and to study other measurement
problems requiring the development of statistical procedures which produce valid
results even when all the usual assumptions are not satisfied by the data. The
research is expected to make contributions to statistical theory in addition to
its timeliness in proferring applications to recently recognized problems that
are certain to be with us for some years to come.
