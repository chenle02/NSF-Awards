The proposal utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to study the locomotion of
C. elegans and their sensory response to environmental variations. C. elegans is
one of the mostly studied model animals in biology due to its genetic
tractability, sequenced genome, simple anatomy and body transparency. It is also
a superb system to study mobility and sensing. This project will use C. elegans
as a simple model system of living organisms to obtain critical physical
information for understanding the interplay between sensing, locomotion and
environment, incorporate this information into theoretical and computational
models of undulatory locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative
research project between a mechanical engineer at Washington University and a
mathematical at the New York University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
expected to impact on smart sensing and actuation technology, and the results
will serve as building blocks for development of smart devices that can lead to
robust design of adaptive systems and structures. &lt;br/&gt;
