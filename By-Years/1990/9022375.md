This study will characterize relationships between remotely sensed ocean color
and the vertical profiles of bio-optical variables and primary productivity -
and their interannual and seasonal variabilities - to address central goals of
the U.S. JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Plan. It is hypothesized that photoadaptation
by phytoplankton creates vertical profiles of pigments and optical profiles
which, in a given geographic province and time of year, are predictable
functions of near- surface optical properties estimable from remotely sensed
ocean color. It is further speculated that the joint profiles of natural and
stimulated fluorescence and optical properties are photoadaptive characteristics
which may correlate with primary productivity. Optical and fluorescence (natural
and stimulated) measurements will be acquired during the JGOFS EqPac cruises,
which in combination with core measurements of pigments and productivity, will
be used to develop empirical models of these relationships. These results will
enable pigment biomass and productivity analyses of past (CZCS) and future
(SeaWiFS) ocean color data, as well as contributing to the assessment of
regional biogeochemical processes in the context of the overall JGOFS EqPac data
set.
