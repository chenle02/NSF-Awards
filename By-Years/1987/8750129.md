This project is to develop an artificial intelligence laboratory to be shared by
both the department of science and engineering and the department of psychology.
The laboratory will be equipped with eight "pseudo" Lisp machines which will
also have the capability to handle Prolog and Smalltalk. Four new courses are
proposed which will be jointly developed by the two departments. Thus, the new
lab will serve both the computer engineering and the cognitive psychology
students.
