The principal investigator will study the multidimensional hypergeometric
functions and applications in representation theory and conformal field theory.
He will use methods from partial differential equations and geometry to study
representations of an arbitrary Kac-Moodey algebra and their quantum
deformations. Other applications of the research in hypergeometric functions
will be in the areas of algebraic geometry and algebraic K-theory. This award
will support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
