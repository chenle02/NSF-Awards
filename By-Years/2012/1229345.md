With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and support from
the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs Professor
Karin Ruhlandt-Senge from Syracuse University and colleague Philip Borer will
acquire a highly automated 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen
cooled probe. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) reactivity, weak interactions,
and aggregation in highly reactive metal species; (b) development of
polysaccharide-based carriers for targeted drug delivery; (c) nucleic acid
switches; (d) inhibitors of SHIP-phosphatase; (e) chiral catalysts for use in
complex molecule synthesis; (f) role of metal ions in biology and medicine; (g)
bioactive peptides and peptide sensors; (h) unnatural molecules with unique
folds; (i) dynamic ligand exchange at quantum dot interfaces; (j) carbon-carbon
bond forming reaction of 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans; and (k) technetium and
rhenium-based radiopharmaceuticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and
biochemistry. Many research projects associated with this application will have
a direct impact on society, as they aim to develop biomimetic polymerization
initiators, sensors, conducting materials, and new drugs or treatments,
vaccines, amongst others. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research at Syracuse University and also at neighboring institutions.
