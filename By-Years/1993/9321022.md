9321022 Shannon The importance of market imperfections such as externalities in
both theoretical and policy-oriented research can hardly be overstated. Many of
the most important questions in macroeconomics, such as determining the factors
that affect long- term growth or explaining observed differences in growth and
development rates across countries, either could not be meaningfully posed or
could not be satisfactorily answered until market imperfections such as
externalities in production and capital accumulation or distortionary government
taxing and spending were incorporated into growth theory. However, most of this
work addresses these issues in highly specialized models such as representative
agent models, or models with parametricly specified time separable preferences
and technologies. If these models are perturbed to allow for more interaction
across periods in preferences of technologies, is an entirely new analysis
necessary? Are conclusions of this new analysis radically different? The purpose
of this project is to obtain robust answers to these same questions which depend
as little as possible on assumptions about preferences or production
technologies. This is done by studying the existence, comparative statistics,
and determinacy of equilibria in general equilibrium models with externalities
and an infinite number of commodities. The project also develops new methods for
comparative statics analysis in problems with potential market distortions or
imperfections.
