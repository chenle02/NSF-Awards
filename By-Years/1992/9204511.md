Schmid and Bernstein plan to continue their study of the representation theory
of reductive groups and Lie algebras from a variety of points of view. They plan
to employ tools from topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and
analysis. The expected results, in turn, will have applications to geometry,
number theory, and analysis. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially
quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
