Picturing to Learn, based on preliminary results from a pilot project, promotes
the notion that when students visually explain science to others by the process
of making drawings, the process clarifies and illuminates the science for that
student. The process of making a visual explanation for someone else is similar
to writing an article; one has to fully understand a concept before
communicating the ideas successfully to another person.

In addition, Picturing to Learn introduces a new teaching tool for teachers to
quickly assess whether students truly understand a particular science concept.
While a student might give the correct response to a text-based exam question,
the underlying concepts could be completely misunderstood. Observing visual
explanations of students will prove to be a quick means of assessing their deep
understanding and offering corrective feedback to them.

A team of cognitive psychologists and faculty members from five schools involves
students to: develop exercises that are used in existing curricula; create
assessment rubrics; and examine data to measure improvements in student
learning.

The program promotes widespread adoption of these methods through workshops and
publications, and creates computational visualization tools to describe and
analyze drawings and illustrations. More broadly, the program engages students
to study science using an active and visually appealing approach. In addition
the program educates students and teachers to the importance of communicating
science to others.
