We purpose a two year collaborative project at the US Army Electronic Technology
and Devices Laboratory (ETDL), Fort Monmouth. The program will support one PhD
Student who will carry out experiment at SUNY as well as at ETDL. Work will
include study of electron delocalization in GaAs/A1As quantum wells via the A1As
X Band minimum.
