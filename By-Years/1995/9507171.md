IBN-9507171 Dores, Robert M. Previous attempts at evaluating phylogeny of
vertebrates by comparing sequences of low molecular weight polypeptide hormone
families have yielded, in general, unsatisfactory phylogentic trees. This is due
to the small size and high degree of conservation, such that there are not
adequate differences in peptide structure to construct appropriate trees.
Moreover, construction of trees based on these data have lead to errors in
establishing the relationship of one species to another. However, Dr. Robert
Dores believes that phylogenetically relevant information may be obtained by
investigating the structure of the precursor molecules for the pituitary
hormones, due to their larger size as opposed to the hormones themselves. In the
present studies, Dr. Dores proposes to isolate and sequence the gene encoding
proopiomelanocortin from the pituitary of a number of different species. By
comparing the sequences of these genes using maximum parsimony procedures,
development of an accurate phylogenetic map relating these species with other
vertebrates will be possible. This new information about proopiomelanocortin,
the precursor molecule for corticotropin, melanocortin and beta-endorphin, a
potent endogenous analgesic molecule, will provide more direct evidence for the
relationship between several species. In addition, by sequencing the gene
encoding proopiomelanocortin, the precursor for the important mammalian stress
molecule, corticotropin, new information about stress responses in humans may be
obtained.
