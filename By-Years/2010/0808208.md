MentorNet, the E-Mentoring Network for Diversity in Engineering and Science, a
nonprofit organization, joins with the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the
Geological Society of America (GSA), the American Meteorological Society (AMS),
the American Geological Institute (AGI), which is a federation of 44 Geosciences
societies, and the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science
(SOARS) program, a long-established collaboration of programs focused on
enhancing diverse participation in atmospheric sciences, to implement a two-year
planning and implementation project to expand mentoring opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career
faculty in geosciences fields. The goal of the project is to open up many more
beneficial mentoring opportunities in geosciences, particularly between students
and working professionals, with a special focus on women and others
underrepresented in these fields, using MentorNet's e-mentoring infrastructure,
which is designed to support one-on-one mentoring between students and
professionals on a large scale. Building upon existing knowledge and practices
in the field, while learning about the features of the infrastructure designed
to support one-on-one mentoring relationships, and tapping its own networks, a
Geosciences Mentoring Advisory Council will build a consortium of organizations
to support and further develop participation in mentoring among students and
professionals in geosciences. By design, this project can expand to engage any
number of interested institutions of higher education, corporations, government
labs and agencies, professional societies, and other nonprofit organizations
interested in advancing mentoring in the geosciences.
