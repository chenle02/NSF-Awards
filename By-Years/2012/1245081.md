Part of the movement toward innovation in engineering education is determining
if new approaches to instruction help students engage in innovation themselves.
This project is developing a survey-style instrument that can measure key
processes related to student innovation,termed "innovative engagement". The
project is 1) developing a testable theoretical model of innovative engagement
specific to engineering education, 2) developing an instrument to measure
innovative engagement in engineering classrooms, and 3) disseminating the
instrument to engineering educators in the form of a technical manual. The
instrument is being aligned with ABET student outcomes orientated toward problem
solving and is meant for accreditation assessment and engineering education
research.
