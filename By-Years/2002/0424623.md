Abstract 0424623 Lawrence Bergman Univ. Illinois, Urbana

This project is to conduct a bi-lateral US-Korea Workshop on Intelligent
Infrastructure Systems to be held in Seoul, in September 2004. The objective is
to reach mutual understanding of technical strengths and weaknesses, and mutual
interests of both sides so that a slid basis of research cooperation in the
emerging areas of sensors and smart structures technologies can be formulated.

Approximately 10-12 US participants will attend this two-day workshop. The
topics to be discussed include: smart sensors and materials, monitoring and
integrity assessment, control, retrofit and maintenance. A workshop proceedings
including a summary recommendations and resolutions will be prepared.
