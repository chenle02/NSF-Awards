Professor Kenneth Showalter has been awarded a grant from the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program for continued studies concerning the oscillatory
behavior of certain chemical reactions in solution and in solution-solid state
media. These studies of chemical waves hold great promise for developing a
better understanding of spatial and time behavior in chemical systems. A
detailed characterization of the oscillatory iodate-sulfite-ferrocyanide
reaction will be carried out. Classical chemical kinetics studies of the
component reactions along with a systematic investigation of the dynamical
behavior will be accomplished. Chemical wave behavior in a variety of different
reactions and configurations will be investigated. One particularly innovative
component of this study is the investigation of spiral waves on the spherical
surface of catalyst beads.
