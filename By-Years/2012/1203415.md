The PIs propose to develop a statistical model for inferring past mean global
sea level (GSL) and ice sheet volumes from geological indicators of changes in
local sea levels. This model will employ a Bayesian statistical framework to
combine geological observations and their uncertainties with a geophysical model
of the spatial and temporal sea level patterns associated with different
meltwater sources. The proposed work focuses on three specific applications:
&lt;br/&gt;(1) evaluating the contribution of different ice sheets to high GSL
during the Last Interglacial stage, ~130-115 thousand years ago; &lt;br/&gt;(2)
assessing ice sheet history from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present,
in particular estimating the net ice volume change across this time interval and
assessing the relative contributions of the Laurentide and Antarctic ice sheets
to meltwater pulse 1a at ~14.3 thousand years ago; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) over a
broader sweep of the Quaternary and Pliocene, investigating the relationship
between Northern and Southern hemisphere ice volumes and paleoclimate
proxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geological record of past ice sheet responses
to climate change can serve as a key data source for testing forward physical
models of ice sheet dynamics under different climate scenarios. The model
developed in this project will be an effort to synthesize such a data set,
evaluate its associated uncertainties, and employ it to strengthen understanding
of the relationship between key climate parameters (such as polar and circum-
polar temperatures) and ice sheet stability.
