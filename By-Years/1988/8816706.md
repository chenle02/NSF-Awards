Experiments will be conducted to determine oxygen and hydrogen isotope
fractionation between alunite and water over the temperature range of 250 to
450oC. Exchange experiments will be conducted in cold seal hydrothermal vessels
with runs of 1 to 3 months duration, and will involve coupling of isotope
exchange with Na-K exchange to facilitate attainment of equilibrium. Knowledge
of alunite fractionation factors will allow calibration of alunite-quartz and
alunite-pyrite isotope geothermometers, and will permit interpretaion of
alunite-bearing deposits in terms of temperatures of formation and the chemical
compositions of the various fluids that produced them.
