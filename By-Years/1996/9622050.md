ABSTRACT Dwight Look 9622050 Support was requested for an argon-ion laser to be
used in anisotropic scattering experiments important in radiative heat transfer
applications. Multidimensional experiments using latex particles suspended in
distilled water would provide data for both optically thick and thin media. The
grant was supported under the Research Equipement Grant Program.
