9412919 Sampath The goal of this research is to investigate the effects of
process parameters (deposition rate and ambient pressure) on the properties,
grain size and electrical conductivity, of thin films. The methodology of
statistical design of experiments will be applied to the development of the
experimental plan and the analysis of results. Thin films are widely used in
many applications, including photovoltaic devices. Thin films are deposited in
industry by wet chemical methods and vacuum processes. The vacuum deposition
method produces thin films of superior quality and generates little or no
hazardous waste. However, the major disadvantage is the low throughput
associated with batch processing in vacuum. This research will seek to deposit
CdS and CdTe thin films using an air- vacuum-air process that is environmentally
benign.
