This research is to develop a new method for the fabrication of plastic optical
fibers that is applicable to various polymers including the ones which cannot be
made into optical fibers by the conventional methods despite their excellent
optical properties. The new method is, in a sense, a modified coextrusion
process in which a thermoplastic material is spun into a hollow fiber forming a
cladding while another material is fed into the core at the same time. In this
process only the cladding material has to be thermoplastic and the core material
can be any class of materials; a liquid, an elastomeric gel, or a thermoplastic.
After the spinning, the core material may be polymerized or cross-linked to
enhance the mechanical strength of the optical fiber. To assess the
effectiveness and the applicability of the technique, a liquid monomer and a
cross- linkable elastomer are used as the core of the optical fibers. The core
materials are polymerized/cross-linked after the spinning process, and the
quality of the optical fibers are evaluated. The most significant feature of the
new technique is its broad applicability to numerous materials, thus opening the
way to explore a variety of core material options for plastic optical fibers
which could not be considered before by the conventional methods.
