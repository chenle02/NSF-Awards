This project is boosting the dissemination of findings from education research
through collaboration of 20 educational researchers and engineering instructors
at different colleges and universities in the Pacific Northwest, who are
creating and implementing new approaches to teaching the engineering course
Mechanics of Materials. Specifically, this project is focusing on deeper
understanding of fundamental engineering concepts such as stress, strain, and
equilibrium. The collaborators are working to discover and change students'
preconceptions, which may be incorrect assumptions of how materials behave,
based on their prior coursework and life experience. This project is addressing
a real problem that engineering instructors are currently experiencing in their
classrooms. Since the engineering educators have been involved in the project
from the beginning, they are more likely to continue to use the curriculum
materials they develop, and to encourage others to use them. This collaboration
is also ensuring that the findings are being implemented in classrooms soon
after they are discovered. More interactive, conceptually oriented classrooms,
such as those being implemented in this project, will improve student learning
and increase student interest and retention in engineering.
