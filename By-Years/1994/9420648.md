This award is for support for a three year program to investigate the response
of ice domes, such as Siple Dome in West Antarctica, to changing boundary
conditions, for example as arising from fluctuations in thickness or position of
bounding ice streams. A range of models will be used, from simple one-
dimensional analytical models to coupled dynamic-thermodynamic flow models, to
investigate the response of the ice dome to boundary forcing, and the record
that boundary forcing can leave in the ice core record. Using radar,
temperature, and ice core data from the currently funded field programs on Siple
Dome, and ice flux and thickness values from the map view model as boundary
conditions, a flow line across Siple Dome will be studied and possible ranges of
time scales, the likely origin of ice near the bed, and the basal temperature
conditions that exist now and existed in the past will be determined.The
response of internal stratigraphy patterns to climate and dynamic forcing
effects will be investigated and observed internal layers from ice cores will be
used to infer the forcing history.
