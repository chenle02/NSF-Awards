Rapid behavioral responses to a threat are critical for the survival of animals
subjected to high predation risk. Two methods have evolved to shorten the delay
between a threatening stimulus and an escape response, both by increasing the
conduction velocity of nerve impulses along nerve axons: axon gigantism and
myelin sheaths around the axons. Although myelin is best known in vertebrates,
it is also found in two crustacean groups. These two invertebrate groups provide
opportunities to understand structure-function relationships in myelin because:
1) it is possible to compare closely-related myelinated and non-myelinated
forms; 2) nerve cells can be re-identified from one individual to the next, and
3) development of myelin can be tracked in identified cells through all
developmental stages. In this project, physiological and computational
approaches will be used in a comparative structure-function analysis of myelin
in the two crustacean groups: the malacostraca and the calanoid copepods. Myelin
has evolved independently in these two groups, yet it shares many features
between the two, while being distinct in structure and origin. Some crustaceans
transition from completely non-myelinated to fully myelinated nervous systems
during development, and thus provide a good model in which to investigate nerve
impulse conduction in incompletely formed myelin. Characterizing the
commonalities in structure and function for myelin in copepods vs malacostracans
will provide new insights into the function and evolution of vertebrate myelin.
This study will start answering the question of how and why myelin
evolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train young undergraduate
scientists in interdisciplinary biology and team research, build diversity in
science, technology, engineering and math; and provide public access to
microscopic images for educational and data mining purposes. Postdoctoral
trainees on the project will be educated in the preparation and examination of
material for transmission electron microscopy, extracellular
electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques, and computational
modeling of neuronal functioning.&lt;br/&gt;
