Analysis of heat transfer data in the post critical heat flux region reveals
that wall temperature predictions can be improved when the wall-vapor heat
transfer coefficient is multiplied by a correction factor which correlates with
the quality and the bulk-wall viscosity ratio. In an existing vertical tube
apparatus, this process is being studied by simulating the vapor-liquid system
with a gas-solid mixture with the objective of isolating the effects of discrete
particles on the flow. Experiments will be performed to determine the Nusselt
number and friction factor dependence on the quality, solids volumetric
concentration, Reynolds number, particle diameter, and bulk-wall viscosity
ratio. The experimental data generated in the two-phase flow vertical tube
facility will allow comparison of the momentum and energy transport mechanism.
This information can be used to create global models of heat transfer and
pressure drop of dispersed flows suitable for engineering design predictions.
