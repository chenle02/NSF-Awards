The investigator works in algebraic geometry, although his interests connect to
other areas of mathematics, including topology, combinatorics, physics (string
theory), number theory, and symplectic and differential geometry. This proposal,
continuing various strands of the investigator's work, deals with moduli spaces
and related notions in a variety of settings. In particular, the proposal deals
with a number of fundamental questions regarding the moduli space of curves,
deformation theory, the Schubert calculus, Geometric Invariant Theory, Gromov-
Witten theory, and fundamental groups.

Algebraic geometry provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces
of interesting objects. Once they are defined, natural compelling questions are:
what do they look like? Are they irreducible? Connected? Of what dimension? Are
they smooth? If not, what singularities arise? What structure is exhibited by
their cohomology rings, and why should it be geometrically expected? What are
their equations? The investigator intends to address many of these fundamental
problems in a number of cases. The investigator has a track record of sustained
and serious effort both in outreach to students at all levels (high school,
undergraduate, and graduate), and in building institutions in which algebraic
geometry can grow. The investigator will continue to attract graduate students
into algebraic geometry, both at Stanford and elsewhere, and to continue to
nurture the careers of graduate students, post-docs, and young researchers. The
investigator will continue to work with large numbers of students at the
secondary and undergraduate levels, attracting students into the mathematical
sciences.
