Current research in geometric modeling has focused on extending the coverage of
geometric modeling systems. The most difficult obstacle in extending the
coverage has been integrating freeform surfaces into a system that allows
Boolean set operations such as intersection and union. This project is concerned
with the design and implementation of a small-scale geometric modeling system
based on algebraic volumes, those sets that can be described as the
intersection, union, and difference of algebraic halfspaces (solutions to
polynomial inequalities). In particular, the project involves: Design and
implementation of algorithms for creating freeform algebraic volumes (the 3D
analog of freeform algebraic surfaces). These algorithms will be based on recent
advances in the theory of polynomial spline spaces. Design and implementation of
algorithms for tessellating algebraic volumes. Application tasks such as
rendering and finite element analysis will operate on the resulting
tessellation. Design and implementation of algorithms for performing finite
element analysis on algebraic volumes. These algorithms would analyze the
structural and thermal properties of the modeled object. The resulting system
would allow the design and analysis of a range of geometric objects not covered
under current geometric modeling systems.
