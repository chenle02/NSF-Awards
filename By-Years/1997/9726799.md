This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
organic reaction rates and mechanisms. It involves the research groups of
Kendall N. Houk at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Rene Gree at
the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie in Rennes, France. By introducing
fluorine into molecules, the investigators will analyze the influence of allylic
bonds on the reactivity and stereoselectivity of alkene reactions. They will
specifically address cycloaddition and addition reactions. The US investigator
brings to this collaboration expertise in theoretical and computational
chemistry. The theoretical work will provide prediction of interesting systems
for experimental studies. This will be complemented by systematic experimental
studies performed by the French investigators, which takes advantage of their
unique methodology for introducing allylic fluorine into molecules. The project
could lead to the development of a new synthetic methodology of use to the
pharmaceutical and materials research communities.
