9713437 Harris Fiber reinforced plastic reinforcement, has been demonstrated at
Drexel University, in the form of a ductile hybrid rebar which simulates the
stress-strain characteristics of conventional steel reinforcement. Starting with
a combination of high modulus carbon and aramic fibers, the researchers have
produced a 5 mm diameter rebar with a Young's modulus of 133 Gpa, with an
ultimate strain between 2-3%. Excellent bond was obtained by weaving ribs into
the bar to increase the mechanical interaction between concrete and the rebar.
Results from tests indicate that the ductility indices were comparable to steel.
An analysis and experimental research program will be undertaken using larger
size rebars. ***
