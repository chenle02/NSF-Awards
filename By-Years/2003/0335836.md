9810914 Humayun This research is a component of a collaborative project between
Johns Hopkins University and North Carolina State University to develop a
retinal prosthesis. This proposal is concerned with components that will
interface with the multiple unit artificial retina chipset designed by the
investigators. Specifically, this research will design and develop the electrode
array, the hermetic sealing process for the implanted components, the video
camera and video processing circuitry, and perform biological testing. ***
