The project entails the deployment of a two-dimensional (2D) array of GPS
scintillation receivers in Calgary Alberta. The deployment of a large number of
GPS scintillation receivers over a 2 km region will allow for the investigation
of the temporal evolution of the 2D spatial distribution of observed amplitude
and phase scintillations. The 2D time-evolving observations of GPS
scintillations will be combined with comprehensive theoretical-numerical 3D
forward propagation of electro-magnetic waves through random media, and inverse
diffraction tomography techniques to provide quantitative linkage between the
observations and analysis of the ground array, and the underlying physics and
structuring of the ionospheric irregularities causing the scintillation
observations. Furthermore, data assimilative techniques will be used to estimate
large scale gradients in electron density, winds and fields, and compared with
the scintillation results and auroral imaging to investigate to what degree
knowledge of the large scale background ionosphere improves our understanding of
smaller scale structuring.
