This Research Initiation Award will help Dr. Lee to extend the highly successful
SPHINX speech recognition system to require less vocabulary-specific training
for new tasks. Proposed techniques include linguistic modeling of allophonic
variations, automatic subword clustering, and incremental vocabulary adaptation.
The research should provide insights into subword modeling and fusion of
linguistic theory, statistical learning, and incremental learning theory.
