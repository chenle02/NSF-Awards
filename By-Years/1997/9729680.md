9729680 Bahadur An SGER award will support the study of the effect of nano-
scale particulate fillers from a number of materials families on the
tribological performance of a high temperature polymer. Friction and wear will
be measured for a range of conditions and mixtures and the composition and
properties of the transfer film formed on steel counterfaces will be determined.
It is expected that the high reactivity of the nano-scale particles with the
counterface will result in formation of especially wear resistant transfer
films. The study will also provide data on the tribological properties of filled
polymers for potential use in MEMS micromachines. ***
