ABSTRACT CMS-9528055 Mani "Partial Support of the U.S. National Committee for
Rock Mechanics" This award to the National Academy of Sciences is for support of
the activities of the U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM),
operating under the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, National Research
Council, during the one-year period from September 1, 1995 through August 31,
1996. The USNC/RM represents the United States in the International Society for
Rock Mechanics, and conducts symposia in the U.S. and North America to offer a
venue for researchers in the national groups from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico
to present and discuss their work. The USNC/RM also provides a forum for
meetings with federal agencies and other organizations to keep abreast of
developments in the field and to identify issues of national significance that
may merit independent inquiry to serve the needs of the government.
