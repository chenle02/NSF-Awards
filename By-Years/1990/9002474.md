This proposal is to make nutrient measurements (phosphate, nitrate, silicate)
on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the Pacific along
longitudes 88 and 150 west. The nutrient data are used along with other tracer
data to describe the ocean circulation and in models of the circulation, one of
the principal objectives of WOCE.
