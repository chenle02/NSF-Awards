A grant has been awarded to Dr. Debashish Bhattacharya at the University of Iowa
to determine how intervening sequences (so-called "introns") spread into novel
sites in genes. Introns compose a significant portion of genomes (about 16% in
humans) and play important roles in gene expression and disease, yet their means
of spread remains unknown. This is because few proven cases of recent and
widespread intron spread have been documented. The finding of a wealth of
recently inserted introns in the ribosomal (r)RNA genes of Euascomycetes fungi
makes these organisms ideal for the study of intron spread. Previous work shows
that a good candidate for the mechanism by which introns get incorporated into
genes is by reversal of the splicing process. The rRNAs of a diverse group of
Euascomycetes will be studied to test predictions of the "reverse-splicing"
model such as the expectation that introns are preferentially retained at target
gene sequences that have a high affinity for splicing factors and that introns
are non-randomly distributed, with most of them clustering in regions that are
not buried in RNA tertiary structure. Introns play important roles in the
evolution of eukaryotic genomes and are implicated in diseases. For example,
about 15% of point mutations that are linked to human genetic disease cause
defects in the splicing of introns. It is surprising, therefore, that no general
model of intron spread exists. In this grant, the recent finding of widespread
introns in the nuclear rDNA of Euascomycetes fungi is exploited to address the
issue of intron spread. An important strength of the fungal system is the
availability of robust secondary and tertiary rRNA structures. This allows the
testing of the role of RNA structure in determining intron distribution, an
analysis that cannot be done with most pre-mRNAs which have largely unknown
folding properties.&lt;br/&gt;
