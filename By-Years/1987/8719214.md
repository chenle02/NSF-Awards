This project will examine the process of secretion in Yarrowia lipolytica.
Using biochemical, genetic and molecular biology techniques, the PI will
concentrate first on two proteins, the alkaline extracellular protease
precursors and an extracellular RNase. These investigators will contribute to
our understanding of protein secretion and transport in eukaryotic cells and
yield potentially important information for the use of this yeast in
biotechnology of protein production.
