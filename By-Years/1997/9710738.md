This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years for OC-3 connections for eleven institutions to an OC-48
California statewide network. The network will be connected to the vBNS in two
places: the Los Angeles Basin, and the San Francisco Bay area. The eleven
institutions are: University of California campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine,
Riverside, San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz; Stanford; CalTech;
University of Southern California and the Information Sciences Institute. The
over 40 applications cover fields such as metacomputing; distributed interactive
simulation; remote telescope operation, microscopy and tele-imaging for health
care; digital libraries; and projects in physics, biology and communications.
Collaborating institutions include Oak Ridge National Lab, Rice, Argonne
National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Syracuse University,
University of Tennessee and the University of Texas.
