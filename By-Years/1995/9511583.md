9511583 Huber Research will be carried out in muon-catalyzed fusion,
specifically on the formation rates of molecular muon-hydrogen- hydrogen systems
for different isotopes of hydrogen and the importance of molecular resonances
which greatly enhance the molecular formation process. Experimental work will be
carried out at the TRIUMF laboratory in Canada. A computer simulation code will
be written and applied to analysis of the data produced. Research in this areas
will advance our understanding of the molecular processes involved, with
possible application of this technology to more precise tests of quantum
electrodynamics, low energy tests of quantum chromodynamics, and extending to
future development of an intense source of neutrons for testing materials and,
more speculatively, to large-scale energy production. Education of undergraduate
students is a central component of this grant.***
