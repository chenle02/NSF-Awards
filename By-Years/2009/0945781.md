This SBIR project will develop a new technology for the removal and destruction
of NOx pollutants from diesel engine exhaust. Four important issues will be
addressed in the project. The first issue will be applying a zeolite coating to
reticulated catalyst supports with the correct chemical composition and pore
size distribution. The second issue will be doping the zeolite metal with an ion
exchange process followed by application of a stabilizing nano-oxide coating to
complete the catalyst support system. The third issue will be the design
architecture for placement in the exhaust stream. The fourth and final issue
will be measuring the systems and evaluating their effectiveness, cost, life
cycle, and ease of manufacture.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be a low-cost
emission abatement device that can be easily retrofitted to currently operating
diesel powered vehicles with emission control capabilities. The reduction of
nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, volatile organic carbons, and carbon
monoxide has associated health benefits. EPA estimates that over 86,000 tons of
particulates and 440,000 tons of NOx can be removed from the air with the use of
clean burning off-road diesel engines.
