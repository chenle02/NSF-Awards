The P.I. plans to further investigate the phenomenon of supercritical solvent
extraction augmented by an applied electric field. This augmented separation has
been observed by the P.I. for the CO2/silicon system using CO2 as the
supercritical solvent. The P.I. also plans to demonstrate the cost savings by
this process over the conventional supercritical extraction process. Several
mechanical schemes for the field augmented process will be tested. The P.I. is
also a leading expert on the subject of supercritical extraction. Funding of is
recommended.
