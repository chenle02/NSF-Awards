Abstract 97-06932 MacIntyre Turbulent Mixing and Light and Nutrient Supply to
Phytoplankton In lakes, physical processes that cause turbulent mixing supply
resources essential for primary productivity. Partial upwelling and shoaling
internal waves lead to turbulence and upward transport of deep, nutrient rich
waters. The resulting nutrient fluxes have been 300% higher than those due to
processes occurring offshore. Estimating the impact of vertical mixing in well-
lit surface waters on primary productivity has proved elusive. Large eddies
circulate phytoplankton and expose them to different intensities of irradiance.
Photosynthetic rates of algae circulating in large eddies have changed by up to
80%. For lakes varying in size and stratification, the investigators will
determine the location, frequency and vertical extent of mixing events and
assess their contribution to nutrient fluxes, phytoplankton circulation, and
lake productivity. The researchers will also develop and test models for
predicting light and nutrient supply in other lakes, leading to improved
predictions of primary productivity due to changing land use, weather patterns,
or climate change.
