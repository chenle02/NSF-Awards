SUMMARY Proposal Number: CTS-9410251 P.I.: Sevick Institution: Colorado The
author proposes to simulate the adsorption of surfactant molecules onto clay
platelets. Monte Carlo simulations will be utilized to provide a description of
the equilibrium structure of surfactant microphases adsorbed to isolated clay
platelets as well as surfactants which are sandwiched between platelets.
Experiments will attempt to identify fingerprints of the structures generated by
simulation and hopefully lead to a better description of the surfactant
microphase structure. The review panel was unanimously enthusiastic about the
research project. This would be an opportunity to "make a name" for the PI.
However, the panel also consistently indicated that the problem is complex and
needs to be attacked on a more "simple " basis. First, a well-characterized
solid surface should be used to simulate (MC) hemimcelles/admicelles. Second,
the comparison of MD (or MC) data to experiments will not be straight forward
especially with respect to surface heterogeneities. More thought should be
directed towards relating macroscopic experimental measurements to microscopic
MD (or MC) data. Finally, check literature on micelle (in H2O) simulations and
incorporate that knowledge into your simulation strategies.
