This award will support a 12-month research visit by Professor Karur Padmanabhan
of Wayne State University to the Government Industrial Research Institute in
Nagoya where he will study the effect of ion implantation and ion beam mixing in
ceramics in an effort to understand the mechanisms responsible for mixing in
ceramic- ceramic systems. Among its potential uses, this work can significantly
contribute to improving the reliability and performance of surfaces subjected to
various forms of stress. Dr. Padmanabhan's collaborators will be Dr. Soji
Miagawa, Head of the Bean Technology Section of the Institute, and his
colleagues, Dr. Kazuo Saitoh and Dr. Takeda. He will also cooperate with Dr. N.
Itoh of the Department of Physics of Nagoya University and several persons at
the Toyota Research Lab thereby accessing Nagoya's considerable materials
research strengths in government, academica and industrial research.
