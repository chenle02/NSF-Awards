This award funds the research activities of Professor David Morrison at the
University of California, Santa Barbara.

Some of the most interesting phenomena in nature are described by physical
theories in which interactions happen at many different distance scales at once.
These so-called "conformal field theories" are crucial for understanding diverse
phenomena ranging from the behavior of materials such as those used in the
semiconductor industry to the physics underlying the microscopic (quantum-
mechanical) nature of gravity. Because the interaction scales are so diverse,
these theories cannot be described using conventional theoretical tools, and
this project is aimed at developing improved theoretical tools in order to
achieve a better understanding of these systems. This research advances the
national interest by furthering our basic scientific knowledge of systems that
are likely to have numerous broad-ranging applications. This project is also
envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Morrison will involve
graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical
training for junior scientists beginning research in this field. He also intends
to promote the public understanding of science through efforts to make the
scientific literature broadly available to the public at large. More
technically, Professor Morrison will investigate supersymmetric conformal field
theories in dimensions four and six by using F theory and the algebraic geometry
of elliptic fibrations. F-theory is a variant of a superstring theory which
relies heavily on constructions from algebraic geometry (in mathematics) to
produce desired physical effects. Professor Morrison will use algebraic geometry
to develop new F-theory tools and improve our understanding of six-dimensional
conformal field theories in this way. He will also utilize a general method for
producing four-dimensional theories from six-dimensional ones, adapting that
method to the F theory context.
