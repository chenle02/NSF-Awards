This research is about a theory of new- and oldforms for
irreducible&lt;br/&gt;admissible representations of the algebraic group
PGSp(4,F), for F a&lt;br/&gt;nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero.
The first objective&lt;br/&gt;of this research is to prove the main conjecture,
supported by&lt;br/&gt;extensive evidence, which asserts that a generic
representation admits&lt;br/&gt;a nonzero vector fixed by a paramodular group of
some level; that at&lt;br/&gt;the minimal level such a vector is unique up to
nonzero scalars; and&lt;br/&gt;that at the minimal level a suitable
normalization of such a vector,&lt;br/&gt;called a newform, computes the
L-factor of the representation. The&lt;br/&gt;second objective is to prove a
precise conjecture about the structure&lt;br/&gt;of the spaces of oldforms in a
generic representation, i.e., the spaces&lt;br/&gt;of vectors fixed by
paramodular groups of level exceeding the minimal&lt;br/&gt;level. The third,
and final, objective is to investigate whether a&lt;br/&gt;version of the main
conjecture holds for nongeneric representations at&lt;br/&gt;the level of L- or
A-packets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Briefly summarized, number theory is the part of
mathematics concerned&lt;br/&gt;with the study of integral solutions to
algebraic equations. Though the&lt;br/&gt;problems of number theory often can be
simply stated, solutions may&lt;br/&gt;require extensive theoretical development
and input from other parts of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Broadly characterized, this
research seeks to tie&lt;br/&gt;together, in a useful and new way, two parts of
number theory. The&lt;br/&gt;first part, the theory of automorphic
representations, allows the&lt;br/&gt;formulation of comprehensive conjectures
and proofs; however,&lt;br/&gt;automorphic representations are abstract. The
second part, the theory&lt;br/&gt;of Siegel modular forms, is important for
examples and applications; on&lt;br/&gt;the other hand, Siegel modular forms can
hide important general&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. By developing the theory of local
new- and oldforms for&lt;br/&gt;PGSp(4) this research will make it easier to
systematically and&lt;br/&gt;conceptually construct Siegel modular forms from
automorphic&lt;br/&gt;representations, and thus may lead to work that draws on
the strengths&lt;br/&gt;of both theories. This research crosses several
subdisciplines of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and to facilitate this and other work
this project will&lt;br/&gt;create a freely accessible database on the World
Wide Web about the&lt;br/&gt;existing literature on
GSp(4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
