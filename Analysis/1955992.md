Partial differential equations (PDE) are used to model important systems in
various application areas; in particular, subelliptic PDE are helpful in
settings where there is a constrained dynamics. Examples of such systems include
the motion of robot arms, structural functions of the first layer of the
mammalian visual cortex, the Black-Scholes model for financial markets, and
quantum computing. Geometric and analytic properties of such spaces are captured
in a quantitative fashion by studying the behavior of certain families of
transformations of the space into itself. This project aims at studying fine
properties of such transformations. In terms of broader impacts, the principal
investigator will involve graduate and undergraduate students in several aspects
of the research and will design outreach activities to attract K-12 students to
mathematics.

The technical focus of the proposed research addresses a curve-shrinking flow in
Carnot groups, the study of harmonic extensions of quasiconformal mappings
between boundaries of certain Gromov hyperbolic spaces, and regularity of
certain nonlinear, degenerate parabolic PDE.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
