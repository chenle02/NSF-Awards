9424103 Jackson Through this award, the Directorate for Biological Sciences and
the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the Directorate for
Education and Human Resources award will provide support for an innovative
summer program that targets students from two year colleges, a student
population that typically does not participate in REU-sites programs. During the
first two summers, participants will be extensively trained in various
techniques used commonly in molecular biology and biotechnology research at the
Massachusetts Bay Community College in Wellesley Hills, MA. During the third
summer, participants will use this technical knowledge to pursue independent
research at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA or the Science
Park biotechnology center in New Haven, CT. The aim of the program is to equip
students with the confidence and experience necessary to enter and complete
post-baccalaureate training in science. ***
