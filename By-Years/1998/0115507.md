0115507&lt;br/&gt;Pourboghrat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimal controller design for
nonlinear systems has been the topic of much research in the past years.
Although optimal controller design has been completely developed for dynamic
linear systems, its nonlinear extension is still a topic of research. A general
framework for dynamic optimization is the calculus of variations and the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Although these minimization algorithms
over the years have found many important applications, the corresponding
algorithm usually requires the solution of a two-point boundary value problem,
which is not applicable for on-line implementation. Currently, there are several
approximating techniques available that can be used for optimal regulator
design. These can also be implemented on-line at the price of rendering the
control sub-optimal. The problem of optimal tracking controller is even harder,
since the approximating techniques, in general, cannot be implemented on-
line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will attempt to develop a universal
optimal controller for a large class of controllable and observable nonlinear
systems. The objective of this research is a new generic approach for the design
of optimal controllers that can be implemented on-line. The key component for
the proposed control architecture is the use of a generic dynamic neural network
(DNN). DNNs are shown to be capable of approximating any nonlinear dynamic
system with an arbitrary degree of accuracy, provided that they have enough
number of neurons. This generic model of the nonlinear system can be utilized
for the derivation of the proposed universal controller for optimal tracking
problem. The problem of weight adjustment (adaptation) in the network can be
viewed as a controller design for an equivalent system. This allows one to
formulate the two problems of parameter adaptation and controller design for a
system as single problem of controller design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
