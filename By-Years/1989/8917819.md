A complete inventory of the estimated 17,000 species of ferns, conifers, and
flowering plants of the Middle American tropics is the goal of an ambitious
multi-investigator, multi- national program of research coordinated at the
Missouri Botanical Garden, under Dr. Gerrit Davidse. Flora Mesoamericana, in the
form of a traditional published series of books and as a parallel computerized
data base, is a synoptic inventory of the vascular plants that provides
descriptions of basic plant features, a comprehensive identification guide, a
summary of geographical ranges for each species, and a standardized synthesis of
the taxonomy of all the plants. Mesoamerica includes Panama, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, plus the Mexican states of
Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Yucatan, and Tabasco. Taxonomic work is being
contributed by staff members of the Missouri Botanical Garden, the National
University in Mexico City, and the British Museum of Natural History.
Cooperative planning and participation of Mesoamerican botanists are major
features of the project. The flora volumes are being published in Spanish in
Mexico through the National University; the computer databases initially are
being developed in St. Louis and in London, and will be extended to the Mexico
City station. The first published volumes will treat the monocots (grasses,
sedges, lilies, and relatives) and the ferns; subsequent volumes will treat the
dicots and the gymnosperms. There is no comparable inventory of the rich plant
resources of this vast region, portions of which are changing rapidly through
human disturbance and development.
