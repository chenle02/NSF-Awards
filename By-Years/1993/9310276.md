9310276 Blume Traditional models of strategic interaction assume that a
population of highly rational players interacts with one another in a non-
cooperative fashion to determine a collective outcome. While these models
improve our understanding of centralized socialized interaction such as that
seen in well-organized financial asset markets, they do not address the kind of
decentralized non- cooperative competition that arises in labor markets, markets
for retail services, and many non-market social settings. Such phenomena are
best modeled as games with a spatial structure. Players live at given locations.
Each player competes (or, more generally, interacts) only with his near
neighbors. Nonetheless the choice of distant players has an indirect effect
through a string of players who share neighbors who share neighbors, etc. Social
interaction through this decentralized spatial or geographic structure stands in
contrast to centralized social interaction wherein everyone interacts directly
with everyone else. This research will investigate how strategic choice evolves
over time when interaction is decentralized. Preliminary research has shown that
the sharp rationality hypotheses of traditional game theory are not necessary to
understand how competition evolves and what outcomes are ultimately achieved.
Consequently the investigation will study the consequences of abandoning the
traditional models of hyper-rationality in favor of looser strictures on
individual behavior, and study how the spatial structure of the player
population enhances or inhibits the organization of play (e.g., the evolution of
cooperation in so- called "coordination games"). Another theme of the project is
the contrast between social outcomes that can be reached through centralized
social interaction and those that are achieved with decentralized interaction.
Finally, the project will study the ramifications of different "interaction
technologies," such as random matching and fixed partners, for the evolution of
collective choice. ***
