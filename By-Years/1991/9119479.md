This award from the Chemistry Shared Research Instrumentation Program will help
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming to acquire a graphics
computer system. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1. Charge-Transfer Complexes as Probes of Steric Congestion
and Facility of Orientational Motion in Self-Assembled Monolayers 2. Unified
Theoretical Treatment of Chemical Reaction Energy-Surfaces 3. Spider Silk
Protein Structure Function 4. Electronic Structures of Solid State and Molecular
Metal Sulfides 5. An Investigation of the Electronic Properties of Chelating
Fluoroalkylphosphines 6. Remote Participation During Photooxidation at Sulfur
Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The need to accomodate multiple users on the single
laboratory computer and multiple users on a single chemistry department facility
can be met by a single solution: individual work stations for the majority of
user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to other types of work stations
and, ultimately, to a mini supercomputer.
