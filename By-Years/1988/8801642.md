Studies of the marine biology of Antarctic coastal and oceanic environments date
back well over a century. Past and contemporary studies of Antarctic marine
biology have revealed a rich and varied marine biota, in many respects unlike
any temperate or tropical counterpart. Collectively, these studies have been of
great interest to Antarctic and non-Antarctic biologists alike. However, non-
Antarctic biologists rarely have access to meetings devoted to Antarctic marine
biology. McClintock and Pearse request funds to support a national symposium
which will review past, current and future directions in the field of Antarctic
marine biology for non- Antarctic researchers. The symposium will be held in
conjunction with the joint American Society of Zoologists (ASZ)/Western Society
of Naturalists (WSN) meeting Dec. 27-31, 1988 in San Fransisco, California.
Fourteen invited speakers, who are among the foremost researchers in the field,
will present an overview of the marine biology of this unique environment.
Invitations to attend the symposium will be sent to approximately 100 polar
marine biologists, and an announcement will be forwarded to members of the ASZ
and WSN, and be published in a variety of scientific journals. Proceedings will
be published in the American Zoologist. The symposium will provide a unique
opportunity for non-Antarctic biologists to become familiar with important
topics in Antarctic marine biology from those who are at the forefront of the
field.
