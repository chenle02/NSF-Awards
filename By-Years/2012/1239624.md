The 34th Midwest Probability Colloquium at Northwestern University on October
12-14, 2012, at Northwestern University. Probability theory has been the most
applicable branch of pure mathematics. During the last decade we have seen a
clear surge in popularity of probabilistic tools and methods in other branches
of pure and applied mathematics. This year's selection of program topics and
speakers reflect the broad scope of applicability of the discipline. By
maintaining a wide range of active research directions, the Midwest Probability
Colloquium continues to provide a forum for the exchange of intellectual
interest across a wide array of applied fields as well as for core areas of
mathematics. Following the well established traditional format, the colloquium
will be divided into the Tutorial Program and the Research Program. This year's
topic of the Tutorial Program is Probability and Mathematical Biology and will
be hosted by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steven Evans (University of California,
Berkeley)&lt;br/&gt;David Steinsaltz (University of
Oxford)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers of the Research Program
are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Meckes (CaseWestern Research
University)&lt;br/&gt;Jeremy Quastel (University of Toronto)&lt;br/&gt;Gennady
Samorodnitsky (Cornell University)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference will be
sponsored jointly by the National Science Foundation with a conference grant and
by Northwestern University with providing the venue and other local amenities.
