This proposal seeks funding for partial support of a series of three workshops
designed to stimulate the use of new, emerging programming models and advanced
high performance computing (HPC) architectures in a variety of computational
science disciplines. These workshops are designed to explore computational
methods for use in conjunction with the HPC systems acquired with funding from
the National Science Foundation (Grants 0958379 and 0855217). The goal of the
workshop series is to accelerate the use of computational science to solve
critical problems in science, engineering, and other disciplines by promoting an
exchange of information between systems developers, software developers, and
domain scientists. To accomplish this goal, the workshop series will explore
long-term trends in high performance computing as well as the very recent
developments in processor accelerator technology, for example graphics
processing units (GPUs), and in partitioned global address space (PGAS)
programming models and how these recent developments are part of an evolutionary
path to future exascale high performance computing systems.
