This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to show the
feasibility of an advanced concept electro-optical fluorescence microscope
suitable for both routine analysis and research applications. Fluorescence
microscopy has become an increasingly important research and diagnostic tool in
the life sciences and material sciences. Applying video imaging to fluorescence
microscopy has been difficult due to the low level of fluorescent emission and
low contrast in the image. Current video fluorescence microscopes cannot show
real-time 1280 x 1024, images at the diffraction limit of the optics. This
instrument has many features that are unavailable in any single fluorescence
microscope, including real-time, multi-color video images, instantaneous zoom
with no change in focus or brightness, selective contrast enhancement,
fluorescence lifetime excitation, simultaneous full-color
transmission/reflection imaging, or simultaneous transmission/fluorescence
imaging, and diffraction-limited resolution for all objective powers. The
technology can be expanded to include steerable zoom and stereo imaging. The
technology promises to have a cost at the low end of current fluorescence
methods.
