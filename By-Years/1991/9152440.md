The goal of this project is to create a learning environment in which computers
are used both as experimental and as instructional tools. The laboratory
experiments developed 1) permit students to run virtual experiments through the
use of interactive animation, 2) learn to manage and control data acquisition
systems, and 3) run simulations of biological, biochemical, and biophysical
events. Using Macintosh IIci computers, data acquisition hardware and LabVIEW 2,
a unique graphic programming environment that can be used to develop data
acquisition programs or simulations, students have the ability to devise
innovative experiments directly on the computer. Students given an experimental
problem can, by interacting with the computer, control the path of an animated
simulation and experimentally derive solutions to the problem.
