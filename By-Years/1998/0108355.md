This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
techniques for low-cost, high-efficiency, wide-bandwidth power amplifiers for
magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) systems. To date, MRI transmitters have been
based upon broadband linear power amplifiers, which are inefficient and
consequently large, heavy, and expensive. Further, there is a growing demand for
systems operating at higher frequencies with larger bandwidths. Existing high
efficiency transmitters are relatively expensive and have limited bandwidths.
The approach in Phase I is based upon high-level amplitude modulation, low cost
RF power transistors, digital signal processing, and electronic tuning.

The principal potential commercial application is MRI. Other applications
include radio frequency communications, high frequency radar, radio frequency
heating (plasmas, semiconductors), and laser drivers.
