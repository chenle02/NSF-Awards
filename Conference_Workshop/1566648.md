This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) 2016" that will be held from May
23-27, 2016, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This conference is the thirty-sixth installment of the Great Plains Operator
Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group
of over one-hundred mathematicians whose primary research interests are in
operator theory or the theory of operator algebras. Some of the main foci of the
2016 event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; free probability;
recent advances in operator theory; classification of C*-algebras;
noncommutative geometry; noncommutative probability; C*-algebras and dynamical
systems; operator spaces and their applications. The conference program provides
ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
