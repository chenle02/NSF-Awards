The Asiatic or Siberian Eskimos were under Russian/Soviet dominance during most
of their contact history and subject to enormous acculturation pressure. This
project will provide the first monograph on the contact history and survival of
this indigenous group and compare Native transitions and government strategies
during two periods in Russia, 1900-1932 and 1933-1990, and parallel developments
in the U.S., Canada and Denmark.
