9360754 Morford The Microsoft Windows NT (New Technology) Operating System will
be released in the second half of 1993, and is totally inaccessible to visually
impaired students and business professionals. This operating system will be in
many colleges and universities for science and mathematics courses and will
severely hinder the educational and career opportunities for visually impaired
people. The goal of the Graphic Access New Technology (GANT) project is to make
Windows NT accessible to visually impaired persons. Automated Functions, Inc.
(AFI) will design and develop software that will accurately map the two
dimensional Windows NT graphic display to the one dimensional medium of speech.
GANT will use a innovative multiple task approach which uses artificial
intelligence pattern matching technology to accurately convert the graphic
pattern to text character. AFI is expert in the design and development of
adaptive aids to assist visually impaired people. The GANT team is familiar with
graphic based operating systems and understands the needs of persons with visual
impairments. A successful GANT system will enable visually impaired people to
use the same Windows NT System as their sighted peers, enabling access to
mathematics and science related courses and professions without any sighted
assistance. ***
