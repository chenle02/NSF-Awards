The Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples
recorded at the bottomonium resonances: upsilon (5S), upsilon (2S) and upsilon
(1S). The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College
group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a
focus on the study of the important spin-singlet states of bottomonium. The
Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate
students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking
part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software
tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II.
