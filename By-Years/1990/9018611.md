This project investigates the regulation of vertebrate renal function, focusing
on the reptiles. Although paradigms have been accepted for the regulation of the
kidney in nonmammalian vertebrates, relatively little quantitative data is
available for any group. This study proposes to investigate the determinants of
release for hormones likely to influence renal function. And to provide
important information on the hormonal regulation of the reptilian kidney at the
whole organ level and at the level of the single functional unit within the
kidney, the nephron. These approaches will utilize intact animal studies,
isolated organ perfusion, and intravital microscopy. Although mammals and
nonmammalian vertebrates share virtually all the hormonal and neural components
for the control of excretion by the kidney, the relationships between plasma
hormones, neural activity, and renal function appear to be significantly
different. This variation in the response of the kidney and in regulatory
dominance among vertebrates may allow specific regulatory mechanisms to be more
easily observed and elucidated in nonmammalian kidneys. Therefore, this project
will markedly broaden our understanding of the regulation of reptilian kidney
function, and at the same time, may provide a useful model for investigating
principles and mechanisms of renal regulation by hormonal and neural control
shared by all vertebrates.//
