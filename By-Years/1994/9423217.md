This two-year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in fluid
mechanics between Kang Ping Chen of Arizona State University and D. G. Crighton
of the University of Cambridge. They propose studies on large-scale
instabilities in a turbulent jet and in other turbulent shear flows using
viscoelastic modeling for Reynolds stresses. Particular attention will be paid
to the instability mechanism due to elastic stresses. The collaboration is a
continuation of the U.S. investigator's recent work on viscoelastic fluids flow
and interfacial instabilities in co-current shear flows. He brings to this
collaboration experience in viscoelastic fluids research and expertise in
asymptotic analysis and numerical simulation. This is complemented by the
British investigator's experience in fluid dynamics research. The project will
advance theoretical understanding of large-scale structures in jets and other
turbulent shear flows.
