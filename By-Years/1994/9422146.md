9422146 Huttenlocher This award is to purchase equipment for support of research
in Computer and Information Science and Engineering. Specifically, this award
will be used for equipment to support several projects in the processing and
analysis of digital video: 1) video motion analysis for annotation and browsing
-- detecting significant changes in camera motion and tracking moving objects in
order to automatically segment unstructured video; 2) adaptive video compression
-- using motion segmentation in compression; 3) video transcoding; 4) network
protocols for continuous media; and 5) compression-- tolerant image analysis --
including development of algorithms that operate directly on compressed video
data. ***
