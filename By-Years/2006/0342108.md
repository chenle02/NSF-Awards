The current capability of neuroscience to monitor and alter brain function has
profound ethical implications, which scientists and the public have only begun
to examine. Two recent major conferences were devoted to surveying the ethical
implications of progress in neuroscience, one at the University of Pennsylvania
entitled "Ethics and the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution" and one at Stanford
University entitled "Neuroethics: Mapping the Field." These conferences promoted
the dissemination of ideas among individuals and the wider public. The current
series of workshops will take the next step, in the form of intensive dialogue
among relevant experts that will give form and direction to the field of
neuroethics. Specifically, the meetings are designed to accomplish the following
objectives: (1) Define issues of highest priority for neuroethics; (2) Elucidate
scientific progress and obstacles; (3) Engage ethicists and policy specialists
in the areas most relevant to each particular issue, to help understand the most
directly relevant moral principles and social traditions, relevant regulations
or policies now in place, and analogous precedents in other fields; (4) With the
relevant scientists and ethicists, collaboratively develop policy positions on
each issue; and (5) For each issue, write and submit an article summarizing the
major conclusions for publication in a widely read or generalist journal.
