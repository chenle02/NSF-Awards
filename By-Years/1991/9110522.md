Machines During the past decade, parallel database systems havegained increased
popularity due to their high performance,scalability, and availability
characteristics. With thepredicted future database sizes and complexity of
queries,it is essential that these systems effectively utilizehundreds or
thousands of processors. Several studies haverepeatedly demonstrated that both
the performance and scalability of a parallel database system is contingent on
the physical layout of the data across the processors of the system.Recently,
the design of a new declustering strategy, termed Multi-Attribute GrId
deClustering (MAGIC), was introduced. MAGIC is superior to the current
declustering strategies because it can partition a relation using two or more of
its attributes. In addition, it minimizes the overhead of using parallelism to
allow the system to scale to a large number of processors. This project focuses
on: (1) analysis and extension of MAGIC for executing complex queries, and (2)
incorporation of algorithms for dynamic on-line reorganization of a relation in
the presence of update queries and changing workload characteristics.The
approach involves development of analytical and simulation models first,
followed by a prototype implementation. This research enhances the scalability
of a parallel database machine and improve its performance for executing complex
queries.
