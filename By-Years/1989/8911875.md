This project addresses a neglected but crucial area of research in the theory of
strategic dynamics, i.e., renegotiation in repeated games. Renegotiation and
bargaining power are combined in a unified, coherent theory. Much of the project
is concerned with providing clean characterizations which make the theory
tractable in applied economic problems. Both the formulation of the appropriate
definitions and the characterizations become progressively more challenging as
more complicated supergames are studied. The project gives definitions and
conjectured results for asymmetric strictly repeated games and for some dynamic
and stochastic games. This is extremely important research because it corrects a
major flaw in models of repeated games and repeated game models are widely used
in macro theory, industrial organization, international trade and many other
areas of economic theory. The validity of repeated game models depend on the
credibility of the agreements reached by the players. If players think they can
escape punishment for violating agreements by renegotiating the agreement after
they violate it, then they no longer have an incentive to abide by the
agreements. Therefore, a model of repeated games without a theory of
renegotiation is flawed because many different outcomes other than the one
agreed upon are possible.
