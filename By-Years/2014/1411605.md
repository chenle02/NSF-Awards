The goal of this program is to use very small motions of distant galaxies and
quasars to test cosmology, measure geometric distances, and detect gravitational
waves. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and
graduate students. In addition, Dr. Darling will participate in Colorado's Fiske
Planetarium live lecture series using the Science on a Sphere (SOS) exhibit that
will enable communication of the broad ideas of cosmology, relativity, and other
current research to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proper motion
measurements will be obtained from geodetic monitoring, the Gaia mission, and
original observations at radio frequencies using Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI). They can provide cosmological tests that are nearly
model-independent. This work can measure or constrain: (1) The real-time growth
and recession of structures, providing mass and distance measurements, (2)
Extragalactic parallax for a statistical sample and individual galaxies, thus
providing geometric distances, (3) The primordial stochastic long-period
gravitational wave background and (4) Cosmic shear, rotation, bulk motion, and
local voids that may manifest as an apparent acceleration attributed to dark
energy.
