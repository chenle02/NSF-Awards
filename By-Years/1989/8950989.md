Experiments in structural dynamics and control are to be conducted by
undergraduate students. Similar instrumentation has been acquired and
experiments successfully integrated into the graduate curriculum. However,
insufficient facilities exist to handle the additional requirements of large
undergraduate classes. The experiments will provide adequate resources for two
test station dedicated to the undergraduate laboratory. In the first part of the
experiment, modal analysis will be performed on several simple structures, the
results of which will be compared with analytical and/or computation solutions.
In the second part, linear and nonlinear systems representing aircraft and space
structures will be modeled on a analog simulator. Control methodology will be
digitally implemented via microcomputer. These experiments will lead to better
understanding of phenomena arising in both rigid body and flexible body dynamics
and control as well as providing hands on experience with equipment generally
found in both industrial and academic environments.
