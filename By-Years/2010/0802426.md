The WGBH Educational Foundation (WGBH) is developing, evaluating, and
disseminating a Teachers' Domain digital library collection of 50 rich-media
resources drawn from the national network of ATE Projects and Resource Centers
to support the teaching and learning of advanced technologies in high schools.
Leveraging NSF's investment in the original production of such learning objects
for use in higher education settings through the ATE program, the project is
identifying those most appropriate for teachers and students in grades 9-12 and
adding background essays, lesson plans, and other contextualization features to
support integration with commonly taught curricula, easy use by both teachers
and students, and alignment with standards in mathematics and science as well as
technology. A companion online professional development course targeting
science, math, and technical/career education teachers at the high school level
is also being produced and marketed. The Center for Children and Technology
(CCT) at the Education Development Center (EDC) is piloting these resources in
testbed schools and conducting a series of case studies analyzing use throughout
the country. This project is helping to prepare the nation's technical workforce
by enhancing the relevance and impact of STEM education while also encouraging
students to consider further study and potential careers in advanced technology
fields. A secondary goal is to prepare high school teachers to integrate such
content within ongoing math and science classes. Dissemination, promotion, and
marketing activities are conducted through collaborating ATE Projects and
Resource Centers as well as established channels of WGBH and the other member
stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), engaging professional
associations in K-12 science, math, and technology.
