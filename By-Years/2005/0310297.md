Practical yet Provably Secure Public-Key Primitives

Victor Shoup



This research addresses the fundamental building blocks, or primitives, of
public-key cryptography, and attempts to design and analyze new primitives that
improve the state of the art, either through increased efficiency or increased
security. The objectives are to design new primitives suitable for publication
in academic journals, as well as for submission to relevant standards bodies.
The methods used include (1) the "reductionist" approach of modern cryptography,
whereby the security of a scheme is formally reduced to the presumed
intractability of well-studied mathematical problems (e.g., factoring), and (2)
algorithmic techniques from number theory and algebra.

Public-key cryptography plays an essential role in securing computers and
communication networks. The two basic public-key primitives are public-key
encryption and digital signatures. The first primitive allows a sender to
secretly transmit a message to a receiver, where the sender only needs to know a
public key (known to everyone), while only the receiver needs to know the
corresponding secret key. The second primitive allows a signer, using a secret
key, to generate a digital signature on a message so that the signature can
later be verified by any party using a corresponding public key.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years on these problems,
there is still more work to do, in terms of improving the efficiency of the
schemes, reducing the strength of the intractability assumptions, improving the
quality of the security reductions, and in developing practical distributed
versions of these schemes so as to avoid a single point of failure. These are
the specific tasks taken on by this research.
