Professor Hadwin will conduct research on the theory of operators on Hilbert
space. His investigation will include work on generalizations of the Bishop-
Stone-Weierstrass theorem for subalgebras of a C* or W* algebra, a study of the
notion of reflexivity for operators and operator algebras, and of invariant
operator ranges, among other topics. Hilbert space operators are essentially
infinite matrices of complex numbers. These operators have applications in every
area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is
an attempt to classify certain important categories of such objects.
