One key to empanelling an impartial jury for a courtroom trial is the process of
voir dire in which the judge, the attorneys, or both, question potential jurors
about their background, history, and beliefs in order to determine whether they
are qualified to serve. To identify biased prospective jurors, attorneys and
judges must elicit adequate and accurate responses to questions. Social science
research has shown that jurors do not provide such responses and resist
admitting to bias. An apparent reason for voir dire's shortcomings is the kind
and quality of questions asked by attorneys and judges. This research will
assess the adequacy of typical questioning during voir dire in terms of social
science standards of questioning and interviewing, and then examine the
relationship between the adequacy of the questioning and the identification of
juror bias. The theoretical and methodological significance of this research is
that it will provide systematic knowledge about voir dire questioning and
demonstrate a method for the evaluation of that procedure. The broader
significance is that the research should identify potential improvements in the
effectiveness of voir dire for empanelling an impartial jury as guaranteed by
the 6th Amendment.
