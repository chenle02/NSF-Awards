9511540 Fuhr This two-year award will support U.S.-Ireland cooperative research
between Peter L. Fuhr and Brian MacCraith of Dublin City University, Dublin,
Ireland. The objective is to investigate the use of spectroscopic and evanescent
wave sensors to detect the presence and concentration amounts of hazardous
contaminant and corrosive materials in the environment. The investigator has
been involved in the development of fiber optic sensors capable of operating
when embedded inside civil structures. He proposes to use similar techniques to
test a fiber optic evanescent wave sensor for contaminant (or corrosion)
monitoring in civil structures and at construction sites. The project takes
advantage of Irish expertise in the field of evanescent wave sensing. This is
complemented by the principal investigator's experience in fiber optics sensors
incorporating spectroscopic techniques. The project will advance understanding
of the application of fiber optic sensors for monitoring environmental
activities.
