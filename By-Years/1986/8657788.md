String theory has become the leading candidate for a unified theory of the
fundamental interactions, replacing theories of pointlike particle interactions
with elastic, one dimensional, extended objects. Strings enlarge and extend the
symmetry and structure of spacetime, matter, and forces in ways that are not yet
fully understood. One of the goals of this research is to discover the
underlying principles of string theory, which may enable us to solve some
longstanding problems of physics. One of these is the reconciliation of quantum
mechanics and general relativity. String theory appears to reconcile the quantum
with the equivalence principle by modifying the microscopic structure of
spacetime while preserving differential geometry as a large- scale
approximation. One of the mathematical structures that may be a key to this new
geometry is the connection between string dynamics and two dimensional surfaces;
this connection has been the focus of the recent work of this investigator. The
investigator is one of the new Presidential Young Investigators for FY 1987. He
is an exceptionally promising young theoretical elementary particle physicist
whose future work on string theory and on other areas of elementary particle
theory should be very significant and interesting.
