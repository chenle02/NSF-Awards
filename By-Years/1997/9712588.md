The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Amitabha Sinha of The
University of California - San Diego in his continuing studies on the influence
of initial vibrational state selection on the dissociation dynamics of
molecules. Using vibrational overtone-overtone double resonance, he can prepare
HOCl in specific rovibrational states on the ground electronic state surface and
investigate the expected non-statistical behavior. Photodissociation dynamics of
molecules (e.g., CH3I and H2O) occurring on excited electronic states will also
be investigated, with the goal to better understand the coupling of vibrational
motion with nearly degenerate electronic excited states. The study of chemical
reactions and their associated reaction dynamics stands at the forefront of
contemporary physical chemistry. The goal of the present study is to understand
how various molecular vibrations having similar total energy but corresponding
to different intramolecular distribution of the excitation influence chemical
reactivity. Measurements in which the excited states are fully resolved yield
data which allow detailed comparisons with current theoretical models and
promise to provide new insights into the factors that influence selectivity in
chemical reactions.
