Computer Science (31) This project uses robots in an undergraduate liberal arts
computer science curriculum to enhance two courses: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Advanced Topics. Work done by other educators on using robots in the
Artificial Intelligence course are adapted and extended in two ways: 1) learning
objective for the use of robots is based on high-level knowledge-based AI
algorithms rather than low-level reactive algorithms, and the impact of robot
construction on liberal arts students is minimized; and 2) robots are
incorporated into the existing AI course rather than by creating a separate
course on robotics. This minimizes the impact of using robots on faculty
resources at smaller liberal arts Computer Science departments. Finally, robots
are used for open-lab projects thereby minimizing the impact of using robots on
the credit requirements for the major, while at the same time, providing
students with a greater opportunity to be creative in their solutions. This
project adapts the work done earlier in incorporating robots into the AI
curriculum at St. Bonaventure University, Bryn Mawr College, and Swarthmore
College.
