This grant supports a program of research in nuclear physics and astrophysics
at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of The California Institute of Technology.
The research is carried out by a group consisting of 6 professional faculty, 2
research faculty, 14 postdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists, 12 graduate
students and 8 undergraduates. The research consists of low energy experiments,
intermediate energy experiments, and theory. The low energy work includes
measurements relevant to the synthesis of the elements in the easily universe
and in stellar evolution, and is conducted with accelerators in the Kellogg
Laboratory. The intermediate energy experiments employ electron- scattering to
probe short-range properties of nuclei. This work will include experiments with
an optically pumped polarized 3He target built by the group, to determine the
electric form factor of the neutron. The measurements will be made at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, at the MIT Bates Laboratory, and at other
international accelerator centers. In addition, a search for neutrino-
oscillations will continue, using the neutrino beam from the Los Alamos Meson
Facility. The theory component of the Kellogg program addresses a variety of
theoretical and phenomenological studies, many of which are related to
experiments carried out by the Kellogg group. Particular emphasis is placed in
all these activities on providing students with the broadcast possible education
in nuclear physics.
