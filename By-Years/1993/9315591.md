CTS-9315591 Columbia University Alan C. West ABSTRACT Spatial and temporal
variation of electrodeposition for two specific cathode geometries in the
presence of laminar, tangential, periodic flow will be investigated. Current
distributions are to be determined for a cathode at the base of a recessed
insulating cavity and for a set of three closely spaced cathodes. Experimental
measurements of the codeposition of copper with trace amounts of silver will be
compared to results from numerical simulations with the transport equations.
Improved electrodeposition has the potential for higher quality products in a
broad range of industries from plating to microelectronics.
