Under the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Samuel Jones at the University of
Georgia, Mr. Myong Chung will study the morphology, chromosome composition, and
patterns of genetic variability in Korean and Japanese species of the monocot
genus Hosta, source of the horticulturally important hosta lilies. Numerous
populations in Korea and Japan have been collected by the student over the past
few years, and samples from these and other collections will provide materials
for herbarium and laboratory studies. Genetic barriers between species will be
evaluated through a program of artificial hybridizations in a common-garden
experiment, in part to test whether species are reproductively isolated.
Electrophoretic techniques are being used to measure amounts of gene differences
between species, focusing upon a subset of seven species in a genus estimated to
have 20 or so species in nature. The hosta lilies, native to eastern Asia, are
in a taxonomically confused condition, and the project will help establish a
reliable basis for species identification and for inferring evolutionary
relationships among the various forms.
