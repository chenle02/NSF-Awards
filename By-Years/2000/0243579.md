ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this exploratory project is to
develop and evaluate a system to extract, categorize, and analyze awards focused
on nanoscale science and engineering. The PI will explore methods based on
knowledge data discovery techniques to advance the state-of-the-art for
extracting, analyzing, understanding, and digesting information about a complex
research area from large semi-structured data. The areas of focus will be on
discovery of topics and research trends and classification of data with respect
to the topics under consideration. For the test case, the abstracts of 250,000
NSF awards available on the web will be used as the overall data where both
technical merit as well as broader impact will be analyzed.
