This engineering research equipment grant provides for upgrading one soil test
system for geomechanics research. The equipment that will be purchased includes
a general purpose, automated triaxial soil testing system, with a servo-
controlled feedback and associated electronic software. This equipment has the
unique capability of performing strain-controlled soil tests to measure
appropriate mechanical response and soil failure behavior under confining stress
conditions. The equipment system will also complement the geotechnical
centrifuge facility which is being completed by the University of Colorado at
Boulder.
