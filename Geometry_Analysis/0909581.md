The Ricci flow, and the field of geometric flows in general, has seen tremendous
progress and yielded important applications to geometry, topology, and nonlinear
analysis. The fundamental works of R. Hamilton and recent breakthrough by
Perelman on the Ricci flow have led to the spectacular applications to
geometrization of 3-manifolds, including the Hamilton-Perelman proof of the
Poincar√© conjecture. In this project, the PI will investigate several important
problems related to the formation of singularities in the Ricci flow and the
Kahler-Ricci flow which are of great interest in geometry, complex analysis, and
nonlinear partial differential equations. They include studying the geometry,
such as volume growths and curvature decay rates, and the classification of
complete noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci solitons; the geometry of steady
Ricci solitons with positive curvature, in particular the uniqueness question in
3 dimensions; asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Kahler-Ricci flow on
compact Kahler manifolds with positive first Chern class. Progress on these
issues would lead to profound new understandings in geometry and nonlinear
analysis.

The Ricci flow is an important type of geometric flows, which have profound
importance and applications in science and geometry. Examples of applications of
other include the motion of a surface by its mean curvature, the flow of gas in
a porous mechanism, the motion of a liquid crystal, the diffusion of oil in
shale, the reproduction of sparse species, and image sharpening.
