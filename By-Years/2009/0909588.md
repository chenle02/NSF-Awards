Field experience is a fundamental part of the training of student geologists,
but practical considerations limit the numbers of students who can take part in
extensive field programs. Moreover, little is known about how novice geologists
acquire the visual skills of experts, raising questions about how best to
develop teaching interventions. The 5-year project investigates differences
between expert and novice geoscientists in the field and in a virtual semi-
immersive display environment. The research team is composed of scientists and
educators with expertise in perceptual learning, geology and geophysics, the
recording and analyzing of eye movements, and large-field-of-view image capture
of natural environments. They hypothesize that there are large differences
between the eye-movement sequences of experts and novices, and that novices will
show improvement during a field trip. The researchers will study similar groups
in a virtual environment, hoping to gain additional insight into learning
through comparisons of the data collected in the two environments. Their
ultimate goal is to design a virtual semi-immersive environment that replicates
the salient aspects of the field learning experience.
