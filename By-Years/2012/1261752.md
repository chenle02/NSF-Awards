The behavior of labor supply is critical for the analysis of many issues in
economics, including the effects of tax and transfer programs on allocations and
welfare, and business cycles. For the analysis of aggregate issues, the
elasticity of aggregate labor supply is a critical parameter. For many years
there has been substantial controversy over the magnitude of this elasticity. On
the one hand, estimates from micro data have tended to yield small elasticities,
while estimates from aggregate data often suggest much larger elasticities.
Because this elasticity plays a key role in so many contexts, this apparent
inconsistency is very problematic for obtaining reliable assessments for a wide
range of policies, or for predicting how the economy responds to various shocks.
This project seeks to resolve this apparent inconsistency by explicitly
considering models that incorporate plausible technological features and in
which one can both meaningfully recreate the standard micro estimation exercises
and also consider the effects of aggregate changes to the economy. Preliminary
work suggests that the disparate elasticity estimates can be reconciled within
such a model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labor market outcomes have large and direct
effects on the standard of living enjoyed by most individuals. Understanding
what factors shape labor market outcomes and assessing the welfare costs of
various policies and institutions will allow policy makers to make better
decisions and led to better economic outcomes. This work provides a better
foundation for aggregate economic policy evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
