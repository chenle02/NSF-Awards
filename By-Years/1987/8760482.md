Ground-based astronomical imaging is limited by the poor seeing conditions that
result from atmospheric turbulence in the viewing path. Large telescopes require
active correction for these effects to obtain the maximum resolving power
inherent in their aperture size. Traditional adaptive optical systems are costly
and limited in the number of elements that can be implemented. This research
will examine a new approach to active wavefront correction for astronomy. Under
a Phase I SBIR award a compact system operating in real time will be
investigated. It is all optical in design, eliminating substantial amounts of
electronic processing to reduce cost, increase speed, and allow expansion to
many active elements. Successful development of this technology could also
benefit optical testing and laser communications.
