Research will be carried out to investigate the cause and evolution of the nova
outburst and the driving mechanism of the hot, pulsating variable stars. The
studies will use a Lagrangian, hydrodynamic computer program that includes a
large nuclear reaction network, element diffusion, accretion, new surface
boundary conditions and the latest available equations of state. The specific
projects are: (1) a study of the consequences of accretion of hydrogen rich
material onto a strongly magnetized white dwarf; (2) a study to explore the
various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the observed abundances of
the intermediate mass elements and make specific predictions with respect to
Na-22 and Al-26, (3) a study to determine the cause of the cessation of nuclear
burning and the return to quiescence of the white dwarf which will include the
effects of dynamical friction and radiation pressure driven mass loss; (4) a
study of the recurrent nova phenomena concentrating on T Pyx, a slow nova due
for an outburst in the near future; (6) a study of the helium abundance in the
envelopes of the GW Vir (PG1159-035 variables) by means of nonradial,
nonadiabatic analyses and new compositions; (7) a study of the pulsating white
dwarf in the V471 binary system with the intent of discovering the cause of its
variability; (8) a study of cooling sequences, with diffusion included, for the
PG1159-035 variables; and (9) optical spectroscopic studies of novae in outburst
and blue stellar objects from the Case Blue Star survey.
