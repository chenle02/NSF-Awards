Software systems evolve over time in order to adapt to changes
in&lt;br/&gt;environment. Graceful software evolution requires that only
expected&lt;br/&gt;changes in functionality occur; while desirable, this is
difficult to&lt;br/&gt;achieve. Software tools are needed to automate the
evolution of&lt;br/&gt;complex software systems containing heterogeneous
components, by&lt;br/&gt;reporting change impact information to programmers,
allowing&lt;br/&gt;examination of the effects of code edits. Tool support for
change&lt;br/&gt;impact analysis has a clear potential to boost programmer
productivity&lt;br/&gt;and enable safe code
enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research in change impact analysis
assumes that an&lt;br/&gt;object-oriented system is developed with a suite of
tests, run as the&lt;br/&gt;system is updated to check the safety of changes.
Analyses can&lt;br/&gt;determine which tests are affected and which changes
affect each of&lt;br/&gt;these tests. Since these tests often exercise
independent&lt;br/&gt;functionalities, the tests affected correspond to
those&lt;br/&gt;functionalities that may have been altered. This research will
develop&lt;br/&gt;an interactive tool for change impact analysis of Java, as
part of a&lt;br/&gt;industrial-strength programming environment to ensure
practicality.&lt;br/&gt;The tool will allow experimentation with the granularity
of changes&lt;br/&gt;and program representations, incrementalization of the
analyses,&lt;br/&gt;collection of a Java benchmark suite, and application to
collaborative&lt;br/&gt;software development.&lt;br/&gt;
