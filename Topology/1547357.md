Recently, algebraic topology has found a number of applications within
mathematics and beyond. For example, topology provided powerful new methods for
detecting and describing shape and structure in complex and high-dimensional
data. This award supports the Research Training Group in Algebraic Topology and
its Applications at Ohio State University. This work will be performed in a
highly collaborative and active interdisciplinary research environment that has
recently emerged, involving investigators from the Departments of Mathematics
and Computer Science & Engineering. The main objective of the project is to
provide early-stage mathematicians and computer scientists with opportunities to
learn about both theoretical and applied aspects of topology and related fields.
Exposure to these topics will allow students and junior faculty to move fluently
across a range of research topics, to enter research communities in traditional
core areas, and to work in new interdisciplinary directions.

This award supports postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and
undergraduate researchers studying such topology-related fields as geometric
group theory, metric geometry, computational geometry and topology, knot theory,
and stochastic topology. The award also supports the development of new courses,
as well as working groups, seminars, and workshops in these areas. At the heart
of the project is an emphasis on mentoring at all levels. The program also
places a strong emphasis on developing writing and communication skills,
particularly for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students involved in the
research group.
