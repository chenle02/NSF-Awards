The Federation of the American Sociey for Experimental Biology will host a
conference on Plant Molecular Genetics at Copper Mountain, Colorado, on August
9-14, 1992. Overall, the objective of the conference is to bring together
genetic approaches to studies of plant development, hormone action,
transcriptional regulation, biochemical regulation, and disease resistance. %%%
It is timely and useful to bring together plant scientists at a conference where
the key emphasis is on the use of genetic analysis in the study of plant
biology.
