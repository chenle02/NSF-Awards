This award provides funds for an REU Site in Psychology at Southern University.
The aim of the project is to provide research experience opportunities for eight
undergraduate psychology majors during an 8-week summer training program.
Students will be recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. Students will
engage in coursework as well as learn about the research process by conducting
literature searches, conceptualizing research ideas, developing research
methodology, conducting research, analyzing data, writing research reports, and
presenting research papers at local, state, and regional conferences. The
program will enhance the professional growth and development of program
participants. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
research experiences. w
