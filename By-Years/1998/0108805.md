Professor S. Scott Saavedra and his co-workers at the University of Arizona are
developing biocompatible coatings that can be used as a universal platform for
the support of protein receptors in biosensing devices. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is examining the use of
polymerizable planar lipid bilayers for this use. Both specific and nonspecific
protein interactions with the lipid bilayers are evaluated, using novel optical
waveguide spectroscopic methods developed in Professor Saavedra's laboratory.
Methods for generating patterned microarrays of these materials are being
developed as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protein or peptide specific sensors
show great promise for analysis of biological systems, for monitoring drug
dosages and uptakes, and for detecting biomaterials in a variety of
applications. The development of robust, versatile substrates for these sensor
applications is the subject of this research project. Using novel polymerizable
lipid bilayers, a universal platform for these biosensors is being developed.
