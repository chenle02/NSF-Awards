Measurements of DOC and DON by the high temperature catalytic oxidation method
will be made on samples from upper ocean hydrocasts along four N-S transects
across the Equatorial Pacific in both the spring and the fall of 1992. The
sampling grid was designed and the timing of the cruises was selected in order
to observe the complete range of seasonal variability. These survey- type
measurements will provide critically needed data for constraining upper ocean
models of the carbon and nitrogen cycles.
