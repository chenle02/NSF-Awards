0421409&lt;br/&gt;Holzenburg&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves the
purchase of a state-of-the-art IR/Raman/NSO Microscope to be used by a number of
different departments at Texas A&amp;M University. Some of the noteworthy
projects include the characterization of metal colloid films for use in
microfluidic devices, the physical and chemical characterization of carbon
nanotubes for use in various material composites, and the characterization of
ultrasmall magnets in order to determine the effects magnetism plays on
vibrational modes of a specific molecule.
