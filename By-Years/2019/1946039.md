Episodic memory stores our past experiences; we can remember not only episodes
but also the order in which the episodes occurred. These memory abilities are
critical to our lives, but they tend to decline as we age and are impaired in
diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s. Developing an animal model of episodic memory and
its replay may be crucial to understanding episodic memory function in humans.
By using techniques currently available only in animals, the investigators will
advance our knowledge of human memory. The investigators will also explore
whether intensive, early, and sustained research experiences for undergraduate
and high-school students, in particular those students from underrepresented
groups, leads to an increase in STEM employment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We will
answer four questions. Do non-human animals have a rich representation of the
flow of past events? Can they replay episodic memories after incidental encoding
in an unexpected assessment of memory? Can they replay episodic memories forward
and backward in time? Can they "remember to remember" episodic memories?
Evidence of this type is critical to develop an animal model that recapitulates
critical aspects of human episodic memory mechanisms to effectively use the
causal techniques developed in animals to begin to provide insights about
specific cognitive mechanisms that occur in people. The proposed work may have
transformative effects in our understanding of human mechanisms of cognition by
combining powerful techniques only available in animals with cutting-edge
behavioral techniques that tap into cognitive mechanisms of the type focused on
in humans, while being guided by theories and computational models of human
cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
