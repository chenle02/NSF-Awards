Understanding the variety of properties exhibited by atomic nuclei from the
underlying forces between their constituent nucleons, and understanding how
these features evolve with the number of neutrons and protons, represents one of
the key challenges of nuclear physics. The central theme of this proposal is to
develop a new method for obtaining a reliable microscopic description of nuclei
across the nuclear landscape. This method, which is called the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group, has proven very successful in the treatment of many other
complex many-body quantum systems, and seems very well suited for application to
atomic nuclei as well. The goal of the proposal is to build the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group into a practical approach for the microscopic description
of atomic nuclei and to apply it systematically across the periodic
table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in achieving the goals of this project
should have broad impact extending well beyond the nuclear domain. Having a
reliable description of the detailed structure of atomic nuclei makes it
possible to address fundamental issues in nuclear astrophysics, including how
the elements in the universe are synthesized, as well as issues related to
fundamental symmetries of nature. The method being developed is computationally
very intensive, requiring the development of new computational algorithms that
should also have broad application across felds. Finally, the scientific
research that is proposed will involve the active participation of several Ph.D.
students, helping to train them in forefront scientific research and in cutting
edge computational methodologies. &lt;br/&gt;
