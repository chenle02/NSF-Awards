ABSTRACT OPP-9708349 MUNCHOW, ANDREAS RUTGERS UNIVERSITY This project will
utilize a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to conduct a series of oceanographic
transects from Baffin Bay, through the Canadian archipelago, to the Beaufort Sea
where a large, multidisciplinary research program, Surface Heat Budget of the
Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean, will be conducted. A measurement program of tracer
concentrations will be used to track fresh water flow out of the Arctic Ocean
through a series of outlets in the Canadian Archipelago. The strength and volume
of the outflow will be determined within a framework of physical and atmospheric
dynamics that control the circulation. This project will add an important
component to the understanding of global change on linkages of the Arctic Ocean
to the global ocean through one of the least studied "valves" in the global
plumbing system.
