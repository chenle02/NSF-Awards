This project will advance the knowledge of physical models which are of
fundamental importance in engineering, meteorology, or natural disaster, such as
flooding and hurricanes. It will advance the development of powerful
mathematical tools based on state of the art analysis, and the theory of linear
and nonlinear partial differential equations. An important component of the
project concerns the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists
and researchers. The research program provides ample opportunities for Ph.D.
students and Postdocs to be trained in mathematical analysis and physical
modeling applied to fluid mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses
powerful mathematical tools to tackle several fundamental questions on the
behavior of flows in fluid mechanic. A rigorous theory will be developed to
study how incompressible flows become linearly unstable close to possible blow-
up time, a typical signature of turbulence. The effect of boundaries on the
dynamic of incompressible flows is of paramount importance. It will be
thoroughly investigated on the 3D quasi-geostrophic equation, a model used in
meteorology and oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
