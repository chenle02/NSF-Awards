In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Brian C. Goess of the Department of Chemistry at Furman
University will develop syntheses of new members of the sesquiterpene
furanosteroid family of natural products. These molecules, which include
wortmannin, have attracted significant attention for their ability to inhibit
the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K), enzymes known to play a critical role
in cell growth and differentiation. Syntheses of six new members of this family
of natural products, none of which have been previously synthesized, will be
developed. Additionally, modifications to the synthesis routes will generate
analogs suitable for use in assays to determine the biological activities of
these new natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new natural products are
isolated in only minute quantities from their natural sources. Given their
important biological activities and their potential as chemotherapeutics,
chemical synthesis of each of these molecules is necessary. This work will also
enable more efficient methods for the preparation of this entire family of
molecules, including those that exist but have not yet been isolated from
natural sources. This project could have significant impacts on pharmaceutical
industries and general biological studies. This project will also serve as the
training ground for undergraduate chemists, many of which will attend graduate
schools in chemistry, where the skills they develop on this project will be
extensively utilized.
