Geology (42) Recent innovations in information technology and advancements in
Geographic Information System software enable in-the-field, real-time access to
data collection, analysis and visualization. The GeoPad project involves a
field-durable TabletPC equipped with wireless networking, GPS receiver, digital
camera, voice-recognition and GIS software. Following a successful study
exploring the potential benefits of GeoPad, this project is fully integrating
the use of GeoPads into field courses and upper-level undergraduate geology
courses. GeoPad technology and integrated curriculum content are enhancing
spatial reasoning skills by affording students powerful data visualization,
analysis and interpretation tools; enriching field trip experiences by providing
access to supplemental information in support of interactive discussions of
geologic observations; and enhancing field-based exercises by supporting real-
time, distributed, collaborative data collection and analysis, enabling students
to interpret data and observations as a field experiment unfolds. Through
identifying and testing a robust platform for field investigations, the GeoPad
project and its results are having impacts beyond the geosciences into other
field- or map based disciplines.
