This project will develop materials that are used with existing CAD software,
developed by Microcompatibles under an NSF SBIR grant. These materials will be
used in technology classes and, later, in math classes. The software creates a
block on the screen which, through the use of easy to learn commands, can be cut
and drilled to make a part. The student sees the part being cut on the screen
and can zoom in and measure different areas of the part. Once the instructions
for cutting have been completed, they can be sent by network or modum to a shop
in which the part is actually made and sent to the student. This will help
students learn 3-dimensional visualization and integrate technology and math
curriculum.
