This research is concerned with the development of numerical methods for
singular integral equations. A computer-aided approach to a real variable theory
is suggested for solving integral equations with strongly singular kernels and
nonlinear discontinuous terms. New algorithms and adaptation of existing
algorithms for more accurate and reliable computation are proposed. It is
expected that this research will contribute significantly to the resolution of
outstanding problems in the linear theory and will provide insight for attacking
nonlinear and multi-dimensional problems.
