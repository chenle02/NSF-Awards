The Department of Statistics at the University of Pennsylvania will purchase
three Hewlett Packard 9000/735 workstations which will be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. Each will be configured with
the necessary hardware and software to provide a distributed cost- effective
floating-point computing system. This system will be used for the following four
research projects: (1) Hidden Markov Models, Symbolic Computation and Stochastic
Calculus, and Combinatorial Optimization; (2) Surveys, Observational Studies,
and Matching; (3) Computational Problems in Statistical Finance; and (4) Time
Series Analysis.
