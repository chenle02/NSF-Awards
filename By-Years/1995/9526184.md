9526184 Sillman Recent measurements of tropospheric trace species were performed
as part of the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE) at remote marine
locations along the North Atlantic coast. These species include ozone; which
impacts human health, agricultural crops and ecosyqtems; hydroxyl radical, which
controls tropospheric lifetimes of a wide range of species, including methane
and halogenated hydrocarbons; and nitrogen oxides. These measurements provide
important information about the chemistry of polluted continental air masses
exported to the Atlantic Ocean. Preliminary results suggest that significant
removal of reactive nitrogen occurs as continental air travels over the ocean,
possibly associated with fog events. This project will investigate the export of
chemically reactive species using a combined continental- and urban/regional-
scale model developed by the PI. The urban/regional-scale model represents the
photochemical evolution of urban plumes transported over water and includes the
impact of vertically stratified circulation over water. The model chemistry will
be enhanced to include aqueous reactions, and representation of fog events. This
project could identify conditions that lead to the removal of nitric acid and
PAN and quantify removal rates for these reactive nitrogen-containing species.
Comparison of the model results with the NARE measurement data will be performed
to assess and refine the model's ability to simulate chemical processing and
transport of polluted continental air masses as they travel over the Atlantic
Ocean.
