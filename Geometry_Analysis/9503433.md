9503433 Li The proposed conference is in the area of geometric analysis. A wide
spectrum of topics in geometric analysis is covered: gauge theories, Riemannian
geometry, symplectic geometry, evolution equations and curvature flows are some
of the topics covered in the past by this series of conferences. This annual
series of conferences has been supported by the National Science Foundation
since 1991, and it is the only one of its kind serving the west coast. The
organizers expect about 60-70 participants; a large fraction of the funds is to
provide travel support for graduate students.
