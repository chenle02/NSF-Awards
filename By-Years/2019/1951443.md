The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
new platform for the cryopreservation of cellular therapies. This technology
will allow for improved preservation of cells through the development of cell-
type specific cryoprotective solutions and protocols that deliver high survival
and function of cells after freezing and thawing. The cell therapy industry is a
rapidly growing market that is expected to reach $8.21 billion by 2025. The
proposed project will impact the cell therapy industry by improving quality of
cells after freezing and thawing, extending the shelf life of these cells from
hours or days to months or years, and alleviating processing bottlenecks
associated with current preservation methods. This technology can be adapted for
a variety of cell types, which may be administered to patients as cell
therapies, used for research applications, or stored in biobanks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Teams project builds upon prior research in
the development of cryoprotective solutions and protocols for a variety of cell
types. The technology utilizes algorithm-driven optimization to create novel,
nontoxic cryoprotective solutions inspired by how organisms survive freezing in
nature. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated with a cryoprotective solution
and protocol optimized for the preservation of mesenchymal stem cells, which is
currently undergoing beta testing at 8 sites. Additional technologies for other
cell types are in progress. Development of this technology for specific markets
requires a thorough understanding of customer needs. This I-Corps team project
is aimed at identifying customer needs through customer discovery interviews,
which will inform the development of new products in our pipeline to meet these
specific needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
