High-speed processing technology, parallel algorithms and architectures, and
VLSI implementation of systolic arrays have made possible many new applications
of real-time digital signal processing. The investigators are working in this
algorithms and architectures area as applied to sensor array beamforming,
adaptive arrays, and time-varying tracking. Additionally, they are looking at
the theoretical problem of decomposing dynamical systems or processors into
"digital processor primitives" for effective real-time processing.
