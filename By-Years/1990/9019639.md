Quantitative understanding of the link between microbial loop organisms and
suspension-feeding macrozooplankton is one of the central issues in zooplankton
ecology today. This research project will utilize a newly developed
immunochemical probe to ciliate protozoa to investigate this link in laboratory
and field studies. The probe overcomes the difficulties with conventional
methodologies. It permits predation on microzooplankton to be studied without
artifacts of collection, concentration, incubation, or preservation. The
following hypotheses will be tested: 1. H0: A cross-shore gradient exists in the
ciliate link to suspension-feeding copepods, from an inshore upwelling domain to
an offshore, stably stratified domain. 2. H0: Temporal variations occur in the
ciliate link to suspension-feeding copepods, with increased significance during
relaxation of upwelling events. 3. H0: Interspecific differences exist in the
importance of ciliates to co-occurring species of suspension-feeding copepods.
The study will contrast 3 major suspension-feeding copepods in the California
Current System: an epipelagic species (Calanus pacificus californicus), a
mesopelagic species (Eucalanus californicus), and a strong vertical migrant
(Metridia pacifica). Laboratory experiments will develop additional antisera and
characterize predation rates on different ciliate taxa. Field research will be
conducted in conjunction with the CalCOFI program. These cruises will address
cross-shore and temporal variations in the ciliate link to suspension-feeding
copepods, utilizing immunochemical dot blots, gut fluorescenec, and Iatroscan
lipid analyses. Additional cruises will address diel and vertical variations, to
examine any interspcific differences in the significance of this linkage to
coexisting species of suspension-feeding zooplankton.
