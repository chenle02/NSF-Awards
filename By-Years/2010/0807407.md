Advancing Careers of Excellence (ACE), based on Miami Dade College's prior
successful NSF CSEMS/S-STEM scholarship initiatives, is identifying and
recruiting 27 academically promising, low-income students and providing them
with scholarships, a full range of customized student services, and special
enrichment and motivational activities. ACE enables low-income, minority, and/or
female students, who meet established academic criteria, to obtain Associate in
Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degrees in biological, physical, or
mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, geosciences,
engineering, and technology areas associated with them. These students are then
eligible to transfer to a university or enter the workforce directly.

Intellectual Merit: This collaboration of seven Miami Dade College (MDC)
campuses brings together a diverse and experienced group of educators, students,
and business partners, including local science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) firms. By capitalizing on MDC's successful experiences with
mentoring and outreach, this program continues to broaden participation of
underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Student support services include: (a) mentoring by faculty from STEM
disciplines; (b) Web portal for students to communicate with each other, their
mentors, and project personnel; (c) academic and career planning for scholarship
recipients; (d) opportunities for students to interact with STEM professionals
on and off campus; and (e) internships for scholarship recipients

Broader Impact: Project ACE helps to alleviate the critical shortage of
scientists and engineers in the Florida Department of Labor targeted occupations
for Miami-Dade County. Since MDC awards the most associate degrees of any
college or university in the country to both Hispanics and African Americans,
and has a student body that is over 50% low-income, the project provides
opportunities for under-represented and economically disadvantaged students.
Participants make an economic contribution to the community and serve as role
models for other students.
