This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
Program. The purpose of this research is to analyze the substitutability of
public and private spending in the United States. This is a very important issue
because the degree of substitutability has major implications for macroeconomic
policy. If consumers view public outlays as close substitutes for their own
personal expenditures, then increases in government spending could result in
commensurate decreases in private spending, nullifying the expansionary impact
of the fiscal policy. The project will examine this issue at the disaggregated
level. Statistical analyses looking for significant correlations between the
different components of government and consumer expenditures will be undertaken.
This will help to determine what underlies the aggregate relationship between
public and private spending. The plausibility of the correlations at the
disaggregated level should help determine whether any relationship that exists
at the aggregate level is reasonable or is the result of spurious correlation.
