IBN-9603542 Baas Neurons are the principal cells that make up the nervous
system. They consist of a rounded cell body and two types of elongate
extensions. One type of extension is called an axon while the other type is
called a dendrite. Axons are specialized to transmit information, while
dendrites are specialized to receive information. In order for the neuron to
extend axons and dendrites, it must elaborate within them complex arrays of
cytoskeletal elements. These cytoskeletal elements provide architectural support
for axons and dendrites, and also act as railways for the transport of
substances from the cell body down their lengths. One of the most important of
the cytoskeletal elements is the microtubule. The microtubule is an
intrinsically polar structure, and as a result of this polarity, the microtubule
can direct the types of substances that are transported into axons and
dendrites. Fundamental to the differentiation of axons and dendrites is the
establishment of very different microtubule arrays in each type of process.
Axonal and dendritic microtubules differ in many respects, including how they
are organized relative to their polarity. The axonal microtubule array has been
extensively studied, but the dendritic microtubule array has received far less
attention. The overall goal of this grant application is to elucidate the
cellular and molecular means by which the dendritic microtubule array is
established, and how it becomes different from the axonal microtubule array. The
proposed experiments involve direct observations within living neurons as well
as high resolution studies using the electron microscope.
