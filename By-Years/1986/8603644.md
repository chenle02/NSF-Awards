The PI's propose to use improved relativistic electromagnetic particle codes as
well as existing codes developed under their previous NSF grant (ECS-8219105) to
address crucial issues concerning the generation of coherent radiation from
relativistic electron beams. The simulation studies will be carried out in the
microwave range and will include the free-electron laser, electron cyclotron
maser, and Cherenkov maser. The research will investigate: the effects of ac and
dc space charge fields on the gain, resonant condition and nonlinear efficiency
of various high current free electron devices; the transverse mode competition
in various free electron devices; the effectiveness of using a background plasma
for beam dc space charge and current neutralization and the feasibility of using
the interaction between relativistic electron beams and plasma filled waveguides
to build coherent radiation sources; and the efficiency of a Cherenkov maser in
a planar dielectric waveguide and a high-harmonic gyrotron using axis-encircling
large electron orbits.
