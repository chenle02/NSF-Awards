9631511 Gilly Research on the giant axon system of the squid during the past 50
years has provided the foundation for our understanding of communication within
and between neurons - nerve impulse conduction and synaptic transmission. The
basic mechanisms governing these processes are shared by all organisms with
nervous systems, from jellyfish to humans. Much remains to be learned about the
dynamic interactions that occur between individual nerve and muscle cells and
how these interactions change during the acquisition of new behaviors.
Background work indicates that giant and non- giant motor systems in squid can
act independently to achieve a large range of jet velocities or, in close
concert, to achieve super-charged jetting. Experiments funded by this grant are
designed to examine the interactions between these two motor systems during
escape behavior and to describe changes in these interactions that occur shortly
after hatching. Preliminary work has shown that these developmental changes are
strongly linked to the experience-dependent acquisition of prey capture
behavior. It is expected that this work will provide new insights into how
activity of specific motor nerve cells is coordinated by the brain to produce
complex behavioral outputs and how development of this motor coordination is
influenced by experiences early in life.
