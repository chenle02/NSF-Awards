Antonovics 9520754 The majority of plant species have both male and female
flowers. However, some species have male and female flowers on different plants.
Plant ecologists and geneticists are keenly interested in the forces that
determine the transitions between these two types of breeding systems. The
proposed research will study how this transition is being manifested in an
herbaceous plant, Astilbe biternata, which has an intermediate breeding system.
Understanding this transition will increase knowledge of how genes can be
transmitted in plants and will help to plan long-term conservation strategies
for dioecious species.
