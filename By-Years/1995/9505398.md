abstract 9505398 Early This project involves a demographic anthropologist at
Florida Atlantic University in a study of the population dynamics of a small
group of Venezuelan Indians, the Yanomami. The project will code and analyze a
unique data set of over 20 small Indian communities covering periods of 20-50
years. The researchers will develop demographic profiles for each community for
the duration of its existence, estimating rates of fertility, mortality,
migration. The researchers will develop a population profile of this group as it
developed from first contact with non-Indian societies through settlement at
religious missions. The data will be immensely valuable to demographic
researcher to explore such questions as the relation between imbalanced sex
ratios due to precontact warfare, small group size random variation, disease,
female infanticide, and polygyny, and the overall fertility structure of the
population. This research is important because it will provide a valuable data
resource for studies of small-group population dynamics. Such studies can
provide insight into the history of the human population in general.
