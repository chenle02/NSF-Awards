9421770 Short This is a special starter grant for a NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellow in Plant Biology. The starter grant is designed to help establish an
independent research career for the recipients of the NSF research fellowship in
plant biology. Dr. Short has conducted research on the molecular genetics of
phytochrome during the tenure of his NSF fellowship. Dr. Short is now an
assistant professor at Queens College and proposes to initiate an investigation
on the role of phytochrome in the red-light enhancement of phototropism in
Arabidopsis thaliana with the starter grant. The long term goal of the research
is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of photomorphogenesis in plants.
