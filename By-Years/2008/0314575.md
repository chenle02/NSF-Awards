Feng, Milner, Minchella The interactions between parasitic trematodes and their
invertebrate and vertebrate hosts are complex. Models of these interacting
systems are similarly complex in order to capture biologically relevant features
of the systems. Advances for many questions in this area face difficulties in
part because of the large number of parameters involved in the models and
because of the limited data available. The investigators combine the theoretical
and empirical experience of a parasitologist and the modeling and theoretical
expertise of mathematicians to develop and investigate these models. The work of
this project is threefold: first, new models are proposed for host-parasite
interactions, with more complex models motivated by biological considerations
and newly available data; second, a study of some mathematical properties of
each model is carried out and their biological and ecological implications
assessed, such as parasite population control or potential species extinction;
third, validation of the models through comparison of model results with field
data follows. The goal of the project is to develop a theoretical framework for
the study of questions associated with host-parasite interactions. A particular
host-parasite system is used, human-schistosome-snail (macroparasitic disease),
to highlight the generality of our approach. Specific objectives are to develop
mathematical models to understand the role of various components of host-
parasite interactions in the disease transmission dynamics, to determine which
biological details are critical components in the model, to construct and
analyze appropriate models in which the parameters are readily related to field
data, and to provide useful information for field workers and policy makers in
public health. The project significantly advances our knowledge and
understanding of the dynamics of host-parasite systems that include intermediate
hosts, by providing usable models to study natural systems, by analyzing their
sensitivity to the parameters affecting the dynamics, and by allowing
structuring of the complexities of the systems into hierarchies. Just as
important is the possibility to help address some of the theoretical issues in
the control of schistosomiasis via chemotherapy.
