9317044 Hoisch Theoretical and physical models as well as field studies suggest
that complex structural histories involving alternating contraction and
extension can develop within the interior of contractional orogenic belts,
essentially moderating crustal thickness during the growth of the orogenic belt.
This project will attempt to test these models by use of mid-crustal exposure of
the hinterland of Sevier Orogen in the Raft River and Grouse Creek Mountains of
northwestern Utah. The work will involve structural mapping, Metamorphic
thermobarometry, P-T-t path modeling, and several geochronologic techniques.
This study will address several components of the deformation history of the
area and test several existing models for middle crustal evolution during
Mesozoic regional contraction and post-orogenic extension. It will also help
link the possible coeval deformations between the hinterland and the foreland
thrust belt. ***
