This grant supports the UCLA ion microprobe as a national facility for research
in the earth and planetary sciences by enabling access to qualified external
investigators and supporting continued development of analytical methods that
take advantage of the unique strengths of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
for in situ isotopic analyses. Our vision is that costly geochemical tools, such
as the CAMECA ims 1270 ion microprobe, should be a community resource supported
in centers with the scientific and technical expertise needed to fully exploit
their potential. Prior NSF support has led to numerous significant discoveries
in fields ranging from tectonics and igneous processes to sedimentology,
paleoclimatology and paleobiology, Earth?s earliest history and the origin and
early evolution of the Solar System. In the current grant period, our goal is to
ensure that the nation?s geochemists, cosmochemists, and geochronologists
continue to have access to our world-leading facilities at a level commensurate
with our historic productivity, provide UCLA scientists the resources to
continue to develop and refine existing and new SIMS methods for research in
geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and geochronology, and undertake instrument
modifications that lead to improvements in data acquisition and expanded
capabilities that facilitate new types of investigations. During this funding
cycle, the facility will commission a new scanning electron microscope with
enhanced capabilities for cathodoluminescence imaging. Research training will
continue to be a high priority and UCLA scientists will engage in synergistic
activities both locally and nationally, including our longstanding annual
graduate SIMS Workshop.
