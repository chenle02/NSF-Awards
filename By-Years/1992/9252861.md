South Carolina State College proposes to provide talented, undergraduate,
ethnic minority and female students with a program of academic enriched and
comprehensive research activities. These activities will be integrated in a
manner to significantly enhance the participating students chance of remaining
in the Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) pipeline and pursuing careers
associated with the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science
and Mathematics. Our RCMS Program will develop and implement the following
components: 1. A faculty Preceptor Seminar and Faculty Mentor Program to provide
students with structured group learning and skills development activities, and
early academic stimulation to pursue graduate study. 2. A Summer Research
Program that will provide intramural and extramural research experiences. 3. A
program of Special Seminars and Colloquia. 4. A Secondary School Outreach
Program in which selected science education students and college faculty will
provide instructional support and assistance for middle school/high school
classroom teachers. 5. Skills Enhancement Exercises that are designed for GRE
preparation will be presented in four phases during four years of student
participation in the RCMS program.
