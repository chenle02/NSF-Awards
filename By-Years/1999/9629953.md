This three-year program will investigate the nature of quasi-periodic (QP) radar
echoes that occur from sporadic E layers in the nighttime midlatitude
ionosphere. There is mounting evidence of the existence of a still-unidentified
source of unexpectedly strong energetics in the midlatitude ionosphere. It is
important the PI strive to identify and understand the physics of this
phenomenon, because it reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of
ionospheric plasma processes. Moreover, the PI will participate in a US-Japan
rocket program in which rockets and ground-based sensors will make in situ
measurements of plasma density, electric field, and neutral wind in the E
region.
