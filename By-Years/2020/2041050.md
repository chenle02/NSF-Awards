NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: MXenes are a large class of two-dimensional carbides
and nitrides that exhibit exceptional electronic, optical and charge storage
properties. They were discovered at Drexel University a decade ago. MXenes are
comprised of layers of metal atoms connected by carbon or nitrogen atoms and
having thickness of less than one nanometer. Their unique combination of
electronic conductivity and tunable optical properties, such as a wide range of
plasmonic colors, may be a game-changer in optics and electronics. More than 30
different MXene compositions have been synthesized; dozens more are predicted to
exist. However, in spite of total number of publications on MXenes approaching
3000, just a few solid solutions (structures with a random mix of metal atoms)
have been reported. Solid solution MXenes that are synthesized in this study
greatly expand the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials and offer an
opportunity for precise tuning of electronic and optical properties of MXenes.
These materials can find applications in the manufacturing of transparent
conductive electrodes for solar cells, smart windows, transparent heaters,
optical filters, etc. Courses covering synthesis and characterization of MXenes
are developed as a part of this project and offered online. Graduate and
undergraduate students participating in this project are offered research co-
operative education and internships at the National Nanofabrication Facility in
South Korea to learn nanofabrication and perform fabrication and testing of
MXene-based optical devices, such as transparent light emission diodes and
electrically tunable optical filters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The primary goal of this work is to establish direct experimental relationships
between chemical compositions of solid solution MXene and their resulting
properties. Solid solution MXene research is expanded into diverse structures
and chemistries in order to study and generalize these relationships, and thus
to enable specific optical and plasmonic properties to be rationally chosen
based on the desired application. This project includes (i) synthesis of
quaternary MAX phase precursors with the desired compositions; (ii) finding the
appropriate conditions for topochemical conversion of the MAX precursors into
MXenes, (iii) determining the conductivity and optical properties of MXenes, and
(iv) using an array of advanced characterization techniques to determine the
composition and structure of solid-solution MXenes and correlate them with the
measured properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
