This project by Cornell University will launch a new I-Corps Node centered in
Upstate New York. I-Corps NY Node brings together Cornell University as the lead
institution, the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology
(RIT) as partner institutions. This project will increase the velocity, volume,
and success rate of technology startup teams forming in the colleges and
universities in the Northeast, including Upstate NY. This new Node will adopt
current best-practices in the Node network to grow a network of business mentors
for academic inventors, promote lean launchpad principles in research, and
expand entrepreneurship education around the region. The Node evaluation team
will use iterative evaluation and redesign efforts to ensure the achievement of
economic development, education, and workforce development outcomes. The
researchers, instructors, mentors, and institutions in this Node will bring new
ideas and tools to strengthen the National Innovation
Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will foster the inclusion of I-Corps
participants, particularly underrepresented minorities, women, and the disabled
in multiple regional I-Corps programs each year. In partnership with RIT's
National Technical Institute for the Deaf, the Nation's largest engineering
program for the deaf and hard of hearing, the Node will encourage nationwide
participation from this underrepresented group. Programs will conclude with
showcase events to publicize the teams and their success in regional innovation.
This project will leverage a high concentration of academic anchor institutions
to improve a moribund regional economy. Upstate NY academic institutions spend
over $2.3bn on R&amp;D, an amount that ranks eighth nationwide in state research
spending. I-Corps represents an investment in growing a new innovation economy
in a part of the country with tremendous assets to build upon and expand.
