Survival analysis is a highly active area of research with applications
spanning the physical, engineering, biological, and social sciences. Researchers
in survival techniques, in addition to statisticians and biostatisticians,
include epidemiologists, reliability engineers, demographers and economists, who
call this area duration analysis. This grant will partially support an
international workshop on Survival Analysis and Related Topics, to be held in
June, 1991 at the Ohio State University. Two distinct groups are doing research
in the area of Survival Analysis. The reliability and life testing group focuses
on survival analysis for physical systems, primarily from a parametric
viewpoint. The biostatistical group studies techniques for use in the biomedical
sciences, and uses nonparametric or semiparametric methods. The major goal of
this workshop is to provide a forum for an exchange of ideas between these
groups, using the Bayesian approach, in order to develop an environment for
research leading to a synthesis of various ideas.
