This project introduces a new measurement and analysis methodology that can be
used to characterize end-end performance measures (such as loss and delay along
a path) as well as internal network characteristics (such as loss experienced
along distant path segments) from measurements taken at a single point within
the network. The proposed "measurement-in-the-middle" approach uses time-
stamped, packet-level traces gathered at this single measurement point together
with probabilistic state-based sender/receiver models and statistical
inferencing techniques to infer end-end performance measures. These metrics
include the loss and delay along paths between a source, destination, and
measurement point, and along portions of these paths as well. The research
performed in this project will develop and analyze (through modeling,
simulation, and empirical study) the theoretical foundations and practical
considerations needed for this new approach towards network performance
measurement and analysis. The ability to infer end-to-end and path-portion
performance from a single point within the network has many advantages. Most
importantly, because measurements are taken "in-the-middle," the end-end
behavior of a large and diverse mix of source/destination pairs can be measured,
without having to instrument individual senders and receivers. This research
will develop a fundamentally new approach to network measurement methodology
that will allow network operations, engineering and research users to measure a
larger, and more diverse, mix of network traffic than has been possible in the
past. In addition to more fully characterizing network traffic, a richer set of
measurements and a better understanding of network traffic can also play an
important role in improved network management, network modeling, and
network/protocol design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
