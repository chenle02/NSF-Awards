The goal of this research is to determine the effects of certain substrate
surface microgeometries on cell growth. The eventual application of this work
will be in the design of orthopedic implants with a range of surface geometries
which will facilitate the desired cellular response on the various regions of
the device. The design of three types of surfaces will be investigated; namely,
1) one that promotes bone growth and inhibits soft tissue growth, 2) one that
allows soft tissue growth but not bone growth, and 3) one that acts as a barrier
to fibrous tissue growth. The cellular response to sputter coated Ti surfaces
which have various dimensions of square wave microgeometries will be compared to
a flat surface. If the square wave shape does not produce the desired cellular
responses, a cusp shaped microgeometry will be evaluated. Two cellular lines
will be tested - rat tendon fibroblasts and rat bone marrow cells. Phase II of
the research will concentrate on the design and in vivo testing of orthopedic
implants with the appropriate microgeometries strategically placed on the
implant to obtain the desired cellular responses.
