9315312 Winn Work is underway on a time-series study of the inorganic carbon
cycle in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The work is part of the US JGOFS
Time-series study at Hawaii (Hawaii Ocean Time-series, HOT). Measurements are
being made of all four carbon system parameters including dissolved inorganic
carbon, total alkalinity, pH, and pCO2. Samples are collected approximately
monthly on the HOT cruises to Station ALOHA. Ongoing intercalibration work is
continuing with other laboratories to insure the accuracy of the data. The time
series record of the carbon system is to be used to assess the direction and
magnitude of air-sea carbon system parameters within the main thermocline. The
ultimate goal is to improve our ability to predict the oceanic response to the
oceanic role in, future climate change.
