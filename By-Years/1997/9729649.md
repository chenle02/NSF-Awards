9729649 PHILLIS Dr. Phillis's research focuses on the role of the "motor
protein" dynein in neuronal development and the establishment of the mature
anatomy of neuronal axons. Although dynein is well known to be involved in the
movement of intracellular components along microtubules, Dr. Phillis's analysis
of the gene for cytoplasmic dynein light chain, Cdlc1, in the fruitfly
Drosophila has suggested a role for this molecule in shaping the growing tips of
axons. This research encompasses three projects, each designed to investigate
specific aspects of the cytoplasmic dynein light chain with respect to axon
anatomy. The first project involves the analysis of when Cdlc1 mutations affect
axon projections during development. Using a set of genetic markers, Dr. Phillis
and his colleagues will label specific sensory neurons and their axons as they
undergo pathfinding in the central nervous system during development. They will
then characterize the development of these axons in Cdlc1 mutants, and compare
them with observations of wild type development. This analysis will help
determine the timing of onset of axon defects caused by Cdlc1 mutations. In
addition, Dr. Phillis's group will create a mutant form of Cdlc1 that can be
activated by temperature shifts. With this inducible gene, it will be possible
to determine the specific time in development when Cdlc1 function is required
for the establishment of proper neuronal anatomy. In a second project, Dr.
Phillis's group will characterize the effects of Cdlc1 mutations on neurons
grown in primary cell culture, using a microtubule labeling system that allows
the analysis of microtubule dynamics in live cells. These experiments will
resolve the effects that Cdlc1 mutations have on the growth dynamics of
individual neurons, and on the dynamic changes in cytoskeletal architecture that
underlie the growth of axon projections. Finally, Dr. Phillis's group will
perform a genetic screen for mutations that either enh ance or suppress the
effects of Cdlc1 mutations on axonal growth. Subsequent genetic and molecular
characterization of genes identified in this analysis will provide a detailed
understanding of a series of genes that function with Cdlc1 in neural
development.
