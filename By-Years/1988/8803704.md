This project will focus largely on problems of multiple instance network flow
computations. Many important, non-trivial combinatorial problems can be cast and
solved as a sequence of closely related network flow computations. Recent
results have led to improved efficiency in computing such sequences, and in turn
this has lead to faster solutions to important combinatorial problems. This
project will extend recent work, concentrating on general methods to specific
important combinatorial problems. In particular, two general classes of sequence
will be assumed: parametric network flow problems, where the sequence is
generated by changing the capacities of certain edges, and multiple source-sink
problems, where the sequence are generated by changing the choices of source and
sink nodes.
