9312628 Draayer The aim of the program in theoretical nuclear physics at
Louisiana State University, which is under the direction of Professor J.P.
Draayer and currently involves five graduate students (four in physics and one
in computer science) and one postdoctoral research associate, is to give a
simple but accurate description of the properties of heavy nuclei, like those in
the rare earth (e.g., erbium) and actinide (e.g., uranium) regions which are
made up of a large number of protons plus neutrons (greater than 150). These
species are heavy enough to display generic features shared with neighboring
elements and yet show unique individual characteristics that we can use to learn
about how protons and neutrons interact among themselves and with each other
inside the nuclear medium. We are seeking to answer in an intellectually honest
way questions such as, "Why do rotational and vibrational modes dominate the
structure of heavy nuclei?" The research involves training of graduate students
in critical thinking skills and the use of state-of-the-art computing
facilities, such as supercomputers (available at centers across the country) and
parallel machines (available through special "8g" state funding) that will help
define the next generation of megacomputers. 7' 7 7l 7 7 7` 7 7 7E 74 7 7 7 71
