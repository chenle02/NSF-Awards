This is a project to complete a geochronology and geochemical study of the
well-sampled Reunion hot spot track. PI will do 40Ar--39Ar geochronology and
geochemical work on five sites along the track: The Deccan basalts
(geochronology only), basalts from deep industry wells on Mascerene Plateau,
dredged vocanics from the Rodrigues Ridge, and late-stage basaltic volcanism
form Mauritius. These data will be coupled with that obtained from four sites
from ODP leg 115. Precise dating of Deccans will determine correlation of these
with K-T extinction and the other work will address a number of questions
relating to the evolution of the hot spot through time. %%% Hot spot volcanism
is a process of fundamental importance in the earth and can shed light on basic
earth processes such as the motion of lithospheric plates through time, relative
to the mantle. The geochemical studies might provide information on documented
record of hot spot volcanism going back to 65 million years before present and
is the best sampled hot spot track on the earth, so the data will be especially
useful.
