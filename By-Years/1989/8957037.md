In recent years plant scientists have been looking at mechanisms by which
atmospheric CO2 is taken up and assimilated within the plants. Dr. Moroney has
made an important contribution to this area by his finding that CO2 is actively
transported across the plasma membrane of the green algae, Chlamydomonas, when
it is adapted to low CO2. Moreover, he has identified polypeptides which are
induced under these conditions. He now plans to use mutant strains to pursue
these studies to determine the localization and function of these systems, and
hopefully identify the genes which are activated under these conditions. Dr.
Moroney has made important contributions to plant biosciences including
bioenergetics in chloroplast thylakoids, and ATP biosynthesis in chloroplasts.
His biochemical and molecular investigations of the C accumulating mechanisms
will be important in understanding how organisms can adapt under different
environmental conditions.
