The periodic table of chemical elements is an array that is confusing to the
uninformed and profoundly simplifying and full of crucial information to the
informed. It represents some of the most basic information for the construction
of what people see, feel and breathe. Due to the table's complex appearance and
the way it is described; many individuals shun its informative base. This
proposal is a planning grant application that intends to develop a multi-media
presentation, which includes TV, web site, a teachers DVD, and an outreach plan,
to bridge this knowledge gap in a user freindly manner. It will make educating
minority children one of its priorities. The basic premise for their bridge is
that people will better grasp the aspects of the chemical elements if they
humanize the elements by discussing them as products of scientists and that
scientists are people. The success of this effort is critical. While chemistry
affects every aspect of human life, it is one of the least understood sciences.
If successful, this project may well pave the way for additional programming.
