This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the
research of Professor Patrick Mariano at the University of New Mexico. The theme
of the research will be single electron transfer (SET) photochemistry. Specific
goals will be to define the mechanisms of photoredox processes, to define the
nature and reactivity patterns of ion-radicals which are intermediates in SET
reactions, and to develop new SET-photochemical reactions. Specific areas of
investigation will be heterolytic fragmentation reactions of SET-derived cation-
radicals, synthetic applications of SET-photochemical and metal-catalyzed
oxidative cyclization reactions, and the photochemical generation and reactions
of azomethine ylides. Photochemical single electron transfer reactions provide
reactive radical and radical ion species which are of fundamental interest, as
well as key intermediates in a variety of technologically significant synthetic
applications.
