Few insect herbivores utilize Magnolia virginiana (sweetbay) as a hostplant,
one being the sweetbay silkmoth, Callosamia securifera (Saturniidae). However,
closely related species suffer 100% mortality on this plant. Preliminary
phytochemical work indicates that mortality is due to at least two insecticidal
compounds, magnolol and biphenyl ether. This study will characterize
physiological/biochemical adaptations of C. securifera to Magnolia by comparing
its detoxification mechanisms with those of two congeners unable to tolerate
this host's chemicals. In vitro and in vivo experiments will be used to identify
enzymatic detoxification systems. In addition, because the three Callosamia
species appear to have recently diverged and have some overlap in host use,
possible tradeoffs in digestive efficiency and detoxification enzyme activity
that may have favored hostplant specialization in the genus will be tested.
Specifically, predictions that 1) specialists have higher digestive efficiency
than generalists and 2) generalists have higher levels or 3) higher inducibility
of broad substrate-specificity detoxification activity than specialists will be
tested. With the detailed characterization of specific detoxification mechanisms
used by C. securifera to cope with toxins in its host, it may be possible to
formulate better hypotheses concerning biochemical tradeoffs associated with
host specialization.
