. LAY ABSTRACT

Understanding how past experience shapes future behavior is one of the
fundamental challenges for modern animal behavior and neurobiology. Meeting this
challenge will require characterization of physiological changes triggered by
experiences known to influence specific behaviors, such as aggression during
male-male encounters. Two factors have been shown to critically influence the
intensity of aggression expressed in an encounter: 1) the outcomes of previous
encounters, whether won or lost, and 2) the location of the encounter, whether
familiar or unfamiliar. It is the goal of the proposed work to examine the
physiological components that contribute to the effect winning has on future
encounters (winner effect), as well as those components that contribute to
aggression associated with familiarity with the encounter location.
Specifically, the function of observed changes in testosterone after competitive
interactions will be evaluated. In addition, neurochemical changes that occur in
response to transient changes in testosterone will be documented. To begin
examining the role of site familiarity in the intensity of aggression,
comparisons will be made between resident-intruder aggression (site-specific
aggression) and neutral aggression (aggression in a neutral arena). It is
predicted that the neurochemical vasopressin will be more closely associated
with resident-intruder aggression than neutral aggression. The monogamous,
highly parental Peromyscus californicus (California mouse), and the promiscuous,
less parental P. leucopus (white-footed mouse) will be developed as model
systems for this analysis of interactions between experience and intensity of
aggression. Information obtained in these studies may provide insight into some
of the physiological mechanisms underlying plasticity in the intensity of
aggression in mammals.
