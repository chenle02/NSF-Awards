Harbater This award supports the work of David Harbater on Galois covers of
algebraic curves. Prof. Harbater's work involves number theory and geometry. He
intends to use his recently established result, Abhyankar's conjecture, to use
patching techniques to construct Galois Covers of curves. This is research
primarily in the field of algebraic geometry. This field has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter century as techniques from number theory and
algebra have found geometric application. Algebraic geometry is the study of
curves that can be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Galois covers of curves are particular examples that have strong
symmetries. The techniques of algebraic geometry now find application in such
diverse fields as physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
