Algebras of chiral differential operators, a concept around which this project
is centered, are in this class and were introduced by Schechtman, Vaintrob, and
the principal investigator some 10 years ago. Here is the list of the main
topics addressed in this project: 1. Gerbes of asymptotic chiral differential
operators on smooth algebraic varieties. 2. Asymptotic chiral differential
operators and localization of affine W-algebras. W-algebras and singularity
theory. 3. Asymptotic chiral differential operators on singular affine algebraic
varieties. Semi-infinite induction functor and string
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project belongs in the interface of
mathematics, especially its algebro-geometric part, and modern quantum field
theory. Classical mechanics is adequately described by such algebraic structures
as Poisson algebras, quantization is usually satisfactorily reflected in
geometric representation theory. The passage to fields drastically changes the
landscape and, in particular, leads to such modern and still poorly understood
concepts as a vertex Poisson algebra and a vertex algebra.
