This project will complete the first (two year) phase of establishing a hands-on
telecommunications laboratory, supporting undergraduate instruction in
Information Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture and Networking
Software. It is a joint interdisciplinary project including Computer Information
Systems (CIS) in the School of Business and Computer Science (CS) in the School
of Science. Data communications laboratory courses from both disciplines are
presently being offered using the equipment on hand. The current courses are
designed to teach the basics of data communications, including transmission
media, LAN configurations, operation, management and diagnosis. However, the
current laboratory does not include network analysis nor fiber optic equipment.
These limitations severely restrict the scope of the possible experiences. The
equipment to be purchased under this project will allow students to carry out a
full complement of experiments. The goal is to provide students with direct,
hands-on experience in designing, assembling, testing, modifying and diagnosing
telecommunications networks. Over a five year period it is planned to expand
from data communications to a laboratory which will support experiments in the
high speed transmission and switching of multiform information, including data,
images, voice and video.
