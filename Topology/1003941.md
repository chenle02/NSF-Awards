In spite of a significant progress on the topology of the automorphism group of
a free group, relatively little is known about the large scale geometry of this
group. A part of the proposal is a program to remedy the discrepancy with
mapping class groups, where the geometry is very well understood, thanks to the
recent work of Masur, Minsky and others. The first step in this program is
hyperbolicity of the free factor complex. Other questions proposed are finite
presentability of Torelli groups, finiteness properties of arithmetic groups
over function fields and quasi-isometric rigidity of right-angled Artin groups.

The interplay between algebra and geometry is one of the classical themes in
mathematics. For example, symmetries of Platonic solids form fundamental
examples of groups. In geometric group theory the situation is reversed: one
starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object (for example, another
group) and constructs a geometric object with the same symmetries. The study of
the geometry of this object then leads to a greater understanding of the
algebraic object one started with. The proposal contains several instances of
this approach. Culler-Vogtmann's Outer space is a geometric object whose
symmetries are the same as those of a free group (of finite rank). Recent
results reveal that this space has negative curvature in some directions, much
like the surface of a saddle. Understanding this phenomenon better would lead to
a greater understanding of the symmetry group of the free group.
