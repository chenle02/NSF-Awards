The Keck Consortium in Geology proposes to recruit nine minority students each
year for inclusion in two of the Consortium's undergraduate field research
projects during 1991-92 and 1992-93. The students will have completed their
sophomore college year and will be supported on their home campus by an on-
campus faculty sponsor. The students will spend three to four weeks in the field
and one to two weeks writing and illustrating a final report covering their
field research project. The results of their effort will be reported in poster
session format at the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology. One research
project for 1991-92 will be located in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario and will
deal with the Precambrian geology along a terrane boundary. The second project
will be in Beloit, Wisconsin and covers the hydrology of the Turtle Creek
drainage basin. The projects for 1991-93 will be located in Gaspe, Quebec and
San Salvador Island, Bahamas and will deal with sedimentary processes in clastic
and carbonate near-shore environments.
