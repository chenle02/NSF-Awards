The objective of this grant is to elucidate the mechanisms of action of certain
glycosidase enzymes. It has been found that a fungal alpha-glucosidase can
convert beta-D-glucosyl fluoride to alpha-D-glucose. The proposed research will
1) determine whether this unusual catalytic process occurs at the same site as
natural alpha-D-glucosies, 20 ascertain whether other glucoisdases react with
the wrong anomer and if so 3) examine their stereochemistries, rates and
mechanisms. In addition, the 3 dimensional structure of soybean beta- amylase
will be determined by X-ray crystallography. Enzymes catalyse almost all the
reaction that take place in a living organism. This research will enhance our
understanding of not only the mechanism of action of glucosidases but also the
basic principles which underlie enzyme catalysis at the molecular level.
