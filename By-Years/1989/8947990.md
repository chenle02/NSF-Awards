This award is the initial award under the Cooperative Agreement AST 8947990
with the Associated Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) for the
management, operation, and maintenance of the National Optical Astronomy
Observatories (NOAO). The research programs in FY 1990 will cover astronomical
subjects from the sun and the solar system through stars, galaxies, and quasars
to the origin and structure of the universe. The instrumentation programs will
include work on adaptive optics systems, infrared arrays, and the design and
development of multi- object spectrographs. Major initiative programs are the
development of a world wide network to study solar oscillations and techniques
for polishing and testing large light weight mirrors. The NOAO is comprised of
the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory (CTIO), and the National Solar Observatory (NSO). NSO includes the
solar facilities at Kitt Peak and the Sacramento Peak Observatory (SPO). In
addition there are central administrative, technical and computing support
groups. NOAO's mission is a three-fold one: (1) to provide state of the art
optical and infrared telescopes and associated instrumentation and the support
necessary for the conduct of research programs in astronomy, solar physics and
related fields (2) to perform forefront research programs by in house staff and
(3) to develop new and innovative astronomical instrumentations. The facilities
of NOAO are available to all qualified scientists on a competitive basis. Over
700 scientists make more than 1200 visits annually to utilize the observing and
data analysis facilities of the NOAO.
