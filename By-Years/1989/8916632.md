The objective of this project is to design, manufacture, and install an
earthquake strong ground motion simulator on the new 100 G-ton geotechnical
centrifuge in the Civil Engineering Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI). Because large earthquakes are rare events that occur
unexpectedly with respect to both time and geographic location, very little data
has been recorded on the resulting strong ground motions and the effects of
these motions on earth structures. The installation of the simulator on the new
geotechnical centrifuge at RPI will provide a capability to simulate such
earthquake- induced strong ground motions in the laboratory. While this does not
substitute for the much needed field data from large earthquakes, it
nevertheless does provide valuable information for use in earthquake hazard
mitigation. This installation will provide the largest such simulation
capability in the United States and complements the much smaller units available
at several major universities.
