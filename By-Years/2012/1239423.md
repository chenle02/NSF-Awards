Data-driven intelligence is an essential foundation for physical systems in
transportation safety and efficiency, area surveillance and security, as well as
environmental sustainability. This project develops new computer system
infrastructure and algorithms for self-sustainable data-driven systems in the
field. Research outcomes of the project include (a) a low-maintenance,
environmentally-friendly hardware platform with solar energy harvesting and
super capacitor-based energy storage, (b) virtualization software infrastructure
for low-power nodes to enable inter-operability among distributed field nodes
and from/to the data center, and (c) new image and data processing approaches
for resource-adaptive fidelity adjustment and function partitioning. The synergy
between the self-sustainable hardware, system software support, wireless
communications management, and application data processing manifests through
global coordination for quality-of-service, energy efficiency, and data
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In broader impacts, this project enables data-
driven intelligence in the field for important physical system domains.
Integration of the technologies involved is accomplished through real-world
system deployment and experimentation, including an intelligent campus traffic
and parking management system and collaborative work with industry
collaborators. The results of this project will further enhance the
technological competitiveness for US industries in key areas such as intelligent
transportation. The education component includes cross-disciplinary curriculum
enhancements and the development of a new instructional platform for realistic
experiments with cyber-physical systems. Within the scope of this project, the
PIs perform mentoring and outreach activities to recruit/retain women and
minorities in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
