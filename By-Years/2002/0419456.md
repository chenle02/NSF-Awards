This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project to develop a
variety of thermoset plastics incorporating biodegradable polymer components as
replacement for environmentally undesirable styrene reactants. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the area of
renewable resource based biodegradable polymers for broad industrial use.
