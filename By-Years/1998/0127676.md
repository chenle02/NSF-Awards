A critical first step in characterizing gene function is defining the expression
pattern of a gene. A novel methodology is being developed in plants to rapidly
determine the cell-type specific expression of thousands of transcripts in
concert. The technique involves separating plant cells by protoplasting
transgenic lines that express GFP in specific cell types, obtaining an enriched
population of GFP expressing cells using a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter
(FACS), and applying mRNA isolated from sorted cells to microarrays. The result
is an expression profile from a specific cell type. Extensive controls have been
performed and a first round of the entire protocol with a single transgenic line
has been completed. The results are extremely promising with microarray profiles
of specific genes in agreement with their independently confirmed expression
patterns in the Arabidopsis root. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) Further
test and develop the methodology. 2) Expand the number of sorted cell lines. 3)
Develop computational tools to analyze and disseminate the data. The risk
associated with this project is balanced by the enormous potential benefit to
the plant community.
