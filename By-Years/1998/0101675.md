&lt;br/&gt;This project is focussing on professional development of middle
school science, mathematics and technology teachers. These middle school
teachers are (a) receiving technology training (b) interning with Cleveland
State faculty on real world science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
projects, (c) attending follow-up content and pedagogy workshops, (d)
implementing Middle School ATE professional development materials with their
students, and (e) leading a year-long engineering challenge
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concurrent with professional development efforts
are curriculum development, the focus being to develop or adapt curriculum from
prior ATE projects for a middle school audience, and to prepare materials that
can be disseminated to institutions that prepare middle school teachers. The
project is a collaboration between the Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC) at
Cleveland State University, Cuyahoga Community College, and Lorain Community
College. Other partners include the Cleveland Municipal School District (CMSD),
and CAMP Inc, a non-profit organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
