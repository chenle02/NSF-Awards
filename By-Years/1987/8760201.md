A systematic study of a new family of high power switches is proposed. This
study is directed toward applying recently obtained results and knowledge to the
need for improved switches for lasers and other applications, and toward
improving the understanding of these new switches. The new switch is an
optically triggered thyratron, also referred to as a back of the cathode, light
triggered thyratron (BLT). Several versions are to be studied. Improved switches
are needed for excimer lasers in the medum power range and above, pulsed
electron beams, and various types of accelerators. This need is important
because a significant part of the performance limitation of these devices, and
hence the industrial applications, are caused by limitations imposed by the
types of switches that are available. Improved switches will lead to much more
useful devices for industrial applications. The BLT operates cold cathode, does
not arc, and has improved characteristics over existing thyratrons in the areas
that are most important for these applications, including considerably improved
current rate of rise, peak current and reverse current handling capability.
