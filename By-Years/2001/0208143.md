Determining the speeds of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is very important for
determining when a CME on the solar disk will impact the Earth. The head-on
speed of a CME is very difficult to measure directly and this project will
investigate the possibility of using measurements of the associated filaments to
determine the speed of the CME. Observations in the Helium I (HeI) emission at
1032 nm will be used for this purpose. The data will be obtained from the Mauna
Loa Solar Observatory. The HeI 1083 nm data will then be compared with data from
the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on the SOHO
satellite. In addition, the project will use magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
simulations of the propagation of CMEs to help refine the predicted Earth impact
times.
