This CAREER project investigates how humans and computers can work together to
answer questions. Humans and computers possess complementary skills: humans have
extensive commonsense understanding of the world and greater facility with
unconventional language, while computers can effortlessly memorize countless
facts and retrieve them in an instant. This proposal helps machines understand
who people, places, and characters are; how to communicate this information to
humans; and how to allow humans and computers to collaborate in question
answering using limited information. A key component of this proposal is
answering questions word-by-word: this forces both humans and computers to
answer questions using information as efficiently as possible. In addition to
embedding these skills in question answering tasks, this proposal has an
extensive outreach program to exhibit this technology in interactive question
answering competitions for high school and college
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is possible by a new
representations of entities in a medium-dimensional embedding that encodes
relationships between entities (e.g., the representation of "Goodluck Jonathan"
and "Nigeria" encodes that the former is the leader of the latter) to enable the
system to answer questions about Nigeria. We validate the effectiveness of these
representations both through traditional question answering evaluations and
through interactive experiments with human collaboration to ensure that we can
visualize these representations effectively. In addition to helping train
computers to answer questions, we use opponent modeling and reinforcement
learning to help train humans to better answer
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
