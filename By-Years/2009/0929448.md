This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will prototype a novel
photovoltaic (PV) material based on nanotechnology: photovoltaic fabric. The PV
fabric will be woven using threads that comprise of an array of p-type silicon
nanowires grown directly on the periphery of thin metallic thread. The nanowires
are covered with a continuous n-type silicon film forming a multitude of high
surface area diode junction structures about the periphery of the thread. Then,
the n-type layer is coated with a transparent conductor. A porous insulating
layer isolates the n-type and p-type electrodes. This innovative technology will
make it possible to construct flexible photovoltaic textiles that are light-
weight and portable. The Phase I program will focus on making functional PV
threads that demonstrate diode behavior and a photo-response. In parallel, a
surrogate material will be used to initiate the weaving and electrical
interconnect process that will be required to produce a PV textile. The full
project goal is to develop a novel textile based platform to harvest clean,
affordable, point-of-use solar power. The final research objective is to produce
functional swatches of PV fabric that demonstrate efficiencies of 30% with a
specific power greater than 300 W/kg.

The worldwide PV market is between $20 and $25 billion. The market is growing
at an annual rate of between 25% and 30%. It is expected to exceed $70 billion
worldwide in 2012. The photovoltaic fabric material technology is novel and
innovative, and if successfully engineered, could prove to be an extremely
disruptive technology. Solar power is an underused natural resource. Increased
awareness of the need for renewable, clean sources of energy are currently
driving the expansion of solar electrical power generation into the broader
energy markets. Portable PV materials enabled by nanotechnology would have a
multitude of applications: from the emergent field of "Smart Textiles" to
military uniforms and shelters to portable consumer electronics, the impact of a
textile capable of generating electricity from the sun that could be
incorporated into existing products and materials in a flexible, fabric platform
could be a tremendously valuable technology. Illuminex Corporation, the
Pennsylvania State University, and Philadelphia University are collaborating on
this project. At least two undergraduate and one graduate student will have paid
jobs performing cutting edge nanotechnology research. This technology will
compete with the traditional solar power market and open new emergent markets
for portable solar power applications.
