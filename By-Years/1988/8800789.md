The lubricant film in hydrodynamically lubricated bearings actsas a very
important damping element in many types of machinery. The behavior of
bearing/damper systems will be studied by bothanalytical and experimental
techniques. In the experimental work flow visualization will be used as one of
the techniques to determine temperature, pressure, and velocity fields for both
single andtwo- phase flow. Results from the two approaches will be closely
integrated to develop design data and diagnostic techniques for bearing/damper
applications.
