This research project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program has been
funded as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. The research will develop two
novel methods for attaching DNA and other biomolecules to substrates for their
subsequent examination by scanning probe microscopy. Successful implementation
of these attachment methods will allow the full power of scanning tunneling and
atomic force microscopy to be applied to the structural characterization of
biomolecules and other macromolecular systems. Such structural information is
essential to understanding the mechanisms of biomolecule reactions and their
relation to life processes. %%% The ability to anchor a large biomolecule to a
substrate for microscopic examination will be developed in this research
project. The interaction of scanning microscopy probes with the molecule under
study has limited the applicability of these powerful methods for large
molecules. This research project promises to address these limitations,
resulting in a better understanding of the structure of these biologically
important molecules.
