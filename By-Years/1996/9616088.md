96-16088 Lipps This proposal for a small SGER is within the guidelines for these
awards because it is a novel idea that will serve the collections community and
ventures into the application of new technology to a long-standing problem in
that community. The product of this award, a Web interactive, community-data-
entry database that also can be queried interactively on the Web, will push the
collections community toward more interaction among museums and researchers. If
a sufficient portion of the community does take advantage of the product of this
award, it will contribute to a more scientific approach to the adoption of
orphan collections and the location of scientific specimens that are available
for study and curation. The product itself will appear quickly, as many lines of
computer code can be adapted from other collections-based database applications
and tailored specifically to the problem at hand. The new application, developed
initially for invertebrate paleontology collections, will be made available for
adaptation and adoption by other sites, in addition to the service that will be
provided to the community by the PI's institution.
