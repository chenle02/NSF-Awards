This award will support collaborative research in mathematics between Dr. Andrew
Glass, Bowling Green State University and Dr. J.S. Wilson, University of
Cambridge, England. Linearly ordered groups are the building blocks for
partially ordered groups, yet very few examples or constructions are known.
Recently, Dr. Glass and Dr. Wilson have shown that linearly ordered groups arise
naturally in the investigation of certain doubly homogeneous groups of
automorphisms of linearly ordered sets. This already answers several questions
concerning lattice-ordered groups and provides a link between Hahn's Theorem for
Abelian linearly ordered groups and permutation groups. Glass and Wilson plan to
use this connection as well as some recent constructions of infinite groups in
the study of automorphism groups. Wilson's research has been almost exclusively
in constructions of infinite soluble groups, whereas Glass's has been primarily
in automorphism groups of linearly ordered sets and their applications. Their
areas of expertise are complementary and their joint work could lead to
considerable advances in this subject.
