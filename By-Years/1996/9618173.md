Powell and Haidvogel Eastern boundary currents systems, like the California
Current System, have a high plankton biomass because circulation processes
periodically force deep, nutrient-rich water to the ocean surface. Linkage of
physical and biological models is proposed to relate mesoscale features
(filaments, jets, and eddies) to spatial and demographic shifts in population
growth, fecundity and mortality. The results of this research should improve the
understanding of how diel vertical migration and water circulation interact to
affect the spatial distribution and population success of important CCS
zooplankton species such as Calanus pacificus, Metridia pacifica and Euphausia
pacifica.
