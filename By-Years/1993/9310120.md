This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a group
at Vanderbilt University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will continue studying polarized e+e- interactions as
members of the Stanford Large Detector (SLD) collaboration at the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC). They are also actively planning experiments and building
prototype detectors for experimentation with the GEM collaboration at the
Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
