On behalf of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Shapero proposes to organize
a committee to perform a study titled "Elementary Particle Physics in the 21st
century. The purpose of the study is to provide a roadmap needed to guide the
future of elementary particle physics. All of the evaluators regard the study
important and well deserving of support.
