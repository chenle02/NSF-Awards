This research involves the development of a set of computational tools for
addressing problems of image formation arising in fields ranging from medical
imaging and non-destructive evaluation of the manufactured components to
subsurface environmental remediation and civil infrastructure monitoring. Common
to these as well as many other problems is the need to characterize the internal
structure of a region of space from data collected along the periphery. While
common examples such as X-ray Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging
yield high resolution images, the problems of interest in this effort are far
more challenging due to complications associated with the physics of the
underlying sensing technology as well as restrictions concerning where and how
data can be acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges, the work
in this project exploits the fact that in many cases, the processing objective
is the identification of specific regions of interest containing flaws or other
anomalies. Through a multidisciplinary effort in engineering, mathematics, and
computation, the investigators develop and study a powerful new class of
innovative shaped based computational tools which combine variational Active
Surface models, Level Set Methods, Boundary Element Methods, and Partial
Differential Equations to detect/reconstruct geometric structures of interest
directly from raw tomographic data in a general class of PDE-based tomographic
modalities. This study has the potential to yield a substantial paradigm shift
in extracting geometric knowledge from tomographic measurements for a diverse
collection of societally important applications characterized by challenging
physics and restrictive sensing scenarios. Of specific interest here are
problems of geotechnical surface wave inversion, non-destructive testing, and
impedance tomography for environmental monitoring.
