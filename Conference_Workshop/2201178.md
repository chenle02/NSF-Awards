This grant will provide support for U.S. based participants to attend a five day
workshop titled "Minimal Representations and Theta Correspondence," to be held
at the Erwin Schrödinger Institute (ESI) in Vienna, Austria. The event will take
place April 11-15 2022. The minimal representations topics discussed at the
conference have played a central and unifying role in mathematics for over fifty
years, where they find applications to quantum mechanics and communication
theory, and within mathematics to number theory. Theta correspondences use
minimal representations to connect disparate mathematical objects. Work on theta
correspondences has accelerated recently, with the full proof of Howe's Duality
Conjecture published just a few years ago. The award will allow U.S. scholars to
continue working on minimal representations and theta correspondences on the
global stage, with an international community of researchers, as well as
introduce a new generation of mathematicians to the material.

Minimal representations have applications to automorphic forms, harmonic
analysis, for example, the Fourier transforms on basic affine spaces, and
mathematical physics, for example, scattering amplitudes in string theory. They
originate in the Weil representation of the metaplectic group, where they are
connected to Schrödinger's formulation of quantum mechanics via wave functions.
Within mathematics, the most profound applications of minimal representations
are through theta correspondences -- a generalization of Howe's duality
correspondence. Newer "exceptional" theta correspondences have been vital in the
Langlands program and arithmetic. This conference is a timely event, bringing
participants up-to-date on recent breakthroughs on minimal representations and
theta correspondences. The ESI workshop will bring together the top scholars
from around the world to showcase the latest progress in this field of
mathematics and the grant will allow U.S. scholars to travel to Austria and
attend this important event. For more information on the conference, see
