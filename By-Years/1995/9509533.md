9509533 Wiegmann Theoretical research will be conducted on nonperturbative
problems in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In particular,
electronic systems with strong interactions and topological fluids will be
studied. Topics to be studied include Fermi and Bose systems with vector gauge
interactions which describe the Mott insulator, liquid state of flux lines in
superconductors, fractional quantum Hall effect, and topological liquids. The
research will focus on topological effects of the gauge field, the character of
the ground state of the gauged system, toplogical instability, and
fractionalization of the spectrum as a result of a quantum phase transition. %%%
A variety of physical systems will be investigated which are of current
interest. All of these systems are characterized by the fact that they are
strongly interacting and cannot be treated using existing theoretical
techniques. The theoretical approach will be a mathematical one using field
theoretical techniques. The results of this work will contribute to both
condensed matter physics and its mathematical foundations. ***
