By abstracting behavior and carefully engineering interfaces, software building
blocks, also called generic components, can be produced that are more easily
composable and widely usable than the specialized components usually constructed
in current practice. Because of their potential uses, such components are
subject to the most rigorous possible scrutiny, including applying formal
methods of specification and proof of correctness. This project investigates two
key issues involved in applying formal methods to construction and use of
generic components: (1) the need for a formal specification language and related
tools that fully support behavioral abstraction, and (2) the need to deal with
practically useful components, in which efficiency as well as generality is a
key concern. The language and tools issue is being addressed by development of
the Tecton concept description language, its proof theory, and a Tecton parser,
type-checker and semantic processor (for generating proof obligations); these
tools are integrated into a previously developed interactive proof system. The
usefulness issue is addressed by developing formal concepts and models in Tecton
for highly optimized algorithms, such as generic sorting and searching
algorithms taken from a C++ generic library.
