This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program Announcement
NSF 88-28, Research Experience for Undergraduates. Under this award The
University of Central Florida will provide eleven undergraduate students with
training and support while they participate in ongoing research projects on
computer vision in the University's Computer Science Department. The award
recognizes the importance of hands-on experience in active research for training
undergraduates for careers in mathematics, science and engineering, and that too
few such experiences are now available. The University recruited some of the
students from other institutions, in order to broaden the base for attracting
students to scientific careers.
