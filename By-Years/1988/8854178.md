Twenty-five undergraduate teaching faculty attending this two-week short course
will work with the principles and applications of optics in engineering. A
mixture of lectures, demonstrations, with hands-on laboratory experiments and
projects represents the core of this enhancement program. Participants will be
provided with a prepared set of notes on most topics which will be covered
including Fourier analysis, diffraction theory, interferometry, geometrical
optics, holography, shearography, Moire' methods, optical data processing
methods, nondestructive testing, and digital image processing. Participants will
have intensive work experience with the latest in optical equipment and related
instrumentation, much of which is computer controlled. Oakland University
possesses outstanding applied optics facilities, which will enable participants
to work with the modern instrumentation. In addition, the very latest equipment
available will be borrowed from manufacturers and suppliers and set-up in
Oakland's laboratories for participant use. A follow-up evaluation of the impact
of this enhancement experience will be conducted one year later. In addition to
NSF funds, participants' institutions will provide about 10% in travel costs
toward the operation of the project.
