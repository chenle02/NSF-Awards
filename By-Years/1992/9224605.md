9224605 Grossman SDB: Computing with Persistent Stores of Scientific Objects
This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. The objective
of this project is to develop technology to enable scientists to make
computationally intensive queries on very large amounts of data in an object
store. The project consists of three closely related parts. The first part of
the project consists of developing algorithms to store, access, and analyze
objects distributed in a hierarchical storage system. The second part of the
project consists of developing a suite of software tools for working with
objects distributed in a hierarchical storage system. The third part of the
project consists of using these tools to create and analyze several stores,
including: an EventStore -- a store of proton collisions (events) generated by
counter rotating proton beams in a particle collider and registered by a variety
of sophisticated electronic equipment; a TrajectoryStore -- a store of
trajectory segments describing possible flight paths of aircraft modeled by
nonlinear systems; and a VortexStore -- a store of vortex solutions of modified
Navier-Stokes equations. As a result of this project, scientists will be able to
analyze data with object stores, even when the size of the data requires that
the majority of the data reside in tertiary storage. ***
