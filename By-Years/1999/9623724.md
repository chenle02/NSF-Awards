9623724 Lawson The aim of this project is to carry out basic mathematical
research in the emerging discipline of the Lie theory of semigroups and to
explore and extend contact of the theory with other disciplines such as
geometry, control theory, and notions of causality in physics. The general
theory has provided a new direction and impetus to classical Lie theory by
introducing a notion of order or "positivity" to the theory and thereby opened
up new contact points and applications to other disciplines. At the group level,
the appropriate objects to be investigated are those subsemigroups of Lie groups
that are generated by their one-parameter subsemigroups. At the Lie algebra
level, it is a special class of cones called Lie wedges. And at the level of
homogeneous spaces, it is the interrelated notions of homogeneous causal orders
and homogeneous causal structures. The theory of these corresponding structures
is the principal focus of this investigation. Classical Lie theory has proved
itself an extremely versatile and powerful mathematical tool with a host of
applications in geometry, mathematical physics, differential equations, and a
wide variety of other disciplines. There has already been a substantial
development and application of Lie theory in the new directions with which this
project is concerned, the theory of optimal control of systems being an area of
notably successful application, and it is anticipated that the program of
research will significantly enhance both the theory and its applicability. ***
