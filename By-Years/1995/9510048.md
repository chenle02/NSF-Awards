9510048 Langdon Past CO2 level have often been estimated from 13-C levels of
marine organisms. But these values are also affected by species growth, and pH
and temperature of the ocean water. The investigators will test the importance
of CO2 availability, pH, growth rate and temperature on C-isotopic fractionation
by individual cultures of marine algae, representing major phytoplankton groups
in today's oceans. ***
