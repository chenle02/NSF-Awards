Mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are collections of deep convective storms
that are the parents of most beneficial rain and destructive severe weather in
the Spring and Summer in the US. Improved understanding of these systems and
their interactions with other scales of motion is fundamental to improve weather
predictions sought after in the US Weather Research Program. Using data
previously collected during the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment
for STORM Central (O-K PRE-STORM; where STORM stands for STormscale Operational
and Research Meteorology), the Principal Investigator will investigate the
structure and evolution of MCSs and how they affect the larger scale flow. The
two major objectives are: (1) determine how the circulation structure of the
stratiform regions of MCSs develops and how that may affect the structure and
longevity of the parent convective system; (2) examine the structure of
convective vertical drafts to determine how the area-averaged convective
structure varies in space and time as a possible consequence of mesoscale
gradients in the thermodynamic structure of the environment, and interaction
between the convective region and internal mesoscale storm-relative flow.
