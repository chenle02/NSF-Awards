The focus of this project is the development of an undergraduate software
engineering laboratory which utilizes the most advanced techniques available.
This includes CASE tools, automated project management, object-oriented
programming, distributed project development and others. The purpose of the
laboratory is to provide hands-on experience for undergraduate students.
Potential applications areas for students to investigate include embedded real
time systems. A cluster of SUN Microsystems SPARC workstations and Interactive
Development Environments' Software through Pictures are to be acquired. This
project establishes a state-of-the-art laboratory for software engineering which
is badly needed at the undergraduate level. Such laboratories will address the
national need for well trained software developers.
