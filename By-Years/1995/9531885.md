9531885 Firing This project is a component of a multi-investigator study of the
Sub Polar Gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean to be carried out as part of the WOCE
ACCE (Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment). The PIs will participate at least two hydrographic cruises,
providing support to obtain direct measurements of velocity, using a shipboard
ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler), as well as a Lowered ADCP (LADCP). The
data will be used to investigate the upper ocean mass, heat, salt and momentum
balance in the subpolar gyre during both fall and spring seasons.
