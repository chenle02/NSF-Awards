Winthrop University hosts a nine week research program, Winthrop University REU:
Bridging Applied and Theoretical Mathematics. Research themes include
differential equations modeling of cancer biology and the study of phylogenetics
using algebraic geometry and combinatorics. A professional development seminar
and a colloquium series supplement the faculty mentored research activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program supports students from groups traditionally
underrepresented in mathematics graduate programs, but welcomes all students
from institutions whose highest mathematics degree is Bachelor's degree. This
project builds a diverse and talented group of mathematics students and supports
their transition into graduate programs in STEM fields. In this project, faculty
mentors provide sustained mentorship beyond the completion of the nine week
research experience and participants are supported to present their findings at
national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;
