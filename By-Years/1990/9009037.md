We know several of the areas in the brain which control eye movement but we
know little about where they are inter connected for the eyes to move in a
coordinated and responsive fashion. To study one such interconnection two sites
in the brain will be injected with two different neuroanatomical tracers. The
experiment will test if the cortical frontal eye field is connected to the same
cells as the cerebellar fastigial nucleus projections. Electron microscopy will
be used to prove if the identified axons terminate on the same neuron and if so
what the synaptic relationships are. The study should increase our knowledge of
how and where eye movement is controlled.
