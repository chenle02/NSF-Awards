Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics and
today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for Operator Algebras
Lecture Series (GOALS) will provide early-career graduate students with an
introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator
algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation
and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing
technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among
the participants, contributors, and organizers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Operator
algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue
with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory,
conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name a few. As this list
indicates, the breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator
algebras can be intimidating; hence the need for GOALS as stated above. The
objectives of GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of
C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; evening discussions on
psychological barriers; expository talks about more advanced topics; and a
culminating conference with leading researchers in operator algebras. The
community created at GOALS 2022 will be sustained by providing financial support
for the participants to reunite at major annual operator algebras conferences
such as the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium in May 2023. More details

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
