Lawrence Markus will carry out investigations into stochastic differential
equations and into the control of hybrid systems in infinite dimensional state
spaces. The former work arises from a formulation of relativistic Brownian
motion as a stochastic dynamical system on a manifold. These are in turn related
to geodesic flows which will be the focus of Markus' attention in this area. A
hybrid system is a combination of a system such as an elastic beam governed by a
partial differential equation and a rigid body governed by an ordinary
differential equation. This combination will be controlled by boundary
controllers acting only in the rigid body. Investigations such as these are
important because of their applicability to the problem of controlling large
scale space structures. George Sell will work on inertial manifolds for
nonlinear evolutionary equations, functional differential equations with
feedback, spectral properties of linear evolutionary equations, and chaotic
behavior for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation. Inertial manifolds are
currently being investigated by many researchers with the aim of using them to
investigate the global attractors of nonlinear dissipative evolutionary
equations. Markus and Sell will be joined by Yuncheng You, who will work with
them principally in the areas of control of large space structures and control
theory of differentiable manifolds.
