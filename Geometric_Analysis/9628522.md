9628522 Adams This grant supports a group of six mathematicians at the
University of Georgia with interrelated interests. Research areas lie in
geometry and topology including Seiberg-Witten theory, characteristic classes of
singular varieties, integrable systems and Hamiltonian dynamics, and the
Schottky problem. Partial support is provided for travel, a workshop, two
postdoctoral researchers, and several graduate students. Seiberg-Witten theory
lies in the interface of geometric analysis, topology and algebraic geometry; it
is a recent discovery motivated by problems in theoretical physics. In this
theory, electric-magnetic duality plays a crucial role which states roughly that
electricity and magnetism are two phases of a single underlying phenomenon.
