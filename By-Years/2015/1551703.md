Infants need frequent periods of rest or sleep for their physical and emotional
well-being. Sleep also plays a very important role in learning and memory. Sleep
helps babies to solidify newly learned information in their memories, a process
known as consolidation. The goal of this project is to study the role of sleep
in motor learning -- acquiring a new skill involving physical coordination of
movement. The results will provide important insights into how the timing and
quality of sleep infants experience influences their ability to consolidate new
motor learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work bridges three areas of
research: cognitive development, motor development, and sleep. Infants who have
just begun walking independently will learn to complete a tunnel navigation
task. Following the task, infants will experience a delay during which some will
nap and others will not. The impact of napping on learning will then be
assessed. A sleep monitor (actigraph) will be employed to assess individual
differences in quality of sleep and how sleep quality relates to learning.
Measures of sleep prior to training and on the following night will permit
investigation of the unique contributions of day and night sleep to infant
learning. This study will be the first to directly examine sleep and motor
learning in infancy, the first to study the contribution of night sleep on
infant motor learning, and the first to examine whether individual differences
in the quality of sleep mediates the effect of sleep on learning. The proposed
research will ultimately provide guidelines for balancing between enriched
learning experiences and a protective environment that promotes rest and
regulation. This project is being supported by a partnership between the
National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.
