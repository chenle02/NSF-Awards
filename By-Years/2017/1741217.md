This project will support the US Ignite 2017 Application Summit, the 4th in a
series of annual Summits, to be held on June 27-28 in Austin, Texas. The project
will help defray the costs of travel and conference participation for 150
participants. The Summit will enable researchers from the gigabit networking
community to demonstrate their research results to diverse stakeholders
including municipal officials, community leaders, and application developers
interested in Smart &amp; Connected Communities and
Cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also convene an integrated
Principal Investigators meeting for NSF-funded research programs including US
Ignite, and Smart &amp; Connect Communities, advancing their joint research
agenda. The project will enable Application Summit participants to share best
practices and lesson learned with one-another and with community leaders and
stakeholders. The US Ignite 2017 Application Summit will be co-located with the
Smart Cities Connect Conference, ensuring diverse participation from communities
across the nation.
