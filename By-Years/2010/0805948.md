Recent advances in understanding String Theory on boundaries have led to seeing
connections between classical Gravity in 10 dimensions and Conformal Field
Theories in 4 dimensions. This proposal will explore further the relation
between string and gauge theories to understand the structure of hadrons. The
main idea is to improve the understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence, so that
similar methods could be applied to the theory of strong interactions Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). As stepping stones to the main goal are the PI intends to
study field theory planar diagrams in light-cone gauge. He hopes to understand
the emergence of strings from a field theory as a tool for describing long gauge
invariant operators. He will look for new solutions to the string equations of
motion with characteristic properties that make them identifiable in the field
theory side of the correspondence. He will also look at generalizations of cusp
anomaly calculations to better understand the dynamics of gluons in gauge
theories with supersymmetries. The PI plans to give as part of his outreach a
series of popular introductory lectures on string theory and particle physics at
the QuarkNet Center at Purdue. He also intends to give lectures at the Tindley
Accelerated School (98% minority student population).
