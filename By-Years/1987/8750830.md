Significant revisions have recently been made in the curriculum of the senior-
level modern physics theory course at Weber State to include Nuclear and
Particle Physics as a distinct subject area. A corresponding change in the
Modern Physics Laboratory course is planned. The Physics Department will acquire
an IBM-PC-based multi-channel analyzer system (MCA), a high resolution HPGe
gamma-ray detector, and fast timing detectors, with associated electronics
components for this nuclear physics lab. This will permit a wide range of
nuclear experiments to be carried out in this laboratory that are not currently
possible with available equipment. In addition to the laboratory course, the
equipment will also make possible student research projects in nuclear and solid
state physics. The computer-based MCA will give students an opportunity to work
with computer-interfaced scientific equipment which is invaluable to their
training as physicists.
