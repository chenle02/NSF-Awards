The research examines the nature of the most recent phase of gentrification in
New York City, which began after the economic recession of the early 1990s and
is currently reworking the urban landscape. Both citywide and neighborhood
scales will be examined using eight separate data sets from the Department of
City Planning as well as `participant observation' methodologies. Comparison to
two prior phases of post-recession gentrification in New York City will be made.
The study will: (1) contribute to an understanding of the linkages between
gentrification and other urban processes as mediated by economic trends; (2) map
the experience of gentrification over a twenty-year period; and (3) show how
micro-scale market characteristics interact with broader forces of capital
investment. The results are important to academics and managers concerned with
urban restructuring and the development of policies that might influence the
direction of such restructuring.
