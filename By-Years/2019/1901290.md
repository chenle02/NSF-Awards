This award provides funding for US participation in the thematic research
program Operator Algebras, Groups, and Applications to Quantum Information that
will be held from March 11 to June 29, 2019, at the research institute ICMAT in
Madrid, Spain. The conference focuses on recent developments in the field of
operator algebras (C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras) and its interactions
with group theory and the relatively young subject of quantum information. The
main activities of the program consist of two schools, two workshops, and an
international conference, and the themes to be addressed include classification
aspects of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, the dichotomy between
amenability and paradoxicality in its various guises, and the Connes embedding
problem in relation to quantum information.

A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak in the
schools, workshops, and international conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by
NSF an opportunity to participate in this program. The organizing committee will
strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number
of different activities. More information is available at:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
