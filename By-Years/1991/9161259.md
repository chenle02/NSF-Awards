Research is proposed to investigate the efficacy of systolic
compression/expansion (SEC) load balancing for scalable concurrent visualization
systems (SCVS). The approach used is based on a Newtonian derivation for the
equation of motion describing the message-passing flow between neighboring
multicomputer computation elements. An assessment of graphical primitive quantum
size representation for geometry, silicon process technology, and message-
passing rates will lead to an effective metric for predicting the instantaneous
load-balance, and systolically managing the update of SCVS display subsystem.
The SCVS will be simulated via a physical concurrency emulation of the logically
concurrent process structure required to implement a message-passing system for
rendering graphical datasets in a shared-memory. This simulation will serve as
the foundation for load balance monitoring studies based on a parametric test
matrix of input conditions, such as user transformation rate, and geometric
quanta size representation.
