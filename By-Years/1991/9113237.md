The K-alpha spectra of nickel, copper and zinc will be studied using state-of-
the-art resolution available from a monolithic double crystal spectrometer. The
objective is to measure the K x-ray lines with enough resolution to characterize
the effects of multiplet splitting which are believed to result from
perturbations by outer shell vacancies. The resulting data will make possible
improved atomic structure calculations, and provide improved understanding of
inter-electron dynamics.
