Holographic interferometry will be used to study the formation of surface
roughness during plastic deformation of metals. The development of the roughness
will be followed in detail for spheroidized 1090 carbon steel and will be
related to strain, strain rate and environmental effects, in particular the
presence of hydrogen. The technique will subsequently be adapted to the in situ
study of roughness development on tribological surfaces.
