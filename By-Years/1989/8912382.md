Power system black-outs caused by a transient instability initiated by some
severe disburbance must be avoided. The societal costs of such black-outs are
very high. Present methods for assessing transient instabilities are generally
based on global off-line methodologies. A serious technological need exists for
developing a methodology for transient stability assessment (TSA), dealing with
reduced parameter and observation sets such that on-line implementation becomes
feasible. The value of such methodology rests in the subsequent development of:
(i) new protection and control hardware for system components, and (ii) for the
augmentation of stability boundaries by the active control of network elements
installed for this purpose. The research is intended to impact on this need for
an on-line TSA methodology. Power systems which are presently limiting
transmission levels due to potential transient instabilities, could thereupon
more fully utilize installed transmission capacity towards thermal rather than
transient stability limits. The need for additional transmission construction on
such systems may then be less critical because, in effect, more useful capacity
would be available with lines presently in service.
