Professor Gaines will carry out a broad study of hydrogen isotopes in solid and
liquid phases. Specifically the investigator will determine the ortho-hydrogen
concentration as a function of time to infer the dynamics of atoms embedded in
the molecular solid host. This research will evolve into a study of spin
diffusion. The atoms act as powerful relaxation centers but the nuclear
polarization will reach them via the spin diffusion. These nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) studies will also obtain lineshape information. An EPR
instrument will be constructed and will yield a direct measure of atom density
as a function of time and temperature and thus study low temperature chemical
reactions in a well characterized solid host. Emission and absorption spectra
will be taken, a new instrument will be obtained at the University of Hawaii.
