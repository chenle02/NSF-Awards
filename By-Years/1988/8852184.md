This project is improving the quality and relevance of the first and second
courses dealing with chemical analysis through the use of microcomputers and
automated titrators. This is being accomplished through the use of four
automatic titrators in conjunction with four micro-computers. This permits
students to design and control automatic titrations; to collect and process
data; to learn a greater number of volumetric methods including colorimetric,
potentiometric and pH titrations; and to become familiar wtih the application of
computers to new and old methods of analysis. The automatic titrator/computer is
being used to do a series of titrations involving acids and bases; redox
titrations; and potentiometric titrations. The equipment is being used to teach
students about a greater number of analytical techniques and making it easier to
use the laboratory experiments to reinforce theoretical topics covered in the
lecture. It is also enabling the teaching of methods of analysis through the use
of computer simulation. In addition many laboratory skills are being taught in a
more efficient and meaningful manner through the use of computers in the
laboratory setting. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
