The University of Tennessee seeks support to expand the Chemistry Mass
Spectrometry (MS) Center by adding a triple quadrupole electrospray (ES) liquid
chromatography (LC)/MS system. ES is needed for expanded applications,
particularly those involving characterization of biochemical systems. The
instrumentation will also be used for fundamental studies of solvation and other
chemical factors affecting ES sensitivity; and for investigation of the
mechanism of soluble polymer size-selective capillary electrophoresis. Since ES
spectra are characterized by multiple charging, the proposed 4,000 mass-to-
charge (m/z) range corresponds to a practical mass range well in excess of 105.
This constitutes an order-of-magnitude increase relative to current nominal
capabilities, and a two order of magnitude practical improvement, in light of
the special strengths (including sub-femtomole sensitivity) of ES. The system
will accommodate a wide range of chromatographic solvents and flow rates,
facilitating work in microscale and conventional analytical separations. The
tandem MS capabilities of the instrument will provide structural insight across
the full range of analyte compounds, even for individual components of
unresolved or partially resolved mixtures.
