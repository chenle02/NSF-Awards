This project seeks to develop millennium-length estimates of the strength of
Asian monsoon atmospheric circulation and to infer variability in past monsoon
circulation from replicated, annually-resolved stable oxygen isotope (ä18-O)
time series from the long-lived southeast Asian conifer Fokienia hodginsii in
Vietnam and Laos. The research leverages a previously supported pilot study that
demonstrated that tree-ring ä18-O from this species in this region responds to
broad-scale patterns of Asian monsoon circulation that are consistent with
climate dynamics, known controls on the stable isotopes of precipitation, and
the physical and chemical mechanisms comprising the study of isotope
dendroclimatology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include
supporting undergraduates in the planned research and providing a potentially
important new archive of data from a climatologically sensitive region.
