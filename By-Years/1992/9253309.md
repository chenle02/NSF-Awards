This project seeks to integrate real-world applications and mathematical
modeling into the secondary mathematics curriculum. To these ends, 30 well-
prepared high school mathematics teachers from around the State of New York will
participate in two successive summer, residential four-week institutes to be
held at SUNY in Brockton. In these institutes participates will: (1) survey and
examine available, exemplary classroom materials on applications and modeling;
(2) study the underlying mathematical ideas and principles; (3) learn directly
from industrial users of mathematics; and (4) explore appropriate uses of
graphing calculators and microcomputers. Participants will be chosen in five
"teams" of six -- each team representing a region of New York State. During the
first summer -- in addition to their academic studies -- these teams of teachers
will also prepare their own lessons and units involving applications and
modeling, which they will pilot in their own classrooms during the succeeding
academic year. The institutes will also include sessions on staff development to
help prepare the participating teachers to conduct in-service workshops in their
local schools and, in the second academic year, throughout their respective
regions. Support by project staff for all these activities will include at least
two site visits to each teacher's classroom, as well as to periodic regional
meetings of the teams. Cost sharing represents 58% of the total NSF
contribution.
