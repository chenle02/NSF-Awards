Dr. Richard P.Steiner and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Utah are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is the focus on a nationwide effort to attract women and minority
students, particularly through contacts with Historically Black colleges and
institutions with large hispanic populations.
