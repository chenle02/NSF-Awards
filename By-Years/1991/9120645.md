The University of Georgia wishes to achieve these objectives: 1) to expand the
existing PeachNet services to include University System outreach programs; 2) to
pilot a project to create a networking model whereby private and public shcool
systems may be integrated into Georgia's public higher education network system;
3) to provide for network resource management; and 4) to provide access to
NSFNET for 45 units connected to PeachNet. Specifically the following schools
will be directly aided: Atlanta Metropolitain College, Clayton State College,
Dalton College, Gainesville College, Gordon College, North Georgia College, and
Middle Georgia College. The expansion to connect the additional state supported
institutions to PeachNet and NSFNET will provide Georgia educators and students
an opportunity to share resources with the current eachNet and NSFNET
communities.***
