This project will support the establishment of a computer laboratory that will
be used in conjunction with a two-semester introductory calculus sequence. It is
being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program,
which has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-
based undergraduate laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or engineering.
The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support
for the instrumen- tation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional
improvements at U.S. colleges and universities. In particular, the main
objective of this project is to provide the laboratory environment which will
facilitate the use of the system called the Calculus Companion, written by the
Principal Investigators under a previous NSF grant. The computer, with the
Calculus Companion, will enable students to concentrate on learning the
important concepts of calculus, free them from tedious calculations, and
encourage creativity through rapid feedback and experimentation.
