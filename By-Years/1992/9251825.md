To promote leadership among future scientists by providing practical exercises
that foster critical decision making skills, this project has as its goal the
formulation of guidelines and the development of case-studies in natural
resource policy, applied science, and resource development issues. The cases are
to be used in a new undergraduate program in environmental science and collected
in a library/repository at the University, and made available to educators in
environmental studies elsewhere. The case studies, which are being developed in
collaboration with students in the course, provide an ongoing source of well-
written current teaching materials for courses in marine affairs, business, law,
engineering, and the social and natural sciences. They emphasize the interaction
of natural science and social science in the formulation of policies for the
management of natural resources.
