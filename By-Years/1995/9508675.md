Professor Herschel Rabitz is supported by a grant under the Optical Science and
Engineering initiative in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to
perform theoretical studies of laser techniques for controlling molecular
dynamics. The research will emphasize: 1) the establishment of bounds of
possible control over molecular systems; 2) the determination of the essential
features of laser pulses for achieving practical control; 3) the development of
advanced laser field design techniques for molecular control; and 4) a full
exploration of the role of adaptive laboratory feedback as a means of overcoming
inherent design uncertainties and laboratory errors. Although the research is
theoretical in nature, it will be closely coordinated with parallel laboratory
efforts at Princeton and elsewhere. The outcome of this research is expected to
lay the broad foundations for performing optically controlled molecular
manipulations, as well as opening up a new means to probe the complex physical
processes occurring during molecular dynamics. Since the invention of the laser
chemists have dreamed of selectively exciting regions within a molecule thus
causing a controlled chemical reaction to occur. It was long ago realized,
however, that intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution occurrs so
rapidly that it is impossible to concentrate enough energy in a selected bond to
cause it to break. Now, with the advent of laser pulse modulation techniques,
and the application of control theory, it appears that the dream of laser
selective chemistry may become a reality.
