9417018 Moum A horizontally-towed body fully instrumented to resolve horizontal
shears over vertical scales of 1-70 m while measuring turbulent fluctuations
along the towing path will be developed and tested in a scientific experiment.
The towed body will be capable to operate at depths up to 3000 m and within 100
m of sloping boundaries. The science experiment will determine the
representative scales of mixing and internal waves in an area of rough
topography and abrupt bathymetry on the continental shelf of the Eastern Pacific
and compare these to abyssal values in the interior of the ocean away from
boundaries.
