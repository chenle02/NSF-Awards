This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. There are few published measurements of biomass
or production from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean. This
project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in the Arctic
Ocean during the Trans-Arctic cruise of the SOVETSKIY SOYUZ. It will investigate
role of bacteria in the cycling of organic matter in the Arctic Ocean. The
program will study the spatial variation in bacterial biomass and production and
their significance in organic matter cycling and the sinking flux out of the
region of light penetration and into deeper depths. Concentrations of various
organic fractions in sea water will also be accomplished.
