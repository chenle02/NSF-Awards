Engineering -- Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates medical-
imaging research and new technologies into the undergraduate biomedical
engineering curriculum. It develops a series of courses and a new software
package that provides dynamic simulations of commonly used medical imaging
systems. As a prototype, the PI is developing a CT simulator that includes web
pages illustrating principles and devices along with a Java package allowing the
users to view the results as an image is processed step-by-step. Using this
material, the PI is establishing a web-based medical imaging laboratory/library
accessible through the Internet. The assessment process involves an evaluation
of the plans by faculty colleagues, teaching evaluations and exit interviews
with graduating students, and an evaluation by an external review committee and
employers' feedback. In addition to establishing the web-based
laboratory/library, the PI plans to present papers at the ASEE and the IEEE EMBS
meetings to disseminate his work.
