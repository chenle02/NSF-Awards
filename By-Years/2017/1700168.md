This award provides funding for US participation in the program "Analysis in
Quantum Information Theory" that will be held the Institut Henri Poincare during
the fall of 2017.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of Quantum Information Theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians
have agreed to attend and speak at this long-term conference. This award gives
early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not
funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
