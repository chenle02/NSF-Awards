The investigator proposes to study the structure, its robustness/stability and
transitions of the large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, to yield a better
understanding of the atmospheric and oceanic prediction and predictability
relevant to typical sources of their low frequency variability. The proposed
effort studies specific topics in two inter-related areas: A) geometric theory
of incompressible and geophysical fluid flows, and B) low-frequency variability
of atmospheric and oceanic flows. The proposed work in the first area focuses on
the structural transitions of incompressible and geophysical fluid flows in the
underlying physical spaces. The proposed work in the second area focuses on
bifurcation issues of gyre scale ocean circulations. The investigator uses a
combination of physical modelling, rigorous mathematical theory, and large scale
computing to yield new insights into physical phenomena. The proposed study
involves on the one hand applications of the existing mathematical theory to the
understanding of the underlying physical problems, and on the other hand the
development of new mathematical theories. The proposed project involves
challenging problems with important practical implications for geophysical
efforts to quantify predictability, analyze error growth in dynamical models,
and develop efficient forecast methods. These investigations will be of great
benefit in improving predictions on weather and climate changes, which are of
central importance to our economy.
