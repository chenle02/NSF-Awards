The Board on Science Education at the National Research Council, in
collaboration with the Board on Testing and Assessment and the Board on Higher
Education and the Workforce, is convening a 12 member expert committee to
develop a framework and set of indicators that can document the status and
quality of undergraduate STEM education at both community colleges and 4-year
institutions and be used to track improvements at the national level over
multiple years. At present there is no comprehensive, national system for
documenting important aspects of undergraduate STEM education nor is there an
analytic framework for thinking about what indicators are needed to adequately
document progress toward improvement. The committee will meet 6 times to gather
information, deliberate on the evidence, and prepare a report. After the third
meeting, an interim report will be made available for public comment. The final
report will undergo rigorous peer review and be available in free PDF format. By
identifying needed research and data sources, the study will enhance the
information that is available to educators, researchers, and policy makers,
thereby laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of the practices and
conditions that contribute to successful postsecondary STEM education. The
project will provide NSF, other federal agencies, private foundations and
professional organizations with guidance on important indicators to track in
gauging the status and quality of postsecondary STEM education.
