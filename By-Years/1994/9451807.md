The Cellular and Molecular Genetics Core Laboratory is used by four
undergraduate Cell Biology and Genetics courses. It is equipped with
electrophoretic, sequencing, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) instruments.
The courses effected are designed to link benchwork experience and the
formulation of fundamental questions about cellular dynamics, in order to
improve both the critical thinking skills and laboratory proficiency of the
students.
