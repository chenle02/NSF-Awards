Objective: The objective of this program is to design, fabricate, and
characterize a new class of coupled optomechanical resonators and arrays. The
photon-phonon interaction in chip-scale optomechanical cavities has been the
subject of recent research as they can be used to create integrated hybrid
optical/mechanical/quantum information processing systems. This project will
investigate coupled optomechanical resonators and arrays with complex composite
resonance functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual
merit is to use the coupled optical resonance to coherently control and enhance
optomechanical interactions in a chip-scale platform. In the strong coupling
regime of the coupled optomechanical resonator system, the split optical
resonances will be matched to the optical driving field and one of its motion
sidebands, to enhance optomechanical interactions. In the weak coupling regime,
opposite optical forces induced by the phase shift in separate resonators will
be used to simultaneously cool one mechanical resonator and heat the other to
obtain optically-controlled mechanical energy transfers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are to create signal
processing and sensing platforms by using the versatile information processing
capability and extremely high displacement sensitivity provided by coupled
optomechanical resonators and arrays. This program will fund a full time
graduate student and engage undergraduate students in focused sub-projects
related to the proposed research through building Creative Inquiry teams and
providing REU research opportunities. An extensive outreach effort is proposed,
including a summer internship program for both undergraduate and high school
students and a science workshop for high school teachers.
