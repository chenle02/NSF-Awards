9615643 HEDGES The West Indies is unique among tropical archipelagos of the
world in being composed of several, large islands of ancient origin, the Greater
Antilles. Each island possesses a species-rich biota, and collectively, the
islands provide a valuable "laboratory" where scientists can replicate tests of
hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships and biologically-meaningful
mechanisms. The islands of the Greater Antilles have been the focus of numerous,
classical studies in ecology, animal morphology and behavior, and historical
biogeography. Our understanding of phylogenetic relationships among most West
Indian animal and plant groups, however, remains poor. A critical group of West
Indian animals are leptodactylid frogs (genus Eleutherodactylus).
Eleutherodactylus is the largest genus of vertebrate organisms, and comprise
most of the amphibian fauna of the West Indies. Nearly every species of
Eleutherodactylus is restricted to a single island and is found nowhere else. In
this project, Blair Hedges will examine DNA sequences from two mitochondrially-
encoded, ribosomal RNA genes and from one nuclear-encoded gene (serum albumin).
Aligned sequences will be subjected to rigorous phylogenetic analysis, and the
resulting relationships inferred will be subjected to rigorous statistical
testing The resulting and well-supported hypothesis of phylogenetic
relationships will then be used to determine significant patterns of divergence
of chromosomal change, vocalization, life-history, and speciation in these frogs
and in anurans in general. The phylogenetic hypotheses also will be used to test
hypotheses of historical biogeography in the West Indian region.
