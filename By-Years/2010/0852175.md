Research over the past 20 years has shown that trait differences acting after
copulation&lt;br/&gt;but before the fusion of sperm and egg nuclei, often termed
postmating, prezygotic trait&lt;br/&gt;differences, play a primary role in
reducing gene exchange between populations within&lt;br/&gt;a species and
between closely related species. The genetic basis of these
trait&lt;br/&gt;differences is poorly understood and thus, constitutes the
primary goal of Marshall and&lt;br/&gt;Howard's research plan. Specifically, the
proposed research focuses on identifying the&lt;br/&gt;seminal fluid and sperm
proteins that differ, whether in abundance or structure,
between&lt;br/&gt;closely related ground cricket species that are isolated by
postmating, prezygotic trait&lt;br/&gt;differences. Once identified, gene
silencing technology will be used to evaluate the&lt;br/&gt;function of each
protein and its influence on preventing or reducing fertilization
between&lt;br/&gt;species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barriers to fertilization have
been intensively studied in the Allonemobius socius&lt;br/&gt;complex of
crickets, providing an excellent model for evaluating the genes and
proteins&lt;br/&gt;that underlie successful fertilization. Understanding the
genetic basis of fertilization&lt;br/&gt;incompatibilities between populations
and species can provide insight into a wide-range&lt;br/&gt;of topics, including
the development of infertility within species (including humans)
and&lt;br/&gt;the role of sexual selection and sexual conflict in driving the
divergence of fertilization&lt;br/&gt;proteins. The project provides training
for undergraduate and graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;outreach to K-12
schools.&lt;br/&gt;
