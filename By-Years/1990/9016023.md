The principal investigator will analyze how topology determines geometry in
several settings. He will study deformation theory for open 3-manifolds,
geometrization of automorphisms of free groups, and parallels between
renormalization theory and hyperbolic 3-manifolds which asymptotically fiber
over a circle. A central theme in modern dynamical systems is the restriction
topology puts on allowable dynamics and geometry. For example, on the surface of
a sphere, every vector field must have a singularity. On the earth, this means
that the wind cannot blow everywhere at once; there must be at least one spot
where the air does not move. In this vein, the principal investigator will
develop relationships between complex dynamics and the geometry of three-
dimensional hypersurfaces.
