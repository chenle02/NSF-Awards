This award is part of the Arctic System Science Program, a U.S. Global Change
Program. It will undertake a three year study of the response of the McCall
Glacier in northern Alaska to climatic change in the Arctic. The study will
evaluate the effects of climatic response on the arctic hydrological cycle
through airborne measurements of glacial profiles and evaluation of glacial
volume changes which have occurred over the past 40 years. The results of this
study will allow evaluation of the relationships between glacier geometry, mass
balance and climatological parameters measured at different locations in
northern Alaska. Volume change estimates on two other nearby glaciers will be
used to determine the degree to which McCall Glacier is representative of arctic
Alaska as a whole.
