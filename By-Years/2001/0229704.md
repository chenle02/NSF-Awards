Liebermann&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229704&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismological
investigations yield the most precise information on the velocities of sound
waves in the Earth's interior. Laboratory measurements of the sound velocities
in minerals enable these seismic data to be interpreted in terms of chemical
composition, mineralogy and temperature. This project will utilize ultrasonic
techniques in combination with synchrotron X-radiation to measure the sound
velocities of mantle minerals at simultaneous high pressures and temperatures.
This research program takes advantage of the special opportunities for research
that are provided by the multi-anvil, large-volume facilities of the Stony Brook
High Pressure Laboratory and the associated analytical facilities of the Mineral
Physics Institute at Stony Brook University. Many of these facilities were
developed under the auspices of the NSF Science and Technology Center for High
Pressure Research (CHiPR) from 1991-2002.
