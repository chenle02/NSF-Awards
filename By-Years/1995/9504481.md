ATM-9504481 Jacobson This project is funded through the Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) program. It consists of a research and an educational
component. In the research part, the transfer of carbon dioxide, sulfuric acid,
nitric acid, and other trace species from the atmosphere to ocean water, sea
spray aerosols, and marine stratus will be studied. The resulting information
will then be used in regional and global computer simulations. This will lead to
a better treatment of atmosphere-ocean carbon dioxide exchange in climate models
and to a better understanding of trace gas exchange between sea spray particles
and the atmosphere. Particles that grow by gas absorption affect climate
directly by attenuating short-wave radiation. Such particles also remove some
acids from and release other acids to the gas phase. To carry out these studies,
existing chemical, microphysical, and dynamical computer programs will be used,
improved, and re-inserted into a larger modeling system. Mesoscale and global
computer simulations as well as sensitivity studies will be carried out, and the
results analyzed. For the educational component, five courses will be developed
covering (1) the science of urban, regional, and global air pollution, (2)
computer modeling of atmospheric pollution, (3) meteorology and the atmospheric
environment, (4) cloud microphysics and chemistry, and (5) atmospheric radiative
transfer. Furthermore, the PI will work to improve classroom communication,
write programs for and set up computer laboratories for course projects,
evaluate the effects of courses and laboratories on student learning, encourage
students from diverse disciplines and underrepresented groups to participate in
courses, work to foster undergraduate education, advise undergraduate and
graduate students, and encourage students to participate in research projects.
Finally he will develop a course textbook and require students to take part in a
small research project in some courses.
