All human behavior entails the continuous interaction between the actor and the
environment. This interaction requires an exquisite degree of coordination,
often under extremely complex conditions, and we are only just beginning to
understand how such coordination is achieved. With funding from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Sternad will examine the performance of a perceptual-
motor task in which the complex coordination of actor and environment is
distilled in a paradigm suitable for research. The task is the rhythmic bouncing
of a ball with a racket. In this task, the actor must continuously coordinate
the movements of the racket with the movements of the ball, whose trajectories
are in turn determined by the actor. This advantage of this task is that the
resulting ball-racket system obeys well-understood physical principles.
Moreover, by virtue of being a definable nonlinear dynamical system, it displays
characteristic features such as stability and bifurcations. By manipulating the
racket, the actor becomes part of this dynamical system and can exploit its
properties. Some regimes of the system offer rhythmic solutions with "passive
stability", where perturbations converge back onto the attractor without
requiring corrective control. Other regimes require active control on the part
of actor. Establishing, maintaining, and tuning the regimes of active control
rely upon multiple sources of perceptual information. One of the primary aims of
this research is to better understand these two general regimes of coordination.
The research will also establish national and international collaborations in
which both senior investigators and graduate students will
participate.&lt;br/&gt;
