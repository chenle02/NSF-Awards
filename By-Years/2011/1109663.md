The goal of this proposal is to study some geometric variational problems
derived from optimal transportation. The PI proposes projects related to this
goal with an emphasis on the following: (a) studying the optimal allocation
problem arisen in mathematical economics with ramified transport technology; (b)
modeling the dynamic formation of mud cracking using Monge-Kantorovich optimal
transportation; and (c) modeling vascular tree structures of the placentas using
ramified optimal transportation.

The optimal transportation problem aims at finding an efficient allocation plan
for transporting some commodity from sources to targets. In particular, ramified
optimal transportation is used to model the transport economy of scale in group
transportation observed widely in both nature (e.g. trees, river channel
networks) and efficiently designed transport systems of branching structures
(e.g. railway configurations and postage delivery networks). The proposed
optimal allocation problem is the prototype for a class of problems (e.g.
optimal storage problem) arising in mathematical economics. It aims at finding
an optimal allocation plan as well as an associated optimal allocation path to
minimize overall cost of transporting commodity from factories to households.
Also, the proposed dynamic model for mud cracking not only increases our
understanding about mud cracking but also may be useful in predicting the
position of future cracking of a similar material (e.g. a prediction of an earth
quake), and hence provide increased public safety. Furthermore, the quantities
found in the proposed model of placentas using ramified transportation can
potentially be used as part of diagnostic tools in predicting healthy problem
for newborns with abnormal placentas.
