This award will support student travel to the 28th International Conference on
Computer Aided Verification(CAV). The conference will be held in Toronto, Canada
on July 17-23 2016. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences
and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Verification technology is
being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research as well
as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes
fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as
providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In
particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art
methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior
researchers in their areas of expertise.
