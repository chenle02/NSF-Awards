The 2018 Campus Cyberinfrastructure and Cybersecurity Innovation for
Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the previous Campus
Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all
active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) and Cybersecurity Innovation for
Cyberinfrastructure (CICI) awards to meet in person, exchange project findings,
interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across
project areas and project regions. By again co-locating with the Quilt Fall
Member Meeting, the broader scope encourages relationships between campus
cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications, cybersecurity, and regional
and national cyberinfrastructure resources. Based on last year's experience, we
have updated the meeting schedule to provide additional opportunities for
interaction between PIs themselves as well as between the three groups
participating in the meetings. New to the 2018 PI Workshop is an expanded pre-
workshop set of breakout sessions half-day breakout sessions on topics relevant
to academic research networking challenges facing campuses and CC* and CICI PI
teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the
exchange of project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure
experts, collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead
to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated with an in person
workshop. The half-day cyberinfrastructure engineering session will provide
timely insights into growing practice of cyberinfrastructure facilitation in the
campus environment that can be shared with the co-located meeting attendees as
well as the community in general. The broader impact associated with the
workshop includes the dissemination of workshop information, including the
workshop presentations. By co-locating with the Quilt meeting the workshop
continues to bring together stakeholders with a vested interest in leveraging
campus cyberinfrastructure investments to provide the opportunity to develop
stronger ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications
and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources, leading to a broader
set of collaborations and lasting impact on national campus cyberinfrastructure
and science driven applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
