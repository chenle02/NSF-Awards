9713865 Chandrasekar Based on the results of preliminary experiments on drilling
with low-frequency vibrations, this project will fully explore the underlying
phenomena that occur when vibratory motion is superimposed on drilling. The
effect of this vibratory motion will be explored for hard metallic materials
including hardened steel, stainless steel, and titanium, as well as for soft
materials including aluminum and lead. Experiments will be conducted with drills
having various geometries and made of different materials, and with lubricants
of both oil and water soluble types. The investigation will include torque and
thrust, hole quality, friction at the drill-chip interface, and the
morphological characteristics of the chips produced. The study of vibration
superimposed drilling could generate fundamental knowledge about this process
and lead to substantial improvement in the quality and productivity of drilling.
The research results could also help understand other vibration superimposed
manufacturing processes.
