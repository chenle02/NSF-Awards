The main goal of the research described in this proposal is to investigate the
role of group actions in symplectic geometry and other closely related
geometries. Some of the questions that Tolman and her collaborators plan to
study are closely related to important problems in other fields; they hope that
these projects will not only give insight into symplectic manifolds but also
shed new light on the original problems. For example, R. Goldin and Tolman are
working on extending the results of Schubert calculus to more general symplectic
manifolds. L. Godinho and Tolman are attempting to prove the symplectic analog
of the Petrie conjecture. Other questions that Tolman is working on are designed
to explore the "geography" of symplectic manifolds with group actions by
determining whether such spaces are always as well behaved as the natural
examples which we usually consider. For example, Tolman is considering when
symplectic actions are Hamiltonian, when such manifolds possess the hard
Lefshetz property, and what restrictions their graphs must obey. She and Karshon
are also classifying (n-1)-dimensional Hamiltonian torus actions on
2n-dimensional symplectic manifolds; this will provide a new source of examples.
Many important manifolds arise most naturally as symplectic quotients. While
this fact has been used extremely successfully to compute their rational
cohomology rings, many of the theorems do not hold over the integers. Therefore,
T. Holm and Tolman are studying how to compute the integral cohomology ring of
such quotients. Generalizations of symplectic forms which allow some
degeneration, such as near symplectic forms and folded symplectic forms, have
recently played an important role in the study of four-manifolds. Tolman plans
to work on understanding the role group actions in these geometries. Finally, Y.
Lin and Tolman are using generalized Kaehler reduction to construct new examples
of Bihermitian structures, which play an important role in string theory.

In classical physics, symmetries of a physical system give rise to conserved
quantities.For example, the total angular momentum of the solar system is
constant. From a mathematical perspective, studying these physical systems
corresponds to studying Hamiltonian group actions on a special type of
symplectic manifold - a cotangent bundle. The underlying goal of the proposed
research is to gain a better understanding of what types of symplectic manifolds
admit group actions, and how to calculate their invariants. Working with her
collaborators, Tolman plans to attack this question on a number of fronts. She
hopes that this will lead to a greater understanding of an area of increasing
importance, both within mathematics and for physics.
