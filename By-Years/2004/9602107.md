This project investigates ethical issues arising from the commercial
exploitation of emerging genetic technologies. In the near to far future, it is
likely that a wide range of genetic tests will become available to detect
disease or genetic predisposition or to locate individual position along the
normal range of distribution of various traits. Genetic interventions will
include both direct gene change and the creation of drugs to mimic or change
genetic expression. Commercialization of these technologies will transform the
market. Depending on public policy and personal choices, individuals may be able
to enhance their or their progeny's natural endowments, or to sell copies of
their genes. As this market expands, other social institutions, like families
and educational systems, will feel the effects. The objectives of this project
are (1) to identify the chief ethical issues that will arise as market forces
play an increasing role in the deployment of genetic technologies; and (2) to
formulate the types of ethical considerations that ought to be taken into
account by policy makers in deciding whether or in what ways to regulate the
genetic marketplace. The project methodology is reflective ethical analysis
(REA). REA involves the identification and careful reconstruction of public and
policy debates concerning how individual and social institutions should respond
to these new developments. The ethical principles and factual disputes
underlying these positions are identified. Relevant existing empirical studies
are examined to respond to what may have been taken to be ethical disputes. The
need for additional empirical research is noted. Techniques for balancing
conflicting ethical principles are applied to remaining ethical conflicts. In
cases of intractable disagreements, unacceptable options may still be excluded
and a range of ethically acceptable options may be identified. Research results
will be prepared for publication in at least two primary articles dealing with
the two objectives above. They will meet high standards of scholarship, but they
will also be presented in a form which is accessible to a broad audience of
policy advisors and policy makers. Additional publications targeted at specific
professional and lay audiences will also be prepared.
