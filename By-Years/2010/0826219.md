This research focuses on the development of a simple and inexpensive platform to
pattern soft and hard nanoscale materials over wafer-sized areas. The majority
of this work exploits advances in soft nanolithography and free-floating and
flexible gold masks perforated with nanoholes to pattern chemical, biological,
and inorganic materials at the nanoscale level. These nanomanufacturing methods
can achieve, in parallel, sub-100 nm patterns with sub-100 nm separations over
several square inches. The multi-scale and nanoscale patterns are simply
determined by the master. The outcomes of this new soft nanomanufacturing
platform will drive scientific prospects, such as architectures for multiplexed
chemical and biological sensing and unique hybrid plasmonic nanomaterials for
direct integration with chip-based processing.&lt;br/&gt;The educational and
outreach goals of this work focus on integrating nanofabrication research into
the classroom. Domestically, three efforts will be carried out: (1) research-
based courses on nanopatterning for freshmen and sophomores sponsored by an NSF-
Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education award (lab modules for the experiments
at http://www.nanoed.org/courses/nano_experiments_menu.html); (2) contributing
content to a self-assembly/nanopatterning working group as part of the NSF-
National Center for Learning and Teaching in Nanoscale Science and Engineering;
and (3) delivery of public lectures on nanotechnology that also involve live
demonstrations. Internationally, the leading of hands-on nanotechnology
workshops such as the one at the African Materials Research Society (2007) will
continue. Here, professors and students were taught benchtop nanopatterning
experiments based on CDs and soft lithography.
