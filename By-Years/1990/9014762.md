This award supports one conference in a series that has alternated between the
east and west coasts for more than a decade. The conference is intended to
publicize innovative, interdisciplinary research with a strong VLSI component.
This year's focus is on systems integration. The National Science Foundation
support allows reduced registration rates for students, government and
university employees, and program committee members, and travel and registration
expenses for the invited speakers.
