With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Jerry L. Atwood, of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri - Columbia, carries
out the synthesis of host compounds designed to bind anions and to complex
fullerenes. Studies of calix(4)arenes, calix(5)arenes, and cyclotriveratrylenes
which have been metallated on the outer pi faces contribute to a fundamental
understanding of the factors influencing the binding of anions. Development of
metallated deep cavity analogs, which are constructed by versatile self-assembly
processes, affords enhanced anion binding agents. Synthesis of calixarene and
cyclotriveratrylene hosts designed to match the size, shape, and electrostatic
requirements of specific fullerenes offer the opportunity to devise fullerene-
selective complexing agents. Recent years have seen rapid growth in studies of
the ways in which neutral molecules and positively-charged ions may be
specifically recognized and bound by molecules designed for this purpose. Such
studies have had a wide range of implications, including advances in
understanding of critical molecule-molecule and molecule-ion interactions in
biological systems as well as development of practical methods for the
separation and purification of materials. Corresponding developments for the
binding of negatively-charged ions, in contrast, have been comparatively slow to
appear. Professor Jerry L. Atwood, of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Missouri - Columbia, with the support of the Organic Dynamics
Program, synthesizes organic molecules designed to recognize and bind anions
through a combination of specific chemical interactions. Related systems offer
the opportunity to effect analogous recognition of various fullerenes
(`Buckyballs`), providing further insights into the nature of molecule-molecule
interaction as well as techniques for the separation and purification of various
members of the fullerene family.
