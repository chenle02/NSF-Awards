Abstract ATM-9613776 Wang, Bin University of Hawaii Title: Dynamics of the
Coupled Warm Pool System and ENSO Development This study is aimed at
understanding the coupling processes between the atmosphere and the ocean over
the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP). The focus is on the Intra-Seasonal
Oscillation (ISO) in the Pacific which might be effecting the climate over
longtime scales. The study will synthesize and utilize TC data to develop both
conceptual and process models suitable for describing the essential physics of
the warm pool system and to understand the multiple interaction that extends the
influence of the warm pool system to other regions and vice versa. This research
is important because it seeks to improve our capacity to make useful prediction
of seasonal to interannual climate variations.
