The initial stage of the design process, when a designer first starts to
generate ideas, is not well understood. Often referred to as conceptual design,
during this stage the designer generates a multiplicity of designs and
variations on designs, most of which are never verbalized or formalized. This
phase of design will be investigated by studying the knowledge procesess and
heuristics that form its components. The method will be to present selected
mechanical design problems to experienced designers and to novice designers. By
analyzing the processes used by experienced and novice designers, the
investigators will determine which of the functional aspects are part of the
inherent knowledge base and which are acquired through training and experience
in design. The design language and its perceptual connotations will also be
studied.
