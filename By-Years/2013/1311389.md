How birds evolved their staggering ecological diversity, from vampire finches
that drink blood to storm petrels that eat plankton, remains an unanswered
question. Bird skeletons are infrequently preserved in the fossil record; when
they are, it remains difficult to infer the habits of extinct species in ancient
ecosystems. In this doctoral dissertation project, investigators will infer the
diet and habitat preferences of extinct birds by comparing the morphology of
their wings, legs, and beaks to that of modern birds. These inferences will be
further tested in selected species by comparing the predictions made from
morphology with the preserved gut contents of fossil specimens. The most diverse
fossil bird assemblages are found in 125 million-year-old deposits in China and
50 million-year-old deposits in North America and Germany. By comparing the
suite of ecological traits seen in birds from each of these ancient deposits
with the suite seen in these localities today and in the recent past, (&lt;1
million years ago), the researchers will develop a more complete understanding
of how environmental change has contributed to global bird diversity through the
processes of diversification and extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biodiversity
is threatened by increasing rates of species' extinctions. Results from this
study will link past environmental change with extinction, contributing valuable
historical information to improve predictions of future extinction rates.
Fossils are also one of the best ways to get students and the public interested
in science. The investigators participate in several educational programs at the
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, leading 'behind the scenes' tours of
fossil collections and developing professional training programs in geology and
earth history for elementary school teachers. Undergraduate and high school
students will participate in this project with data collection and analysis.
