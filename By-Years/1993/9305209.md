The wing of Drosophila is a relatively simple but highly ordered tissue. It
contains a limited number of histologically identifiable cell types arranged
into a precise pattern of structures. The decision to form a particular cell
type is made for the most part during the latter stages of the growth of the
wing imaginal disc and Dr. Blair is examining the mechanisms underlying these
events. He here proposes to look at the problem of patterned formation of wing
veins. The specific aims are as follows: 1) To isolate and characterize cell-
specific vein markers which will allow him to follow the process of vein
formation in detail; screening known genes as well as new enhancer trap lines,
has already led to the isolation of markers which are specific for preveins,
mature veins, and the posterior cross vein, 2) To use these markers to follow
the effects of different classes of venation mutations during development. Newly
developed techniques will allow an investigation of the effects of both viable
and embryonic lethal mutations and future studies will also make use of
techniques for the localized over expression of genes. The purpose of these
studies is to identify critical steps in the venation process and the genes
required for each. Also addressed will be issues of cell autonomy of such
mutations and the roles played by genes during the cell- cell interactions
critical to the patterning process, 3) To initiate the genetic and molecular
characterization of novel and previously characterized vein-pattern genes, and
4) To perform surgical manipulations to the disc in order to better understand
the cell-cell interactions required for vein patterning.
