This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
highly sensitive and selective label-free biochip assay for rapid detection of
botulinum toxins. The proposed method uses surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR)
technology incorporating peptide cleavage at the surface of the SPR waveguide.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the
area of botulinum toxin detection in food, biological samples and the
environment.&lt;br/&gt;
