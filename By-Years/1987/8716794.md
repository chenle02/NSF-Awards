This action will provide funds for two faculty, two research associates and
four to five students to continue their research in elementary particle physics
with accelerator facilities at Fermilab. 1. A continuation of a series of
experiments ıE594 and E733! to investigate neutrino interactions. The goals
include measurement of a basic parameter in the theory of electro-weak
interactions ıthe Weinberg angle! and a detailed understanding of the weak
interaction involving no change in electric charge ıneutral currents, in
particular the measurement of weak neutral current structure functions!. 2.
Collaboration in the fabrication and preliminary operation of the D0 detector
(E740) to be used at the world's highest energy colliding beam facility. About
150 physicists are involved in this project, the principal responsibility of the
Michigan State group is the design and fabrication of a fast trigger system
capable of selecting the events for detailed analysis from the many less
interesting events. The scientific interest is to make detailed and precise
tests of the model of electro-weak interactions known as "the standard model".
The standard model accurately describes the electro- weak interactions observed
to date but is known to have validity limited to the energies below a few
hundred TeV. The D0 experiment will probe the standard model at energies higher
than available in the past.
