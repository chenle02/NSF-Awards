9311474 Akasofu Substorm studies would significant by advance if we could
identify the directly driven component and the unloading component and how they
vary as a function of time during a substorm. Unfortunately, the present
accuracy of substorm and storm indices, such as AE, Dst and Ut, is not
sufficient for such proposes; in particular in advancing a study of the
relationship between the energy dissipated in the magnetosphere with solar wind
and IMF parameters, such as V, Bz, , etc. It is proposed to examine: (i) whether
"void regions" in DMSP particle data can be regarded as a "working definition"
of open field line regions in the polar cap and (ii) if so, changes of the size
of the void region during many substorms could indicate changes of the open
flux, on the basis of simultaneous DMSP electron data together with the IMF Bz,
AE, Dst, , etc. If the "working definition" of the open field line region could
be confirmed, the size of the open field line region is a relatively simple
geometrical quantity, but yet a measure of the flux of the open field lines and
of magnetic energy in the tail lobe. A comparison of the flux with IMF and
magnetospheric parameters is expected to provide important insights into
substorm processes. ***
