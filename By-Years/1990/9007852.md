Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Delaware acquire a Single Crystal X-ray
Diffraction System. Among the areas of chemical reserach that will be enhanced
by the acquisition are the following: 1. Arsenic and Antimony-Based Clusters of
the Early Transition Metal Elements 2. New Metal Complexes of Energetic
Ambidentate Ligands 3. Binuclear Transition Metal Complexes 4. Coordination
Chemistry of Ambidentate Ligands 5. Preparation of Novel Pyrazolo-fused
Heterocycles 6. High-Tc Superconductivity/Structure Relationships in Perovskite-
Related Oxides of Nickel
