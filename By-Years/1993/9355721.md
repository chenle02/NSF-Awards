9355721 Braile This four year project serves ninety earth science teachers from
six midwestern states. Each year thirty teachers will attend 4- week intensive
summer workshops, 2-weekend workshops during the academic year, and a 1-day
workshop at a national NSTA meeting. The enhancement activities include:
improving their content knowledge of current concepts and application of earth
processes; introducing skills through modern technology using computers; taking
an extended field trip in the midwest region; and practicing presentations and
other hands-on experiences. The program takes place in two parts with the summer
teacher enhancement workshops occurring during years 1, 2 and 3 while the
academic year follow-up occurs in years 2, 3 and 4. The central content theme of
Earth processes is complemented by activities which will prepare teachers to
disseminate their understanding of earth processes through the use of materials,
activities, and modeling teaching skills at local inservice workshops and
regional and national presentations. Participants will be required to conduct at
least one inservice workshop for their peers. This will be facilitated by
providing them with guided grant writing experiences. Participants may earn six
semester hours of course credit: 3-semester hours in the Department of Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences and 3-semester hours in the Department of Curriculum and
Instruction, all at Purdue University.
