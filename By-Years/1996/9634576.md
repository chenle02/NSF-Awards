The foci of this research are twofold. The experimental projects will focus on
the investigating the physical and chemical properties of pyramidalized alkenes,
obtaining photodetachment spectra of the radical anions of several of these
molecules and of the radical anion of cyclobutadiene, and attempting to observe
a derivative of cyclopentane-2-one-1,3-diyl in matrix isolation. The
computational research will include studies of stereomutations of cyclopropane
and geminally disubstituted derivatives, potential surfaces for several other
types of organic reactions, geometries of and energy differences between
electronic states of both di- and triradicals, substituent and solvent effects
on C-H and O-H bond dissociation energies, strain in paddlanes and the
differences between the chemistry of phenylnitrene and phenylcarbene. With this
accomplishment based renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Washington. Professor Borden will focus his work on the study of
highly strained organic molecules. The combination of both experimental and
theoretical methodology can offer new insights to the types of bonding that
carbon can undergo.
