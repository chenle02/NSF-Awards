Burrell, Brian&lt;br/&gt;0213458&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensitization is a simple
form of learning in which an animal's responses to environmental stimuli are
enhanced. This form of behavioral plasticity is important because it contributes
to processes of attention and arousal, as well as to more complex forms of
learning such as classical (i.e. Pavlovian) conditioning. Typically,
sensitization is induced by the delivery of a particularly strong or salient
stimulus. This stimulus activates neurons that release modulatory
neurotranmitters, which alter the neural circuit mediating the test behavior.
Because the modulatory neurons are distinct from the neurons that mediate the
test behavior, this process is referred to as extrinsic sensitization. However,
there are many examples where sensitization is induced by a stimulus that is
similar or identical to the stimulus that elicits the test behavior. In such
situations, modulatory neurotransmitters are released by neurons within the
circuit that mediates the test behavior. This is referred to as intrinsic or
wind-up sensitization. &lt;br/&gt;Using the medicinal leech, the distinct
physiological and cellular mechanisms of intrinsic and extrinsic sensitization
will be examined. These experiments will combine electrophysiological recordings
from single neurons with simultaneous monitoring of sensitization-induced
changes in a defensive withdrawal reflex (shortening). Both forms of
sensitization are observed in the leech shortening reflex and the leech nervous
system is extremely well characterized, making it possible to record from
single, identifiable neurons that are known to mediate this behavior.
