This award is for support of a two year study to measure cosmic ray produced
nuclides to obtain surface exposure ages of glacial moraines. The goal of the
research is to use this technique to constrain the chronology of Antarctic
glaciations. One of the priorities will be to obtain new dates for the Late
Wisconsin Ross Sea Drift. Helium-3, Beryllium-10, and Aluminum-26 will be
measured together whenever possible but there will be an emphasis on Helium-3
measurements in the younger rocks.
