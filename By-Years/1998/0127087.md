Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to make the
physiology student laboratories at Truman State University more investigative.
The main obstacle in transforming our laboratories from traditional formulative
exercises into student-driven investigations lies in our data handling
capabilities. The stand-alone instruments we had been using require manual
adjustments for which no record is generated, which made it difficult to compare
data from different instruments or work sessions. In addition, the data records
consisted of extensive collections of strip charts. There was no efficient
method for sharing these records within a work group. Worse yet, this form of
record did not facilitate in-depth analysis, comparisons, and contrasts;
quantitative evaluations could only be made after painstaking hands-on
measurement of each bit of pertinent record. This project is upgrading the
technology of our physiology labs with the aim of improving our data collection
and interpretation capabilities by providing instruments which allow
computerized data acquisition and analysis. It is an adaptation of models
introduced by the University of Central Florida, Harvey Mudd College, California
State University at Hayward, and Cornell University, with NSF support. The
expected outcomes of this project are: 1) students able to design and carry out
procedures which allow them to answer specific physiological questions; 2) the
ability to highlight the relationships between procedures, data, and the
interpretation of data so that students have a better understanding of how "real
science" works; and 3) giving the students an opportunity to compare and
contrast results from related procedures and draw conclusions
therefrom.&lt;br/&gt;
