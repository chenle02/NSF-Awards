High-resolution and high-sensitivity microwave sky surveys are just beginning,
from experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South
Pole Telescope (SPT). They will detect thousands of galaxy clusters through the
spectral distortion of the microwave background radiation known as the Sunyaev-
Zeldovich Effect (SZE). These experiments have the remarkable potential to
measure galaxy cluster velocities using a small signal known as the kinetic SZE
(kSZ), which would be the first direct determination of velocities for objects
at cosmological distances. The cosmic velocity field is a powerful probe of
structure growth, since velocities are the direct result of gravitational
instability. Early studies were generally inconclusive because of large
systematic errors. This project is a comprehensive theoretical,
phenomenological, and observational study of galaxy cluster velocities,
including (1) characterization of the cosmological information; (2) statistical
methods for extracting it; (3) calculating the impact of systematic errors; (4)
improved calculations of model predictions for the cluster velocity and momentum
statistics; (5) studying the accuracy with which cluster velocities and momenta
may be extracted from observations in different wave bands; and (6) cluster
peculiar velocities and momenta from the ACT experiment. This newly accessible
source of cosmological information is a novel probe of the formation of
structure in the Universe, providing independent tests of the standard model in
cosmology and better determining several fundamental
parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes educational initiatives at
a range of levels, including mentoring of a graduate student; involving
undergraduates in the research effort; and secondary education and public
outreach efforts in cooperation with the Allegheny Observatory.
