This proposal consist of two parts. The first part aims to complete the analysis
of genus one curves that Ciperiani has already started in collaboration with A.
Wiles. They hope to show that every genus one curve defined over Q has a point
defined over some solvable extension of Q. The subject of the second part of
this proposal concerns the structure of the p-primary part of Selmer groups and
Tate-Shafarevic groups over Z_p-extensions of an imaginary quadratic extension
of Q for primes p of good reduction.

Ciperiani's research is in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry. This
subject combines techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. On the one
hand, algebraic geometry started by analyzing figures that could be defined in
the plane by polynomials. On the other hand, number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. Independently of these differences, these
two subjects have always influenced each other.
