Research will be carried out along three separate lines: 1. Previous work has
shown that the physical state of the amorphous domains of semicrystalline
polymers is widely misunderstood. The principal investigator was able to show
that these domains have the state of a deformed rubber. It is proposed to
further develop these arguments, and to attempt to predict the amorphous domain
thickness and the mechanical properties of these systems. 2. The structure
factors of certain models of semicrystalline polymer chains can be calculated
exactly. The results will be compared with experiment. 3. Techniques will be
studied for the computer simulation of the free energy and entropy of dense
lattice polymer systems. Such properties cannot be obtained as trivially as
those that are defined as ensemble averages of microscopic properties. The
technique will then be applied to a number of interesting problems in polymer
science, such as blends, amorphous domains, and random copolymers.
