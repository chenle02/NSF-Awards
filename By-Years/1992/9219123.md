R1 and R2 are sequence-specific retrotransposable elements found inserted in a
fraction of the 28S ribosomal RNA genes of most arthropods. The objective of
this proposal is to determine whether the remarkable success of these elements
is due to their freedom to move from species to species or their ability to
remain active in a species lineage over long evolutionary periods. Most
experiments will focus on the sequence relationships of R1 and R2 isolated from
species of the dipteran genus Drosophila. The 3' half of the elements will be
cloned after the polymerase chain reaction amplification and their nucleotide
sequences determined. This sequence analysis will be complemented with studies
of the distribution of R1 and R2 within different geographical strains of
several species using genomic DNA blotting procedures. Experiments will also be
conducted with three species of parasitic wasp (genus Nasonia) which contain
multiple families of highly divergent R1 elements. %%% The proposed experiments
will provide information that is fundamental to an understanding of the
stability of mobile elements within genomes, their ability to transfer between
species, and their ability to regulate their own abundance.
