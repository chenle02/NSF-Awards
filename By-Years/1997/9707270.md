9707270 LiWang This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
Engineers. Dr. LiWang will study the interactions involved in dimer formation of
representative members of the chemokine family of proteins, using a combination
of biochemical methods and NMR spectroscopy. This family has unique structural
properties that allow a detailed assessment of important amino acid interactions
in the formation of quaternary structure. Chemokines have been divided into two
subfamilies, characterized by the ability to form different dimer structures
despite having similar monomeric subunits. A structural investigation of a
chemokine dimer will therefore lead to an understanding of the interactions that
form the structure of these proteins themselves, and shed light on the protein-
protein interactions that are responsible for dimer formation and stabilization
in general. ***
