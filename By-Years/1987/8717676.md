Observations of neutron and gamma-ray-line emission from solar flares are
providing important new information on particle acceleration in solar flares and
on the flare process itself. These gamma-rays and neutrons are produced directly
by nuclear interactions of the flare-accelerated protons and heavier ions with
ambient gas in the solar atmosphere. Thus they yield the most direct information
available on the total number, energy spectrum, time dependence, and angular
distribution of the accelerated ions in the flare region, and they can provide
unique new information on both the scale height and the 3He/H ratio in the solar
photosphere. Gamma ray line emission was first observed in 1973 and relativistic
neutrons were observed in 1983. These observations have stimulated much more
extensive theoretical calculations of gamma-ray line and neutron production by
flare particle interactions and comparison of the flare observations with these
calculations have provided much important new information. This grant will
pursue these general theoretical objectives. In particular, the PI will
calculate the gamma ray line emission with a view to determining the time
dependence of particle acceleration in flares. All of this is with a view to
comparing theory with observations in order to narrow the field of candidate
models of solar flares.
