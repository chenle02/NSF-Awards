9711710 Curry Funds are provided for the support of core and rock sample
repository at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that is maintained for the
benefit of marine geological community at large. The prime criteria for
continued funding of these facilities remain the extent and quality of service
provided by the repository to the community, the extent and types of studies
supported by the core and rock samples and steps taken by the institutions to
maintain and archive the materials in pristine condition for future use. Funds
will support the Woods Hole facility for three years and allow it to provide
continued service to the marine geoscience community.
