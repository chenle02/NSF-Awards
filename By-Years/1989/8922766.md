The role of microwave spectroscopy in the elucidation of the quantitative
structure (nuclear geometry) and other fundamental properties (electric dipole
moments, quadrupole coupling constants, potential energy surfaces, etc) of
molecules is well established. A significant advantage of microwave spectroscopy
is that it is much more amenable to the study of unstable and transient
molecules than are experimental techniques such as gas electron diffraction and
X-ray crystallography. Thus, microwave sepctroscopy plays an important and often
essential role in the understanding of molecular structure and molecular
electronic properties. This award to the Chemistry Department of the University
of Kansas will help purchase instrumentation that will upgrade the microwave
spectrometer. The microwave spectrometer will be used in the following areas of
research: 1. Determination of near-equilibrium structures 2. Microwave
Spectroscopy of Oxiranones 3. Microwave Spectroscopy of
Difluormethylenecyclopropanes (enes).
