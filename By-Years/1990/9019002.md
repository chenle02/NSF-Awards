This award provides 43% funding for the acquisition of a laser Raman microprobe
system with multichannel detection capabilities. The system is to be installed
in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University.
Washington University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The
Raman spectroscopy facility will assist projects such as the investigation of
diffusion of gas from natural gas-fluid inclusion in minerals and the role of
carbon (graphite or diamond) in mineral inclusions, and will be accessible to
researchers in other departments and to off-campus users.
