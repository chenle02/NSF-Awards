The major objectives of this program are to introduce modern instruments to
improve undergraduate instruction and to interface computers with scientific
instrumentation for design and measurements. Modern solid-state sources,
frequency sweepers and amplifiers will be used to replace the obsolete and
unreliable vacuum tubes. Equipment with digital input/output will be used to
interface with the micro- computers and computer-aided design (CAD) and
computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) techniques will be emphasized in circuit and
device design. Circuit testing will be done by automatic measurement methods
which will be introduced for accurate and fast data acquisition. The recent
advances of microstrip integrated circuits and solid-state devices will be
emphasized. To accomplish the goal of educating future engineers with
fundamental and modern knowledge, microwave integrated circuit workstation
equipment is needed. This equipment consists of 5 circuit design stations, 1
circuit fabrication station, 2 circuit assembly stations, 1 antenna test
station, and 5 circuit test stations. The five circuit test stations and the
antenna test station will also be used to conduct experiments for other
conventional waveguide and coaxial components. The experiments and projects are
designed to prepare the students by providing them with a modern working
knowledge of the equipment and design methods used in the microwave, antennas,
electromagnetics, optics and high frequency solid-state device areas.
