This project has the goal of improving understanding of the basic dynamical
processes that drive tropical/extratropical interaction on the intraseasonal
time by performing both idealized numerical model experiments and diagnostic
analyses. Enhanced understanding of tropical/extratropical interaction is
crucial for improving medium range (1-4 week) weather forecasts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies have shown that different phases of an
active tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) are followed 1-4 weeks later by
the excitation of the dominant Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (both
the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Pacific/North American patterns), and
coincide with large changes in the frequency of occurrence of these
teleconnection patterns. It has been found that probabilistic weather forecasts
based on both MJO and El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation phases outperform state-of-
the-art numerical weather prediction models for North America with lead times of
2 to 4 weeks. Changes to Arctic surface air temperature have even been observed
following an active MJO.
