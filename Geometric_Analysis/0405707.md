Abstract

Award: DMS-0405707 Principal Investigator: Erwin Lutwak, Deane Yang, Gaoyong

This project continues a long term program to develop extensions and duals of
the Brunn-Minkowski theory, which lies at the very core of convex geometric
analysis. This includes ongoing investigations of the partial differential
equations that arise in these extensions. Generalizations of affine functionals
associated with convex bodies are another central focus of the proposed work. A
large part of the project concerns establishing sharp affine isoperimetric
isoperimetric inequalities and related analytic inequalities. The investigators
will also continue their efforts to understand better the connections between
affine convex geometric analysis and information theory.

This project has potential for broader impact in many areas of science and
engineering, because it deals with when and how can one reconstruct or
approximate a geometric object from a limited number of geometric measurements.
This is the central question in many practical endeavors ranging from computer
vision to medical imaging. Some of the questions being studied by the
investigators are sufficiently concrete that they can be explained to and
investigated by graduate, undergraduate, and even high school students.
