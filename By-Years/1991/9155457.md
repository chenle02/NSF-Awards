Interface Institute has proposed the expansion and development of a project,
begun with the support of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, which targets
Black and Hispanic middle school/junior high school teachers and youth in the
Elmhurst District of East Oakland, California. Activities to occur with National
Science Foundation support include: (1) expansion of the network of scientists
and corporate representatives working directly with teachers and students
through classroom visits, field trips, job shadowing and mentoring; (2) design
and distribution of "hands-on" materials, activities, and demonstrations to
enhance the California State Science Framework (CSSF) curriculum; (3)
involvement of increasing numbers of students in after-school programs at the
Interface Institute which support classroom worked based on the CSSF.
