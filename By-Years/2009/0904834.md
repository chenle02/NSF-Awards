This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on implementing
novel methods for uncertainty quantification in the context of modeling carbon
sequestration. Significant advances in both the basic methodology and
computational implementation are proposed. Advances in numerical methodology and
computational implementation are planned to result in a tool that will be very
effective at the petascale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a
significant impact on a problem of great importance to society. The project will
also integrate research and education.
