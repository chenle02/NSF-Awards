The objective of the proposed research is to understand the dynamics of the
magnetosphere. Magnetospheric physics is at a critical juncture; research to be
carried out in the next few years should lay bared the dominant mechanisms for
coupling the ionized upper atmosphere to the solar wind on time scale as short
as a few minutes. The science involved concerns more than the geophysical
questions to be answered; the behavior of a cosmical plasma system is being
investigated. Other less accessible examples of such systems are pulsars, radio
galaxies and the solar atmosphere. The Investigators have a long term program of
investigation of the magnetohydrodynamic processes that couple energy, momentum,
and mass from the solar wind into the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper
atmosphere. Towards this objective, both students and P.I.s will undertake a mix
of theory, data analysis, and interpretation of computer simulations. In
addition to contributing to understanding the fundamental processes that govern
the magnetosphere, the work will be useful in such applications as monitoring
and predicting naturally occuring hazards to earth orbiting spacecraft.
