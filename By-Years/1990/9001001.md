The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important tool available to
organic and inorganic chemists for structure determination, and it is becoming a
significantly useful technique for analytical chemists and biochemists. This
award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at University of the Pacific acquire a high field NMR Spectrometer.
The NMR Spectrometer will be used in the following research topics: 1. NMR
Studies of DNA-Polyamine and DNA-Histone Interactions 2. Synthesis and
Characterization of Macrocyclic Multinuclear Systems 3. Reactions of
Phosphoranyl Radicals with Unsaturated Disulfides 4. Synthetic and
Conformational studies of Nitrogen Containing Carbohydrates 5. Synthesis of
Inhibitors of Enzymes with Acetylated and Deacetylated Polyamines
