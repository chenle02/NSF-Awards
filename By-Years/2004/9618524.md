Lamb, Frederick AST 96-18524 Drs. Lamb, Pethick, and Shapiro will carry out a
diverse research program that addresses a wide variety of projects within a
common theme of understanding the physics of compact objects. In particular
their work will involve the exploration of the properties of matter under
extreme conditions and strong-field gravitation. Among the projects the
investigators will address are studies of superfluidity in nuclear and neutron-
star matter, properties of matter in the inner crusts of neutron stars, disk
accretion in a variety of contexts, stellar dynamics in disks, in non-spherical
clusters, and in binary systems composed of neutron stars, supernovae collapse,
and massive black holes in the context of active galactic nuclei. The PIs will
use both large-scale computations and analytic modeling to carry out their
theoretical investigations. ***
