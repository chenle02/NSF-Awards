Continuous sections of uppermost ocean crust produced at the East Pacific Rise,
including the pillow-sheeted dike and dike-gabbro transitions, have been exposed
by rifting in the Hess Deep were explored and sampled during 11 dives of ALVIN
in 1990. Over 200 rock samples recovered in 9 dredge hauls. The preliminary
studies will be extended by obtaining a comprehensive suite of major-oxide,
trace-element, and mineral data using the new ICP-MS at Scripps Institution of
Oceanography.
