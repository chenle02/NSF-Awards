Understanding bat biosonar performance using the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound and
adaptive beamforming

This proposal will test the series of hypotheses that bats use adaptive
beamforming for echolocation and that this adaptive beam provides more tracking
information than a stationary transmit beam. The project will use a combination
of biological, behavioral, acoustic, engineering, signal processing and
statistical techniques as well as new acoustic technology and a creative
mathematical approach to investigate adaptive beamforming in the big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus). A high-resolution, multi-element microphone array will
measure the echolocation beam from both stationary and flying bats and the
Cramér-Rao Lower Bound will be used to determine the tracking accuracy for
static and adaptive transmit beams.

As part of the project, the postdoctoral fellow will create a bioacoustic
curriculum on the biological, physiological, and ecological characteristics of
bats that includes acoustic files and spectrograms and students will be
encouraged via inquiry-based approaches to create bioacoustic experiments and
mathematically interpret their results. The curriculum, alone with outreach
components, will be implemented at high schools across Rhode Island to foster an
understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of science and encourage student
excitement and engagement about biology, mathematics, and the physical sciences.
