Objective:

This exploratory effort will investigate the use of incorporating C60 fullerene
thin films within micro and nano systems.

Intellectual Merit:

The C60 electrical insulating property, combined with its high internal
mechanical loss and low-acoustic impedance, would enable coupled resonator
arrays where coupling and isolation needs to be spatially modulated with large
ratios, without using free-space between resonators. Additionally, C60 has
ultralow surface energy and friction, which can be utilized for stiction
prevention, and precursors for on-chip carbon nanotube fabrication. Fullerene
structures made at the nanoscale, where the number (and size) of molecules can
vary, might provide a new set of nonlinear and controllable material properties
useful for realizing memory, analog signal processing, and RF signal modulation
techniques within micro and nano electromechanical systems.

Broader Impact:

This effort on fullerenes as a structural material in microsystems will yield
new knowledge on material properties and processing technologies of fullerene
thin films. This knowledge will have broad application in the device community
in addition to scientists who wish to use the methods developed to study
material properties of other materials that can be mechanically and electrically
linked to free-standing fullerene structures. The knowledge of fullerenes as an
engineering material will further catalyze the introduction of educational
material related to van der Waals-forces at the micro and nano scale into the
engineering and science curriculum.
