This project will continue studying the geologic history of West Antarctica and
the reltionship of West to East Antarctica by collecting paleomagnetic samples
from Mesozoic age Antarctic Peninsula rocks. Resolving the position of the
different West Antarctic crustal blocks is critical in understanding the opening
history of the Weddell Sea and the resulting paleo.climatic, paleo.oceanographic
and paleo.biologic implications of the Weddell Sea opening. It is hoped that by
systematically collecting paleomagnetic samples ranging in age from the Triassic
through Late Cretaceous that a more complete apparent polar wander path can be
constructed for the Antarctic Peninsula. Such a polar wander path can help
constrain the position of the Antarctic Peninsula with respect to East
Antarctica and provide information on the time of opening of the Weddell Sea.
The field program depends on the close support from the R/V Polar Duke to
collect paleomagnetic samples from sedimentary, volcanic and instrusive rocks
from the Antarctic Peninsula.//
