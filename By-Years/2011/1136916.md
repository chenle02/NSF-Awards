This engineering education research initiation grant will help universities
understand the effectiveness of outreach programs on engineering and faculty.
Since outreach programs are common at many universities, there potential to
utilize these programs for informal education of current engineering students.
This project will research how to use these programs for both outreach and to
support learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance
of this project will be to inform other university outreach programs how to be
more efficient. The PI's plan to actively disseminate their findings to a broad
community, thus potentially impacting recruitment and retention of a large
number of students currently under-represented in engineering degree programs.
This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
