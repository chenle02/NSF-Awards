Most mammals are promiscuous, only a few species forming monogamous pair bonds,
but in birds monogamy is by far the commonest pattern. Natural selection favors
individuals that reproduce most rapidly and efficiently and, especially for
males, monogamy places great restrictions on the numbers of offspring that can
be produced in an individual's lifetime. Therefore, to understand why monogamy
is so common in birds, the costs and benefits of this mating system to males and
females must be investigated. Although monogamy is generally considered to be
the typical mating system of waterfowl, recent studies have shown that
variations on strict monogamy can occur in these birds. In some species of
ducks, paired males court and copulate with females other than their mates, and
some males are able to hold two mates simultaneously. In species where males
help their mates protect the ducklings, such bigamous behavior leads to complex
conflicts of interests among the members of breeding trios. Dr. McKinney will
investigate how such relationships are formed, and how they affect the
reproductive success of the males and females concerned, in the South American
speckled teal. Dr. McKinney has studied this species in captivity for several
years, and it is ideally suited for detailed analysis because males are variable
in their contributions to parental care. A combination of field and aviary
techniques will be needed. Therefore, individually marked birds will be studied
in Argentina and Peru to complement intensive long-term monitoring of
relationships among the birds in a captive flock. Dr. McKinney's careful
combination of captive and field studies will provide insights into both the
proximate mechanisms and the functional significance of departures from strict
monogamy, and thus will contribute a great deal to our understanding of complex
social systems in general.
