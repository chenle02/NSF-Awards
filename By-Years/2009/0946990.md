With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors John F.
Hershberger, Gregory R. Cook, Sivaguru Jayaraman, Seth C. Rasmussen and Wenfang
Sun from North Dakota State University Fargo will acquire a single crystal X-ray
diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such
as: 1) photochemical reactivity of photoactive chromophores; 2) study of
conjugated organic materials for applications in photovoltaics; 3)
characterization of synthetic chiral amines and chiral building blocks; 4) study
of the role of transition metal ions in protein and enzyme function; 5) study of
square planar platinum compounds for energy conversion and chemical sensing;
and, 6) development of homogeneous catalysis for decarboxylative
transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.
