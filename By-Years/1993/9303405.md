The objectives of this project are investigation of chaotic or unpredictable
behavior in manufacturing systems and development of methods for controlling
variations in system performance due to nonlinear interactions. The novel
approach identifies if a manufacturing systems is under control and prescribes
control actions for systems not under control. Experimental evidence of chaotic
or unpredictable behavior in manufacturing systems for certain scheduling rules
is presented, and the transition in system behavior, from chaotic to periodic,
due to change in scheduling disciplines is explained using theoretical results.
Other system parameters influencing predictability of system performance are
identified. Improvements in classical system performance measures, such as
sojourn times, throughput rate, conformance to due dates, due to enhanced
predictability are measured. Control schemes for manufacturing systems are
presented that do not require explicit analytical models of the system. The
research opens new directions for analyzing and controlling manufacturing
systems, or in general any complicated system. The research is essential for
developing an understanding of dynamic behavior of integrated manufacturing
systems.
