ABSTRACT ATM -9712057 Dirmeyer, Paul A. Institute of Global Environment &
Society, Inc. TITLE: Integrating Climate, Hydrologic, and Decision Support
Models for Regional Assessment. The idea of the proposal is to develop an
integrated assessment capability based on component models. For this it is
proposed to improve current climate, hydrologic and assessment models and to
develop effective mechanisms for coupling these models in order to produce
increasingly detailed projections of regional climate changes in climate and
hydrological conditions which in turn are used to provide more realistic
assessment of the consequences of resulting changes in water availability for
key sectors. This system will be tested over the Ganges-Brahmaputra valley. This
research fits into the goals of MMIA very well and if successful will help
mitigating the detrimental effects of climate change.
