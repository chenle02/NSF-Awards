This project is to add a 20" x 28" throat, open cycle wind tunnel and sting
balance to the mechanical and civil engineering laboratory. The new tunnel will
support a variety of experiments in convective heat transfer that are not
supportable with the existing closed cycle tunnel. In addition, the increased
size and speed will provide access to high Reynolds number regimes where the
characteristic differences between laminar and turbulent boundary layers can be
elucidated. Besides strengthening the existing laboratory course, the department
plans to introduce a new course in the area of applied fluid dynamics which will
be supported by the new machine.
