CTS-9510190 Pethica Columbia Univ. The potential of using cyclic lactams for
separation of organics from aqueous solutions will be investigated. Preliminary
data indicate that cyclic lactams from micelles, exhibit a lower consulate
temperature (LCT) with water, and have substantial capacity to solubilize
aromatics such as pyrene. The phase diagrams of alkyl-N-pyrrolidinone/water and
partition coefficients will be measured for selected solutes. Similar studies
will also focus on a liquid alkene-grafted polyvinyl pyrrolidinone that is
water-insoluble and has low interfacial tension. Extraction of the solutes will
be performed by changing temperature or by using mechanical dispersion of the
liquid polymers followed by centrifugation. The research may lead to the
development of low-toxicity, biodegradable and non-volatile solvents for the
recovery of biochemical from fermentation broths and the removal of
environmentally undesirable chemicals from aqueous solutions.
