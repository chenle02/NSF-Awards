The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a carbon-fiber composite 3D printing process that produces high-
strength, lightweight components. While 3D printing with plastics has existed
mostly as a prototyping tool thus far, its use can be expanded to enable on-
demand manufacturing and custom industrial lightweight structures. The proposed
technology will address limitations of current polymer 3D printing processes
(extremely slow speed, poor mechanical properties, high material costs) to
improve manufacturing economics; it can be used for industrial-grade machines
and hobbyists alike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of an axial lattice extrusion (ALE) 3D printing technology.
Conventional 3D printing processes make parts by repeatedly printing one planar
layer of material on top of another. For production of high-strength,
lightweight engineered cellular structures, the conventional 3D printing
approach is extremely inefficient (slow) and produces very weak structures. In
contrast, the ALE process allows fabrication of high-strength, lightweight-
engineered lattice structures using non-planar 3D toolpaths. This is made
possible using a combination of computational geometry, digital process controls
with selective material cooling, and advanced materials. This enables parts to
be made in a fraction of the time needed with conventional 3D printing while
using up to 50% less material. This lowers costs while maintaining strength for
end-use applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
