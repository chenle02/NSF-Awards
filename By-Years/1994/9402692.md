9402692 Schadler This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made to evaluate
Laser Raman Spectroscopy Techniques for use as an experimental tool to measure
the local three dimensional state of stress in composites. Since failure is a
localized event it is important to have good local data and in the case of
composites the deviation from uniformity is much greater than in many
conventional materials. If successful, this would be a new technique for
obtaining these local stresses and therefore useful in evaluating the safety of
structures made of composites. ***
