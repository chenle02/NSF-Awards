The subject of the workshop is two-phase flow visualization, image analysis and
data interpretation, with focus on particulate flow. Flow visualization is an
essential non- intrusive method of investigation of two-phase flow structure and
the underlying dynamics. The objective is to identify emerging new methods of
visualization and interpretation. The meeting will be organized by Dr. W.J. Yang
(University of Michigan) and Dr. D.D. Joseph (University of Minnesota). The
proposed workshop will provide a forum to evaluate the present research on
particulate two-phase flow visualization, and to establish future trends in that
area. The written report will be distributed to universities and research
centers involved in flow visualization.
