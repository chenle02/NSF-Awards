This proposal uses algebraic and computational methods to study problems at the
interface of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. The two central themes are
toric varieties and hyperplane arrangements. The main objects studied in toric
varieties are the equivariant Chow ring, the homogenous coordinate ring of a
toric variety embedded by a very ample divisor, and toric codes. The questions
are to better understand how combinatorics and geometry (of the fan defining the
toric variety, or of the polytope defining the divisor) manifests in the Chow
ring, in the homogeneous coordinate ring, and in the associated toric code. The
main object studied in hyperplane arrangements is the module of logarithmic one
forms. In particular, Terao's conjecture that the freeness of this module is
combinatorially determined is one of the main open questions in the field. The
PI will also study the LCS and Chen ranks of the fundamental group, and their
connection to resonance varieties.

Two of the three toric projects have significant real world applications: the
Chow ring of a toric variety is simply the ring of splines: such objects are
central in numerical analysis (for example, in solving partial differential
equations, which are crucial to much of applied mathematics), and in geometric
modelling. Toric codes are a generalization of the Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller
codes used in signal processing and data compression. Advances in coding theory
could lead to more efficient transmission of data over noisy communication
channels. Software will be developed for the NSF sponsored Macaulay2 platform,
and made publicly available, benefitting researchers in many different areas.
For example, toric varieties are widely used as test cases for mirror symmetry
in mathematical physics. This software will be coauthored with graduate
students: the project supports 50% summer research for two Ph.D. students. The
PI will also produce a state of the art book on hyperplane arrangements.
