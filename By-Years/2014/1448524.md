The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to increase the reliability of existing
cloud applications, while also lowering the barrier to entry to cloud operations
for less technically sophisticated users. The rapid growth of cloud computing
over the past decade has made enterprise-scale IT infrastructure available to
companies of all sizes, but the ability of most companies to effectively
leverage those resources significantly trails the technological leap that cloud
computing represents. The goal of this project is to address these deficiencies
by designing and implementing a high-level, declarative programming language
that infrastructure operators can use to manage their cloud deployments. Using
this language and its accompanying abstractions will reduce application downtime
due to operator error, enable operators to more easily and quickly update cloud
deployments, and make applications portable across cloud
providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project advances the techniques for managing complex, large-scale
systems on cloud platforms. Existing cloud management platforms are based on
low-level abstractions, such as individual virtual machines, and do not give
operators a way to describe the high-level structure of cloud deployments. By
taking a language-based approach to the problems of cloud management, this
project will produce robust cloud abstractions that will handle the low-level
details of cloud operations. In addition to facilitating manual administration,
these abstractions will serve as a basis for more sophisticated cloud control
programs than are possible today.
