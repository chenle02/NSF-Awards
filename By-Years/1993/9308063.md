9308063 Palmore This Fellow will study the interaction of proteins with surface
components. A common problem with the design of biosensors, artificial organs
and synthetic biological fluids is the inability to control surface/fluid
interactions. Current design of biologically compatible materials is based on
studies of protein adsorption at structurally ill-defined surfaces. Molecular
mechanisms by which proteins are adsorbed are poorly understood. Specifically,
this Fellow will study the adsorption of cytochrome c at several well-defined
surfaces. Results of the studies will lead to the development of a strategy
toward the rational design of biocompatible surfaces, and development of a
general technique for study of protein adsorption. This work will be performed
in the laboratory of Professor George Whitesides at Harvard University. ***
