A request is made by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to fund the
operation of the East Coast Winch Pool for an additional five years. The
investment in overboarding equipment is an expensive undertaking due to the high
cost of purchase, maintenance and shipping of these systems. In an effort to not
only ensure that these systems are available to researchers for their work but
to also ensure that that they are properly maintained and available to the
entire science community with expert support, NSF created the East Coast Winch
Pool. This “pool” was created to offer scientists a convenient single point of
contact for all of their overboarding equipment needs as well as the expertise
to provide them with creative engineering solutions for their unique
requirements while at the same time reducing cost by pooling equipment for use
by the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
