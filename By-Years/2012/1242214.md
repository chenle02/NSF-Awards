1242214&lt;br/&gt;Sokolov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal deals with
fluorescent nanoparticles of unusually high brightness. Being a substantially
new and radically different approach to making fluorescent nanoparticles, this
research is considered to be high risk. At the same time, it is a high potential
&lt;br/&gt;payoff due to the importance of such particles for a broad range of
photonic applications involving tagging, tracing, labeling, and particularly in
biological imaging and sensing. High brightness of labeling particles is
desirable to attain higher signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently, to increase
sensitivity and/or speed of sensing, contrast of imaging, to decrease the limit
of detection, etc. The merits of the proposed research are in the study of
silica nanoparticles, which have unusually strong fluorescent emission;
understanding the nature of this phenomenon; and investigating the limits of
this approach for bio-imaging applications.
