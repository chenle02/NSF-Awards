This project is focused on building a diverse scientific workforce inclusive of
underrepresented minorities by coordinating and integrating the efforts of
professional scientific societies. The Alliance of Scientific Societies for the
Development of the Next Generation of Scientists will draw upon insights and
principles from the field of social science to build a Community of Practice by
unifying and integrating the established effective practices for inclusion and
diversity within a large group of national and international scientific
societies based in the US. The goals of this Alliance are to create innovative,
effective and strategic plans across organizations to offer members of
minorities the opportunity to participate in the scientific enterprise, and to
establish robust programs for the recruitment and retention of a diverse
scientific workforce. A set of best practices and evaluation metrics will be
developed and made available to the scientific community by a variety of
mechanisms including conferences, workshops and on-line
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from the social sciences (drawing upon
research in communities of practice, social cognitive career theory, identity
formation, and cultural capital) provide insights into how underrepresented
minority scientists develop, make choices, and meet challenges. This project
will bring together the Minority Affairs and Diversity Committees of
participating scientific societies along with social science professionals and
other stakeholders to integrate their knowledge and experience to create and
disseminate a unified database of diversity programs, a standard reference set
of evaluation metrics, and create a context in which to share resources, best
practices, and program outcomes to broaden participation of underrepresented
minorities in the scientific enterprise.
