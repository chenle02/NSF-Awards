This funding supports a project to update the surveying equipment and
instructional quality and capability in civil engineering technology at Wake
Technical College. Acquiring "theodolites with distance measuring capability
connected to computers" creates a total surveying system within the
institution's facilities. This surveying system is used by students in both the
day and evening programs in the Surveying Technology Curriculum for course work
in the Hydrology, Drainage, and Subdivision course. This award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution. //
