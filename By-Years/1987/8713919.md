The research is a very broad investigation into the mechanics of powder
consolidation, incorporating a large number of materials problems related to
consolidation of metal, ceramic and composite powders through the addition of
heat, pressure and shear stresses. The research includes the use of 3-D finite
element modelling of the stresses, and various models, from a wide range of
sources, for the effects of pressure and stresses on densification. The program
also addresses the issue of microstructure control, i.e., the problem of
coarsening in the latter stages of consolidation, and the various complications
associated with the production of composite materials, consisting of several
discrete phases with significantly different behavior during consolidation. The
research will also investigate the behavior of a great variety of metal, ceramic
and composite materials through experimental measurements on materials during
the consolidation process, and through characterization of microstructures at
various stages of the consolidation process.
