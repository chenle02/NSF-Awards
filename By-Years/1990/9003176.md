This research involves the study of fitting statistical nonlinear regression
models to data for which the response variance has been modeled as a function of
the mean response and other variables and possible unknown parameters which must
be estimated from the data. Estimation will be studied for repeated measures
data in which the response variance varies within individuals. A heteroscedastic
random coefficient model containing a functional model for intra-individual
variance with unknown parameters to be estimated is considered. Systematic study
of the implications of the theory of variance function estimation for data
consisting of independent observations will be conducted. Estimation for
regression analysis with censored data will be studied when a variance function
model is postulated. These models are applied to a detection limit problem
common in pharmaceutical applications.
