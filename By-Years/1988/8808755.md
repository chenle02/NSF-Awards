With the work of Hilbert and the publication of the >Principia mathematica> by
Russell and Whitehead early in this century and Godel's work in the 1930's on
incompleteness in mathematics, the issues of provability and incompleteness
theorems have been of central concern for logicians, mathematicians and
philosophers of mathematics. In 1976, Professor Boolos completed a major study
which resulted in his book, >The Unprovability of Consistency>. Since that time,
much has happened in the logic of provability which requires a new look at the
issues addressed in that original study. Provability logic, a branch of modal
logic, is the study of those properties of formal consistency and provability
(as in the work of Hilbert and Godel) that can be expressed when a symbol
meaning "it is provable that" is added to the usual languages of logic. As Godel
discovered in his studies of mathematics, formal provability is a perplexing
notion: although every interesting formal theory T can prove "2+2=4"
provable.in.T, no such theory T can prove even "2+2=5" >un>provable.in.T.
Provability logic provides a systematic account of formal provability that makes
sense of its strange properties. The field has grown greatly since 1976. One
striking new feature of his new study will be the treatment of predicate (i.e.,
quantified) provability logic, including recent results by Artyomov, McGee,
Vandanyan and Professor Boolos himself. This and other new topics will greatly
enhance our understanding of the logic of provability and incompleteness
theorems.
