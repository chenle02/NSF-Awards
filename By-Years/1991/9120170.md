A study of the superfluid transition of 4He films adsorbed on slip- cast Al2O3
powder will be made, using a torsion oscillator and acoustic techniques. The
vortex core size will be obtained as a function of temperature, film thickness
and 3He concentration. The dissipation at the transition will be measured over a
frequency range from 1 kHz to 30 MHz. It is also proposed to measure the
tortuosity of porous ceramics; and to study the dynamics of the lambda
transition using a vortex-ring theory. Measurement of the superfluid density in
liquid 4He films on a porous substrate can furnish new insight into the quantum
behavior of condensed matter at very low temperature.
