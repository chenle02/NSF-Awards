This collaborative research project entitled "Place-based Geospatial Science
Learning and Applications in Rural Alaska" is a youth-Based ITEST Program
addressing math, science and cultural content areas. With the support of ten
partner organizations, program participants engage in the application of
marketable geospatial information technology (IT) fluencies situated in
culturally relevant contexts, resulting in more informed decision-making
regarding the sustainable use of natural resources in rural Alaskan communities.
In regions characterized by high dropout rates, poor standardized test scores,
and struggling cash economies, 160 secondary students -- mostly Native Alaskans
-- and 16 teachers work closely with scientists for a total of 19,200 and 1,920
contact hours, respectively. By project's end 3,319 students -- including 2,025
Native Alaskans and 243 teachers -- will have access to locally and culturally
relevant IT curriculum facilitated by web-served imagery, geographic information
systems (GIS) data and field kits available for loan. The program integrates
geospatial IT and local traditional knowledge of landscape features into
standards-based curriculum. Students synthesize concepts from Native American
cartography, geomorphology, topographic and geologic map interpretation,
remotely sensed data interpretation and GIS during a capstone field experience
emphasizing landscape evaluation. The project incorporates the expertise of
teachers, education researchers, remote sensing specialists, geoscience
professionals, Native Elders and others with traditions-based knowledge into
innovative pedagogical approaches meeting the needs of rural Alaskan
communities. Analyses of these approaches and practices by researchers will
provide new models for enhancing learning in meaningful
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
