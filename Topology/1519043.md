The "K-theory: Future Directions" workshop/conference will be held at the Ohio
State University, Columbus, Ohio, May 11-16, 2015. K-theory is the study of
vector bundles on spaces and provides very important invariants of the space.
Depending on the space considered and the variant of K-theory used, these
invariants are of importance to different parts of mathematics ranging from
algebraic topology to number theory. As a result, the program theme lies in the
intersection of very active areas in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and
arithmetic geometry,with major advances made in the area during the last decade.
In view of these, the workshop and conference should be of great interest to
junior faculty and graduate students who may be starting their research careers.
The program will feature several key-note talks which will survey the historical
background, current state of development and prospects for future progress in
the focused areas. These talks will provide an opportunity to take a longer view
than is customary at many research conferences and should be particularly
valuable for young researchers. In recent years, there have been several major
advances in the field of Algebraic K-theory, leading up to the solution of the
Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures. The powerful techniques
introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on
several outstanding remaining problems in the area. The workshop and conference
will focus on the Koszulity conjecture and the Carlsson conjecture, which are
among the main remaining open problems after the solution of the Milnor and
Bloch-Kato conjectures. The two conjectures have been around for nearly 20 years
and special cases of both have been verified. In view of the solution of the
Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures, this shows the importance and relevance of
the above workshop and conference. For the conference web-site, please visit
