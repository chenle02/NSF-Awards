This is a travel award for a trip to England to visit faculty and examine
facilities at the University of London and Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
These visits are to identify the best match of interests and appropriateness of
library holdings in preparation for a postdoctoral study program. Initial
contacts have been made with faculty, who have expressed an interest in serving
as postdoctoral mentor. This travel award will enable the investigator to meet
with the various professors and make a choice of the program best suited to her
goals. Initial discussions of formal arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment
will also be held.
