This project is designed to elucidate the mechanism of action, at the cellular
level, of the benzodiazepines, a widely used sleep inducing drug. One
possibility is that benzodiazepines induce sleep by interfering with the proper
function of calcium channels, which are powerful regulators of neuronal
function. The project will involve direct injection of benzodiazepines into
several areas of the brain, including those areas where, according to previous
research, the drug should act. Also injected in the same areas will be drugs
which block the effect of the benzodiazepines, calcium channels, and other drugs
which lead to the opening of these channels.
