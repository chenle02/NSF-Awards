9204998 Klemperer This research will measure the seismic velocity structure of
the Aleutian Arc and the Bering Sea Shelf in order to provide constraints on
continental growth and composition. It is widely believed that two-thirds of the
continental crust forming today does so at magmatic arcs, but, paradoxically,
recent geological and petrological estimates of island arc composition suggest
that arcs are substantially more mafic than average continental crust is
believed to be. The best test of the composition of in-situ crust is its seismic
velocity, but though many measurements of continental velocity have been made
worldwide, very few data exist for island arcs because of the logistic
difficulties of working in these areas. This project is coordinated with two
other NSF-funded projects to collect seismic reflection data via the R/V Ewing
under a University of Delaware and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory grant and an
ocean-bottom seismometer deployment under a Woods-Hole Oceanographic Institution
grant. ***
