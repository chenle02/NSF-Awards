The ultimate goal of this research is to develop sophisticated compilers for
parallel machines. Memory latency is the focus of our research because it is the
bottleneck that drives many design decisions in parallel architectures today. As
systems become larger, it is increasingly difficult to have all memory close to
all processors which can increase effective memory latency. Current solutions
for reducing memory latency can be categorized as either dynamic or static.
Dynamic solutions include multi-caches and shared virtual memory. These methods
are based on the assumption that programs exhibit a high degree of locality and
therefore, the cost of servicing a cache miss or a page fault can be amortized
over many references that cache line or page. Current static solutions rely on
the programmer to use memory efficiently. Three related research directions are
proposed: a static solution to the problem of reducing effective memory latency
that requires much less detailed knowledge of the machine by the programmer than
present solutions, the combination of static and dynamic techniques for reducing
memory latency, and static and dynamic methods for exploiting locality in
recursively defined dynamic data structures.//
