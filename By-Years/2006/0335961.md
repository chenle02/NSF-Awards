ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exploratory proposal with the
objectives to (1) put a systematic structure in place for tracking information
and activities at regional centers in nanotechnology, (2) document the trends
and patterns in nanotechnology activities, and (3) disseminate information and
trends to facilitate formation of effective partnerships for coordination and
enhancing access to NNI's programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is
being fully funded by the Engineering Directorate.
