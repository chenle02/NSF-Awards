This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at the CUNY-Queens College acquire a 400 MHz
spectrometer which will be used in the following research investigations: (1)
The Interactions of Azaheterocycles and Their Metal Complexes with Nucleic
Acids; (2) Natural Products Synthesis; (3) Synthesis of Lipid Analogs for Use in
Studies of Lipid-Lipid Interactions in Membranes; (4) Stereochemical Effects in
Transition Metal Ion Centered Dendrimers; (5) Mechanism and Design in
Organometallic Chemistry; and (6) Synthesis and NMR of Labelled Amino Acids,
Peptides, and Nucleoside Analogs. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
