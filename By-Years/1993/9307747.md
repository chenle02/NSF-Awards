9307747 Mitchell Olds Molecular Biological approaches to quantitative genetics
can be used to study in breeding depression and hybrid breakdown. The genetic
basis of inbreeding dpression is an unanswered question with implications for
many problems in agriculture and genetics. For example, hybrid vigor (avoidance
of inbreeding depression) is responsible for a large portion of the increases in
crop yield obtained by plant breeders. Crosses between distantly related
populations may produce offspring with reduces fitness (hybrid breakdown).
Phenotypic plasticity and genotype environment interaction may also be important
in agricultural and wild species. Despite many years of inquiry, the genetic
basis of these phenomena remains unclear. %%% Using recently developed
techniquesin molecular biology it is now feasible to elucidate the genetic basis
of ombreeding depression and outbreeding depression. This technology will be
used to ask 1) What causes hybrid vigor? 2) Does genotype environment
interaction contribute to hybrid vigor? 3) How do changes in gene expression
cause genotype environment interaction? 4) What causes hybrid breakdown? This
research will have important implications for understanding the genetics of
agricultural and natural populations.
