This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of
morphological diversity in iguanian lizards." This research compares the
evolution of morphological diversity among and within two lizard families,
Agamidae and Iguanidae. The goal is to identify clades that have evolved greater
morphological disparity than other clades, test for common ecomorphological
patterns within and between groups, and test for an association between
increased morphological disparity and diversification rates using a phylogenetic
context.
