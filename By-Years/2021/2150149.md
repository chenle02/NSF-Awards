The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project advance the treatment of COVID-19. A viral
infection like that leading to COVID-19 creates stress on cells similar to
cancer, obesity, diabetes and aging. This project advances a single non-toxic
injection for critical patients to reduce cellular stress, block virus
infection, and increase survival. In addition, this biologic therapy is also
effective against the SARS-CoV-2 mutations, Ebola, and Influenza A. This has the
potential to transform treatment for virus infections and cancer therapy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project advances a treatment to end COVID-19 by blocking the SARS-CoV-2
receptors on lung cells. The project advances discoveries that a survival
protein, GRP78, is essential for virus infectivity and that an associated
inhibitor can prevent infection. The project optimizes methods to use a lead
GRP78 inhibitor to block spike proteins (SPs) of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations, as
well as other virus receptor binding domains (RBDs) from binding to receptors
and to lung cells. It is anticipated that the efficacy of the lead GRP78
inhibitor to block whole virus SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and Influenza A virusesâ€™
infection on lung cells will exceed 99%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
