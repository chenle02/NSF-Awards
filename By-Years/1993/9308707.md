9308707 Robinson The research entails a study of representations of Clifford
algebras on Hilbert spaces within a geometric context. Links with reduction
methods in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization are expected.
Transferences between phase spaces and the generalized theory of the harmonic
oscillator will be studied in view of symplectic group actions. The research is
likely to have significant applications to modern quantum field theory and
Hamiltonian mechanics.
