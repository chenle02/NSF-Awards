The research efforts to be carried out will involve various aspects at the
interface of particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. General areas
of this interface include cosmology, supernova physics and cosmic ray physics.
Particular long term projects include refinement of Big Bang nucleosynthesis
constraints and predictions, including studies of light element evolution,
studies of the quark-hadron transition, nucleochronology, supernova neutrino
physics in the light of SN 1987 A, studies of the interplay of particle physics
models with galaxy and structure formation,m and implications of the ultra high
energy cosmic ray spectrum on physics and astrophysics.
