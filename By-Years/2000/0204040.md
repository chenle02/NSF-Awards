EIA-0204040 Mary Hall University of Southern California Resource-Aware Off-line
and On-line Empirical Optimization &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research we propose
herein explores a new paradigm that fundamentally restructures the compilation
process to enable resource-aware optimization. We will demonstrate how this
system can alleviate some of the problems that lead to inefficiencies in big
science and engineering codes today: register pressure, cache conflict misses,
the trade-off between synchronization, parallelism and locality in SMPs, and
process migration in computational grids. There are three essential components
of this research program:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Compiler-directed off-line
empirical optimization;&lt;br/&gt; Dynamic feedback, for user-and compiler-
directed on-line optimization; and&lt;br/&gt; Experience base to guide
optimization from history: The results of experiments from both off-line and on-
line empirical optimization will be maintained in an experience base, which can
be used to generalize prior optimization results and plan a future optimization
strategy.&lt;br/&gt;
