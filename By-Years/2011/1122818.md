Thermodynamics and the underlying statistical picture of random molecular
motions are fundamental in biology. In order to make sense of processes ranging
from respiration and photosynthesis in the cell to the survival and
stabilization of ecosystems students need a good understanding of energy, its
conservation, its availability, and its transformation. Since biology is about
the generation, maintenance, and evolution of organization and structure, the
concept of information and its statistical mechanical partner, entropy, is
critical. Students typically encounter energy, enthalpy, and entropy in
introductory biology, chemistry, and physics classes. But the approach taken in
the three disciplines can be dramatically different. Often, they make different
(unstated) assumptions resulting in statements of the laws of thermodynamics
that look different in different classes. This lack of consistency raises
barriers to students' development of a coherent understanding of these important
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we work with an interdisciplinary
group of physicists, chemists, and biologists at four universities to (1) come
to an agreement on a common content and representational scheme; (2) create a
literature survey bringing together results about student understanding of
concepts in thermodynamics from chemistry, biology, and physics education
research; (3) study student understandings of and attitudes about the basic
concepts of energy, entropy, diffusion, and stochastic processes; (4) create web
materials including text and materials for active-learning instruction for use
in an introductory physics course for biologists; and (5) create and validate an
instrument to evaluate students' learning gains on these topics.
