This project for dissertation research in social anthropology will study
agrarian violence in a Mayan community in Chiapas, Mexico. The student will
spend 18 months studying how the community's social organization is changed by
changes in population, internal socio-economic differentiation, government
policies, participation in external markets, and migration, and how changes in
social organization affect agrarian violence. This research is important because
agrarian violence in developing countries is a destabilizing factor in the world
and any advances in our understanding of the causes of violence may be helpful
in dealing with it.
