9317303 Boston The proposal concerns the maize storage proteins (zeins), that
are stored within ER membranes as spherical aggregates called protein bodies. A
molecular chaperon has been isolated and characterized that accumulates during
kernel development and may play a critical role in the ordered deposition of the
proteins within protein bodies. This molecular chaperon is BiP, and is a 75 kD
polypeptide that is found within the ER and the protein bodies. Although the
exact role of this protein is not known, BiP homologues are found in both
prokayotes and eukaryotes. The goals of the proposal are to characterize the
interactions between BiP and target proteins during translocation to the ER of
normal and mutant endosperm; to investigate the molecular basis of altered
protein body morphology in developing endosperm of fl2,De-B30 and Mc mutants;
and to determine if post translational modifications are correlated with BiP
function in plants. %%% The studies outlined in this proposal will increase our
knowledge of the processes regulating transport and accumulation of the
important storage reserves. They are also essential for devising new strategies
for introducing new gene products to improve plant growth and quality. ***
