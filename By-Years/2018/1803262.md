Nature has evolved complex pathways to amplify the signal from the detection of
low concentrations of ions or molecules. A robust, man-made amplifier system
with similar control and amplification of ionic and molecular signals as those
achieved in Nature will be helpful for probing biological channels with ultra-
low conductivities (like those important in diabetes) and understanding
biological processes. Inspired by biology, this research will focus on
development of the first steps to prepare ionic circuits with amplifying
properties built on the principles of both electronic integrated circuits and
Nature?s signaling pathways. Prototypes of ionic circuits will be prepared using
nanopores with controlled geometry and surface chemistry as the building blocks.
The investigators chose nanopores as building blocks, because biological
channels and pores in a biological cell create the first step of biological
amplification. The interdisciplinary program will create an excellent training
environment for graduate and undergraduate students. Visits of students from
local schools at both universities are also planned with hands-on activities on
nanotechnology and biosensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the
research is to design a generic route for ionic amplification and building ionic
transistors with millisecond response time for biosensing applications.
Nanopores in various materials including silicon nitride, polymer films and
glass nanopipettes will be rendered ionic transistors by tuning their surface
characteristics and geometries. The nanoporous transistors will be three
terminal systems, which will function according to principles similar to those
of semiconductor-based transistors. In the ionic systems constructed, instead of
electrons, anions will carry negative charge, and, instead of holes, cations
will carry positive charge. Nanoscale dimensions of the system are required for
a quick temporal response, as movement of only a few ions or molecules will lead
to changes in the measured signal. Connecting two ionic transistors in a circuit
will lead to preparation of an ionic equivalent of a Darlington amplifier, where
current gain is equal to a product of amplifications of the two component
transistors. Application of the Darlington amplifier to probe ion channels with
ultralow conductivities will be demonstrated as well. Preparation of an ionic
differential amplifier will also be explored. With these amplifiers, in
principle, thousand-fold amplification might be achieved, making measuring
femto-Ampere currents accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
