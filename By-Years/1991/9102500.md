Irwin The primary thrust of the research is the investigation of a more general
purpose signal processing architecture which achieves the same level of
performance as special-purpose signal processing architectures without an
accompanying increase in granularity. Most attempts at trying to expand an
architecture to accommodate a more general class of applications usually result
in an increase in granularity. With the increase in granularity either the
overall size of the processor increases or, to keep the overall physical size
constant, fewer processing cells are utilized. In either case, the end result is
a decrease in performance. This project attempts the development of more general
purpose signal processing architectures which avoid this difficulty while
maintaining the granularity, performance, and physical size of fine grain
processors with the flexibility of more coarse grain processors.
