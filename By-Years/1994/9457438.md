This research aims to extend current methods of time-frequency and time-scale
analysis by developing a general theory for signal analysis and processing in
alternative coordinate systems. Specific tools under investigation include
optimal, signal- dependent time-scale representations, information measures for
time-frequency and time-scale analysis, and operator-based, generalized
coordinate systems. Test signals are being drawn from problems in machine health
monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging, and dispersive signal processing.
