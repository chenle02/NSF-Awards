This research deals with the problem of how slabs deform as they descend into
the mantle, and how this deformation is related to the observed seismicity. This
problem is very difficult to formulate and this research adopts a variational
principle, a minimum strain energy approach, as a starting point. Seismicity
will be studied by analysis of existing catalogues and finite thickness slab
models will be used to analyze the strain. Previous work done in the Aleutians
and Cascadia will be compared to this study which will concentrate on western
Pacific and South American subduction zones. This research relates slab
distortion to seismicity at subduction zones and is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
