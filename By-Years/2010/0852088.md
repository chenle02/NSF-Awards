This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration between the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Los Angeles-area urban colleges will enable the
Consortium for Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site to recruit approximately 18 mostly minority and women
students per year for research experiences in cutting-edge projects in
astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science. The scientific goals of CURE
projects are part of the larger research projects as defined by the JPL research
mentors, often within the context of ongoing or planned space missions. CURE
students are immersed in science at the JPL Oak Grove facility, at the JPL Table
Mountain Observatory, and, occasionally, at Caltech. They help to design and
build experiments, take data, analyze data, and present results. The students
have access to the research mentors and facilities that are beyond the reach of
their home institutions, and are exposed to the science community at JPL and at
professional conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will provide
research experiences for minority students and women, who are underrepresented
in the science workforce and in higher education, and to thereby encourage them
to select science or engineering as a career. The students learn to work as part
of a skilled and highly motivated team; operate in a nonacademic, professional
environment; develop a professional attitude and become valued colleagues;
develop responsibility to their projects, to their mentors and to themselves;
think logically, critically and clearly to solve research problems; and learn
good scientific communication skills.
