The CCCO will continue to oversee and coordinate scientific planning for two
important oceanographic components of the world Climate Research Program (WCRP)
-- the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Studies of Interannual
Variability in the Tropical Ocean and the Global Atmosphere (TOGA). The CCCO
will increase its interaction with the ICSU/WMO Joint Scientific Committee for
the WCRP in order to develop more effective cooperation between oceanographers
and meteorologists involved in the WCRP, in particular to establish a basis for
truly joint efforts under the WCRP's Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
(GEWEX) now being planned. Staff services will continue to be provided to the
CCCO into 1992.
