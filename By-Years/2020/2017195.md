Scientific studies of decision-making have established that concepts such as
urgency and risk vary widely among individuals and across cultures. Medical
decision-making depends on how associated concepts are interpreted by both the
sick and their caretakers. This research examines how distinct cultural notions
of time and timescale shape medical decision making, using diabetes-related
complications as a case study to question how interpretations of time influence
health decisions and outcomes. The research is informed by and advances
anthropological theories of temporality. The project also trains U.S.
undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how
social, cultural, and demographic factors affect notions of time and how these,
in turn, shape medical risk. Diabetes complications often begin with mundane
symptoms that rapidly develop into dramatic, life changing events. Using
interviews and participant observation, this study examines how people living
with diabetes seek care from multiple sources and in relation to acute versus
chronic manifestations of the disease. Patient-centered data will further be
contextualized by interviews with healthcare providers and participant
observation in diabetes clinics. The researcher will provide evidence of 1) why
and when specific providers or sets of providers are selected; and 2) how these
caretakers' notions of time interact with diabetes complications to affect
medical decision-making and outcomes. Understanding diverse stakeholder
perspectives will inform theories of medical decision-making by shifting the
focus from the individual life-course to incorporate multi-generational and
community perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
