Experiences for Undergraduates in Computer Vision This Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports ten students per year in programs
carried out during the full calendar year, for three years. The students work on
projects involving computer vision, including such subareas as visual lip-
reading, human face processing, and color image processing. With the full
calendar year experience, the students have time to follow a substantial project
through to completion. The students meet with their faculty advisor once each
week, they participate in the weekly research group meetings and write a
technical report on their project. The project has a target of having 50% of the
participants being from underrepresented groups.
