Singhal This project provides partial funding to support a workshop on
international technology and operations management to be held at the University
of Baltimore, which will also serve as the host. Other collaborating
universities sponsoring the workshop are Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, Tulane,
Georgetown, and Indiana. Topics to be covered in the workshop include problems
in product design, manufacturing, and decision making in the supply chain.
International technology and operations management is critical to the
competitiveness of a nation. Yet, the development of the field is weak. The
workshop will provide a forum whereby researchers in the field can share
information on research and course development to spur additional activities in
the area. Given the global competitiveness of manufacturing today, the
involvement of the business and management academic units is crucial for
profitable manufacture. The involvement of these academic units will provide the
avenue through which students of business can have a better understanding of the
complex decisions required of a manufacturing enterprise in product design,
manufacturing, and marketing.
