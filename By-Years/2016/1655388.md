This proposed workshop seeks to enhance ethical cultures by changing how
research integrity is perceived as both a research and educational area. By
focusing on positive research integrity the workshop will contribute to research
that will equip scientists and engineers with knowledge, skills, and a positive
viewpoint to encourage them to make ethical choices and exhibit model behaviors
that will benefit their communities and the broader society. The outcomes of
research on positive research integrity will be of interest to administrators,
educators of STEM from K-20, scientists and engineers. It will facilitate
educating undergraduates and post graduates in critical thinking skills,
recognizing ethical issues, navigating difficult situations, and cultivating
interpersonal and communication skills.

This proposed workshop aims to convene a 2 day workshop to develop a research
agenda for positive research integrity in the spring of 2017. It will assemble
researchers and practitioners of positive ethics, research integrity,
philosophy, moral psychology, and character education. By bringing together
scholars not typically in one room, recommendations and best practices will be
shared as a means for articulating a research agenda. The following research
questions will be tackled. (1) What are best practices in positive ethics
research and education? (2) How can proven approaches in positive ethics be
applied to STEM fields and workplaces? (3) What are a research agenda and
research questions for Positive Research Integrity? A workshop summary and white
paper will be produced and disseminated.
