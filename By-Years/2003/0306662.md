The investigators are creating algorithms and software for solving optimization
problems of a general yet highly practical nature. Such problems arise in
aerospace, biology, engineering, economics, medicine, and many other such
fields. They involve thousands of variables and constraints. The intellectual
challenge is to design methods that are efficient and reliable on increasingly
large problems. A key aspect of the new work is improved handling of the sparse
matrices involved. New classes of problems are also targeted, including ones
with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
large community of researchers already depend critically upon the investigators'
optimization software. They include economists exploring international trade
agreements and the effect of greenhouse gases. At Boeing and NASA, shape
optimization is essential for designing complex new aircraft configurations such
as transonic airliners and a quiet supersonic business jet. Future Space Shuttle
decisions depend on accurate computation of optimal trajectories for reentry
from orbit and for emergency landings during launch. For example, new sharp-
nosed vehicles are being compared against conventional blunt-nosed designs. The
investigators' work is of national importance through its contribution to the
saving of scarce resources and the competitive edge that it provides to US
industry and defense.&lt;br/&gt;
