Dr. Muhleman will make observations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Titan
at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths using a number of different telescopes
and observing techniques. The experiments are designed to measure and interpret
processes that can not be studied with existing spacecraft or in other
wavelength bands. The program includes the investigation of the middle and upper
atmospheric wind systems on Venus and Mars using the various rotational
transitions of carbon monoxide as the tracer gas. Mercury, Mars, Saturn's rings,
Titan, and Venus will be studied with the new technique of using the Very Large
Array telescope as a synthetic aperture radar receiver of echoes from these
objects that are illuminated by the Goldstone radar transmitter. Such radar
images provide powerful tools for investigation of the subsurface structures of
the terrestrial planets and the rings of Saturn. Radio wavelength techniques
offer unique capabilities in planetary science. They can be employed to probe
down to the 100-bar level in the atmospheres of the major planets, whereas no
spacecraft experiment to date has measured anything deeper than 2 bars, and that
includes the Galileo mission to Jupiter. Similarly, no spacecraft experiment has
sampled any planetary surface deeper than 1 or 2 cm. An additional unique role
for Earth-based radio techniques is for synodic studies of the planets over
timescales of several years. Dr. Muhleman uses state of the art Earth-based
radio astronomy facilities and techniques to probe the surfaces of planets and
the physics of their atmospheres.
