Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato(Pst) in tomato is conferred by a
single dominant locus, Pto. Tools necessary for cloning the locus were developed
during the tenure of the Plant Postdoctoral Fellowship Award. Near Isogenic
lines of tomato were used to identify RFLP and RAPD markers tightly linked to
the gene and a large F2 population was used to create a high resolution linkage
map that allowed precise placement of Pto in relation to the molecular markers.
A tomato YAC library was constructed and a screen identified a candidate for the
Pto locus. The project will be continued and the putative Pto gene isolated and
characterized. %%% This work should significantly increase our understanding and
ability to control disease in plants.
