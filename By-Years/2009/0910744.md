Funding is provided to support the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Sumer
Policy Colloquium, a yearly ten-day workshop on the basics of atmospheric
science policy. Each year, the AMS brings together academics, practitioners, and
policy makers at the highest levels of government, in both the executive and
legislative branches, and leaders of private enterprise and non-governmental
organizations to discuss how science and policymaking intersect.

Through the Colloquium and a range of AMS-sponsored follow-on activities,
participants learn how to: (1) help their scientific knowledge become
incorporated in broader aspects of the national agenda such as contributing to
public health and safety, economic growth, protection of the environment and
ecosystems, and geopolitical stability; and (2) engage effectively in the
development of public policy for science.

The broader impacts involve supporting a diverse group of graduate students and
faculty of exceptional scientific and leadership potential to gain a fuller
understanding of science and policy.
