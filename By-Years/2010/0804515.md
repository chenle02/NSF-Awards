This proposal merges and impacts the field of psychology and law. The PI will
attempt to extend current risk assessment models in delinquency prediction by
examining ecological factors that would influence delinquency prediction models
and the impact that it would have in the legal system. Moreover, he has
demonstrated a high level of competency in doing community-based research and
scholarly accomplishments. Because of the relationships he has fostered with the
community/agencies of interest, he has adequate resources to succeed in his
project.
