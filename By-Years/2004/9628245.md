9628245 Carey The P.I. will model sea water intrusion in southern Baldwin
County, Alabama. This study necessarily requires a region where there are
sufficient data for model inputs. Baldwin County is a rapidly growing region of
the Gulf Coast and like many coastal areas, relies primarily on groundwater as
its source of potable water. Because of the importance of groundwater to this
region, there has been a wealth of data collected. Available data include well
water levels, water chemistry, pumping rates and surveys of water uses. Other
data available include aquifer parameters like hydraulic conductivity. A
calibrated seawater intrusion model of southern Baldwin county will be used in
an inverse manner to determine the flux of fresh water flowing through the
system and escaping to the ocean. The Alabama Gulf Coast is a region typical of
the earth's passive continental margins. Many of the estuarine deposits which
were formed during sequential incising and excising of the coast during sea
level rise and lowering have been preserved as hard bottom deposits here. This
initially local study will provide insight into much of the world's passive
continental margins and the fresh groundwater fluxes onto them.
