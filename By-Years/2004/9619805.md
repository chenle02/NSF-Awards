9619805 Maxwell, Bruce North Dakota University System REU: Research Training and
Collaborative Projects for Undergraduates in Computer Science This Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 10 students per year
in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. Students
participate in a spring semester research seminar offered at the University and
on-line via the WWW to off-campus participants. The seminar covers basic
research, writing, and presentation skills, and helps students to select an
advisor and design a research project in their advisor's area of specialty. The
participants are selected from area universities and community colleges,
including the five Tribally Controlled Community Colleges located in North
Dakota. Research areas include neural networks, computer vision, speech
recognition, network design and simulation, human-computer interfaces, and
application development for remote sensing tasks. Students are able to select
from this diverse set of topics for their summer projects. The goal of the
project is to provide research experiences and training to undergraduates in
computer science, focusing on students from regional institutions where
opportunities for research are rare.
