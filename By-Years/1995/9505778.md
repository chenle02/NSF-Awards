The goal of this continued excavation of an island in Lake Victoria is to
reconstruct the evolutionary divergence of Old World monkeys and apes. It will
include excavations of sediments adjacent to highly productive productive
primate fossil-bearing areas. Since 1987, the locality has produced many
important finds including two new species of bushbabies, a compoete and
undistorted skull fo the ancestral Old World monkey Victoriapithecus, and
postcranial remains of Kenyapithecus which demonstrate that it is the earliest
semiterrestrial ancestral hominoid in the fossil record. A major emphasis of
this phase of the project will also be placed on publishing descriptions as well
as phylogenetic and functional interpretations of the more than 6,000 fossil
finds from this incredibly productive site.
