This project is for the development of a technological literacy course, "The
Digital World", to be stored on a CD ROM, for national distribution. The course
is designed to be completely portable; any faculty member with a Macintosh and a
CD drive will be able to offer it. In an effort to reach students who would not
normally consider technologically oriented courses, the course has no
prerequisites and will require no advanced mathematics. The course will use a
hands-on, active approach to learning. For example, the final project will
include student involvement in a project such as designing simple tic-tac-toe-
playing chips that compete against each other in a tournament on the last day of
class. A prototype version of the course will be taught at Dartmouth College.
Feedback from students and faculty will be used to develop a second version,
which will then be distributed on CD ROM.
