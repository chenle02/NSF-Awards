The object of this workshop is the evaluation of underwater vehicle technology
through the use of competitive scenarios. The workshop will bring together the
experience and knowledge of autonomous underwater vehicle technology with the
experience that has been gained through the International Submarine Race program
to foster innovation and technology development through competition. The subject
is sufficiently complex and has attracted a very large degree of interest so
that a workshop of invited experts is the best method to advance the concept to
practice. This approach will be employed to examine the process of utilizing
competition to foster and evaluate technical advances and as a result to develop
scenarios with which to characterize, evaluate and advance the state of the art
of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The results of the workshop will provide the
basis for competition based programs for technology enhancement and evaluation
in the future.
