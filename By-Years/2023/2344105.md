This project will describe the meteorological conditions and predictability of
the August 2023 Maui wildfires. Important scientific work includes determining
the role of terrain, the contributions of the preceding climatological
conditions, and clarifying the skill of weather models for this event.
Understanding the meteorology of the 2023 Maui wildfire is critical for warning
and protecting the population of Maui and the Hawaiian Islands. The findings of
this project should lead to better decision-making regarding Maui wildfires,
including guiding decisions regarding controlling power infrastructure,
facilitating evacuations, warning the population, and enhancing adaptation/land-
management decisions to reduce the threat. Furthermore, the insights gained in
studying this event should enhance wildfire decision-making for all of Hawaii,
and provide guidance useful for wildfires in other areas of the U.S.

This project will examine the meteorological origins of the Maui fires including
the role of terrain-induced weather features, such as high-amplitude mountain
waves and downslope windstorms, the nature of the large-scale flow controlling
the local weather features, the role of the passage of Hurricane Dora to the
south, and the contribution of antecedent climatological conditions. It will
clarify the meteorological ingredients required to produce such an unusual
catastrophic event. This study will also examine the predictability of weather
prediction models for such event, the required model resolution and physics to
provide skillful predictions, and study prior cases of wildfire and strong winds
across western Maui, to gain insights into the frequency of previous
wildfire/strong wind events in the region and the meteorology associated with
them.
