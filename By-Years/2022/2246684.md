The project lies at the interface of logic and analysis, more specifically,
descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory,
probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in
these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical,
and descriptive structural complexity of countable groups and equivalence
relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph
theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this
combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open
problems in these fields. This research project aims to generate more new
general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. This
project involves training of graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study problems
around orbit equivalence relations, measure equivalence and quasi-isometry,
amenability and inner amenability, cocycle superrigidity, treeability, weak
equivalence, and rigidity and anti-rigidity for group actions by applying the
perspective and insights of descriptive set theory and logic. The problems in
the proposal are of interest to many fields, including descriptive set theory,
measured group theory, geometric group theory, measurable combinatorics, ergodic
theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. The PI and
collaborators&lt;br/&gt;have already seized the first foothold toward a
resolution to many of the proposed problems, and this project is likely to
advance knowledge in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
