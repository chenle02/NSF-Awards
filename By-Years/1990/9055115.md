Northern Arizona University will initiate a five-week, residential,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry, Forestry,
Geology, and Physics/Astronomy for 30 high school students entering grades
10,11. "SOS: Summer of Science" provides rising high school sophomores and
juniors with the opportunity to perform research in Astronomy, Biology,
Chemistry, Forestry, or Geology at Northern Arizona University. Research
internships offer each student a discipline-specific research experience with a
practicing scientist. Research activities are complemented by training in basic
skills needed for actual research - experimental design, statistics, using
library collections, reading scientific literature, scientific writing, and
social and historical contexts. Students will present the results of their
research to their parents, teachers from throughout the region, and university
faculty during a Scientific Conference that is designed to prepare them to
continue the research with the students in their high schools.
