This project is to support US participants' travel to the international
conferences on Vertex Algebra and Related Topics which will be held in Kyoto
during December 15-17, 2010 and Taipei in December of 2011. The conferences
cover the following topics: infinite dimensional Lie algebras, vertex algebras,
representation theory, number theory, combinatorics, group theory, and
connections among vertex algebras, conformal nets and conformal field theory.
The major goal of the proposed conferences is to present the most important
developments in vertex algebras.

The proposed conferences help to maintain the international standing of the
American researchers in the theory of vertex algebra. The proposed activities
have a strong impact on educating and training young mathematicians. Graduate
students and junior researchers (some of them are from non Ph.D. institutions)
will be invited to attend the conferences and to give talks. The conference will
also help to strength the communication and cooperation among different schools.
