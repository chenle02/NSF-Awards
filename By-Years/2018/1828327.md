An award is made to Wesleyan University to support the acquisition of a confocal
microscope for use by faculty and students across multiple departments and
disciplines. The new instrument will profoundly enhance the training environment
and be used during many highly interactive laboratory courses taught by Wesleyan
faculty to promote STEM career advancement. The proposed microscope will be
housed in an advanced imaging facility that includes scanning and transmission
electron microscopes. To support dissemination of science to the general public,
as exemplified by the large number of articles authored by Wesleyan faculty that
are printed in the popular media, data generated by the new system will be used
in outreach presentations, science camps, local high-schools, an annual
scientific imaging student prize, and similar forums.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Wesleyan boasts an unusually broad portfolio of research topics that
will benefit from the new system, including evolution and development of
morphology, optogenetic-based control of behavior, cell biology, physiology,
developmental neuroscience, and chromosomal dynamics. Each of these areas is
experiencing an expansion of research into spatial relationships, driven by
advances in microscopy, and by the realization that researchers must study
three-dimensional shapes and how those change over time to understand the
structure and function of biological systems. Several of the research projects
will only be possible because the local availability of the system. Data and
analyses from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both educational and
public outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
