This proposal, submitted by the National Action Council for Minorities in
Engineering, is for $262,643 and will support an effort to develop a one-year,
dual component faculty/student cultural diversity program for improving the
engineering school environment for minority students. The faculty component
would focus on increasing the sensitivity of engineering faculty to cultural
differences within their student population and the importance of considering
these differences within the advising role. The student component would be
geared to helping them learn to cope with an environment that is likely to be
significantly different from any previous educational experience. A pilot
program would be carried out between April 1992 and March 1993. From April 1993
to June 1994, NACME would be involved in helping the engineering program pilot
site take the program through its second year. During those 15 months NACME
would also be involved in identifying other engineering school programs that
would institute a program based on the model program.
