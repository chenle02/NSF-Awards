The cytochrome c-cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) system provides an exceedingly
rich opportunity to investigate the intimate details of protein-protein
interactions and long-range electron transfer between physiologically related
heme proteins. The objectives of this research proposal lie in two areas. This
first area is to characterize the interaction between both horse and yeast iso-1
cytochrome c with yeast CcP. Experiments designed to clarify the stoichiometry
of binding between cytochrome c and CcP will be performed to determine if, and
under what conditions, more than one cytochrome c may bind to CcP. The high-
affinity cytochrome c binding site on CcP will be mapped through site-directed
mutagenesis. The role of individual amino acids at the binding site will be
assessed through thermodynamic measurements of the binding affinity. The
location of any secondary interaction sites will also be determined through
site-directed mutagenesis. The second area of interest is to characterize
electron transfer between the heme groups of cytochrome c and CcP. Transient-
state kinetic techniques will be used to investigate the rate of electron
transfer from ferrocytochrome c to the oxidized intermediate of CcP and the rate
of redox equilibration between the heme iron and Trp- 191 in CcP compound II.
The specificity of the reaction dynamics and the electron transfer pathway will
be explored through site- directed mutagenesis of CcP. %%% This work should lead
to a better understanding of protein-protein recognition in general, and of heme
proteins, which include hemoglobin and the proteins in energy metabolism, in
particular
