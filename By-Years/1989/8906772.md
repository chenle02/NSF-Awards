This project is concerned with infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. The principal
investigator will concentrate on a new class called vertex operator algebras
examining problems related to the study of their structure, classification,
formulation on higher genus surfaces and the geometric realization of some
concrete examples. The postdoctoral associate will work on the structure of the
integrable highest weight representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebras. This
research is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie
algebras arise from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group
is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie
groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of spherical
motion.
