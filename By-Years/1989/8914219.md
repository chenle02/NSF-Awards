This research has the objective to develop and implement substantially advanced
systems for underground excavation through the establishment of (1) systems that
advance continuously and safely through widely varying conditions, (2) systems
that have substantially increased rates of advance, (3) an increased range of
applications for mechanized cutting systems, and (4) increased safety of
excavation operations. The research planned on continuous, automated excavation
processes offers the greatest promise for substantial advances; however, other
effort on the application of available and promising techniques that engage the
entire excavation system will also be performed. The results of this research
could transform today's individual struggles to cope with the hostile
underground environment to routine, continuous, automated manufacturing
processes. Broadly viewed, this integrated research effort has the goal to
extend the benefits of automated manufacturing technologies into the new,
unstructured area of tunneling.
