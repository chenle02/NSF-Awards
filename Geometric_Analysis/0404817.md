Title: Harmonic forms and topology of complete manifolds

ABSTRACT

This proposed project is about relating the analysis and topology on complete
noncomapct manifolds. In particular, it is proposed to search for an extension
of the de Rham-Hodge theory, and to relate the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian
to the topology of manifolds.

The main objective of this project is to describe some large scale structures of
objects which are high dimensional analogue of the unbounded surfaces. The
approach is to inspect the physical steady states of a naturally defined energy
on such objects. The results and techniques are expected to be useful in
describing more complicated systems arising from physics, biology and other
branches of science.
