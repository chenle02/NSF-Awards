9322571 Huband This proposal is being awarded to enable a task force of
engineering deans and industry leaders under the auspices of the American
Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Engineering Deans Council and the
ASEE Corporate Roundtable, to conduct studies on the quality of engineering
education. The task group will undertake a study of the health of engineering
education in the United States and create partnerships between universities and
industry that can strengthen the entire engineering enterprise. This study will
begin with a planning meeting sponsored by the ASEE Engineering Deans Council in
the Fall, 1993 and continue with a Spring, 1994 workshop. An action team will
then focus on the results of the workshop for summer, 1994 implementation start
date. The results of the study will be summarized by the action team and
published in report form. The report will be distributed widely in the
governmental, industrial and engineering communities. ***
