Oklahoma State University proposes a planning grant to establish an Alliance
for minority Participation. The proposed Alliance would involved minority
students from throughout Oklahoma including those at Oklahoma State University,
Langston University, our traditional minority campus, and other regional and
private institutions. The activities that would be carried out under the
Alliance represent logical extensions, to support AMP goals, of programs which
we currently have in operation in one or more of our units. Our Alliance will
include mentoring and community building activities on the several campuses,
greatly increased research opportunities for minority students enrolled at the
predominantly undergraduate institutions, and will address the critical bridges
from high school to college and college to graduate school. A special feature of
our Alliance will be the use of satellite television to deliver enrichment
activities to the Alliance institutions. Since these transmissions will be
available nationwide, the program has the capability of immediate national
impact.
