This grant provides funding for development of time-saving tools to connect
more closely design and manufacturing. The overall purpose of this research is
to provide a mathematically sound and rigorous approach to the integration of
decision making in design and manufacturability assessment. In particular, there
are three primary objectives of the work: (1) an integrated model for design and
manufacturability assessment, (2) a template-free feature methodology for
complex, multi-axis and rotational machined parts combined with a decision
analysis approach for assessing time, cost and process variation of quality
attributes of a proposed product, and (3) a feedback system for linking
manufacturing evaluation and the design product model. The objective is to make
recommendations for improving design and manufacturability. This approach is an
extension of previous work done in generative process planning based on
template-free features. The significance of this project is that the integrated
model takes into account information-based decision making in design and
manufacturability assessment. By using manufacturing features based on machining
capabilities of the parochial factory, and not constrained to theoretical
template features, the emphasis is on the process. The goal of this work is the
development of theory and tools by which an organization or individual can
evaluate a product model of a proposed part in relation to the factory's
specific manufacturing capabilities. The comparison explicitly states the
decision-making criteria, preference and costs. If successful, this flexible
model will demonstrate the important elements in manufacturability assessment
and how this assessment can be linked back to the product model and design to
investigate redesign options.
