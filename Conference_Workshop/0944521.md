The proposal is for funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially minorities, women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty,
at Southwest Conference on Integrated Mathematical Methods in Medical Imaging
that will take place February 6 and 7, 2010, at Arizona State University, Tempe,
Arizona.

The main focus of the conference is to enhance the mathematical understanding of
the consequences of modern data collection strategies used in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) with respect to generating high fidelity images. The conference
will bring together researchers from the mathematical sciences and engineering
as well as practitioners from the biomedical community. It will engage
researchers from all career stages, including undergraduates from ASU and other
Southwestern institutions who will be invited to fully participate in the
conference. Graduate and undergraduate students from ASU, the University of
Arizona and other Southwestern institutions will also be encouraged to give
poster presentations and attend talks. The organizers anticipate representation
from some of the many Arizona medical research hospitals, Mayo Clinic, BNI, and
Banner Health, who are actively engaged in brain imaging research, as well with
researchers from the University of Arizona.
