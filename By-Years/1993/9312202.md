9312202 CECI This research will address several questions about the capacity of
children to serve as witnesses in legal proceedings, including criminal trials,
juvenile court hearings, and civil proceedings such as family courts. There has
been much controversy in this area because children are often the only witnesses
to events resulting in criminal charges that identify them as victims, and they
are frequently in the middle of bitter divorce cases. The courts have made
procedural rulings but the scientific basis for these rulings has been
challenged. This research will provide some answers to some questions in this
complex field by examining the extent to which childrens' memories are
susceptible to suggestion and the effectiveness of investigative techniques. The
research will not exhaust the questions to be examined or the different
methodological approaches that might be used, but it represents a solid
beginning in an important area of psychology and law. The project is comprised
of three experimental studies involving pre-school age children: (1) childrens'
capacity to distinguish in memory between true and false events, (2) childrens'
recollection of stressful events after a series of interviews about them,
including the use of anatomical dolls, and (3) the effects, on the accuracy of
childrens' testimony and on jurors' perceptions of their credibility, of
shielding children from the alleged perpetrator during testimony. This research
will make an important empirical and theoretical contribution to scientific
knowledge about childrens' reports, and a significant contribution to sound
legal practice and the reliability of legal processes. ***
