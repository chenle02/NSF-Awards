HRD 03-27699&lt;br/&gt;The CONNECT project at the University of California at
Riverside works to increase the pool of available mathematics teachers, develop
the mathematical capabilities of secondary school students (grades 6-12), and
improve the mathematics curriculum - all through mentoring and associated
activities. The CONNECT mentoring network builds upon a strong suite of existing
programs at UC Riverside (MATE, GEMS, CTF, HBHM) involving a diverse range of
target audiences and participants from college faculty, to students in grades
6-12, to undergraduates, and to secondary school teachers.
