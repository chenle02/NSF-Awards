The goal of this project is to develop, test, and deploy novel sensors that will
enable the study of activity and migration of small songbirds (20-50 grams). The
sensors required for such small animals require weight and energy budgets (1
gram and 1 micro Watt, respectively) below most low-energy devices and must
survive in challenging environments and collect useful data over many months.
This project has the potential to significantly impact the science of animal
behavior because many important species cannot be effectively monitored with
existing technologies -- for example roughly half of bird species weigh less
than 50 grams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the focus of this project is to
develop the technologies that will enable other researchers to study the
behavior of small animals, the project will test these devices on a specific
model species (Dark-eyed Juncos) in order to enhance the understanding of the
variation of timing on reproduction, migration, and biodiversity. Finally, while
the target application for this project is animal biology, many of the
fundamental technical problems are common to general low-energy sensing
problems. For example, a key problem is detecting the onset of interesting
events using extremely low energy levels prior to expending the significantly
higher levels of energy needed to collect high resolution data.
