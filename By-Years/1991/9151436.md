The goal of this project is enhance an experimentally oriented curriculum that
gives students experience in modern microscopy techniques. The scanning electron
microscope, an I.S.I. model ABT 55i, with WET-SEM capability and inherent ease
of use by undergraduates, is being used in the introductory biology sequence,
five upper division laboratory courses, and the student-oriented research
program. The instrument serves as the focal element in a curriculum designed to
offer students a progression of vertically-integrated experiences with modern
