ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Directions in Science and Engineering Ethics
Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;A Workshop at Indiana University, June 10 and 11,
2002,&lt;br/&gt;Hosted by the Association for Practical and Professional
Ethics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brian E. Schrag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
supports a one and one-half day workshop to explore new directions in science
and engineering ethics curriculum, focusing primarily on web-based courses. The
fifteen invited participants are leaders in research ethics education or are
expert in the use of computer technology to create on-line research ethics
curriculum. Participants will share their experience and ideas concerning
objectives of research ethics education: new directions in content and pedagogy,
and best uses of computer technology, combined effectively with other
pedagogical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will recommend
standards and guidelines for NSF grant applications that propose curriculum
projects in research ethics, especially on-line curriculum. The main guidelines
that derive from this project will be posted on the web site of the NSF program
Societal Dimensions of Engineering, Science and Technology. The background
papers from which the standards are derived will appear in appropriate
publications where they can benefit the broader audience of professionals in the
field of ethics education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt
