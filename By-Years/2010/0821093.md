The team will construct a computational physics cluster at Alabama A&amp;M
University (AAMU), a historically black land grant institution, to allow leading
edge work in solar physics and space weather modeling. The team will build a
sixteen-node computer cluster, such that each node includes a pair of 64-bit
quad-core processors and Myrinet high-speed interconnect capability. The cluster
will also have 9 TeraBytes of mass storage in a Level 5 RAID array connected to
a head node, as well as associated support equipment. The principal
investigators will include four high-end workstations to perform 2D and 3D
visualizations using model output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the AAMU
Physics Department are partners of the Center for Integrated Space Weather
Modeling (CISM), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center
headed by Boston University. These personnel are involved in validation
activities for integrated space weather models being developed by CISM. Also,
two members of the team are young faculty members, as well as specialists in
solar physics modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAMU Physics Department has
formed the first research group among HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and
Universities) institutions to offer advanced degrees in space physics to
minority students. The cluster will provide a unique facility for research,
allowing the Department to provide advanced training in computational physics
and to strengthen its unique space science research program. This high
performance computational system will also be used by students and faculty of
other research departments at AAMU, such as the Department of Plant and Soil
Science, the Department of Chemistry, and the Department of Engineering.
