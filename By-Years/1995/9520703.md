The proposed research is suitable for an SGER, due to its interdisciplinary
nature, involving applications of geometric modeling and scientific
visualization to provide improved representation and display techniques for the
cornea. The application has the potential of revolutionizing the field of
optometry. Instead of the current trial-and-error method of fitting contact
lenses a much faster and precise procedure can be developed. Furthermore, it
will enable fitting contact lenses to people whose corneas have complex and/or
irregular shapes, something which is impossible with the current state of the
art. A successful completion of the project may induce the manufacturers of
contact lenses to embark on a development effort, but at present they don't have
the financial incentive to take the risk. Thus the small investment in this
project can have significant impact. The PI is highly qualified and is strongly
motivated, due to a personal vision problem. I recommend funding.
