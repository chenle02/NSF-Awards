Regulatory proteins, which bind to specific DNA sequences, control the initial
expression of many genes. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate
the rules that govern specific DNA recognition by regulatory proteins, using a
combination of biochemical experimentation and computational modeling.
Initially, this project will focus on building a complete, unbiased model for
the C2H2 zinc finger protein family. The C2H2 domain is common to many
eukaryotic transcription factors. In order to develop the model, data will be
collected through this project. Furthermore, computational tools will be
developed to analyze the published genomes of yeast, worm, fly and human, in
order to identify potential target genes of the members of the C2H2 family. A
number of yeast predictions will be analyzed further with biochemical methods in
order to assess the success of the method. Finally, the potential of this method
as a general modeling method will be explored further, by attempting to model
other protein families. Successful calculation and comparison of models for
other protein families has the potential to reveal interfamily similarities and
differences. An insight on the general rules that govern the protein-DNA
recognition can be gained this way.
