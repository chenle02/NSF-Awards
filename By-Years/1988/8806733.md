This project is concerned with the numerical analysis of singularly perturbed
ordinary and partial differential equations. Standard numerical approaches have
difficulty in such situations. The main objective of this project is to develop
tools for the construction and analysis of high order finite-difference
discretizations for these problems. The methods employed will consist of a
combination of classical and modern notions of consistency, stability, and
regularity. The development of the discretization schemes will use a general
finite-difference framework and will take place in an environment of realistic
numerical experimentation and rigorous mathematical analysis.
