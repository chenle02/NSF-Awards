Moderate and low pressure plasmas and electrical gas discharges are used in a
variety of technologically important applications (e.g., plasma processing, gas
lasers, plasma switches). The gaseous environments of these plasmas are
unavoidably contaminated with dust and particulate matter originating from
electrodes, walls, and gas phase chemical reactions. In this research program, a
first principles computer model will be developed to describe the perturbation
of plasma properties and the initiation of plasma instabilities by particulate
matter. The goals of developing the model are to predict the change in electron
transport coefficients and the formation of arcs and streamers resulting from
the presence of particulates in moderate to low pressure glow discharges (< 1
atm); and to set operational limits on the tolerance of such discharges to the
size, type, and distribution of particles. The results of this study will
provide a new capability to the designers of long lived gas discharge devices
with which to predict and correct the performance of their devices in the non-
pristine environments in which they must operate. The computational techniques
developed here will also be directly applicable to predicting the onset of
streamer formation from non-uniformities on electrodes.
