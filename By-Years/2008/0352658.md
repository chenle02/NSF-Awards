Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology&lt;br/&gt;Symposium: Recent
Developments in Neurobiology&lt;br/&gt;January 4-8, 2004, New Orleans,
LA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the symposium is to provide experience to in-
training members of the profession, in terms of symposium
presentation/participation at a national meeting. Another is to expose these
individuals to potential employers. We also seek to provide a set of recent
printed evaluations papers to the Neuroscience community through the journal
papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have included two advance assistant professors
in the list of primary speakers, to break with the unwritten "rule" of extending
exclusive invitations to more senior investigators. We choose to honor the
productivity of these young faculties, and at the same time, contribute a
symposium invitation to their upcoming tenure evaluations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
