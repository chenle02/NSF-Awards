DeJong and Heron 9711415 The objective of this study is to provide a deeper
understanding of the socioeconomic adaptation to the U.S. of West Indian
immigrants, an increasing demographic, political and economic force in the U.S.
Specific research questions concern differences in occupational attainment
between men and women in the immigrant population and between the immigrant
population and various native populations; the influence of local labor market
conditions on the process of occupational attainment; and the influence of
different national sociopolitical contexts, represented by the U.S., Canada, and
Britain on the process. The analysis will apply various multivariate techniques
to national census data. ***
