The Southwest Center for Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) was funded to
experiment and demonstrate how advanced technological education can be delivered
over distance learning systems. In the first three years the Center focused on
the development of a distance learning infrastructure, professional development
of faculty and revising materials for distance education delivery. Now the
Center is focusing on development and testing of technical courses that require
a hands-on laboratory component. Some of these courses are being developed in
conjunction with other ATE Centers at Maricopa Community College District and
Bellevue Community College; others are being developed for use at industrial
sites. An AAS degree program for distance learning technicians is also being
developed. The Center is increasing its role in professional development of
faculty and in representing the infrastructure needs of the technical education
community in distance learning networks.
