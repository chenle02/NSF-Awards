The objective of this research is to better understand how midlatitude cyclones
or storms develop. The principal investigator will examine a number of
cyclogenetic processes in the extratropical atmosphere, focusing on the
formation of so-called "short waves" in the upper troposphere, in a series of
case studies. The study will employ high resolution analyses in isentropic
coordinates, using the technique of potential vorticity inversion. Much previous
research on cyclogenesis has dealt with the process after the initial upper-
level shortwaves are evident. In this project, the PI will attempt to identify
the origin of those shortwaves.
