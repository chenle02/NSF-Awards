This project is a Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant to support an
African American anthropologist to consult with leading experts in the
anthropology of emotions, in order to help her do a pilot research project on
the African American women's cultural construction of dysphoria, or depression.
The project involves interviewing groups of women on their understanding of
dysphoria and their techniques for coping with it. The planning grant is
designed to aid the applicant in preparing a full- fledged research proposal on
this subject. This sort of project is important substantively, to further
understanding on sub- cultural variation in how people conceptualize moods and
emotions, and as a technique to increase the representation of minority
scientists in the US.
