This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate objective of this project
is to determine the acceleration mechanism responsible for strong increases of
radiation belt electron fluxes during geomagnetic storms. The project will
calculate Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) wave power from ground-based magnetometer
and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar data for specific time
intervals during which relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt
underwent significant flux enhancements and there was strong ULF wave power.
This will allow for the test two theories of ULF radial diffusion, one that
relies on field line resonance frequencies and another that does not.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2-year postdoc-led project that will support the
development of an independent research career for a young scientist at Virginia
Tech. The understanding developed through this research will also benefit the
National Space Weather program by improving our understanding of the near-Earth
radiation environment during storms.
