This award supports Dr. Raul Lobo and a graduate student from the University of
Delaware in a collaboration with Hellmut Eckert and Hubert Koller of the
Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of MÂ¼nster. The collaboration
brings together the complementary capabilities of the German and U.S. groups to
organic-inorganic interactions in arsenic-synthesized zeolites and their role in
directing the formation of specific zeolite structures. The objective of the
research is to obtain accurate structural and dynamic descriptions of the
guest/host interactions of organic structure-directing agents in arsenic-
synthesized zeolites. The work could lead to methods for constructing materials
with novel pore architectures and to new, accurate structural models that can be
used as the basis of realistic molecular calculations. The work could also have
enormous implications for the understanding and optimization of the catalytic
activity and selectivity of zeolites as industrial catalysts.
