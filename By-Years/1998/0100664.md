In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Veronica Bierbaum of the University of Colorado will pursue
a program of research on the kinetics, mechanisms, and thermochemistry of gas
phase ion-molecule reactions. Tandem flowing afterglow-selected ion flow tube
instruments will be used to study the gas-phase ion thermochemistry of peroxyls,
hexamethylene tetramine, nobornadiene, and pentalene. Nucleophilic substitution
and elimination reactions, their competition, solvation effects, and solvent
kinetic isotope effects will be examined. Reactions of nitrogen and oxygen with
many different ions will be investigated, with special emphasis on anion
chemistry, novel product ions, and isotope exchange. Negative and positive
chemical ionization techniques for volatile organic detection will be extended
to studying rate constants, branching ratios, H/D exchange and CID fragmentation
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the thermochemical data gathered in this
program has relevance to important combustion and atmospheric processes. The
sources of high concentrations of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the earth's
troposphere are not currently understood, but their impact on atmospheric
chemistry is significant. The characterization of biogenic emissions from a
variety of growing and harvested plants addresses this critical problem in
atmospheric chemistry. The experimental results from this research will also
contribute to the fundamental understanding of reaction kinetics and
thermochemistry and will provide valuable intercomparison with
theory.&lt;br/&gt;
