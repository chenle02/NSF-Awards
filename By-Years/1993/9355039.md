9355039 Sinha This proposal requests support for 5 graduate research
traineeships in atmospheric chemistry. The research and education program
described involves the study of a variety of problems in stratospheric and
tropospheric chemistry. In addition to graduate research, a complete graduate
education curriculum in environmental science, with an emphasis on the
atmosphere, is described. The five individual research programs described are
involved in a variety of interdisciplinary and collaborative work. Interactions
between these groups foster and excellent environment for learning all aspects
of atmospheric chemistry. The collective group meetings and course offerings
provide a sound foundation for the proposed training program. Problem solving is
emphasized in the educational process. ***
