This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigator concerned
with the behavior of waves in discrete (lattice) systems and potential
applications related to this. Many physical and biological systems are both
spatially discrete and nonlinear. Examples include crystal lattices,
biopolymers, and nanoelectromechanical devices. The interplay of the discrete
structure and nonlinearity often leads to the formation of spatially localized
nonlinear waves that carry or trap energy. This project will advance fundamental
understanding of properties and stability of nonlinear waves in discrete
structures, which is important in a number of different fields, including
materials science, condensed matter physics, mechanical engineering, and
biophysics. It will also provide insight into the dynamics of nonlinear waves in
two new types of tunable granular metamaterials and develop novel approaches to
channeling and trapping of acoustic energy, with potential applications to
energy harvesting, shock absorption, and vibration mitigation. An integral
component of the project is teaching and training graduate students in the
interdisciplinary research area of nonlinear lattice dynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a new analytical approach to
illuminate the essential role of discreteness in the dynamics of solitary waves
in nonintegrable Hamiltonian lattices. It will clarify how this dynamics is
affected by lattice dimension, nonlocality, nonconvexity, anisotropy, and
heterogeneity, which often play an important role in real physical and
biological discrete systems. The work will be accomplished in part by
constructing semi-analytical solutions for one- and two-dimensional lattices
with piecewise linear interactions. This will provide insight into fully
nonlinear lattice problems, which will be studied through a combination of
asymptotic and numerical methods. A particularly interesting class of
nonintegrable lattices corresponding to locally resonant granular crystals, a
new type of granular material that has additional internal degrees of freedom,
will be considered. Through a combination of analytical, numerical, and
experimental work, the PI and her collaborators will investigate the dynamics of
solitary waves, breathers, and other nonlinear waves in these systems, focusing
on the phenomena of energy trapping, wave redirection, and attenuation, which
are of both fundamental and practical interest.
