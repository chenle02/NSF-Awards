This proposal describes the design, characterization and development of an
energy-aware sensor middleware framework applied to functional mediation between
emerging sensor network protocols and their applications. The work focuses on
applications and protocol integration using innovative sensor middleware that
addresses sensor energy economy and network adaptation. Constraints in hardware
and available energy of the sensor&lt;br/&gt;nodes give rise to additional
restrictions in terms of the size and processing requirements of middleware
software. This proposal addresses these requirements and provides a middleware
design solution that can operate in tandem with the existing sensor network and
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocols, and can be implemented for a number
of emerging sensor network applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
