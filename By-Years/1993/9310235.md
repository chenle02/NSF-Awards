9310235 Kouri The implementation of newly developed theoretical formalism,
Distributed Approximating Functions (DAF), is proposed for studying large scale
quantum dynamics on massively parallel machines. The formalism has been tested
successfully in various 1 D, 2 D and 3 D scattering problems in the frame of
time dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) by the methods of the real time
Feynman path integral and matrix vector multiplication. The real time Feynman
which is made practically useful by the DAF, will make the calculation of many
body, high dimension quantum scattering systems more feasible.
