This project will investigate the use of naturally-occurring radon as a tracer
for gas exchange in seasonally ice-covered waters in the Arctic Ocean, using
ships of opportunity for sampling. At its maximum extent, sea ice covers nearly
10% of the ocean surface, which creates an important control on the exchange of
heat and biogenic gases (CO2, O2, DMS) between the ocean and atmosphere. In the
Arctic, the summer minimum in sea ice cover is rapidly decreasing and this
implies a greater oscillation between the minimum and maximum sea ice extents.
The effect of this increased oscillation on the net air-sea exchange of gases is
not certain because sea ice is interconnected with upper ocean physics and
biology. What appears certain, is that the Arctic surface ocean will experience
greater variability in ice cover and this increase in variability emphasizes the
need for a predictive map of air-sea gas exchange versus the forcing conditions
in the sea ice zone. Sea surface convection during freezing, stratification by
meltwater, and the presence of interspersed ice floes may exert important
controls on the gas transfer velocity and flux of biogenic gases. A well-
constrained determination of the flux of CO2 in sea ice, and in turn a well-
constrained budget of polar ocean carbon, will require more detailed knowledge
of gas transfer velocity in the presence of sea ice. This study proposes to make
an exploratory map of the scaling relationship between the gas transfer velocity
and the forcing conditions in the seasonal sea ice zone, by combining estimates
of the gas transfer velocity from radon measurements with forcing conditions
(such as wind and upper ocean turbulence) from Arctic Observing Network
measurements and from model results. In addition to its impact on understanding
carbon cycling, the project will support an early career investigator, and a
graduate student.
