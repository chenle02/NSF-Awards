Large-scale coordination tasks are becoming increasingly important in hazardous,
uncertain, and time-stressed environments such as rescue operations and disaster
response. In such environments, human rescuers must rapidly make decisions while
under stress and with incomplete and dynamic information, that may save or put
lives at risk. The proposed multidisciplinary research is founded on three key
advances/technical ideas. 1) Teams of Autonomous Agents: Cyber Agents, Robots
and People (CARPs) are hybrid teams that consist of large number of these
entities, distributed in space and time and varying in capability and role. (2)
A cooperative control paradigm facilitates the sharing of a) common goals, b)
initiatives for communication and action, c) responsibilities for coherent group
activity, d) information on the environment, mission, and situation, and e)
assistance to overcoming barriers for various members of CARP groups whether
human, robot or cyber-agent. (3) The key challenges for team formation and
coordination in large-scale, uncertain coordination domains include ad hoc
interoperability across different agents, teams and organizations that are
brought together "as is", and co-adaptation to each other and to changing
priorities and roles within the team. The impact of having CARP technology
successfully deployed will allow robots to advance beyond niche roles in a
handful of industries; instead they will be integrated into the larger society
of humans and information systems in the workplace. Emergency response teams are
an early high-payoff test domain as robots can go places normally dangerous to
humans, thus saving rescuers' and victims' lives.
