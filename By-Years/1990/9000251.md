The University of Southern California is in the process of converting the tuna
clipper OSPREY into a research vessel that will be named the R/V VICKERS.
Funding for the purchase and conversion of the vessel has been supplied mainly
from private sources. NSF will supply funds for one 10-day cruise aboard the
vessel in 1990. This grant is for one year only. This vessel is part of a fleet
used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research
projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized
equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number
of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a
ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also
requires hightly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These
vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels,
and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically
dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities
and research institutions around the country.
