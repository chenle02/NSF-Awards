The project will accomplish three objectives: (1) development of innovative
methods for interactive teaching and testing engineering students by computer;
(2) development of courseware in Statics , a mandatory lower division course for
the majority of engineering students); and (3) testing, modifying, and
implementing the courseware. Alabama A&M University at Normal, Alabama, and
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville are the project subcontractors.
They are now teaching these courses to a large number of students with diverse
backgrounds and will be participating in the development, testing, and
dissemination of the courseware. Five problem-solving oriented lessons and 5
examinations in a cT-version for stand-alone computers (Macintosh and PC) and a
NovaNET system version, will present students with new problems each time the
lessons are used. Students will be able to work problems on their own, supported
by continuous and appropriate feedback throughout the problem solving process.
Instead of multiple-choice tests, sophisticated constructed student responses
such as algebraic expressions, sentences, and cursor location will be judged by
computer. These innovative instructional materials will be disseminated to other
engineering schools all of which teach the Statics course.
