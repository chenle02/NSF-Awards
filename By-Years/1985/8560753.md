This work is concerned with the fabrication of optical lens by using what is
termed a graded index. Rather than vary the shape as with a conventional lens,
the material properties are varied such that the speed of light is changed. By
slowing down the speed in the center of a cylindrically shaped lightwave
transmission medium, the light can be focussed and thus a lens can be simulated.
This gradient index optical design has not been prevalent in this country.
