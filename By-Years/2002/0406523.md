Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CONFERENCE: Eighth International Symposium
on Avian Endocrinology, Scottsdale, AZ June 6-11, 2004&lt;br/&gt;PI: Carol M
Vleck, Institution: Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal is a request for $12,000 from the NSF to support participant costs for
up to 30 participating graduate students and recent postdocs from US
institutions to attend. The International Symposium on Avian Endocrinology
(ISAE) has been held approximately every four years since 1977. The objective of
the conference is to provide a review of the field of avian endocrinology and to
bring scientists from multiple sub-disciplines together for information exchange
and the development of collaborations. The 8th ISAE will be held in June,
&lt;br/&gt;2004 in Scottsdale, Arizona and will be hosted by Arizona State
University. This is only the second time the meeting has been held in the United
States and the first time in 20 years. As such, it provides a golden opportunity
to engage US students and recent graduates with colleagues from across the
globe. Information will be exchanged in plenary lectures, invited symposium
talks, poster sessions and informally during meals, social events and the
mid-&lt;br/&gt;conference day of arranged field trips. Participants from more
than 20 countries are expected. Based on conferences, the Symposium will foster
the exchange of new information and facilitate many cooperative, international
projects and will create opportunities for promising young students and
postdoctoral researchers to participate fully in this international conference.
It will also provide US students and postdocs with the opportunity to interact
and form collaborations with each other and with researchers from across the
globe.
