This joint work between Prof. Mani Soma (U. of Washington) and Jacob Abraham (U.
of Texas). The research is on fault models, test generation, and design
verification for analog and mixed-signal Integrated circuits. A top-down
approach to test and verification in mixed-signal design is being pursued.
Research topics include the following. Develop algorithms for abstracting a
circuit from the description of a mixed-signal circuit. Define testability
figures of merit for major analog blocks such as converters, filters, etc., and
develop methods to compute them. Investigate algorithms to evaluate testability
of mixed-signal design using high level design information. For design
verification, the group is finding accurate transformation algorithms to map
analog blocks to discretized form. Also, abstractions to reduce state space
complexity during verification are being explored. The algorithms and methods
are being built into testability and test tools.
