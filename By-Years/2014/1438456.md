Energy Systems

The convergence of competition in the power industry with the arrival of
environmentally friendly micro-turbines, fuel cells, photovoltaics, small wind
turbines, and other advanced distributed power technologies has sparked strong
interest in distributed power generation. This convergence of policy and
technology promises to transform the electric power system from one relying
primarily on central generation to one in which Distributed Energy Resources
(DERs) provide most of the power needed. The resulting major improvement in
power reliability, quality and efficiency; and the greater flexibility to
respond to changing energy needs could save billions of dollars now lost each
year because of power disruptions. An important challenge with this evolution --
especially in light of the increasing number and diversity of DERs -- is the
development of integrated monitoring, control and coordination strategies that
would ensure optimal dispatch of the energy resources to provide highly reliable
services under various disturbance and failure scenarios. This is significant
given the fact that the distributed power market is driven by the need for
reliable high-quality power, and the substantial impact that local disruptions
in power flow can have when the DERs are integrated to support grid operations.

The objective of this research project is to resolve the fundamental issues that
arise in the fault-tolerant dispatch of DERs through the development of a
hierarchical architecture for the integration of monitoring and supervisory
fault-tolerant control. In this architecture, distributed monitoring and fault-
tolerant control systems that perform timely fault identification and control
system reconfiguration at the local level are integrated with a higher-level
supervisor that optimally coordinates power generation in the event that local
fault rectification is not possible. This hierarchy enables the timely
mitigation of faults with supervisory oversight. To achieve these objectives,
the following projects are planned: (1) the development of an integrated
approach for local model-based fault identification and accommodation in stand-
alone DERs, (2) the design of robust monitoring and reconfiguration strategies
that account for intrinsic uncertainties due to intermittent power generation in
renewable DERs, external disturbances, and data losses and errors, (3) the
design of an optimization-based supervisory control system that reconfigures the
power dispatch strategy following failure events, and (4) applications of the
developed methods to simulated models of hybrid DERs.
