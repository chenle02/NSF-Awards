This project aims to develop efficient tools of mathematical analysis to
investigate challenging problems arising in optimization, systems control, and
other fields of applied mathematics unified under the name of variational
analysis. This new form of analysis employs generalized differential calculus
when the standard calculus methods are not available. The main motivation for
developing these tools of analysis is to solve a number of practical problems of
engineering, mechanics, and behavioral sciences. Results of this project arm
researchers and practitioners with new machinery that make it possible to solve
problems that provide valuable insight to practical
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on second-order variational
analysis, which has been largely underinvestigated from both viewpoints of
theoretical studies and practical applications. It carries out a systematic
development of generalized differential tools of second-order analysis, with
applications to the design and justification of numerical algorithms in
nonsmooth optimization and related areas. Among other directions of research,
the project applies second-order variational analysis to broad classes of
finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional variational systems, which go far
beyond optimization and optimal control. Results will be beneficial to both
applied mathematics and applied science communities.
