A user mode research program will be carried out in medium energy hadronic and
electromagnetic nuclear physics. Polarization studies relating to properties of
the nucleon and of few body systems will be carried out at the SATURNE facility
(Saclay, France), at the MIT/Bates electron linac, and at CEBAF. New and much
more precise data on the charge structure of the proton will be obtained at
Bates and in the future at CEBAF. At Saclay, data will be obtained on
polarization variables leading to improved understanding of the deuteron, and
will also provide important polarimeter calibration data essential for the CEBAF
and MIT/Bates core research programs. Experiment planning and detector
development work will be carried out relating to these and other approved
activities at Bates and at CEBAF. Simulations, data analysis, interpretation,
and other related activities will be carried out at William &amp; Mary.
