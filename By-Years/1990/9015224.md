This Industry Internship project will be carried out in collaboration with
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), a major manufacturer of electronic
components. The objective of the project is to develop a set of decision support
tools for the effective scheduling and operation of a surface-mount production
time. The analysis of generic scheduling algorithms and their operation within
this environment will also be assessed.
