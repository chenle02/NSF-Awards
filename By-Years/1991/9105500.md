This research deals with fractals and the fractal dimension of self-similar
fracture patterns observed in the crust, and the loading conditions under which
they were formed. Three known loading conditions that have different fractal
dimensions are shear-deformed granular material, sequential-growth fractures,
and shock-loaded fractures. This research will extend the analysis by
investigating fault-deformed rock from the San Andreas fault, shocked materials
from laboratory work, and other laboratory and computer simulation experiments.
Fractal dimension relates to the relative frequency of large versus small
fractures and may bear on estimations of earthquake frequency of occurrence.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
