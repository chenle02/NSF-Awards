This is a project for research on nonlinear partial differential equations with
applications to singular perturbations, optimal control theory and differential
games, mechanics, nonlinear waves, etc. The general topics of this research
include: a) Singular perturbations of reaction-diffusion type; b) First- and
second-order PDE's of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs type; c) Porous medium
equations; d) Nonlinear waves. These topics are unified by the common
methodology of partial differential equations. This research is part of applied
mathematical analysis.
