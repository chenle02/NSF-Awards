9455393 Hubele Title: New Engineering Statistics Course With a Virtual Computer
Laboratory A new engineering statistics course with a virtual computer
laboratory addresses the problem of offering a computer laboratory-based course
in a university with large enrollments and few computer laboratories. The aim of
this project is to design and implement an integrated classroom and laboratory
experience for junior-level engineering students who can communicate with fellow
classmates and instructors using electronic mail and file transfer software from
their residence or place of work. Computer modem access is the only necessary
student hardware. Statistical solutions to multi-disciplinary engineering
problems are created by student teams using statistical methods discussed over
the university's existing communication network. The statistical laboratory
materials being developed by various researchers are integrated into this
virtual laboratory setting, thus making all results accessible to a larger
audience. Classroom, laboratory and course assessments comparing this new course
to a traditional engineering statistics course offer educators the opportunity
to evaluate the validity of this integrated course for their technical course
offerings.
