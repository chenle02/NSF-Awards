9413383 Cameron The present grant will support the design and procurement of a
new injector synchrotron (CIS) to enhance the capabilities of the existing
synchotron and electron-cooled storage ring (the Cooler). The Cooler provides a
unique capability in this country to perform a class of experiments using thin
internal targets in the ring. The CIS would increase stored beam intensity by an
order of magnitude, improve stability and ease of operation, and reduce
operating costs. A number of important experiments will benefit from or only be
possible with CIS. ***
