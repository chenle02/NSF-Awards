This project represents a partnership with community colleges, industry,
regional high schools, and universities to establish an industry-aligned pathway
in cloud computing. Technology sectors have shown significant demand for cloud-
certified information technology professionals. Collaboratively-developed and
industry-led curriculum in cloud computing will lead to a Cloud Fundamentals
Certification, stackable toward an Associate of Applied Science with Cloud
Specialization. This project leverages existing collaborations among the
institutions to create labs and share curriculum development best practices. The
target audience for the project will be two-year college students, including
veterans and incumbent workers. This project addresses the national call to
increase the supply of qualified technicians proficient in cloud
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a survey of Tech Chief Financial Officers,
cloud computing was selected by 74% of those surveyed as the technology that had
the most impact on their business in 2017. The goal of the project is to
establish an industry-aligned pathway in cloud computing to increase the supply
of qualified technicians with proficiency in cloud technology. Project goals
will be achieved by working with industry partners who will provide expertise
and guidance in curriculum design. The project will develop products that will
be disseminated to other institutions including: a new industry-led curriculum
in cloud computing, a cloud literacy initiative, a professional development
community of practice, and an outreach plan for military
veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
