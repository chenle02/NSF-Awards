Abstract for the proposal DMS- 0245385 of Stembridge and
Fomin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will continue their
study of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;structures arising in algebra, representation
theory and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and to develop software tools to assist
researchers in&lt;br/&gt;these areas. One example of such structures are the
cluster algebras,&lt;br/&gt;designed to provide a concrete algebraic framework
for dual canonical&lt;br/&gt;bases and total positivity in semisimple groups.
Our investigations&lt;br/&gt;will also include the study of generalized Kostka-
Foulkes polynomials,&lt;br/&gt;sub-Coxeter arrangements, and the combinatorics
of crystal graphs and&lt;br/&gt;generalized
associahedra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In selecting combinatorial problems and
conjectures to investigate,&lt;br/&gt;the proposers intent has been to identify
areas that are most likely to&lt;br/&gt;provide insight into other disciplines.
Indeed, combinatorics has an&lt;br/&gt;important role to play in an ever
widening array of applications in&lt;br/&gt;both mathematics and computer
science; this increasing importance is&lt;br/&gt;related to the demand for
explicit or algorithmic understanding of&lt;br/&gt;discrete structures, and has
grown in tandem with the prominence of&lt;br/&gt;computation in nearly all
phases of research in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
