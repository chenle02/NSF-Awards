9412179 Bachalo This project will lead to the development of a novel diagnostic
that can simultaneously measure the velocity, size, and temperature of
individual droplets in spray flames, and measure the gas phase temperature filed
surrounding burning droplets in addition to their velocity, size, and
temperature in controlled experiments involving single droplets, streams, or
arrays of droplets. There are no equivalent commercial instruments in the market
today. The prototype instrument will be applied to the study of droplet
interaction in the combustion of high grade and low grade fuels. the effects of
various environmental effects such as chemical composition and temperature, and
fluid dynamical effects such as turbulence and acoustic oscillations, on droplet
heatup and vaporization will be experimentally studied. The transient
heating/ignition of fuel droplets will also be studied.
