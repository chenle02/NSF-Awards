An experimental and numerical/analytical study will be made of the delamination
mechanics of polymer coated systems under contact stresses. Thin polymer
coatings are used in many situations, e.g., in electronic and optical
applications. An indentation-induced debonding test will be used to determine
the adhesive shear strength of polymer coatings. Scanning laser acoustic
microscope and a modified microhardness tester will be used to measure
interfacial debonding characteristics in opaque systems. Contact mechanics
models (analytical and finite element) will be developed.
