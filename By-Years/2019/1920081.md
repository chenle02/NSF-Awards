The process by which trauma experienced by one generation impacts the
environment and biology of subsequent generations is referred to as
"transgenerational transmission." This doctoral research project will examine
how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma impact the epigenetic DNA
methylation profile of grandchildren, within a population that has experienced
highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The project will advance
knowledge about human biology and interactions between biology, culture and
environment. Project outcomes may inform public health research and
interventions for at-risk communities. The project will also support student
training in a STEM field, and the research will be shared with local partners in
education and health, as well as research and practice communities in early
childhood development nationally and internationally. Resulting data will allow
other researchers to validate or replicate findings in the growing research area
of biological embedding and toxic stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent
decades, researchers have begun to investigate mechanisms that may help to
explain the greater rates of psychological distress and chronic disease seen in
children within populations that have experienced extreme stress and adversity.
The present research will use questionnaire, hormone, and DNA methylation data
to examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma - especially
those that occurred while the mother or child was in utero - impact child
genetic expression and regulation of the stress response. Community-engaged
research in this context provides a unique opportunity to study the
transgenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma-related changes to the
stress response and to learn about the risk and resilience factors that shape
child development in the wake of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
