This project is supporting a workshop to explore issues relating to
sustainability and institutionalization of projects funded under the STEM Talent
Expansion Program (STEP). In particular, the workshop is bringing together
Principal Investigators of both new and established STEP projects with
representatives from regional Workforce Development organizations from around
the country. The seeds of this effort lie in the experiences of the STEP project
leadership at the University of Central Florida who have successfully engaged
with staff at Workforce Central Florida (WCF), which is that region's authority
for workforce planning, programs, and the regional labor market. The primary
expected outcome of this workshop is the creation of a set of new partnerships
between STEP grantees and Workforce Development organizations from the different
projects' respective regions.
