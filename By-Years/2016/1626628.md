A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation for the R/V
Oceanus, a 177? research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel
owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State
University. Until 2012, the vessel had been operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution but was then retired. OSU determined that the vessel was in better
material condition than their ship R/V Wecoma so they took Oceanus and retired
Wecoma. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the
Pacific Northwest. R/V Oceanus completed 205 days in 2015, 126 (61%) of which
were for NSF. In 2016, the vessel is scheduled to sail 196 days with 77% (151
days) of the schedule for NSF. With this proposal, OSU provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Triaxus Cable Housing
$6,000&lt;br/&gt;2) Altimeter $3,286&lt;br/&gt;3) Triaxus Computer System
$5,000&lt;br/&gt; $14,286&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
