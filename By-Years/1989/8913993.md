The Kamchatka Peninsula in the eastern Soviet Union is an area of great
geological interest. Its southern half is part of the Pacific "ring of fire"
containing 105 volcanoes, 29 which are currently active. Of particular interests
are several epithermal gold and mercury deposits in the northern Kamchatka.
While the Kamchatka has long been considered off-limits to foreigners, the
northern Kamchatka has recently been opened. This travel grant to Craig Chesner
of Michigan Technological University and Art Ettlinger of Washington State
University will enable them to accept an invitation from the Soviet Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Volcanology to visit the northern Kamchatka and
contiguous areas of eastern Siberia to inspect epithermial deposits and to
determine the feasibility of long-term cooperative research.
