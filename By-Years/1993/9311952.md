9311952 Chafetz Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative
research effort between the University of Houston and the University of Fes,
Morocco. The project will focus on newly discovered travertine deposits in
Morocco. Travertine is a limestone that forms at the surface from spring waters
due to biotic and abiotic processes. The investigators (Drs. H. Chafetz from the
University of Houston and B. Akdim from the University of Fes) will conduct
field and laboratory work to determine whether these newly discovered but as yet
unstudied travertine deposits display multiple episodes of formation and whether
they are cold or hot water deposits. By answering these questions, Chafetz and
Akdim will evaluate paleoclimatic conditions as well as provide valuable
insights into the origin and diagenesis of travertines. Project funding will
enable the researchers to jointly conduct fieldwork and to visit each other's
laboratory over the course of this three-year study. This project in geology and
paleontology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Morocco to combine
complementary talents and conduct research in areas of strong mutual interest
and competence. ***
