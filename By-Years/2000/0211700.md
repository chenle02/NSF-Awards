The convergence of modern genomic approaches with other areas of biology holds
great promise for insights into central problems in development and evolution.
One of the more vexing challenges has been to unravel the complex relationship
between morphological and developmental change and evolutionary processes at the
molecular level. In this project morphological, evolutionary, and genomic
approaches will be integrated in an analysis of the genetic basis of the
developmental transformations that occurred during cotton fiber evolution. By
dissecting distinct stages in this morphological series, unparalleled insight
will be gained into the genes involved in evolutionary transformations of cotton
fiber during: (a) divergence among wild species; (b) early stages of
domestication; (c) modern crop improvement; and (d) chromosome doubling. Cotton
is unique in that four different species were independently domesticated from
different wild ancestors, two each in the Old World and New Worlds. The former
have two sets of chromosomes (they are "diploid") whereas this number is doubled
(they are "polyploid") in the latter. By including all of these species, the
research will detail the comparative genetics of plant domestication and the
extent to which parallel selection has led to convergent or parallel patterns of
gene expression change. In addition, the experiments will shed new light on the
intriguing hypothesis that genome doubling has led to novel avenues for crop
improvement. Additional experiments will reveal the patterns of genome size
change among species that vary several-fold in genome size, and lead to insights
regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this evolutionary change. In
addition this project will contribute significantly to enhancement of the
world's leading textile fiber through the development of important tools and
resources necessary for long-term sustainability. These include an expanded set
of expressed sequence tagged genes ("ESTs"); a "fingerprint map" for the cotton
genome; an improved resource of bacterial artificial chromosomes ("BACs") for
ready cloning of important cotton genes and other uses; and detailed information
on gene expression for key stages in cotton fiber development. Human resources
will also be developed, with special emphasis given to members of historically
under-represented groups, through myriad connections to undergraduate and
graduate education, K-12 and outreach efforts, and scientific exchanges.
