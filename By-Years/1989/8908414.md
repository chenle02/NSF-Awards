This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
bioelectrochemistry. During the twelve month period beginning 1 September 1989,
Professor Stankovich will undertake a program to develop expertise in genetic
engineering such that she can produce metalloenzymes with well-defined molecular
characteristics to serve as models with which she can test theories of
biological electron transfer processes. To acquire this expertise, Professor
Stankovich will collaborate with Professor Grant Mauk of the University of
British Columbia who is an expert in the area of site directed mutagenesis. This
Career Advancement Award will enable Professor Stankovich to broaden
significantly her research capabilities in the area of bioelectrochemistry. The
results of this research could bear significantly on the current understanding
of biological electron transfer processes.
