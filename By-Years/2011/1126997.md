Of the 6,000-7,000 languages now spoken globally, it is estimated that 90% will
be replaced by dominant languages, and that the majority will be extinct by the
end of this century. The loss of language entails the loss of cultural,
ecological, and a myriad of other types of knowledge. For the scientific
community, it is akin to losing a species. One area in which government
agencies, scholars, and community members have placed great effort is developing
long term digital language resources grounded in documentation, preservation and
maintenance. As a result of this work, progress has been made in terms of best
practices and policies for developing long term web-based language resources
that have the potential to stifle language loss. In order to apply and expand
the knowledge garnered over these last few years in this area for the purpose of
documenting and preserving languages, a two-day planning session is proposed
that brings together members of geographically diverse language communities in
the United States and linguists. The project will answer two questions: (A) In
what ways can the academic community and language communities work together to
document and archive endangered languages using digital and online resources;
(B) How best are language data storage and retrieval, community needs, and
scientific inquiry integrated to preserve language loss and advance
understanding. The culmination of the planning session will be: (1)
identification of community infrastructure needs to support online and digital
documentary resources; (2) identification of educational needs in terms of best
practice for documentation and archiving; (3) identification of language
resource and development of documentation plans for needed resources; (4)
development of curriculum and resources (5) development of proposals for further
funding for the implementation of documentation, archiving and curriculum for
best practices.
