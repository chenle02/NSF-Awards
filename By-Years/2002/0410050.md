0089897&lt;br/&gt;Wyslouzil&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Barbara Wyslouzil and
students from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in a collaboration Reinhard
Strey of the Department of Biology at the University of Cologne, Germany. The
project will focus on investigating homogeneous vapor-to-liquid nucleation,
which plays an important role in many atmospheric and industrial processes.
Through cooperation with the German group, different methods experimental
methods will be compared-in Worcester, a supersonic nozzle apparatus will be
used; in Cologne, a nucleation pulse chamber; and at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, a small-angle neutron scattering chamber. The results
of the research will spur further theoretical development and advance the entire
field of nucleation research by providing accurate measurements of nucleation
rates over a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Exchange of junior
researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their training
and to allow them to establish international connections early in their
careers.&lt;br/&gt;
