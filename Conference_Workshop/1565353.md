This award provides funding for the "Conference on Analysis and Geometry," to be
held at Princeton University from January 26 to 29, 2016.

The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the
fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and geometric
analysis. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers
who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a
chance to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee
will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a
number of different activities. More information will be made available at:
