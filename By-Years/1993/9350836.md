9350836 Sauer This project upgrades and augments the use of a ten station
physics laboratory by allowing students the use of computers and other state-of-
the-art equipment. In these laboratories students examine the physical laws and
concepts of physics not only by experimentation during laboratory sessions, but
also on an individual basis from assignments made in the classroom or honors
class. By the use of the computer and computer interfacing with sensors, they
are able to more quickly and more carefully analyze data while controlling the
variables in their experiments. By using CD ROM and interactive computer
software, they will be better able to study the concepts in their honors
projects or the concepts presented as classroom activities. The project is
structured to help increase the students' analytical abilities, to augment their
understanding of the physical laws of nature, and to develop their skill in
using modern scientific apparatus. With the integration of the new equipment in
the laboratory the students gain experiences that go well beyond those that they
would have received in traditional general and introductory physics laboratory
programs. ***
