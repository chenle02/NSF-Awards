The process of designing or upgrading a large-scale
broadband&lt;br/&gt;communication infrastructure involves solving several
optimization problems, including&lt;br/&gt;the problems of optimum topology
design, server placement, distribution&lt;br/&gt;and replication of data between
the servers, and fair division of&lt;br/&gt;limited network resources (e.g.
bandwidth, CPU cycles, etc.) among the users. As&lt;br/&gt;networks become
larger and more complicated, it becomes imperative to&lt;br/&gt;use
mathematically sound, scalable methods for solving the above
problems.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop and implement such
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main thrusts of the project is
development of new approaches&lt;br/&gt;for network design and sizing. In
particular, the project focuses on&lt;br/&gt;development of optimization
techniques where the goal is to construct a low cost&lt;br/&gt;topology, choose
optimum locations (and sizes) for servers (e.g. web&lt;br/&gt;caches,
application servers, wireless hubs, etc.), and decide how
to&lt;br/&gt;replicated the data. A related problem is
network&lt;br/&gt;expansion/augmentation, where the goal is to decide (online)
where to&lt;br/&gt;place new equipment and to choose which new links to lease in
order to&lt;br/&gt;satisfy the increased demand. Due to economies of scale,
topology design&lt;br/&gt;and augmentation problems have concave costs structure
and hence can not&lt;br/&gt;be solved by classical flow-based approaches. The
investigators work on&lt;br/&gt;developing principled approaches for solving the
above problems and on&lt;br/&gt;designing and implementing a set of tools that
can be used in the&lt;br/&gt;planning and network management process.
