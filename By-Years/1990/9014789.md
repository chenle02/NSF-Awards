Professor Kleppa is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Metallurgy, Ceramics and
Electronics Materials Program of the Division of Materials Research to perform
high temperature calorimetric measurements on refractory materials. This
research will provide data which are critically important in the design of new
high temperature composites and other high temperature materials. Professor
Kleppa will study the high temperature calorimetry of alloys involving
transition metals which form intermetallic compounds with particular emphasis on
compounds of early transition metals with late transition metals. He will also
begin a new research program involving the thermochemistry of transition metal
phosphides. The experimental technique used in obtaining these data is known as
solute-solvent drop calorimetry, and Kleppa plans to extend the utility of the
technique to temperatures above 1400K.
