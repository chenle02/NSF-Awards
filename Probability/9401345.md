The Principal Investigator will study sums of independent random variables. The
research will focus primarily on identifying the best possible constants in
inequalities for moments and tail probabilities for such sums. The case of
randomly stopped sums will be investigated as well. The Principal Investigator
will study certain problems concerning sums of random variables. A primary focus
of the proposed research is to establish precise quantitative information on the
behavior of such sums. A more complex situation, in which a number of summands
is itself a random quantity, will be investigated as well.
