This project is focussed on the combinatorial properties of convex polyhedra
and their implications for linear programming and combinatorial optimization.
Included in this are efforts to completely characterize the numbers of faces of
simple, unbounded polyhedra and to further describe the algebraic properties of
polytopes and PL-spheres.
