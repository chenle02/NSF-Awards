Dr. Nora M. Haenn (North Carolina State University), in collaboration with
researchers at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur in Mexico, will undertake research
on the interactions between rainforest conservation and migration from Mexico to
the United States. One-fourth of Mexico's parks and protected areas are located
in the southern parts of that country, places where large-scale international
migration has only recently become the norm. Because southern Mexico is also
home to tropical ecosystems, the research asks how migration affects rainforest
conservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will investigate the impact
of international migration on rainforest protection by surveying 200 rural
families living on the border of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. Calakmul is
Mexico's largest protected area for tropical ecosystems. The survey will pose
questions on agricultural and forestry activities, migration, and remittances.
The investigators previously carried out similar surveys in Calakmul, when
international migration from this region was unusual. By comparing past findings
with current land use and migration trends, the research aims to identify the
impact of migration on forest cover. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is
significant because it will address the connections between two significant
trends in the contemporary world: on-going land cover change and dynamic
international labor migration. These topics are not usually linked in either
social science theory or policy development. But because local conservation
efforts are increasingly focused on local household participation, even as adult
male household heads are frequently working abroad, investigation of those
linkages is critical. The research also builds ties between U.S. and Mexican
institutions and supports student education.
