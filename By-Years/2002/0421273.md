0421273&lt;br/&gt;Menq&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to image biomolecules at high
spatial resolution and manipulate them at the nanoscale level in living
mammalian cells. The proposed information aggregation technology if successful
will lead to automated visual-guiding systems with which AFM tracking of
targeted biomolecules could be possible. Furthermore, the proposed system
provides 3D surface information instead of a 2D image. These advances are
important when applying the AFM imaging and manipulation to biological systems.
