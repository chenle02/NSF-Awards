The research collections maintained by the Division of Birds at the Field
Museum of Natural History represent a significant portion of the world's avian
specimen material. The scope of the collections in terms of species
representation (80% of the world's species in the skin collection, 20 % in the
skeletal collection and 15% in the pickled collection), the recency of the
majority of the specimens and the superb state of curation make the collections
at the Field Museum a premier resource for evolutionary biologists. With the
changes in the world's avifauna (both in distribution and absolute numbers)
brought about by man's activities and the increasing difficulty in obtaining
permits for further collecting, the value of the Museum's specimens is
incalculable. To protect the collection better and make information about it
more accessible to the scientific community, this project will start
computerization of the collection data. Computerization will improve the staff's
ability to answer collection inquiries, will vastly improve access to collection
information for visiting professionals and other potential users, will allow the
staff to determine what geographic areas and what taxa are poorly represented in
the collection, and will increase collection security by enabling the staff to
know at all times where each specimen should be located.
