Arias will investigate several problems in Banach space theory with
applications to operator theory and probability. The main areas of research will
be the local theory of Banach spaces, nest algebras for a Banach space
perspective, and finite- dimensional operator theory. Banach space theory is
that part of mathematics that attempts to generalize to infinitely many
dimensions the structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The
axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those
for Euclidean distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to
hold.), and as a result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.
Much of the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of
Banach spaces.
