Western knowledge of major Precambrian tectonic and lithologic elements in the
basement of the Silurian plate is limited, although considerable data on that
geology exists in the (former) USSR. This action provides support for O.M.
Rosen, an expert on the Siberian plate, to collaborate with workers at the New
Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in evaluating and analyzing much of
the existing information. Results should provide a compilation of relevant data
and several manuscripts that will be of considerable value to western workers in
the Arctic basin including Alaska.
