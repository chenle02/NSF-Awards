The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide 24 months of support to Dr. Kellee Tsai to work with Dr.
Houyi Zhang at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, China on a
study of capitalism without democracy, the political orientation of private
entrepreneurs in China. The Political Science Program of NSF is providing
partial support of this project.

This project will analyze the political orientation of private entrepreneurs in
China by conducting a national survey of private entrepreneurs in collaboration
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The survey results will speak to
the controversial issue of whether China's growing private sector constitutes
the basis of a pro-democratic middle class.

Dr. Zhang is the Director of the Rural Sociology Research Division of CASS who
has worked on national projects funded by the PRC State Council, National
Economic Reform Foundation, National Industry and Commercial Bureau and serves
on the Board of all the key national research entities involved in private
sector research.
