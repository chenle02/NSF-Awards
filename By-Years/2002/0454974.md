This project will develop analytical methods to speciate by functional groups
the water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) in atmospheric aerosols using solid
phase extraction techniques. The goal is to apply this method to the Particle-
Into-Liquid Sampler (PILS), expanding its capabilities for online measurements
of broad classes of the organic aerosol. The methods will be evaluated through
measurements in urban Atlanta, GA, and surrounding rural regions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Organic carbon compounds often comprise a significant fraction of
fine atmospheric particles, and a major sub-fraction of these are soluble in
water. In many cases water-soluble particulate organic carbon is formed from
secondary organic aerosol formation, a complex process that can be a significant
source of fine particle mass. This demonstration project will lead to the
development of measurement techniques that can be deployed in both ground-based
and airborne studies in online and automated measurements, leading to a better
characterization of the fine particle carbonaceous component and a better
understanding of fine particle formation mechanisms. This project will support
the work of a graduate student.
