ABSTRACT

The principal investigator proposes to study three problems in the area of
partial differential equations, namely the nonlinear two-phase elliptic free
boundary problem, symmetrization for diffusion equations with bounded measurable
coefficients and symmetric behavior of solutions of nonlinear parabolic
equations. These problems defy the standard treatments which succeed in solving
linear problems or equations in divergence form because of their nonlinear or
non-divergent structural nature. Therefore, solution of these problems will not
only contributes knowledge about these partial differential equations, but also
inspires new ideas which will most probably prove useful in studying other
nonlinear partial differential equations or equations of other types. The
suggested methods in this proposal either successfully solved part of the
problems or are motivated by the ideas that are most likely to lead to the
solution of these problems.

The study of the theory of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial
differential equations and diffusion processes becomes increasingly important in
the area of partial differential equations. The problems studied by the
principal investigator in this project motivate ideas that lead to the creation
of some methods that might succeed in treating other partial differential
equation problems as well. Solving these problems gives affirmative answer to
the question of the well- posedness of these mathematical models which originate
in physics and other disciplines. In addition, the theoretical treatment of
these problems will shed light on the numerical solution of these and related
problems. Taking into account the origins of these problems, one is liable to
believe applications of the theory about these problems can be sought in
disciplines other than mathematics.
