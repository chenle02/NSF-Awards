This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prepare robust
biocatalysts to endure extremes of temperature, pH, water tension
(lyophilization), long term storage and protease attack. Preparation methods are
technically facile, economical in material and labor costs and useful for
preparation of enzymes for use in packed bed reactors. Important commercial
enzymes will be used in the work, during ongoing consultation with manufacturers
and users of commercial enzymes to ensure smooth and ready transition to
commercial development. More robust enzyme preparation will find wide commercial
applications related to food products, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals,
environmental remediation, medical therapy and diagnosis, destruction of
hazardous waste, pollution control and personnel protection.
