9624811, PI-Hrabak: Trichomes of Arabidopsis are differentiated epidermal cells
found on leaves and petioles, stems or bolts, and sepals.The development of
Arabidopsis trichomes has been studied genetically by the isolation of mutants
blocked at different steps in the developmental pathway. Two of the early genes
in this pathway (GL1 and GL2) have been cloned and encode putative regulatory
proteins containing a myb DNA binding motif and a homeodomain motif
respectively. The expression pattern of GL1 and GL2, as assessed by promoter-GUS
fusions or in situ hybridization studies, is very similar to the expression
pattern observed with GUS fusions with the gene that is the subject of this
proposal, CPK2. CDK2 is an isoform of the family of calmodulin-domain protein
kinases. The hypothesis here is that CPK2 is involved in determination of
epidermal cell fates or in the process of trichome development. The following
questions will be addressed to test this hypothesis: Is CPK expressed in
trichome mutant backgrounds? Does increasing or decreasing the amount of CPK2
mRNA and protein affect trichome developmen t? Other isoforms of CPK genes have
been cloned but there is a lack of information on their function. The above
studies may help provide clues to function for one member of this family.
