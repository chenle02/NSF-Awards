Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2017 Joint
Conference on Electronic Properties of 2D Systems &amp; Modulated Semiconductor
Systems to be held at the Pennsylvania State University. The award is jointly
funded by the CMP and CMMT programs in the Division of Materials Research. This
conference will bring together leading scientists from a variety of fields in a
collegial atmosphere that supports open discussion to discuss issues at the
cutting edge of two dimensional materials and systems. This meeting will focus
on topics at the forefront of Condensed Matter Physics such as topological
phases and the development of new devices. It will bring together senior and
junior researchers from around the world.
