Experiments will be conducted aimed at clarifying the predominant mechanism
leading to the generation of streamwise vortices at the wall in wall-bounded
flows. A flush, wall mounted actuator will introduce distortions into a base
laminar flow, ranging from pure strain to pure vorticity. Diagnostics will be
from LIPA (Laser Induced Photochemical Anemometry). The experiments will
quantitatively identify near-wall events initiating flow distortion, and have
strong relevance to active boundary layer control.
