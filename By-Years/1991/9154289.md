A five-day workshop for 30 faculty members drawn from engineering, science, and
mathematics, will focus on using computer algebra as an effective tool in
teaching, revising curricula, and making the contents of their courses more
conceptual. In the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the workshop, participants
will conceive and create units suitable for incorporation into the undergraduate
curriculum. Dates: Summer 1992Contact: Mark A. Yoder
