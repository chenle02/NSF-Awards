The focus of this research involves the development of new chiral catalysts.
Neutral and charged bi-,tri-, and tetra-dentate ligands will be used in
conjunction with cationic copper (2+), tin (2+), aluminum (3+) and scandium (3+)
metals in the generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids. Reactions under
consideration will include enantioselective carbonyl addition processes,
particularly aldol and vinylogous aldol reaction variants, cycloaddition, and
conjugate- and hetero-conjugate addition processes. Catalysts will be developed
that will implement both the enolization process and will moderate the
subsequent electrophile-enolate bond construction with absolute stereochemical
control. Catalyst structure will be examined using X-ray
crystallography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David A.
Evans of the Department of Chemistry at the Harvard University. Professor Evans
will focus his work on using a combination of fundamental concepts in inorganic
coordination chemistry with mechanistic principles in organic chemistry for the
design of chiral metal-based complexes that function as catalysts for important
families of carbon-carbon bond forming processes. The project provides an
excellent venue for the training of graduate students and the results of the
research will have significant impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural
industries. &lt;br/&gt;
