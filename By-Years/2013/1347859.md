This project is designed to build capacity for conducting research on learning
progressions in geography. Learning progressions offer a means for educators to
determine how students learn geographic facts, concepts, and skills, and whether
they are on track toward attainment of a particular curriculum standard or set
of standards. The available research base in geography education is primarily
focused on students' understanding (or learning) of individual ideas or skills,
but not on the relationships between different areas of content or types of
skills learned progressively across grade levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through
this project, geographers and education researchers will receive training to
develop and validate learning progressions and assessments based on Standard 1
of Geography for Life: National Geography Standards (2nd Edition): How to use
maps and other geographic representations, geospatial technologies, and spatial
thinking to understand and communicate information. The capacity building will
involve four activities: 1) a planning meeting with geographers and learning
progressions experts, 2) an inventory and prospect study for the research, 3) a
research training workshop with graduate students, early career scholars and
faculty mentors, and 4) preparations for the coordination and implementation of
the research plans produced by the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is the first to develop a methodology for designing learning progressions
referenced to national geography standards. The goal is to stimulate interest,
and provide training and mentoring support for graduate students and early
career scholars interested in carrying out this type of research. The long-term
vision is to educate a cadre of future researchers with strong research and
analysis skills who can participate in the creation and testing of learning
progressions for all 18 national geography standards. The outcomes of this
project will include co-authored research manuscripts and an online American
Association of Geographers (AAG ) clearinghouse of research results.
