Several computer science rearchers at the University of Kentucky will augment a
Sequent multiprocessor with additional processors and memory, for purpose of
conducting research in distributed problem solving, surface fitting for vision
analysis, and shared memory management. This is an important research activity
and the University has made a very substantial contribution. This relatively
modest award is enthusiastically recommended.
