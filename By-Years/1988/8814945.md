In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Professor F. A. Cotton of Texas A &amp; M Universsity will investigate
the synthesis, structure, dynamics and reactivity of compounds containing
multiple bonds between transition metals. Research in this area is important for
the understanding of fundamental principles of bonding and reactivity in
organometallic cluster molecules, which are in turn important in the area of
organic reaction catalysis. Specific studies will include diruthenium and
diosmium species, edge-sharing bioctahedral compounds, chiral molecules with
multiple metal-metal bonds, compounds with new or rarer M-M multiple bonds such
as V, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ir, the use of fluoroalkoxide ligands to change the
properties of a variety of these compounds, organometallic and metal-hydrogen
chemistry, and use of specialized X-ray (high pressure) and neutron (polarized
beam) techniques for structural investigations.
