The International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)
is an annual event, and is the most widely-attended gathering of experts from
the signal processing community. In 2014, it will take place in Florence, Italy.
Historically, about 25% of the ICASSP participants have been students. This is a
very healthy statistic because the future of this all-pervasive discipline is
largely determined by the number of young people adopting signal processing as
their field of endeavor. Many of the students are coauthors of accepted papers
and presenters at the conference. For them, ICASSP is a unique opportunity to
meet many of the leaders in the field and to broaden their horizons by being
exposed to areas of research different from their own. The conference is also an
excellent opportunity for them to start networking with people who will likely
be their future collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately is expected
that the number of US-based students attending the conference in Florence will
be smaller than usual. This is largely due to the high travel costs to get to
Florence from North America. This proposal aims at providing travel support for
some of these students, hence, insuring better representation of US students at
ICASSP 2014.
