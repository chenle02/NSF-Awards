The idea of providing differentiated network services to customers with
different usage profiles is gaining strong commercial support. Many companies
are providing solutions to policy-based management for desired Quality of
Service (QoS). These network-based services range from application level control
to bandwidth management. However, the onus of deciding or designing these
policies rests on network managers. The view taken by most solution providers is
that of a static organization where requirements can be assessed in advance.
Consequently, at the user end overprovision of services has become a norm. This
proposal investigates the economics of differentiated network service
arrangements in business environments and the design and development of
realistic network environments to conduct experiments and evaluate performance
of a wide class of pricing approaches. The class of approaches we propose to
investigate range from purely deterministically guaranteed QoS through contracts
to real-time pricing that provides consumers with option to buy a QoS for each
application at the time of consumption. To test the various pricing schemes, the
token-bucket paradigm will be used. It will simulate a given price/contract
arrangement. The framework for economic experiments developed by this project
will provide a benchmark tool to assess network efficiency under different
contractual arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;
