9218819 Rothman The PI will develop and apply a number of simple models for the
simulation of complex geophysical fluids. Phenomena of interest cover a wide
range of problems in multiphase flow, including flow through porous media, phase
separation and hydrodynamics, sedimentation, convection, non-Newtonian fluids,
and granular flow. ***
