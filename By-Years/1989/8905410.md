The primary objective of this U.S..Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Joseph P. Kennedy of the University of Akron and Dr. Tibor Kelen of the
Kossuth Lajos University, Debrecen, Hungary is to study the effects of process
variables in the preparation of telechelic polyisobu>tylenes. Relative
telechelic polymer yield, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution
will be determined through fundamental kinetic studies. Results should
contribute to a second objective of synthesising "perfect" and mixed
polyisobutylene.based rubbery networks which may be suitable for studying a
number of follow.on questions pertaining to the theory of rubber elasticity and
bimodal networks. This project in polymer research fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. In
addition to new knowledge of elastomeric networks, collaborative efforts under
this project are also expected to yield sufficient inventories of new polymers
for use by polymer physicists and engineers in subsequent research.
