This project introduces undergraduate students to computational thinking (CT) by
engaging them to create apps for mobile phones and tablets that are both useful
and personally meaningful. CT is a 21st century STEM literacy whose concepts are
needed by informed citizens and workers to solve problems and understand complex
systems in many domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, students learn CT
by creating mobile apps using App Inventor, a visual blocks-based programming
environment. The project is developing online curricular modules that use mobile
app programming to teach CT principles and mobile computing design concepts.
These modules include web-based tutorials, video lectures, screencasts,
programming exercises, and quizzes --- online materials that give students more
in-class time to engage in active learning. Several introductory and
intermediate courses are being developed based on these modules. The project is
also devising, testing, and evaluating new techniques for assessing students' CT
knowledge in the context of mobile computing and project-based
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In partnership with MIT's new Center for Mobile
Learning, this project is widely disseminating curricular materials, course
designs, and assessment rubrics, and is building a national community of
undergraduate educators focused on teaching CT via mobile
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project reflects mobile computing's
transformation of society by building a curriculum in which undergraduates learn
CT not by merely using apps, but by creating them. The materials developed in
this project will support both novice and intermediate students in
constructionist learning and in design, innovation, and entrepreneurship
activities that connect computer science to other disciplines.
