The goal of the research to be performed by Dr. Murphey is to understand how
synapses are stabilized during synaptic rearrangement in the nervous system. The
synaptic assembly process is a dynamic one involving both the pre- and post
synaptic cells. During the previous funding period, Dr. Murphey gathered
remarkable results suggesting that the strength and short term plasticity of
synapses can be controlled by the postsynaptic cell. Dr. Murphey will now
concentrate his studies on the role of the postsynaptic cell in the process of
synapse assembly. He will utilize electrophysiological techniques to describe
short and long term plasticity at synapses that are constantly being altered. In
addition, pharmacological tools will be used to block neurogenisis or neural
activity in an effort to explore the mechanisms underlying synapse stabilization
and destabilization. Finally, Dr. Murphey will use computational tools to
explore the consequences of synaptic rearrangement for circuit function. Results
obtained from this study will add significantly to our knowledge of what
interactions are involved in the assembly of synapses.***
