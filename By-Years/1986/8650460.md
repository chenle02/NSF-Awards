The Department of Chemistry at Trinity University will fully integrate nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy into its undergraduate curriculum using
applications that demonstrate the enormous power and versatility of this
spectroscopic methodology for the examination of chemical structure and
dynamics. Virtually all students who have the potential to employ NMR
methodologies in their eventual careers will be exposed to multiple uses of this
essential technology. Development of this program will be achieved through the
purchase of a 60-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for observation of
proton and phosphorus-31 nuclei. This spectrometer will be employed for spectral
observations of organic and organophosphorus compounds, for determination of the
structure and dynamics of inorganic compounds having phosphorus ligands, and for
investigations of biochemical processes by phosphorus-31 observation. Uses of
this instrument will bring together major research developments which are
dependent on NMR spectroscopy, particularly in biochemistry and inorganic
chemistry, and relevant applications of this spectroscopy for inorganic
chemistry and biochemistry in the undergraduate laboratory.
