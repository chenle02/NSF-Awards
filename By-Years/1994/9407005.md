Weber 9407005 This study will investigate the genes that control the growth of
localized groups of cells during the growth of organisms, to produce the final
shapes and proportions of specific parts in the adult. The project will study
these genes by using many replicated measurements of the proportions of wings in
Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly), combined with methods of marking
and identifying chromosome regions so that the effect of each region on the
adult wing shape can be distinguished from effects of other chromosome regions.
By this approach, a complete map of the chromosomes will be assembled, showing
the locations of the genes which control the shape of the wing. This information
will help to guide the search for specific DNA sequences with well-defined
localized effects on shape. Since many basic genetic discoveries with
applicability to humans have been made using Drosophila, this investigation may
also shed light on how genes control form in humans. The wing of the fruit fly
provides ideal material for such studies, because it can easily be projected
like a slide to give highly magnified image on a large computerized measuring
pad.
