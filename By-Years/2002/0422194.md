This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop scale-up
production technology to produce engineered cartilage for drug discovery using a
proprietary Alginate Recovered Chondrocyte (ARC) method. This method stimulates
adult human cartilage cells to form a cartilaginous tissue with proper
compositional and functional properties. ARC cartilage tissue is expected to
offer a cost-effective alternative to current culture systems and expensive
animal studies while utilizing human tissue.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of drug discovery
for cartilage-related problems such as rheumatoid arthritis.
