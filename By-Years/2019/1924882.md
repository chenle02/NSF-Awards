The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
food and health product safety in the US. This can reduce the economic burden
associated with disease and infection caused by bacteria on surfaces. The
proposed technology can be used to determine adherence to cleaning protocols
that are used to keep food and healthcare facilities safe. It can also be used
to help monitor chronic wounds, thus reducing the number of clinical visits for
routine status check-ups. The ability to conduct real time measurement of
biofilms in a closed environment is currently unavailable in the market. This
technology can potentially impact food safety and also health care markets.

This I-Corps project will further develop a wireless sensor platform technology
that is proposed for use in monitoring growth of biofilms or fluid build-up in
closed systems such as bandages or on surfaces such as food preparation areas or
healthcare counters. The sensor is a platform technology that consists of a
flexible sensor, a reader, and algorithm to translate the wireless signal. The
sensor is a planar, Archimedean coil that is an open circuit inductor capacitor
that forms a resonant structure. It can be placed on or in surface materials or
bandages. As cells or a biofilm grow on the surface of the resonator, this
changes the local dielectric and a large shift in the resonant frequency is
observed. This can be sampled wirelessly using a vector network analyzer.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
