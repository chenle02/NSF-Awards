A triaxial loading frame with a freezer attachment, high-speed microcomputer,
and electromechanical transducers will be procured to provide necessary support
for several research projects in the geotechnical area. The acquisition of this
equipment will bear directly on research on stress-strain behavior of fine-
grained granular materials, frozen geomaterials, and new liner materials for
isolation of hazardous waste. The microcomputer will be integrated with other
equipment such as the triaxial device, a newly developed multiaxial device,
direct shear apparatus, and permeability apparatus. This microcomputer is
designed for a multiuser environment, and provides the necessary speed for a
multiple-experiment environment. The triaxial equipment with freezer chamber
will be used in studying fracture mechanics of frozen geomaterials. The freezer
chamber is detachable so the equipment can be used for other projects as well.
The equipment will be used primarily in four ongoing research projects dealing
with stress-strain behavior of mine tailings materials, fracture mechanics of
frozen geomaterials, strength and deformability of new liner materials, and
stabilized grouts.
