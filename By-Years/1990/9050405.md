Microprocessors in mechanical engineering education are ready to move beyond
personal computer based control and data acquisition to mechatronics: a blend of
mechanical design and electronics which stresses breadboard design of
microprocessors and support chips. The logical niche for mechanical engineers is
the microcontroller or microcomputer-on-a-chip. These chips are the basis for
modular control in product design: automobiles, appliances, cameras, etc. The
purpose of this project is to establish a microcontroller laboratory concurrent
with a required course on microprocessors. The present laboratory uses
microprocessor board designs which concentrate on bus oriented wiring.
Microcontrollers have memory and I/O onboard. Wiring problems are reduced to
peripherals. This allows the additional time to teach computer assembly of
microcontroller programs, to strengthen the peripheral designs but with
microcontrollers, and to place more course emphasis on interfacing stepper and
DC motors. The laboratory equipment would consist of twelve work stations. Each
student would have a microcontroller development board to interface a personal
computer for program assembly, software simulation, and program downloading to
the microcontroller. Six oscilloscopes and three logic analyzers would provide
for hardware and software debugging.
