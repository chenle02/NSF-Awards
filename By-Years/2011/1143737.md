Organisms adapt to external perturbations through the optimized structure of
their gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In the long-term, the state transition
network of a GRN converges to a set of attractors that make the organism
resilient to removal or functional impairment of genes. In wireless sensor
networks (WSN), such attractors refer to a group of sensors serving as sink
nodes for packets sent over multiple hops. This project maps such attractor
based genomic robustness onto WSNs to infer optimal topologies and routing
strategies that mitigate both sensor failure and a noisy wireless channel. This
is being achieved by conducting in silico gene ?knock-down? experiments by
simulating the functional removal of a gene from sample GRNs, to understand the
dynamics of the attractor state space. This information is next used to design
WSN topologies and routing protocols that are resilient to network uncertainty,
node breakdown and compromise. &lt;br/&gt;This project pursues the design of
optimal wiring rules between sensors in a robust WSN that guarantees maximum
probability of successful packet transmission under a given routing strategy.
The guiding principle is to follow nature?s foot-steps in designing simple rules
(i.e., routing algorithms) that guarantee maximum efficiency over an optimized
WSN topology. It also develops innovative network-science based tools, and
provides insights into the interplay of GRNs and WSNs that inspire new designs
for engineered systems (i.e. fault-tolerant topologies for WSNs). Validation and
testing are accomplished on real life WSN testbeds. Research results will be
disseminated through publications, besides allowing for the design of new
graduate-level courses.
