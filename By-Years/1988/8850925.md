The request is for a renewal of CUNY's Urban Environmental Program for Middle
and Junior High School teachers. The present version seeks to train 50 middle
and high school teachers (at least half of which will represent minorities and
most of which are disadvantaged) in the New York City metropolitan area. The
project will focus on "Energy and Environmental Control" and will utilize
previously-developed materials to (i) allow teachers to master the subject, (ii)
acquire techniques for the teaching of urban environmental studies to children
and adolescents, (iii) implement environmental science curricula in the
classroom (including computer-based materials), (iv) develop appropriate
environmental science activities for their classes, (v) inculcate in the
participants a sense of excitement about scientific investigations in general,
and to (vi) provide the participants with problem-solving experiences in
science. An amount equivalent to 76.10% of the NSF award is being contributed by
CUNY-Hunter College and other sources.
