Infinite horizon optimal control problems arise naturally in the study of
models of economic growth. These models consist of minimizing an integral
functional with an infinite upper limit. The admissible pairs of control
functions and state functions must satisfy a differential equation, state
constraints and control constraints. Given the admissible pair, the functional
need not be finite, and as a consequence, the traditional concept of minimum
becomes meaningless. To circumvent this difficulty, a variety of weaker notions
of optimality have been introduced. The investigator has established the
existence of these weaker notions of optimality under minimal convexity
hypotheses for ordinary differential equation constraints. He now proposes to
generalize these results for the class of differential equations with delays
called hereditary differential systems. The difficulties encountered there are
greater than in the case of ordinary differential equations, but the models of
this type may be more realistic for problems involving resource management and
economics. Research in optimal control problems has been an essential part of
control theory, optimization and calculus of variations. Results of such
research are often interesting for people interested in trajectory optimization
for space vehicles and for scientists interested in resource management.
