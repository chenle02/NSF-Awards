Large volume strain has been reported from several studies involving deformed
thrust wedge packages, but little is known about the mechanism of mass
transport. This project will use stable isotope geochemistry and whole-rock
composition data to assess the role of fluid flow and to determine the direction
and quantity of flow. Results should further quantify volume strain in the late
Cretaceous San Juan-Cascade nappes of western Washington and provide insight
into the direction and magnitude of fluid flow responsible.
