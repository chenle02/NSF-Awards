Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: Making Learning a Part
of Life: Theories, Technologies, Practices, and Assessment in Support of
Lifelong Learning The University of Colorado has been awarded funding in the
amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months to initiate a planning effort to
establish a CRLT Center focused on the theme "making learning a part of life;
theories technologies, practices, and assessment in support of self-directed
life long learning." The Center will build on funded research in computer
science, cognitive science, psychology and education. The University of Colorado
and its extended community will function as a testbed for the development and
evaluation of learning technology tools and approaches. The planning grant will
allow current research approaches to be shaped into specific activities that
will comprise the collaborative project of the Center. Partners in this planning
grant include Apple Computer and Boulder Community Network.
