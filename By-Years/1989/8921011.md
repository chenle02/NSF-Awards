A fast and efficient computational scheme is to be developed for the evaluation
of an integral which occurs in the theory of free surface waves and their
interaction with immersed structures. In the linear regime a variety of
techniques exist for computing wave-structure interaction by spectral methods.
The investigation here is focused on carrying out the computation in the time
domain. This approach is particularly useful for coupling to the computation of
the elastic response of the structure. An algorithm for evaluating the integral
under the influence of bottom topography is to be developed.
