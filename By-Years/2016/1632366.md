This award will partially support a conference focused on Electron Probe
Microanalysis (EPMA) planned for May 16-19, 2016, at the University of
Wisconsin, under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society (MAS).
Quantitative analysis by EPMA is fundamental to earth and materials sciences.
Analytical skills obtained by students are valuable and form a foundation for
quantitative techniques that are related to x-ray spectrometry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned topical conference will be the first
conference or workshop explicitly focused on electron microprobe analysis in
many years, providing an opportunity for experienced scientists to interact with
students and researchers new to the technique. The EPMA user community is much
broader than members of any one organization or professional society, and one
aim is to attract all users of electron probes and provide them with four days
of valuable experiences to take back to their laboratories. In addition, the
conference is designed to facilitate interaction between materials scientists
and geologists who have much to learn from each other but may rarely have venues
to interact.
