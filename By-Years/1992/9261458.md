The objective of this research is to implement new algorithms using wavelet
transforms to evaluate the fractal dimension of turbulent dynamical systems. A
major thrust of the work will be the adaptation of arrays of transputers for
fast and efficient parallel computation. The resulting hardware and software
will be useful for image analysis in medical applications.
