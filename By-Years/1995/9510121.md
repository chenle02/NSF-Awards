Abstract CTS-9510121 Fluid-particle mixture and granular flow instabilities will
be investigated. The dilatational and shearing instabilites of spatially
homogeneous processes in slow sharing movement of granular media and suspensions
will be studied using a computer simulation technique. The results will be
tested in an experiment using the index of refraction matched, photochromatic
tracer particle method. The stability of granular flow, including clustering, in
the Bagnold grain-inertia regime will analyzed by using both kinetics theory and
continuum mechanics. Understanding instabilities in suspension and granular
flows is a critical aspects of the multiphase flow theory. It has important
applications in the design of industrial equipment handling solids and in the
analysis of geotechnical phenomena. ***
