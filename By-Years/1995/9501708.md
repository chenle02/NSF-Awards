The discipline of Computer-aided Verification attempts to provide software and
hardware engineers with (semi) automatic formal methods for improving the
reliability of concurrent and real-time systems. Over the last decade, Computer-
aided verification has matured into a well-defined but loose collection of
various models, theorems, algorithms, techniques, and tools. Indeed, to the
outsider the discipline seems to provide a shopping list of different formalisms
and methods, with little or no assistance as to which model, technique, or tool
may be particularly (un) suited for a given task. This CAREER research seeks to
aid the further advancement of the discipline and the technology transition by a
systematic organization of the core results in a single standardized framework
that can be taught on the undergraduate level, the reactive-system model. To
achieve both simplicity and generality, a system is identified with its reaction
function, which, given a system state and an environment move, yields a set of
possible new system states. Based on the reactive-system model, this research
pursues three objectives: (1) Development of a uniform, clean, and comprehensive
theory of Computer-aided Verification. While most results were formulated,
originally, for specific formalisms with various idiosyncrasies, it is expected
that the translation of theorems and algorithms into a common framework will
lead to a deeper understanding of dependencies, connections, and applications.
(2) Preparation of a standard textbook on Computer-aided Verification, targeted
at the advanced-undergraduate level and the beginning-graduate level. It is
hoped that the text will move formal methods into the mainstream of the Computer
Science curriculum. (3) Development of a course on the practice and applications
of Computer-aided Verification, a project-oriented course is offered to advanced
undergraduates and beginning graduate students in engineering.
