This award supports cooperative research on the geophysics of Argentine and
Antarctic margins to be conducted by John LaBrecque of the Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory at Columbia University and Marta Ghidella of the
Antarctic Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This work will extend studies of
the pre-Jurassic reconstructions of the conjugate margins of the Antarctic
Weddell basin and the southern edge of South America. The procedure will be to
compare magnetic and gravitational anomalies on both sides of the South Atlantic
in Africa and South America to define the reconstruction of the prerift
continent. Current information suggests that the Weddell and South American
margins are conjugate rift margins but data is lacking for the Weddell side.
This study will help provide such data through dipping seismic reflector
measurements which can indicate thick accumulations of volcanically thickened
oceanic crust. These will be correlated with high amplitude magnetic anomalies.
The results will be shed further light on the theory of the breakup of the
supercontinent Gondwana. In this study, the U.S. side will benefit from logistic
support in Argentina, access to new data sets, and general advancement of
geophysical science. They bring advanced scientific computing and improved
instrumentation as additional benefits to the collaboration. The result will be
an expanded data base for this sector of the southern oceans and encouragement
for the U.S.-Argentine joint geophysical effort in Antarctic research.
