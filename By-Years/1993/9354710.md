9354710 Nakmura In this decade, career opportunities in the environmental
sciences will outpace those in many other disciplines. However, women and
minorities are poorly represented in the ranks of environmental scientists.
California State University, Los Angeles (CSLA) has a student body over 37%
Hispanic, 10% Black, and 29% Asian. Entering students have little knowledge of
environmental careers. This curriculum revision project will magnify student
interest in environmental sciences and give undergraduates the necessary
knowledge, skills and experiences to become environmental scientists. Through
this project, course "modules" will be developed that fit the environmental
themes of aquatic pollution, atmospheric change or land use. Under the aquatic
pollution theme, a biology class might collect marine fish specimens from sewage
outfalls and look for lesions and tumors. A chemistry class would measure the
concentrations of DDT in fish from contaminated and uncontaminated sites. A
writing course would use the shared data to draft an environmental impact
statement. Integrated modules will give students hands-on experience with a
local problem, use of critical thinking skills and practice in report writing
from multidisciplinary data.
