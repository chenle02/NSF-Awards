This planning grant will lead to full proposals from the Alaska Pacific
University for a Teacher Institute and Teacher Preparation. The planning grant
will bring together the advisory board, the teachers and the elders form the
native villages and use them to help identify how science education can be
relevant and linked to the native culture. Ongoing projects funded by private
foundations have supported the universities work with native Americans. This
minority institution is uniquely well suited to address the needs of this
population. The Alaska Pacific University is cost sharing 94% of the project.
