Indole-3-acetic acid is found in plants in both free and conjugated form. One of
the less well-studied forms of conjugated IAA are a unique class of proteins
where IAA is a prosthetic group attached directly to the protein structure. An
increasing body of evidence suggests that regulation of protein stability is
important to auxin function, thus making these modified proteins of particular
interest. The first gene for a protein covalently modified by IAA was recently
cloned from bean and found to be related to proteins present in several other
plant species, including the model plant Arabadopsis. Four lines of study will
further characterize these proteins in plants. &lt;br/&gt;1) Experiments will
define, on the molecular level, the expression, regulation and function of the
bean 35 kDa protein. &lt;br/&gt;2) Previous studies which focused on bean will
be extended, starting with cloning the respective genes, to related proteins
from species more amenable to genetic manipulation, such as Arabadopsis and
Medicago.&lt;br/&gt;3) IAA-protein gene expression will be analyzed at the
tissue and subcellular level using reporter genes and immunological
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;4) The attachment of IAA to the proteins will be analyzed
using complex liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods that will allow
rapid identification of this class of modified proteins. &lt;br/&gt;These
studies should provide the biochemical, tissue and molecular information
necessary to further understand the possible roles of this unique class of
modified proteins in relation to phytohormone regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
