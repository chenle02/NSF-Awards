9404431 Hager/Dontchev This research will pursue the applications of recent
implicit function-type results for set-valued maps in an infinite dimensional
setting to numerical algorithms for optimal control problems and the Lipschitz
properties of their solutions. This work considers control problems with state
and control constraints for which there are many open questions. Log-barrier
approaches to control constraints will be investigated, and error estimates for
discretizations will be derived. This research will develop and analyze
numerical algorithms for solving optimal control problems with control and state
constraints. In particular, the possible Lipschitz properties of optimal
solutions will be investigated. Knowledge of the Lipschitz continuity of the
solution is important, for instance, in the study of the convergence behavior of
various numerical approximations for the solution. Anticipated applications of
the research include problems in computer aided geometric design, and optimal
motion planning of a flexible structure (such as a robot or a crane) in the
presence of obstacles.
