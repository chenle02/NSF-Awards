This proposal offers a new approach to opto-electronics by the exploration of
guided-wave lenses for collimating, imaging and Fourier transformations. The
method involves decreasing the refractive index of the lens zone, rather than
increasing it as is conventionally done. While the idea may be difficult to
implement, if successful, such lenses could have an important effect on the
production of integrated optical modules. The investigator intends to fabricate
the lenses lithographically to form a lens pattern on a GaAs/GaA1As waveguide.
To address the problem of rough and non-vertical walls the investigator has
already collaborated with colleagues at U.C. Santa Barbara and at TRW. He will
carry out very detailed and careful comparisons with existing lens fabrication
methods as well as performance characteristics.
