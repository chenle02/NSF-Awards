Speech unfolds rapidly in time, yet native speakersâ€™ comprehension is generally
accurate and efficient. Previous research suggests that one reason why language
processing seems to be so effortless and robust is that language users can use
context to predict upcoming language input. It is generally agreed that semantic
and morpho-syntactic features of a highly expected word can be pre-activated in
such predictive language processing. However, there is an ongoing debate about
whether the phonological form of a predictable word can also be routinely pre-
activated in real-time sentence processing. This project addresses this debate
by exploiting the phenomena of anticipatory tonal variations. The results of
this study will advance our knowledge on the role of anticipatory tonal
variations in spoken-word recognition and speech processing, and on phonological
form pre-activation in predictive language processing. This will in turn inform
our understanding of the cognitive process in language
perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project first examines how anticipatory
tonal variation cues can facilitate tonal prediction of an upcoming word in
speech perception using eye-tracking technique. Then, the study will examine
whether listeners can pre-activate the tonal form of a predictable word by
measuring their brain responses to the preceding word using
electroencephalography (EEG) technique. Crucially, the expected word in some
experimental conditions will be substituted by an unexpected one that shares or
does not share the tonal form with the expected word, so the anticipatory tonal
variation cues in the preceding word is either concordant or incompatible with
the tone of the expected word. The guiding hypothesis is that if the tonal form
of the expected word can be pre-activated, there should be larger amplitude
modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) to the preceding word when the
unexpected word and the predicted word differ in tone; however, if there is
little or no phonological form pre-activation, there should be little or no ERP
amplitude modulation prior to encountering the unexpected
word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
