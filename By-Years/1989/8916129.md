This award provides for a focused program of continental deep seismic
reflection research involving Cornell personnel and outside investigators. This
program includes: 1) Acquisition of ultradeep combined vibroseis/dynamite
seismic reflection profiles i eastern Montana and North Dakota, as part of a
cooperative program with LITHOPROBE to study the Williston intracratonic basin
and underlying Trans-Hudson orogen. 2) Acquisition of a combined P and S wave
expanding spread profile across the Surrency "bright spot" in southeastern
Georgia to determine its seismic attributes, and assess the possibility that
deep crustal bright spots originate from trapped fluids. The proposed field
program takes advantage of a special opportunity available to COCORP to use an
850-channel, SGR (Seismic Group Recorder) equipped, research seismic reflection
crew. Amoco Production Company is offering to lend the hardware for this crew to
COCORP free of cost for these studies. The advanced capabilities of this crew
will allow the acquisition of greatly more sophisticated data than in the past,
at a cost per mile that is actually less than that of previous surveys.
