A central issue of brain development is how the intricate patterns of nerve
connections are formed by incoming sensory nerve cell processes, called afferent
axons, on central target nerve cells. In rodents, the afferents for touch from
the facial whiskers form a pattern of discrete units at every level in their
pathway from the face to the sensory cortex of the forebrain. In the cortex, the
central terminal patterns of these aligned axons form structures called barrels,
from their shape. This project will analyze how the cells called glial, which
surround nerve cells in the brain, may assist in forming the pattern of the
axons into these barrels. Anatomical and biochemical techniques, including
antibody binding, will be used to assess the developing patterns under a variety
of conditions. Experiments will compare glial antigens with cell-adhesion
molecules, will correlate distribution of afferents between normal and abnormal
development using mutant mouse strains, and use lesion studies to establish how
boundaries change and/or reform during subsequent regeneration. This work
pursues a novel and potentially important issue for developmental neuroscience,
and results will have an impact on developmental biology as well.
