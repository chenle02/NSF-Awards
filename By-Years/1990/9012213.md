The long term goal of this research is to take advantage of the powerful
genetic capabilities available in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
understand 1) The kinds of potassium transporters present in this eukaryote and
2) the structure and function of the transporters. The questions to be addressed
in the near term are the following: What are the structural and functional
similarities, if any, between the high and low affinity potassium transporters
already identified? What is the topological organization of these potassium
transporters in the plasma membrane? Which amino acids in the transporter
polypeptides are involved in the mechanism of potassium transport? A gene, TRK1,
likely to encode the high-affinity potassium transporter, has been cloned, as
has a gene, TRK2, required for low-affinity potassium uptake. Goals for the next
three years are: 1) to define topological features of the high-affinity
transporter (TRK1); 2) to determine the relationship between TRK1 structure and
function by combining site-directed mutagenesis with in vivo functional assays;
3) to determine the molecular basis of potassium affinity and identify amino
acids likely to interact directly with potassium ions by isolation and analysis
of mutations in TRK1 that increase discrimination between potassium and
rubidium; 4) to pursue a molecular analysis of the TRK2 gene; 5) to determine
the molecular basis of mutations in the TRK2 gene and determine their
physiological effects, 6) to determine the molecular changes in TRK2D mutants
(alleles of TRK2 that enhance low-affinity potassium uptake); and 7) to assess
the functional roles of the high and low- affinity potassium transporters.
Future goals include genetically identifying potassium channel genes in yeast.
The proposed research is a continuation of the molecular and genetic analysis of
potassium transport in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This small eukaryote
is useful as a model system in which to examine the molecular basis of potassium
transport which is a highly conserved and fundamental physiological function of
all cells. Through the isolation of mutants that exhibit altered potassium
transport, proteins involved in the movement of this essential ion across cell
membranes can be identified genetically, and the relationship between the
structure and function of potassium transporter molecules can be investigated.
