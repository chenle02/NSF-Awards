This award provides partial support for the international meeting "Relativity in
Fundamental Astronomy: Dynamics, Reference Frames and Data Analysis", to be held
in Virginia Beach, VA from 27 April to 1 May 2009 as Symposium 261 of the
International Astronomical Union. The increasing precision of astrometric
measurements now both allows more precise tests of General Relativity, and
requires relativistic corrections to the measurement of celestial positions. The
meeting will bring together radio and optical observers, theoretical and
experimental relativists, theoretical astronomers, space scientists, Earth
orientation scientists, geodesists, and experts in timekeeping and reference
frames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will support the participation of early-
career scientists from North America. The meeting will expose US students and
postdocs to international experts in this field. Proceedings will be published
by the International Astronomical Union. &lt;br/&gt;
