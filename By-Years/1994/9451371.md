9451371 Hudgings The broad goals of career education, education for life and
employment, form the core of the Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
curriculum. The CIM curriculum provides students with the education and skills
to respond to the present and future needs of business and industry. The
addition of a Rapid Prototyping System to the CIM program is critical to the
continued success of its graduates. Therefore, Camden County College is
proposing the acquisition of a Rapid Prototyping System which will enable
students to fully integrate Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Computer Aided
Manufacturing (CAM) to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining in an
environment which mirrors current rapid prototyping systems. Systems such as
this minimize the "art to part" time required in developing a new project. This
project addresses an industry need for well educated technicians in the
manufacturing technology field.
