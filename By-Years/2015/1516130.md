This award supports a Future Internet Architecture--Next Phase (FIA-NP)
investigator meeting in November, 2014. This meeting is structured around a set
of four use cases or scenarios that have been developed by the Values in Design
Council, with the objective of learning more about the implications of the
various network designs that are part of the Future Internet Architecture, Next
Phase program. The discussions of use cases or scenarios is intended to bring
out implications of the design decisions within each of the funded network
designs. The use cases have been formulated by the Values in Design Council, a
group of social scientists, lawyers, and other experts whose travel to the
meetings is supported by NSF to bring a broader set of perspectives on the
design process. The results of this exercise should serve to better understand
the implications of the technical designs, and to improve communication and
understanding between the design teams and the members of the ViD council.

The broader goal of the NSF FIA-NP effort is enhancing the relevance and impact
of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network
research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership
to the future of the Internet. The program, and the workshops in particular, are
a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of
long-range architectural thinking. The program has the potential to contribute
to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically
viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. The results
of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA-NP website www.nets-fia.net
for public dissemination, will be a contribution to this broader goal.
