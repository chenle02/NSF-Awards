9514305 Boyd There is strong evidence for sexual differences in the central
nervous system, and in the physiology and behavior of most vertebrates. The
steroid hormones derived from the gonads of males and females are necessary for
the generation and maintenance of these differences. However, they are not
solely responsible for these differences and other chemical mediators in the
brain, notably neuropeptides, subserve critical functions in the manifestation
of the anatomical differences. Therefore, a central issue is the definition of
the interrelationship between steroid hormones and neuropeptides in the brain.
The present experiments address this issue and focus on the posterior pituitary
neuropeptide system, which has been implicated in fluid balance, lactation,
learning and memory, reproductive behaviors, and parental behaviors. Dr. Boyd
will determine whether a direct neurochemical link is possible between the
steroid hormones and neuropeptide system containing arginine vasotocin and how
the steroids modulate the ability of identified neurons to produce vasotocin.
She will also establish the connections of these neuropeptide-containing neurons
in the brain. These results are crucial to understanding the basic mechanisms
underlying chemical messenger interactions in the brain. Furthermore, they will
generate important information about the origin of sex differences in
neuroanatomical structures and provide a basis for gender differences in
behavior, prevalent in most species.
