The goal of this project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program is to
probe the structure of transition metal ions adsorbed in microporous molecular
sieve oxides. Electron magnetic resonance methods will be developed and applied
to these systems by Professor Kevan and his group, and detailed information
about the interaction between the adsorbed transition metal ion and the
framework nuclei of the oxide support will be obtained. Comparisons will also be
made to catalytic activity of the characterized materials. Development of
advanced electron magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods is an additional
important goal of this work. %%% Structural characterization of oxide supported
transition metal ions which are useful as catalytic systems will result from
this work. This characterization will be crucial to the further design and
understanding of technologically important oxide supported catalysts used in
petroleum refining and chemical process industries.
