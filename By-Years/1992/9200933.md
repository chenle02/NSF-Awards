This awards supports the research of Professor V. Shokurov to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on problems involved in minimal model theory in dimension
3. He hopes to show that relative log models for 3-folds exists and investigate
their properties under boundary changes. The research is in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that
have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by
the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding
theory and robotics.
