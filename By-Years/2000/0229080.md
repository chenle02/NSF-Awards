Timbuktu Academy has succeeded in designing a program that has raised their
education focus to an applied level, and directly addressed some of the issues
that lead to minority underrepresentation in science, mathematics and
engineering. The program achieves this through an alternative approach to
mentoring, such that minority students can successfully complete their
undergraduate education. To do this, the Timbuktu Academy has brought together
all the key elements that make the program a success at the Southern University
and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge. And while the philosophical approach of the
program may be different, a subset of the student population responds extremely
well to such mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The achievement of the
Timbuktu Academy underscores that, while the leaders have taken a unique
approach to science education, the technique has been spectacularly successful.
