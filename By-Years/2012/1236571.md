CBET-1236571&lt;br/&gt;Phelan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waste heat energy conversion
remains an inviting subject for research, given the renewed emphasis on energy
efficiency and carbon emissions reduction. Solid-state thermoelectric devices
have been widely investigated, but their practical application remains
challenging because of cost and the inability to fabricate them in geometries
that are easily compatible with heat sources. An intriguing alternative to
solid-state thermoelectric devices is thermogalvanic cells, which include a
(generally) liquid electrolyte that permits the transport of ions.
Thermogalvanic cells have long been known in the electrochemistry community, but
have not received much attention from the thermal transport community. This is
surprising given that their performance is highly dependent on controlling both
thermal and mass (ionic) transport. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary
collaboration between mechanical engineering (thermal transport) and chemistry,
and is a largely experimental effort aimed at improving fundamental
understanding of thermogalvanic systems. Both thermal and mass transport will be
controlled by imposing a nanostructured membrane between the electrodes, which
will take advantage of previous work that demonstrated very high rates of mass
transfer through aligned carbon-nanotube electrodes, and very low rates of heat
transfer through randomly oriented carbon nanotubes. This work may enable
improved waste heat energy conversion, largely because a fluidic device like a
thermogalvanic cell can conform to the shape of a heat source like an exhaust
pipe, and because thermogalvanic cells may ultimately be manufactured more
cheaply than comparable thermoelectric devices. Finally, an extensive K-12
outreach program will be undertaken as part of the ongoing Science is Fun
program, in which simple experiments based on demonstrating the thermogalvanic
effect in salt water will be carried out by students in grades 4 through 8.
