9407196 Luke The Department of Mathematics and the Center for Applied
Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will
purchase a workstation which includes a memory upgrade, mass storage devices,
and video recording hardware and software which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
projects, including in particular: 1.) Visualization of Unsteady Nonplanar Flame
Propagation by Michael R. Booty; 2.) Pulse Propagation in Nonlinear Optical
Fibers using Optical Amplification by Cheryl V. Hile; 3.) A Mathematical Model
of Walking with Applications to the Physically Disabled by H. Michael Lacker;
and 4.) Nonlinear Wave Propagation in Disordered Media by Andre Nachbin
