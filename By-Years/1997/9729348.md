A confocal laser scanning microscope will be purchased for studies in a number
of areas of developmental biology. These areas will include neuronal
differentiation, growth cone guidance, signal transduction in development,
telomere function and organogenesis. The organisms used in these studies will
include Drosophila, zebrafish, Arabidopsis, c.elegans and mice as well as cell
cultures from humans and chickens. Typical studies will involve the three
dimensional reconstruction of the morphology of a sample or the visualization of
the interior of a living cell undergoing developmental processes.
