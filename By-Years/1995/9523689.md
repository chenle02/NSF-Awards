The investigators will upgrade recently installed lidars at Arecibo, Puerto
Rico, and Juliusruh, Germany, for temperature and radial wind measurements in
the mesopause region using atmospheric potassium atoms as tracers. These lidars
will then be operated along with a sodium lidar in Fort Collins, Colorado, for
at least five nights each season so that the seasonal variations of thermal
structures in the mesosphere can be studied. The data will elucidate the global
climatology of the mesopause region, as well as other interesting phenomena in
the middle atmosphere, such as gravity waves and tides. When the necessary
technology for wind and daytime measurements has been developed at Fort Collins,
it will be transferred to Arecibo and Juliusruh for the lidars operated at those
places.***
