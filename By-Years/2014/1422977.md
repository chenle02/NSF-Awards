Given the growing demand for interactive data exploration using cloud-based
infrastructure, the PIs propose a user-centric architecture designed
specifically for cost-effective, ad-hoc, real-time analytical processing. The
proposed architecture will use answer approximation techniques and distributed
in-memory query evaluation to offer a fluid data interaction experience to the
end user. The user-centric interaction paradigm has the potential to
revolutionize future data processing platforms, and rapidly accelerate data-
driven discovery and decision making in areas such as business management,
bioinformatics, astronomy, finance, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs
propose a novel interactive faceted exploration paradigm for analyzing multi-
dimensional data cubes. By tightly integrating faceted exploration of data cubes
within a distributed, main-memory interactive query engine, this project
investigates three complementary avenues: cube exploration models geared towards
interaction, query evaluation strategies for interactive main-memory online
analytical processing (OLAP), and distributed architectures for parallel
analysis that trade accuracy to meet user-defined response time constraints. The
PIs will investigate a unique combination of techniques such as speculative
execution, shared scans and sampling to serve user-centric aspects of OLAP
workloads. The simultaneous design of faceted exploration models and underlying
database engine primitives allows data exploration tasks to be performed in an
intuitive and interactive manner, while leveraging modern hardware features for
performance. By focusing on the user, this project will rethink aspects of
database architectures for interactively exploring large
datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, see the project web site
