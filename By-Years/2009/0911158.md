The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor Kenneth M. Nicholas of the University of Oklahoma Norma
Campus to test the hypothesis that efficient and selective homogeneous
transition metal catalysts can be evolved by templating dynamic (equilibrating)
metal complexes with substrate and transition state analogs. Three classes of
important addition reactions will be studied: a) carboxyl ester and amide
hydrolysis, b) ketone transfer hydrogenation, and c) [4+2] cycloadditions.
Results from these studies may provide a deeper understanding of metal-centered
reaction transition states, which could impact the design of both heterogeneous
catalysts with commercial, energy-saving and environmental benefits, and the
development of enzyme inhibitors with biological and health implications. The
project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, including
African and Native Americans, by actively recruiting researchers into an
internship program at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics and the
Oklahoma University Minority Engineering Program.
