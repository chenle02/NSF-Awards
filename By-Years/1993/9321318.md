The aim of this research is the development of molecular thermodynamic models to
predict protein adsorption in ion exchange chromatography. Models will
incorporate electrostatic and van der Waals components for protein-surface and
protein-interactions with particular interests related to adsorption patterns
and molecular orientations. Brownian dynamics simulations are to be performed in
order to examine kinetic effects. A complementary experimental component
comrises characterization of protein adsorption on quartz or silica by total
internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) spectroscopy, surface force
measurements, atomic force microscopy and other methods. This project should
help improve one of the major methods for purification of some pharmaceuticals
and products of genetic engineering technologies.
