The Gordon Research Conferences on a number of scientific topics, are held every
summer to discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of
science. Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of
established scientists, young investigators who are making important
contributions in these areas, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The
meetings are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from other
distractions, and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas. These conferences
have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in research and also
for indicating the future trends in research which are likely to be most
productive. This award represents full or partial support of 21 conferences in
the biological sciences being held in the summer of 2001 through the spring of
2002.
