9317757 Wolszczan This award will support a three-year program of investigations
in which rapidly rotating neutron stars known as radio pulsars will be used as
tools to address current problems in planetary system formation, relativistic
gravity, and globular cluster physics. The specific goals are: (i) conducting a
particularly sensitive survey for millisecond period pulsars; (ii) detection and
dynamical studies of planetary systems around neutron stars; (iii) further tests
of general relativity and other gravity theories in strong-field conditions
using binary pulsars as probes; and (iv) studies of properties of the globular
cluster pulsars and using them as sensitive probes of cluster dynamics.
