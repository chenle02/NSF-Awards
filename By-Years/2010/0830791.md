This project addresses the problem of efficient and scalable routing in dynamic
distributed networks. The goal is to design compact routing schemes (that is,
schemes with low memory overhead) with locality-sensitive node join, leave and
move operations (that is, the cost of a node move operation should be
proportional to the distance the node moves). An important application of
routing is the design of object location services and distributed hash tables.
The novel features of this research include improved bounds on the quality of
routing paths, the ability to efficiently deal with highly dynamic node
operations, and fault tolerance. Further, an important goal is to provide
graceful degradation: if the assumptions under which the routing and location
scheme works are violated or relaxed, the failure should not be abrupt, but
instead the performance should worsen only as a function of the degree to which
the assumptions were relaxed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New paradigms of computation
motivated by the development of the Internet lead to viewing the computer
network itself as a computer and require an understanding of computation
distributed across a large-scale and unstructured networks, whose many nodes are
capable of performing computations independently. A basic operation in such a
system is routing: nodes should be able to send each other messages without
necessarily having complete information about the network. The messages should
be sent along efficient routes, and individual nodes should not be required to
store too much information about the network structure. Further, the network may
change over time, with nodes joining or leaving, or moving within the network.
An additional complication arises when fault tolerance is considered, since the
system must be able to continue working correctly even in the presence of
faults. This project will advance our understanding of the structure of networks
that we rely on in everyday life, improve the efficiency and reduce the
vulnerability of computer networks and applications, thus contributing to the
development and deployment of secure network applications and infrastructure.
The PIs' earlier work on distributed object location has been integrated in
real-world systems. Since the focus of this project is on more realistic
scenarios but problems just as important, it is likely that it will lead to
further implementations and systems of wide applicability.&lt;br/&gt;
