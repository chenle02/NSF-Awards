Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. Researchers at Colorado State University will
improve computer simulations of the effect of Stratus clouds on the surface heat
budget of the Arctic. The fraction of open water, ice thickness, and snow
cover/thickness, and melt pond cover/thickness will be used to look at the
effect of these parameters on cloud formation. The improvement of the cloud
component simulations in Arctic climate models is essential to improving the
accuracy of global climate models used to examine possible greenhouse effects on
global climates. ??
