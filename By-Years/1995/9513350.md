9513350 Stark This award will provide partial travel support for Dr. Glenn
Stark from the Physics Department at Wellesley College to conduct collaborative
research with Dr. Brenton Lewis, The Australian National University (ANU)
Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering. The work will focus on
high-resolution laser spectroscopy of molecular oxygen in the vacuum ultraviolet
(VUV). The broad objectives of this project are to gain insight into the
electronic structure of the oxygen molecule and to contribute to an
understanding of the role of this basic molecule in the photochemistry of the
earth's atmosphere. Molecular oxygen is a strong absorber of solar VUV radiation
in the earth's atmosphere and thus determines the depth of penetration of this
radiation. The research will be centered around laser-based measurements in the
110-135 nm spectral region. The work of Dr. Stark in VUV spectroscopy is
complementary to that being used by the Ultraviolet Physics Unit at ANU. The
work in Australia is supported through the Department of Industry, Science and
Technology (DIST).
