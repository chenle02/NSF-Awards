The Community College of Philadelphia is engaged in a partnership with 12
baccalaureate-degree granting institutions in Pennsylvania to: (1) create a new
degree option for students preparing for careers in secondary math or science
education; and (2) expand the articulation agreements with four-year
institutions to include secondary education. Two new courses and educational
materials focused on inquiry-based, hands-on learning, are being developed for
prospective teachers: Teaching with Technology and Problem-Solving in Math and
Science. Both courses explore the use of technology to investigate authentic
problems in math and science. Students develop a portfolio of problem-based
learning scenarios using technology appropriate for use in their future
professional practice. The project addresses the International Society for
Technology in Education standards for preservice preparation in technology. The
project also includes customized systems of advising and mentoring; recruitment
of prospective teachers from mathematics and science courses; learning
communities; an education student club; and faculty development
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
