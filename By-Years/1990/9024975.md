The research will investigate the processing and properties of superplastically
deformed silicon nitride-based and mullite ceramic materials to develop
constitutive relationships describing the creep strain-deformation behavior of
polycrystalline ceramics and to develop processes for the superplastic forming
of simple components, including the gas blow-forming of ceramic sheets and the
diffusion bonding of superplastic ceramics. Superplastic forming involves the
slow deformation of the component into the desired shape at high temperatures
and under conditions under which fracture does not occur. While superplastic
forming has been applied with some success to metallic materials, titanium
alloys in particular, the application of the process to the forming of ceramics
is highly novel. Ceramic materials are extremely difficult to form and finish,
normally requiring grinding operations which may damage the surface and cause
failure. Therefore, the ability to deform solid ceramics into shaped parts would
be a major advance.
