Philip Geissler, University of California, Berkeley, is supported by an award
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop theoretical
models of the self-asssembly of nanoparticles. The work focuses on two model
systems chosen to exemplify important themes with broad applications: 1) a
protein complex that assembles into strikingly different extended patterns and
2) a system of magnetic nanocrystals driven to aggregate by solvent evaporation.

The research, while fundamental, has broad relevance to both biotechnology and
nanotechnology. Through a collaboration with a performance artist and lectures
to audiences of professional artists, the PI has initiated a diagolgue between
the artistic and scientific community on themes common to both art and science.
