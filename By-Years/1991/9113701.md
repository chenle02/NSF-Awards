This three-year award supports collaborative research in statistical mechanics
between Fa Y. Wu, Northeastern University with Jean- Marie Maillard, University
of Paris. They will collaborate on models of critical point phenomena, such as
boiling and freezing, and phase transitions. They will examine the chiral Potts
model, gauge transformations, other 3-state vertex models and the theory of
transmissivity as applied to these models. The investigators will focus on exact
solutions, but will also utilize numerical approaches and computer simulation,
which is important to finding exact results. Analytical studies and computer
simulations will be performed by Wu and Maillard on massive parallel computers.
Critical point phenomena and phase transitions are active areas of research in
condensed matter theory. This work also impacts theoretical physics and applied
mathematics. Dr. Wu is a theoretician. He will provide theoretical guidance and
analytical expertise. Dr. Maillard is experienced in computer simulations on the
chiral Potts model and other 3-state vertex models. The project will benefit
from their complementary expertise and parallel computer facilities.
