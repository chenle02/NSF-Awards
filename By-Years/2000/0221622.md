For proper functioning of the nervous system, each nerve cell must assemble the
molecular machinery required for the release of its signal, the
neurotransmitter, at the precise location on its target cell where the signal
can be received and a response produced. This precise alignment between the
release machinery of nerve terminals and the reception molecules of their
targets presents a challenge not only for its construction and growth but also
for its maintenance. The precision of this organization between nerve cells and
targets is beautifully illustrated at the frog neuromuscular junction where a
linear array of release sites in nerve terminals is separated by distinct
nonrelease domains. Using the frog motor nerve terminal, Dr. Connor's laboratory
discovered that cytoskeletal molecules including F-actin, a molecule involved in
the structural support and movement of cells and organelles, is concentrated in
nonrelease domains. The long range goal of Dr. Connor's project is to determine
the role of the cytoskeleton and F-actin in fundamental processes of nerve
terminals that may occur in nonrelease domains: the recycling of the
neurotransmitter release machinery and the stabilization of nerve terminals at
their targets. Partial funding is provided to Dr. Connor's laboratory to launch
initial experiments using state-of-the-art, electron microscope tomography to
construct a high resolution, three-dimension map of the cytoskeleton in
nonrelease domains of nerve terminals. Further, this will provide training
opportunities for graduate students in the current techniques.
