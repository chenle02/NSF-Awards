The objective of this project is to create a digital communications laboratory
to train undergraduate students in the design, construction, and testing of
digital communications equipment in the one-three GHz frequency range. The
laboratory includes a signal generator, spectrum analyzer, network analyzer, and
receiver for this frequency range, as well as a workstation with computer aided
design software tools for simulating circuit behavior at microwave frequencies
and generating graphical output for etching microstrip circuit boards. A
coordinated series of new exercises is being integrated into existing
electromagnetics and communications laboratories. Using the equipment, students
also conduct undergraduate research projects sponsored by the Alaska Space Grant
Program.
