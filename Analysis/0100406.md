In joint work with Sergiu Klainerman and John Stalker, we study the decay rate,
pointwise and uniform, of solutions to a linear wave equation on a Schwarzschild
background metric. We have preliminary results for each spherical harmonic. This
is the first step towards understanding the non-linear stability of these
metrics.

Roughly speaking, this corresponds to the propagation and decay of an
electromagnetic wave near a black hole. Our work starts with a careful
mathematical analysis of ideas known to physicists, and plans to develop new
tools.
