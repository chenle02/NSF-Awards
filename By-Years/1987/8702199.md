This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the potential for
improving the performance of anaerobic wastewater treatment processes by use of
ion-exchange resins that are circulated in the anaerobic reactor. The
investigators plan to undertake short- term experimentation to examine the
potential that resins have for acting to buffer the reactor, thus maintaining
desirable reaction conditions, and to determine whether the resins can absorb
shock loads of potentially toxic substances to the anaerobic organisms within
the reactor. The objectives of this project are consistent with those of the
Environmental Engineering Program and the investigators have qualifications that
are appropriate for the work to be done. Award is recommended as a 12 month
Standard Grant in the amount of $30,000 starting on March 1, 1987.
