With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Lisa M. Berreau of the Department of Chemistry &amp;
Biochemistry at Utah State University will develop a fundamentally new type of
photoinduced carbon monoxide (CO) releasing molecules (photoCORMs). Such
molecules are of significant interest for the administration of small amounts of
CO that produces anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, as well as
vasodilation and protection of tissues against reperfusion injury. The modular
design to be pursued involves the use of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone unit as the CO
release motif. Studies of zinc complexes wherein the structure of the pyrone and
a supporting chelate ligand are systematically modified will enable elucidation
of chemical factors that influence structure/physical property relationships and
CO release reactivity. Complementary computational and mechanistic studies will
provide insight into the reaction pathway involved in CO release and will
provide guidance in the design of subsequent generations of pyrone-based CO
release agents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new photoCORMs to be
developed have the potential for use in biological and medicinal chemistry
investigations, as well as applications in chemical synthesis. This project is
fully integrated with the recruitment and training of undergraduate and graduate
students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the
sciences. Students will receive training in synthesis and photochemistry, and
will benefit from interactions with domestic and international collaborators.
