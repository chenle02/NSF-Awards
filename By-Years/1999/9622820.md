Abstract ATM-9622820 Tucker, Donna F. University of Kansas Title: Summer Plateau
Circulation Systems of Western North America This award will allow the
investigation of the summer plateau circulation system of western North America
for two time periods, one in the most recent ten years and one in the most
recent thirty years. Different types of special data, available from military
and other mesonets over this region, will be utilized for this purpose. An
attempt will be made to examine the interannual variability of these circulation
systems. This type of data analysis is important for understanding the plateau
climate and for the validation of climate models over such problematic high
elevation regions.
