9406269 Pullin This Americas Program award will support a collaborative research
between Dr. Jorge Pullin, The Pennsylvania State University and Professor
Rodolfo Gambini, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay, on the
application of loop techniques to the quantization of general relativity. The
objective is to study the extended loop representation of quantum gravity in
which loops are replaced by extended objects which help deal with regularization
issues, and, to analyze the equivalence between the connection and group
representations. They also propose to study the underlying classical canonical
theory, which has potential to become a useful reformulation of classical
general relativity. The concept of reconciling general relativity and quantum
mechanics is one of the most intractable of modern theoretical physics. The need
for a quantum theory of gravity is clear, both on theoretical grounds and for
practical purposes, but, so far, all straightforward attempts to quantize
general relativity have failed. This proposal will focus on a new approach to
this problem, derived from the recent discovery of new loop variables and the
reformulation of general relativity as a theory of connections. This is an
important research that will benefit greatly from the complementary expertise of
the researchers, and that is likely to have a substantial impact on progress in
quantum gravity. ***
