9361317 Shook This nation has more than 11 million manholes which now need or
soon will need to be rehabilitated. Current techniques are either too costly or
do not last. This research speaks to this problem through development of an
innovative technique of restoring many of these structures at less than half the
cost of the reliable methods available today. The concept uses a newly developed
applicator which can apply combinations of portland, high-alumina, or polymer
cements. Fundamental to the requirement of a repair which lasts more than a few
months is application of sufficient thickness of a strong but inexpensive cement
which when needed can be protected with a coating of chemically resistant
material such as latex or urethane. Key to the proposed process is the ability
of the applicator to place uniform thicknesses of cement of sufficient thickness
without costly forms and wither the need for people to enter the manhole. The
latter not only reduces costs but improves safety.
