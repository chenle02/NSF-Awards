This EAGER project is engaged in the initial development of a postsecondary
educational attainment data dashboard. It is organizing and analyzing available
data from multiple existing sources to provide an annotated and coherent set of
STEM metrics that can be used over time. The dashboard integrates issues that
are often separated, such as high school graduation, college enrollment and
postsecondary attainment, with a particular focus on those underrepresented in
STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will take advantage of all existing data
sources, and with expert input, create a web-based platform on STEM educational
attainment for use by evaluators, researchers, and
policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the risks are substantial (both
technically and methodologically), there will be significant value if the
project succeeds in creating coherence around STEM educational attainment.
