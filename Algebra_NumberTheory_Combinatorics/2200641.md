Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, and related
fields such as physics, cryptography, and other sciences. When such a system
describes a one-dimensional object, the corresponding geometric object is known
as an algebraic curve. Broadly speaking, this project studies the geometry of
algebraic curves, both individually and as they vary in families. One specific
question this project investigates is the concept of interpolation: When can a
certain type of curve be passed through a general collection of points? In other
words, one can draw a line through any two points in the plane and draw a circle
through any three points in the plane, unless those three points lie on a line.
More generally, the PI will consider what happens for other types of curves in
higher-dimensional spaces, assuming again that the points do not lie in any
special configurations. This project also includes training for undergraduate
students.

The project considers various questions for the investigation of the structure
of the equations of general curves. For example, in what degrees are they
generated? What is the Betti table of a general divisor on such a curve? The PI
will also investigate certain natural vector bundles on curves that control
their deformation theory --- the restricted tangent bundle and the normal bundle
--- and study how they break down into stable vector bundles, which are the
atomic building blocks of all vector bundles. Finally, the PI will study the
geometry of moduli spaces of curves, focusing on their integral intersection
theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
