This project seeks to tap the vast amount of latent mathematical ability in the
young people of America. Its goal is to expose students in these critical years
to mathematics as practiced by professionals and to empower them with a feeling
that useful information can be gleaned from the simplest of models. Interacting
with these professionals, seeing their lifestyles and work habits, becoming
involved with the same problems, will yield a much more accurate picture of
careers in the mathematical sciences in the rewards, both intellectual and
financial, that they bring. It is also necessary to involve instructors of the
mathematical sciences in this adventure because it is they who will transmit the
excitement and importance of mathematics and science on a day-to-day basis.
