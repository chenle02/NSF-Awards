This award allows the replacement of the unreliable 1970s vintage ion
accelerator and supporting beam components in the Department of Physics at East
Carolina University (ECU) with a modern ion beam system based on a new positive-
ion tandem accelerator. The new system will provide stable, energetic light and
heavy ion beams in an energy range of 300 keV to 8 MeV, perfectly suited for the
laboratory's research in radiation physics, atomic interactions in gases and
solids, and trace element analysis. The research involves faculty, graduate
students, and numerous undergraduate students. In addition to basic and applied
physics research, the laboratory is being used for interdisciplinary research
with the Departments of Biology, Geology, Anthropology, and the ECU Brody School
of Medicine.

The research at this facility contributes directly to the central mission of ECU
and the University of North Carolina system by training students at both the
graduate and undergraduate levels. In particular, it fills a critical need in
the region, the state, and the nation by training students in science. The
technical knowledge gained, and more importantly the critical thinking skills
developed, through this training in experimental physics can be applied broadly
across all fields of science and engineering. These highly trained students will
contribute to the technically literate workforce critically needed in the United
States. East Carolina University serves the primarily rural, economically
depressed eastern portion of North Carolina, and has a relatively high minority
student population. The student training supported by the proposed
instrumentation will continue to include, as it has in the past, minority
students that are severely underrepresented in science, and particularly in
physics. The proposed instrumentation will also serve as a recruiting tool to
increase student interest in science and encourage student participation in
research.
