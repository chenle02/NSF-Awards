The goal of this research is to develop and demonstrate a new real-time laser
technique for the in-situ analysis of deformation at sliding conacts. This
special laser technique produces multiple interference patterns appears as fine,
randomly distributed "speckles" which serve to fingerprint the positions of all
points on the surface. The movement of such points by plastic deformation is
then recorded by simple photographic methods, and serves as detection of
material flow on the contact surface.
