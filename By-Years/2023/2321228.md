The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an innovative technology designed to improve the safety and
security of autonomous vehicles and robots, automation systems, and smart
devices. It is built on the development of autonomous motion planning and
control algorithms inspired by human drivers to perform aggressive vehicle
maneuvers for high-agility, unstable fast vehicle motions. The platform can
analyze combined safety and security risk surfaces for these connected cyber-
physical systems, providing an enabling tool to determine the maximum
operational domain and functional limits of autonomous or intelligent systems.
The technology development also allows for simulation testbeds for these systems
and devices to test their interconnection security, mimicking real-world
scenarios.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform which has direct
applications in the connected cyber-physical systems market. Autonomous
vehicles, robotics, and smart devices are widely used in various industries, and
the demand for safety and security certifications for these systems is
increasing rapidly. This technology provides an innovative tool to analyze the
combined safety and security risk surfaces for these systems, making it possible
to design human-inspired active safety features for next-generation "accident-
free" vehicles or robots. The technology can also extend to various other fields
that require safety and security risk assessments. This project has the
potential to enrich STEM education in emerging technologies such as robotics,
machine learning, and smart devices, and to support the national welfare and
prosperity by advancing the safety and security of autonomous systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
