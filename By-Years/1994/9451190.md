9451190 Lee A research platform developed at the University of Pennsylvania,
"teleconferenced workstations", expands a cutting-edge curriculum in
Telecommunications and Systems at Penn. "Teleconferenced workstations" are a
unique mode of communication currently being used by members of the AURORA
Gigabit Testbed, which connects Penn, MIT, IBM Research, and Bell Communications
Research. The test bed service provision includes support for multimedia and
Teleconferencing. We will use and experiment with this technology as part of a
new course entitled "Distributed and Real-time Systems", as well as in an
existing course entitled "Telecommunications networks". The courses not only
discuss the principles behind the technology, but have a carefully constructed
laboratory component with projects that apply the concepts covered in lectures
to components of the prototyped system at Penn. This will not only augment our
current curriculum in Telecommunications and Systems, but will serve as an
excellent vehicle to evaluate the effectiveness of the teleconferenced
workstation environment.
