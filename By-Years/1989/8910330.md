An experimental program to study oxidation chemistry of selected chlorinated
hydrocarbons under conditions similar to those in an incinerator afterburner
will be established. The species of interest are the chlorinated ethenes which
are "appendix VIII" hazardous wastes and have been measured as major
intermediates during the combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The experiments
will be conducted at atmospheric pressure in a turbulent flow reactor over the
temperature range 700 to 1100 K for selected fuel lean equivalence ratios. Gas
chromatographic analysis will be used to measure the reaction intermediates and
products associated with the oxidation process. Results from these studies will
be used to identify stable intermediates formed during the oxidation of the
reactants and to develop chemical kinetic models valid in this temperature
regime.
