This study seeks to understand the consequences of high- density predator
aggregations to prey behavior and predator- predator interactions. In central
Oklahoma, two species of predaceous antlion larvae (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae)
coexist at very high densities in a narrow zone at the base of sandstone cliffs.
From the prey's perspective, what are the behavioral responses to this spatially
persistent predation risk? The foraging strategy of ants will be studied in
response to experimental field manipulations of predation risk and foraging
reward. From the predator's perspective, what are the interactions between
species that occur within the zone? The nature of these interactions will be
revealed through a series of field experiments that manipulate predator density
and food supply. The results of this study will shed light on the details of
predator-prey interactions, and may provide insight into effective strategies
for biological control of arthropod pests.
