This award supports research on the representation theory of affine Hecke
algebras and quantum groups. The principal investigator will work on completing
the classification of the unramified representations of semisimple split p-adic
groups, via graded Hecke algebras and equivariant homology. He will also
continue the study of the parameter space of these representations from the
point of view of intersection cohomology. Further, he will study canonical bases
in enveloping algebras and the total positivity in reductive groups over the
reals. Many different algebraic objects can be represented as algebraic sets of
transformations of other algebraic objects. Through these representations their
structure can be determined. This project is concerned with the representation
theory of certain algebras. The study of these algebras has applications
throughout mathematics and mathematical physics.
