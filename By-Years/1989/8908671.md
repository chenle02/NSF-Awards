A method is proposed to study the group design process in engineering. Group
design embodies the individual design effort with the additional complications
caused by input from multiple individuals and the need to coordinate the group
effort. These additional dimensions make the group design process difficult to
study and little work has been done in this area. The objectives of the proposed
study are (a) to build a computerized group design system (GDS) and (b) to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the system for studying group design
methodology. Completion of this work will provide a valuable tool for studying
group design methodology. The GDS will be built using a small cluster of
microcomputers and a multiuser data base. The designers will enter transactions
via a keyboard or sketch pad. Direction of the group effort will be
accomplished, via the computer system, by a group leader. The system will be
tested by industrial designers. The results will be presented as a sequence of
interdependent, categorized, design activities. By empirically studying these
interdependent relationships an explanation of how design is produced can be
developed.
