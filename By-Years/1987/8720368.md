The proposed research addresses the role of burial depths, uplift rates, and
thermal parameters as controls on large-scale patterns of mineral equilibria in
classic metamorphic terranes in Vermont and New Hampshire. Also, it is proposed
that regional variations in thermal properties of the crust are required to
explain the complicated variations in pressures (burial) and temperatures
inferred for rocks in this region. Combined field and theoretical studies will
be carried out to evaluate this hypothesis. Specifically, detailed studies will
evaluate metamorphic pressure, cooling rates near peak metamorphism, and effects
of lateral heat transfer to determine the relative roles of he above three
parameters on distribution of mineral isograds. Timing of metamorphism will be
determined by geochronological methods to understand the connection between
tectonic and metamorphic history.
