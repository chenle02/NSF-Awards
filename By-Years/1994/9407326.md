Abstract IBN9407326 Ruth Colwill This award supports continuing analysis of the
way in which information is represented about basic instrumental and Pavlovian
conditioning operations. The primary goal of this research is to characterize
the nature of the associative structures that mediate instrumental, goal-
directed behavior. During the two year funding period, Dr. Colwill and her
colleagues will pursue two issues. First, they will examine the influence of
multiple outcome associates of the response on leaning about stimuli that signal
the occurrence of those outcomes. They will analyze cues that resolve the
ambiguity of the response's potential consequences and compare them with cues
that predict multiple outcomes nondifferentially. The hypothesis being tested is
that the former condition generates hierarchical learning whereas the latter
produces pairwise associations between the stimulus (S), response (R) and
outcomes (O). Second, they will examine the integrity of these two structures
when the same stimulus is exposed concurrently to training situation, each of
which separately promotes different associative structures. In addition, they
will continue their analysis of the properties of binary associations. The focus
will be on two questions; (1) the nature of the association between S and R, and
(2) the relative contributions of R-O and O-R associations to performance of
extensively trained responses. This issue is important to settle not only for
theoretical reasons but because knowledge of the associations influencing
performance is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to
the R-O contingency.
