Coherent optical detection offers the potential to substantially increase the
capabilities of existing long-haul and local area fiber- optic networks.
However, random drift of the signal polarization presents the major obstacle to
this method of detection. The objective of this proposed program is to develop a
polarization controller that will compensate for this polarization drift
enabling the use of coherent detection. We will research the use of liquid
crystals to accomplish this means. This approach will be comparatively much less
expensive and easier to implement that other methods that are currently under
research.
