This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Nonlinear
and Modern Mathematical Physics" that will be held in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia),
from May 4-8 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent
developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of mathematical physics and
partial differential equations. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
