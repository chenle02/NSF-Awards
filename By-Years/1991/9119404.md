A group of researchers at the University of Louisville requests funding for half
of the cost of a circular dichroism spectrometer, which will be used for
assessing peptide and protein secondary structure in solution, for investigating
changes in protein conformation induced by alterations in temperature, solvent,
pH, or ligand binding, and for conformational analysis of synthetic polypeptides
and recombinant proteins. The specific projects proposed include application of
circular dichroism to the following systems: (1) purified, soluble cytochrome
P-450 isozymes, and the membrane anchoring peptide of NADPH-cytochrome P-450
reductase, (2) cytoplasmic and microsomal enzymes involved in the metabolism of
foreign compounds, (3) recombinant human fibroblast procollagenase and
collagenase, (4) native RNA processing enzymes and recombinant enzymes altered
by site-directed mutagenesis, (5) mitochondrial targeting signal peptides, (6)
Ca++ -induced conformational changes in chromogranin A, and (7) synthetic
peptides containing amide bond replacements (pseudopeptides).
