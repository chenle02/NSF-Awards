With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Satoru Masamune of the Department of Chemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor Masamune will focus his work on
developing strategies for the production of catalytic antibodies. The goal is to
find catalysts whose activities are comparable to those of their natural enzyme
counterparts. The focus of this research is hapten design and synthesis and the
use of both homologous and heterologous immunization for the production of
catalytic antibodies. Target catalysts include aspartic protease-like
antibodies, catalytic antibodies for amide bond cleavage with an external
nucleophile and glycosidase antibodies.
