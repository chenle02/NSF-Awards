This three-year U.S.-France award in solid state chemistry and polymers
involves Joel S. Miller at the University of Utah and Jacques Flouquet and
Jacques Schweizer at the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires in Grenoble, France. They
propose to study the properties of molecule/polymer-based magnets. The objective
of their research is to determine the location and magnitude of the total spin
density and the crucial magnetic structure using neutron diffraction techniques.
The collaboration takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the U.S. and
French investigators in chemistry, materials research and physics and the
excellent neutron diffraction facilities in Grenoble.
