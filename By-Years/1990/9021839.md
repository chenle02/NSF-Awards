This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte for the renovation and repair of Smith Engineering Building which
houses that institution's civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering and
computer science research and research training activities. This building was
constructed in 1966 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant
of $200,000 and $200,850 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities and will help sustain
the growth in and increasing technical demands of the research program of the
College of Engineering. This project will address the need to improve the
current research infrastructure by (a) providing better environmental control
for the building, additional wiring to upgrade the data communications system
between offices and laboratories in speed and capabilities, and space in the
laboratories for graduate students; (b) locating or reconfiguring many of the
research laboratories and support shops to achieve increased space with greater
efficiency for use in new projects; and (c) improving the security of the
laboratories. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and
engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and
for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. Engineering
research at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has turned in recent
years to several areas of significant national importance, including micro- and
opto-electronics and computer-controlled manufacturing. Students trained in
these laboratories, which will be better suited to such studies as a result of
the renovation, are in demand in both basic and applied research fields.
