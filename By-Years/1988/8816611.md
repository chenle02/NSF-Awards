Dr. Hackenbrock plans to expand his biophysical studies on the relationship
between diffusion-based collisional interactions and electron transport
activities of the redox components in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.
Results reveal that diffusion-based collisions between all redox partners occur
with frequencies sufficient to account for the maximum rate of their electron
transfers. Dr. Hackenbrock intends to investigate the role of diffusion of the
redox components in the control of the rate of maximum and coupled electron
transport. A combination of highly technical biophysical approaches will be used
including, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, fluorescence
polarization, resonance energy transfer, total internal reflection fluorescence
and digitized video and nanovid microscopy. The transfer of electrons in
membranes is preceded by random, diffusion-based collisions between all redox
partners in a highly fluid membrane environment. All redox components are highly
mobile diffusants and suggest that such diffusion is rate limiting for maximum
electron transport.***//
