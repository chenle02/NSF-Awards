The College of William and Mary in Virginia will offer a ten-week program of
physics research for junior-level undergraduates. Approximately 20
undergraduates are expected to participate in the research program: 10 to be
supported by this grant, 5 supported by other grants, and 5 supported by the
DeWilde Fellowships. DeWilde Fellowships are funded by a private endowment to
the physics department that owe their creation in large part to the success of
the REU program at William and Mary. A 2 teacher RET program associated with the
MINOS neutrino project is included. The William and Mary physics department, a
large, nationally ranked Ph.D. granting program, together with the applied
science department, and in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center and
Jefferson Lab provides mentors and projects in atom-atom, atom-ion, and atom-
surface scattering, surface physics, ultra-sonics, laser physics and laser-atom
interactions, condensed matter physics with a variety of techniques, nuclear and
particle physics, polymer physics, non-destructive evaluation, plasma physics,
non-linear dynamics, quantum computing and quantum information, and
astrophysics/cosmology. This program provides an opportunity for undergraduates
to take part in real research and to become deeply involved in a particular
research field. The presentation skills learned (abstract preparation, short
paper presentation, long paper preparation and presentation) are skills useful
throughout productive careers. Almost all of the approximately 250 previous
participants have gone on to graduate school in the sciences. Some program
activities will be held jointly with Hampton University. The teachers will lead
public tours at Soudan and will generate course material to integrate their
experience with other high school teachers. This project is co-funded by the
Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities and Physics Division.
