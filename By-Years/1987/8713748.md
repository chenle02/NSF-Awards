An expert systems for the assessment of wind-induced damage will be built to
evaluate structural loses and to determine structural integrity and
survivability under extreme wind conditions. The system will combine elements of
wind, structural and knowledge engineering. This system will provide information
concerning damage patterns, that could be used to formulate upgrading strategies
and to evaluate the safety of existing structures. It could also lead to a more
uniform level of structural reliability.
