Many foreign agents form covalent adducts with DNA. These lesions are removed
by nucleotide excision repair systems such as the UvrABC endonuclease system of
E. coli. The mechanism and efficiency of repair may depend on the DNA structure
at the site of the lesion. Using homogeneous substrates specifically modified
with a psoralen monoadduct or crosslink, DNA sequences and helix conformation
will be related to the in vitro efficiency of DNA repair. Protein DNA complexes
and intermediate products will be analyzed in order to formulate biochemical
mechanisms of repair. It is proposed to test whether the rate of repair of a
crosslink depends on the DNA conformation; whether fast repair is due to rapid
incision by UvrABC endonuclease and whether slow repair may form a high affinity
UvrAB-lesion nucleoprotein complex which promotes subsequent slower steps such
as recombinational repair. Nucleotide Excision DNA repair is a natural cellular
defense mechanism by which a cell, using multienzyme complexes rids itself of a
variety of lesions in its DNA. A feature in common among these DNA lesions may
be a distortion of the local DNA conformation which becomes attractive to the
nucleotide excision repair enzymes, allowing this enzyme system to exhibit a
broad range of substrate specificity. In more complex DNA lesions repair may
also require the participation of DNA recombinant enzymes. Dr. Yeung will study
the repair of psoralen-DNA monoadducts and crosslinks in purified system using a
number of repair enzymes and defined DNA substrates in order to better
understand the mechanism of this important cellular process.
