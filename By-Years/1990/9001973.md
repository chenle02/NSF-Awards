Three investigators will study problems in the areas of geometric partial
differential equations, mathematical physics, and dynamical systems. One will
continue his investigation of geometric aspects of the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem and the relationship between quantum field theory and low-dimensional
topology. A second will continue an ongoing investigation of the harmonic map
equation and its connections with Poisson-Lie structures and quantum groups. She
will also investigate the Yang-Mills functional in dimensions larger than four.
A third investigator will study the knot types of periodic orbits in the Lorenz
attractor. Three investigators will continue ongoing projects involved in
differential equations, topology, and mathematical physics. Differential
equations relate the rate of change of one or more variables with respect to
each other, or with respect to time. Topology is the mathematical study of
shape. Both of these areas have a long history of use in mathematical physics.
