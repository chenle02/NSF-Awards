Ten students will receive support from this Research Experiences for
Undergraduates award. They will work under the direction of three faculty
advisors for a period of two summer months. In the preceding award,
institutional support for five additional students was provided; a similar
arrangement is anticipated with the receipt of this grant. Much of the
experimental work involves computational work which will be carried out in the
Mathematics Computer Assisted Learning Center. The center has excellent computer
and software resources available to the researchers. The primary theme used
during the first year to exemplify the experimental nature of mathematical
research will be computational and combinatorial group theory. Here computers
have not only been used to check examples and discover patterns but also to
settle problems which have been reduced to a finite number of cases. After an
orientation period, students will begin work on problems concerning the Mobius
function of finite groups, finding the number of reduced expressions in the
Coxeter generators for elements of the affine Weyl group and, along a more
geometric line, to look at the Hurwitz problem for finite simple groups of small
order. This final area concerns the problem of determining all possible genera
of closed, orientable surfaces which admit a symmetry by the group.
