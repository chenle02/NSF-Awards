AST-0120987&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gyuk, Geza&lt;br/&gt;Inst: Adler
Planetarium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award under the MPS Internships in
Public Science Education Program, the Adler Planetarium will sponsor a unique
graduate fellowship program. The Adler Public Education Fellowship is aimed at
drawing young researchers into closer ties with public education and outreach.
Each year, a graduate student actively involved in research will be selected as
a Fellow and will be responsible for planning, developing, managing and teaching
a 4-5 week summer program for local high school students and carrying out a
program of public observing/demonstrations on the Apache Point 3.5meter
telescope. The Astro-Science Workshop will be a themed, research-based
experience combining lectures by prominent astronomers/astrophysicists and
hands-on student research and exploration. Because the Fellowship is intended to
promote the development of researchers/educators, the Fellow is also expected to
continue a vigorous program of research at their home institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;***
