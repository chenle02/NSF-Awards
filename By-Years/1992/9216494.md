Using modern panoramic detectors and modern computers a massive photometric
search for variable objects in the Galactic Bulge is being undertaken. About
100,000,000 photometric measurements are obtained each year. The primary goal is
to detect gravitational microlensing of the Bulge stars by stars, brown dwarfs
and planets in the intervening galactic disk. A large catalogue of variable
stars of all kinds will be generated and made available to any interested
investigator.
