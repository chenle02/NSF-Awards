ITR/AP+IM: Poseidon- Rapid Real-Time Interdisciplinary Ocean Forecasting:
Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Modeling in a Distributed Environment



Progress in understanding the complex coupled physics, biology and acoustics of
the oceans is accelerating via research on realistic nonlinear multiscale
interdisciplinary processes, interactions and variabilities.

To cope with the variabilities of such economies in space and time, dynamical
model structures must evolve during the prediction, i.e., by adaptive modeling.
The objective of this project is to enable by an effective union of information
technologies and ocean sciences, efficient mulitscale interdisciplinary ocean
prediction with real-time objective adaptive sampling, assimilation of multiple
streams of interdisciplinary data, and autonomous adaptive modeling
