University&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic Differentiation of Functional
Programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automatic Differentiation (AD) is an
established enterprise that seeks to take the derivatives of functions specified
as imperative programs through symbolic manipulation rather than finite
differencing. A framework for applying AD techniques to modern functional-
programming languages, instead of imperative&lt;br/&gt;programs, will be
investigated. This framework will treat AD operators as higher-order functions
that map function objects to function objects. These operators will be
compositional and will apply to more general functions than the maps between
real vectors to which traditional AD transformations are limited. This framework
offers several advantages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a callee can perform the
necessary AD rather than insisting that callers provide appropriately
transformed functions, making it practical to compositionally build an efficient
library of functions based on derivatives &lt;br/&gt;- higher-order derivatives
can be constructed naturally, without special mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;- gradients
can be taken through processes that themselves involve AD-based optimization or
approximate iterate-to-fixedpoint operators such as PDE
solvers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have broad impact in such
diverse fields as engineering design, scientific computing, and machine
learning, where researchers regularly need to take derivatives of complex
programs. It has intellectual merit as it offers a novel synthesis of the
differential calculus with the lambda calculus.&lt;br/&gt;
