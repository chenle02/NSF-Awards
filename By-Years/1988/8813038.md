The Wilson Botanical Garden at Las Cruces, Costa Rica is a tropical biological
station set in a diverse mosaic of natural and agricultural ecosystems at middle
elevations on the Pacific slopes. As an increasingly important focal point for
the training and research of U. S. and Latin American scientists, it plays a
dual role by serving as a traditional site for ecological and systematic
exploration of the premontane forests, and as a base for initiatives in tropical
agricultural ecology and germplasm conservation. Due to continued expansion of
research and increasing competition for the limited multi-purpose space, there
is currently a great demand for basic scientific equipment and all-terrain
transport at the site. This project will provide partial funding for the first
stage of a phased program to upgrade the facility in order to accommodate
greater numbers of investigators for longer terms with improved scientific
resources. Because of its ties to a broad cross section of the U.S. and
international academic communities, this facility will benefit users from an
exceptionally diverse geographic and disciplinary spectrum.
