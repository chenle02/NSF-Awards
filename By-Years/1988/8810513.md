It was once thought that we could "objectively" observe and analyze other
cultures and societies and draw clear conclusions about their nature and
structure. With the revolution which has occurred in the philosophy of science
in which "objectivity" is even denied to physical sciences, the possibility of
an "objective" social science is now seen as beyond reach. Ethnographic studies
are now recognized as a more or less subjective observation of a foreign culture
as seen through a prism the observer's own culture, life experience and
training. In this study, Dr. Mark is continuing her examination of ethnographic
studies of the Mbuti pygmies of the Ituri Forest of Zaire. Specifically she is
concentrating on the life and work of one of these observers, P.T.L. Putnam
(1904-1953) and two of his contemporaries, Paul Schebesta and Colin Turnbull.
The study is based on Dr. Mark's examination of Putnam's personal papers and
field notes, on interviews with people who knew him, and on extensive library
research. She will use this detailed examination of Putnam in order to compare
his work with that of Schebesta and Turnbull. Through this comparison she will
then be able to examine how differing national traditions in anthropology,
differing ethnographic goals, and differing personal quests affect fieldwork and
the writing of ethnographies. This study promises to make significant
contributions to the history of anthropology, to our understanding of the nature
of ethnography, and to the sociology of knowledge in general.
