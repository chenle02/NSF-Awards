The goal of this RIA award is to understand the reasons for the reduction in the
densification rate of ceramic matrices when low volume fractions of inclusions
are incorporated in the particle compact. Experiments will be performed to: (1)
identify critical parameters that can be used to predict the densification of
the composites, and (2) explore the ways in which processing variables affect
the critical parameters. This understanding will lead to processing strategies
that produce dense, defect- free ceramic composites.
