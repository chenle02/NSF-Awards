This project deals with a novel molding method, namely, low thermal inertia mold
(LTIM) of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). The LTIM technique enables surfaces of
the part to be heated and cooled rapidly using thermoelectric elements. The
thermoplastic elastomers are unique in that they exhibit thermal reversibilities
and rubbery mechanical properties. The objective of this project is to improve
the fracture properties of molded TPE's through a systematic investigation of
the effect of mold temperature on the fracture energy. The fracture properties
will be correlated with the thermomechanical history of the processed TPE's
using a computer simulation package known as 'C-flow', developed by Cornell
University. Based on this correlation, the optimum mold temperature can be
prescribed to yield the best fracture strength attainable. The LTIM can then aid
in optimizing the fracture property by controlling the kinetics of
solidification which govern the microstructure of the two-phase system and the
overall anisotropy of the molded TPE part.
