This award provides support for a continuing series of conference/workshops
focusing on problems and advances in the theory of partial differential
equations. The meetings are hosted by various midwestern institutions on a
rotating basis. Two principal speakers are invited, often from outside the
region. Six additional talks are also scheduled. These spring-fall meetings date
back to 1977 and have admirably fulfilled their goals of bringing together
researchers for intensive discussions twice each year. In addition, graduate
students are urged to attend. Many researchers go to great lengths to see that
these students have transportation and lodging. Attendance is now between 70 and
80 mathematicians. Many do not ask for support, keeping the total cost to an
absolute minimum. The breadth of strength and interest in partial differential
equations in the region is truly impressive. Areas ranging from numerical
simulations of turbulence to abstract equations in several complex variables can
be represented at any meeting. The activity has measurably contributed to the
health of mathematics in the region.
