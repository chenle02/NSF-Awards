The largest web search engines now receive hundreds of millions of queries per
day that need to be answered in fractions of a second on collections of tens of
billions of web documents. In order to process all these queries, search engines
consume increasing amounts of hardware and energy resources. This project
focuses on developing new algorithms, index structures, and other software
techniques for scaling query processing in search engines, that is, techniques
that allow queries to be executed faster and on larger data sets using fewer
hardware and energy resources.

Research activities in this project focus on three main approaches. First, the
project studies how index size and access time can be reduced through improved
index compression techniques. Second, work on new early termination techniques
considers how the top results for a query can be computed without exhaustive
traversal of the index structures for the query terms, for simple ranking
functions such as BM25 or Cosine, and for the more complex functions with many
features used by current web search engines. Finally, the project explores
general techniques for query optimization in information retrieval (IR) systems,
inspired by the significant body of work on query optimizers in database
systems.

Web search engines are a multi-billion dollar industry and a crucial component
of the internet. Techniques resulting from this project are expected to benefit
this industry by reducing the hardware cost and energy consumption of large-
scale search services. Results will be disseminated through publications in
major conferences and journals, tutorials at conferences, distribution of
software libraries, contributions to existing software tools such as Lucene.
This project provides research and educational opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students and prepare them for later work at companies, research
labs, or universities. Web site (http://cis.poly.edu/westlab/queryproc/)
