The World Wide Web has become part of our everyday life, and information
retrieval and data mining on the Web are now of enormous practical interest. The
algorithms supporting these activities combine the view of the Web as a text
repository and as a graph, induced in various ways by links among pages, hosts
and users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the 8th Workshop on Algorithms and
Models for the Web Graph (WAW 2011) is to further the understanding of graphs
that arise from the Web and various user activities on the Web, and stimulate
the development of high-performance algorithms and applications that exploit
these graphs. The workshop will also welcome the researchers who are working on
graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of related complex networks, including
citation networks, social networks, biological networks, molecular networks, and
other networks arising from the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web site:
