9310007 RUGGIERO This project will examine the impact of European legal science
on the modernizing processes of Latin America. Legal professionals and legal
interpretations of scientific theories about human behavior played a key role in
the shaping of Argentine history and society. Although Argentina was a post-
colonial nation at this time, it remained part of Europe's "informal empire."
Thus, Argentina's modernizing processes, as was true of much of Latin America,
were greatly influenced by and intertwined with European models. The study
focuses on Argentina to illuminate the complex intellectual and cultural
relationship that existed between Latin America and Europe, and the broader
international world and history that legal science shared. Its interdisciplinary
approach will result in bringing together a variety of published works and and
previously unstudied archival materials on legal science found in both Argentina
and Europe to provide a deeper insight into how the transnational diffusion of
scientific thought influenced lives and actions. This research will make an
important contribution to our empirical knowledge and theoretical understanding
of transnational processes in the relationship between law and society. The
investigator will examine three main sources: the dossiers of criminal court
cases, the archival records of institutions of detention, and published legal
treatises. The field research will be conducted in Buenos Aires, London, Paris,
Rome and Bologna. The investigator will produce a monograph on law and society
in nineteenth century Argentina and a collection of primary texts, translated
and edited, which document legal science in this period. ***
