Software Engineering (34)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defective, or "bug-riddled,"
software is a serious problem in the software industry, costing U.S. companies
as much as $100 billion last year. Software testing is a critical tool for
addressing this issue, but unfortunately, it is viewed as boring and uncreative
by practitioners and receives little formal treatment in undergraduate programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a series of
on-line education modules covering software testing that will be integrated at
several levels across the undergraduate computer science
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module content will allow the instructor to
adjust the coverage assigned to students, and assign module content in parallel
with ongoing class programming assignments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result
will be an array of services with an easy-to-use web interface, allowing
students to use the tool in many different classes, allowing instructors to
incorporate tool-based testing in their own assignments, and supporting use by
students and educators at multiple institutions. As an integral part of the
project, summer research interns from Virginia Tech's Minority Academic
Opportunities Program will participate in both research and educational aspects
of the proposed work. &lt;br/&gt;
