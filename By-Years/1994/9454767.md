9454767 Sadler We are proposing to network together several remote telescopes
and to test the feasibility of their use by students from grades 4-12. We will
design and test specialized software that will allow students to work with each
other and to collaborate with astronomers on research projects. Remote control
of telescopes has the potential to transform conventional science classes and to
serve students with physical disabilities. Such a network will allow students,
even in communities that are resource poor, access to powerful tools that will
increase their educational opportunities. This project will examine the problems
inherent in using remote instruments and test solutions which will improve ease-
of-use and accessibility to a wide audience. This project will provide a model
to be followed in placing other remote scientific instruments on the Internet
for educational purposes. It could prove a catalyst in encouraging the
collaboration of scientists and pre-college students in research projects. It
could also result in the discovery of new asteroids, comets, and variable stars
by our nation's youth.
