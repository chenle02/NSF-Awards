The proposed research will exploit parallelism in unconstrained structural
optimization problems involving Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Typical
engineering problems involve large finite element models and optimization
algorithms take several hundred iterations. Parallel finite element analysis and
optimization cannot be decoupled because calculation of gradients is closely
tied with the function evaluation (FEA), requiring proper distribution of data
such as global stiffness matrix and displacement solution across processors.
Since the total computational cost is dominated by the cost of function
evaluation, methods that result in fewer function evaluations at the expense of
more linear algebraic operations per iteration might be preferred. This might
require the calculation of second derivatives in order to obtain a better
quadratic model. The parallelization of linear elastic finite element analysis
and parallel calculation of first and/or second derivatives will be considered.
In the area of biomechanics, researchers are using optimization methods to
predict the distribution of material properties in the human femur due to the
presence of artificial implants. Several theoretical models have been proposed.
A typical model would formulate bone remodeling as an optimization problem where
the objective function is strain energy and the independent variables are the
material properties in each finite element. Parallel structural optimization
will be used to solve some problems in this field.
