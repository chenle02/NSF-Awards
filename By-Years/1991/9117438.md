The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Roger Nielsen of Oregon
State University, will study the partitioning of rare earth elements between
pyroxene minerals and melts over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The
data will provide important information to geologists who are attempting to
understand the origin and evolution of igneous rocks and magmas.
