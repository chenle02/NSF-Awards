This is a program to design and build a modular general-purpose spectrometer for
SETI and radio astronomy applications. The instrument will mainly be used to
conduct multibeam SETI and astronomical observations at NSF's Arecibo
Observatory. The investigators are working closely with several radio astronomy
groups who will use the instrument and/or its technology in other traditional
radio astronomy applications. The spectrometer is a two billion channel
instrument, dubbed "SERENDIP V". The SERENDIP V system includes new capabilities
not found in any other instrument. SERENDIP V is designed to operate in
conjunction with a seven-beam receiver system which will be installed at the
Arecibo telescope in 2003. The SERENDIP V system will analyze signals from all
beams simultaneously in dual polarization, effectively observing seven points on
the sky simultaneously. This instrument will be used to perform SETI, HI,
continuum polarization, and dispersed pulse surveys concurrently with a large-
scale pulsar survey of the galactic plane that is to be performed using the
multibeam receiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
