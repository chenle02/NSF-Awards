Research will be carried out utilizing electromagnetic and electroweak
interactions to study nucleons and nuclei. Primary emphasis is on measuring
elementary nucleon form factors, studying the few-body system with emphasis on
the deuteron, and initiating a program of parity violating asymmetry
measurements to determine the role of strange quark admixtures to the nucleon
ground state. This research is being undertaken at the Bates Linear Accelerator
Center and CEBAF, with calibration of proton and neutron polarimeters being
performed at IUCF and Saclay. Efforts to be supported include: (1) commissioning
of the Bates recoil proton polarimeter and carrying out an initial experimental
program with this polarimeter; (2) continuation of neutron electric and magnetic
form factor measurements at Bates and CEBAF; (3) carrying out a program of
d(e,e'p)n polarization transfer measurements as part of the initial Hall A
physics program at CEBAF; (4) beginning an experimental program of parity
violation measurements at CEBAF. The development and exploitation of new spin
physics techniques are major objectives of this program. William and Mary
College will also design and construct the Hall A coincidence trigger using
CEBAF equipment funds and graduate student manpower.
