An improved understanding of climate change is a universally important goal of
contemporary environmental science, but a critical key to understanding
perturbations in present climate and any cause and effect relationships may well
lie in better characterizing the past climate record. This collaborative venture
between investigators at the University of Denver and the Harvard University-
Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory will digitally preserve
historical archive solar observational records acquired on photographic plates
during the period 1925-1950 and extract from them atmospheric composition data
for radiatively important trace gas species such as carbon dioxide, methane and
ozone. Independent measurements of changes in atmospheric composition for this
time period characterizing the rapid spin-up phase of the 'Industrial Age' and
where few direct measurements are documented is at the cornerstone of enhancing
present understanding of the anthropogenic and natural influences on climate
change on a global scale. The broader impacts of this project include preserving
a very important archival data set representing a significant and unique source
of knowledge about long-term atmospheric trends, and thereby possibly
facilitating a variety of climate relevant studies in the future. Support is
provided for undergraduate participation through the University of Denver
component that should enhance research experience options for young
geoscientists at that institution.
