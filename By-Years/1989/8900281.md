The study will examine high resolution, rapid sedimentation rate record of
contourites along western margin of North Atlantic in order to decipher the
changes in the rate of formation of North Atlantic deep water (NADW) and the
intensity of western boundary undercurrent (WBUC) during the Pleistocene. Blake
Outer Ridge (BOR), which is the largest contourite drift in western North
Atlantic and extends form 2000 to 4900 m depth, is the target study area. Its
ridge crest contains an amplified high resolution signal of WBUC. Previously
funded pilot study on WBUC was completed and the presence of a high resolution
record in BOR cores was identified. Funding is provided to expand on the pilot
study through stable-isotopic and sedimentological analyses of core tops and 3
piston cores and 9 box cores planned to be retrieved during an REU cruise on
BOR. A comparison of the core data with sediment structures, seafloor photos and
hydrographic maps, as well as seismic echo character will yield new information
about the factors influencing physical properties of sediments. When completed
the study open line of paleocurrent investigations in paleoceanography.
