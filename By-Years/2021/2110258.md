The ocean provides critical services to life on the planet, absorbing 93% of the
heat caused by humans as well as a quarter of human carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions each year. However, rising ocean temperatures and CO2 levels also
change the marine environment: pH and oxygen levels fall, ocean currents change,
and nutrient fluxes and concentrations are shifting, all with effects on
ecosystems and the cycles of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon throughout the ocean
and atmosphere. Until recently, observing these biogeochemical (BGC) changes
across remote ocean areas with seasonal to interannual resolution has been
impractical due to the prohibitive costs associated with large-scale ship
operations. Now robotic profiling floats have been developed that are equipped
with chemical and biological sensors, and which can operate independently for
years. These robotic systems provide us the ability to observe changing ocean
chemistry and biology in real time. This proposal will provide the funds to
operate for five years an array of 500 such profiling floats that are
distributed across the global ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Global Ocean
Biogeochemistry (GO-BGC) Array was funded through the NSF Mid-scale Research
Infrastructure-2 program to deploy 500 biogeochemical (BGC) profiling floats
around the globe. Each float will be equipped with a suite of chemical and
biological sensors for oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical
backscatter, and, in most cases, irradiance. The unprecedented real-time data
stream from the GO-BGC Array will enable observation of ocean biogeochemical
changes with seasonal to interannual resolution through the upper 2 km of the
ocean, driving a transformative shift in scientific and public understanding of
marine biogeochemical cycling and ocean health at the global scale. However, the
MSRI-2 project does not provide funds to operate the array. Operational costs
are centered on the expenses needed to transmit the large data stream from
floats through the Iridium satellite communication system and the expenses to
operate a data system that quality controls the incoming measurements and
distributes the resulting, science quality data in real time. These data are
then available without restriction. This proposal will provide the needed costs
to transmit data from the GO-BGC array. It will support the quality control of
float data streams to ensure that a high quality, science-ready data set is
easily available to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
