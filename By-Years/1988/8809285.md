The objectives of the proposed project are to study and improve analytical
methods currently used in the design and modelling of switching power
converters. In particular, exact solutions for the behavior of simple converters
will be compared with approximate solutions obtained with the widely used "state
space average" method 覺1!, and to solutions obtained by extension of discrete
methods 覺2!. A number of theorems apply to certain approximate solutions of
nonlinear systems 覺3,4!. These will be used to determine the conditions under
which the state-space average methods are predictive. At present, the properties
of state-space average solutions with respect to the stability and the transient
response of the actual converter are not well understood. The relationship
between converter operating frequency and system response time is also not well
understood 覺5!. It is expected that existing knowledge of approximate solution
methods will provide a basis for expanding state-space averaging so that it can
apply to large-signal behavior. Analytical results will be verified
experimentally for simple dc-dc power converters.
