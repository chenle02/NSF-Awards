A very high resolution (R = 1.2 x 105) mid-infrared spectrograph for
astronomical observations is proposed. The spectrograph will be a liquid helium
cooled, double-pass, echelle using a 40 cm long grating. It will be able to
resolve lines with 2.5 km s-1 Doppler width and will have a noise-equivalent
line flux of ~ 4 x 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 (1. in 1 second), allowing high signal-to-
noise observations of many young stars embedded in molecular clouds. The
instrument will be used primarily for studies of interstellar molecules. Very
high resolution and high sensitivity observations are necessary for infrared
observations of molecular clouds, especially the regions around young stars.
