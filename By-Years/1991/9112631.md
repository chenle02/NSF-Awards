This award is for the acquisition of a modern x-ray diffractometer with wide
angle goniometer, texture and thin film analysis attachments, a germanium
detector, and PS/2 computer for data acquisition and search/match capability.
The instrument will be dedicated to research efforts of investigators in the
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, it will be maintained and
operated in the Center for Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis, which is used
by 5 schools and 14 departments on the campus. User fees will be applied to
maintenance and operation costs. Examples of research programs making use of the
instrument include: growth of crystalline organic semiconductors; deformation
twinning of ordered alloys; ordering of A-site cations in perovskites; photonic
materials and device studies; studies of the structure of semicrystalline and
filled polymers, and changes in molecular orientation in polymers.
