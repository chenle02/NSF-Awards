The conference on discrete simulation of fluid dynamics (dsfd.org) is the
premier forum to discuss novel numerical methods for fluid flow including
lattice gas automata (LGA), the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), discrete
velocity methods (DVM), dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), smoothed-particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), stochastic rotation
dynamics (SRD), molecular dynamics (MD), and hybrid methods. The 19. meeting is
held July 5-9, 2010 in Rome. Because of the significant cost of airfare
underfunded researchers need additional support to attend meeting. The NSF funds
provide partial support for 18 junior faculty members, postdocs and students
from the US to present their research at this meeting. A local committee at
North Dakota State University selected the travel support based on need, whether
the applicant belongs to an underrepresented group, and the scientific soundness
of the proposed research presentation.

Advances in materials, nanotechnology, information technology and biotechnology
increasingly rely on novel numerical algorithms. So the training of students and
postdocs who are developing the next generation of these methods is of paramount
importance. This grant provides the most promising young researchers with the
opportunity to learn about the newest developments from their peers, to exchange
ideas with researchers who share similar interests, and the opportunity to
present their own research results at a specialized conference in the field of
novel numerical algorithms for the simulation of fluid dynamics.
