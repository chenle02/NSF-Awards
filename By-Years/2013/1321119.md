Stereoscopic 3D provides an immersive viewing experience and has evoked a
tremendous amount of interest. However, stereoscopic content must be properly
produced to avoid "3D fatigue," such as blurring vision, eyestrain, and
headache. The difficulty in producing stereoscopic content has become a
bottleneck that limits its impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops
computational stereoscopic cinematography technologies to assist stereoscopic
content production by integrating computer graphics, computer vision,
stereoscopic cinematography, and stereo perception. This project explores
fundamental and unique problems in computational stereoscopic cinematography:
how to edit disparity to deliver a pleasant viewing experience; how disparity
interacts with other aspects of stereoscopic content like monocular depth cues
and motion; how to optimize disparity during stereoscopic content manipulation
and authoring, including warping, collage authoring, and video stabilization;
how to coordinate the process of the left and right view with no or unreliable
stereo correspondences; and how to extend monocular content manipulation and
authoring technologies to stereoscopic content in a principled way. In short,
this project solves key problems in computational stereoscopic cinematography
and establishes general principles for developing stereoscopic content
processing and authoring technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This computational
stereoscopic cinematography research facilitates high-quality stereoscopic
content production, which is critical in sustaining and boosting the impact of
stereoscopic 3D in a variety of applications, including virtual reality, human
computer interaction, scientific visualization, educational training, and
medical rehabilitation. The research results, including the technical writings,
the stereoscopic image/video library, and the code infrastructure, are
disseminated through paper publications and online sharing.
