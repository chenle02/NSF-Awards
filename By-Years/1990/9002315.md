Parasitoids (insect parasites that invariably kill their hosts) often aggregate
their attacks where their hosts are most abundant. The degree to which attacks
are aggregated, however, is highly variable--rates of parasitism (on a per
victim basis) sometimes decrease with increasing host density. Mathematical
models have shown that the response to the density of their hosts has profound
consequences for the dynamics of the interaction. However, the mechanisms
underlying aggregation are poorly understood. The proposed research is intended
to examine how an aphid parasitoid alters its foraging in response to variation
in host density. The goal of the research is to develop a sufficient
understanding of the microscale behavior of an aphid parasitoid that can predict
within-generation population-level patterns in the field. Most behavioral work
to date on host- parasitoid interactions has been restricted to observations in
simple laboratory environments or, if in the field, to observations of foraging
on a single plant. In contrast, although population studies of host-parasitoid
interactions often include information on spatial patterns, they rarely attend
to the details of parasitoid behavior. This project consists of lab and field
experiments closely coupled to mathematical models, which are used to
extrapolate from individual behavior to patterns at the population level.
