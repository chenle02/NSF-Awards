This proposal will employ nonspecific molecular recognition, responsive
surfaces and polyvalency to make grafting faster and more efficient. The
chemistry will employ graft-on-a-graft chemistry to prepared functional,
ultrathin, hyperbranched grafts on both organic and inorganic substrates. The
functional interfaces to be prepared will all be assembled with covalent bonds.
These covalent assemblies will be derived from known reactions - condensation
reactions like amidation and catalytic reactions like triazole formation from
alkynes and azides. Such grafts will contain functional groups that can be
further modified with spectroscopic probes and the interfaces so formed will be
useful in modification of the physical and chemical properties of common
materials like polyolefins and metal oxides.&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual impact
of this proposal is that it will demonstrate ways to use the known advantages of
polyvalency, the principles of molecular recognition and the responsive
character of macromolecular systems in a useful synthetic way. The proposed work
will use weak intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding to localize
reagents and catalysts at interfaces. Such localization of reagents will
facilitate grafting by increasing the relative concentrations of the reagents
involved in bond formation. Such effects will make grafting simpler, more
practical and less wasteful in terms of reagents. If successful, this research
will lead to functional surfaces can be designed so as to intelligently
facilitate their own grafting. &lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of this proposal
is its effect on the scientific training and education of students at both the
undergraduate and graduate level. Typically 2-3 undergraduates from Texas
A&amp;M and outside will be involved each year, some in the summer and some
during the school year. These undergraduates will work side-by-side with 2-3
graduate students. All students will have individual and creative roles in the
research and all will participate in publications and presentations at local,
regional and national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
