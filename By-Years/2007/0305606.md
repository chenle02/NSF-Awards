Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Leiserson,
CNS-0305606&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallelism introduces more
opportunities for unwanted nondeterminism in programs, making them hard to debug
and impossible to write reliable regression tests for. Consequently, parallel
computing has emerged as a niche technology suited only for software developers
who are willing to cope with the complexities of concurrency, because
performance is everything for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1993, Herlihy and
Moss{58} proposed transactional memory as an alternative mechanism for enforcing
atomicity, since it allows the user to avoid many of the complications of
locking. With transactional memory, a program can read and modify multiple,
disparate memory locations as a single atomic operation, much as occurs within a
database transaction. The trend has been towards software transactional
memory(STM) {98,57,56}, the overhead of which discourages the use of
transactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contends that the "transactions
everywhere" approach can simplify parallel programming dramatically and that
hardware support can make overheads negligible. To test the project hypothesis,
they plan to develop a hardware specification of "scalable" HTM with a software
simulator, a linguistic framework for C-like languages, complier support
"implicit" transactions, debuggers and other software-engineering tools,
theoretical foundations for semantics and performance, and multithreaded
applications that demonstrate the advantages of an HTM computing
environment.&lt;br/&gt;
