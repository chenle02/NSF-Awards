This award provides support for a combined Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on
Physical Virology: Viruses at multiple levels of complexity and Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS), to be held Jan 22-27, 2023 in Lucca (Barga), Italy. The biennial
GRC aims to transform the study of these processes by establishing Physical
Virology as a paradigm for the intersection of fundamental physical laws and
emergent biological function. The meeting brings together researchers with
scientific expertise in virology, chemistry, materials science, mathematics,
physics, and engineering who share a common desire to (1) understand the
physical mechanisms that enable and regulate viral lifecycles, (2) use this
knowledge to develop and engineer novel nanotechnology platforms based on viral
particles or other self -assembling structures, with applications including
biomimetic materials and optoelectronics, and (3) broaden physical virology to
leverage recent advances in cell biology and protein design. The associated GRS
workshop is a school that takes place immediately prior to the main (GRC)
conference. The GRS is organized by a graduate student and a postdoc. The school
will feature 11 talks by students and postdocs; a career and mentorship panel
discussion comprised of individuals invited from industry, academia, and science
communication. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for these cross-
disciplinary approaches to understand viral biology, predict global spread and
impact, and generate the fundamental knowledge that provides the foundation for
developing new treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this award
include fostering interdisciplinary science, increasing the diversity, equity,
and inclusivity (DEI) of the Physical Virology community, and the training and
career development for early career researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
