This research effort will focus on the analysis of interacting particle systems
with simple dynamics that exhibit large-scale self-organized behavior.
Initially, the research will focus on two families of models, in the plane and
in space, with random cyclic dynamics: the cyclic cellular automata, and the
cyclic particle system. The models are prototypes for spatial interactive wave
phenomena observed in certain chemical reactions, atrial fibrillation, neural
networks, and elsewhere. Following these investigations, the research will
involve other interacting systems such as 'anti-stepping stone models' and
various one-dimensional interface dynamics. This research is in the general area
of probability theory known as interacting particle systems. Such systems, and
related cellular automata, model complex random dynamics. They have found
application in a wide variety of scientific contexts, including physics,
chemistry, biology, and computer science. Of special importance are their
connections with statistical physics, population genetics, and information
transmission.
