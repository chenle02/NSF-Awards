Garnet Chan of Princeton University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models
and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop new
quantum chemical methods for "hard" problems in quantum chemistry. The main
directions of the research are (1) extending the density matrix renormalization
group and related methodologies to tackle the electronic structure of multi-
centre transition metal sites as found in bioinorganic systems, (2) developing
new approaches to strong correlation based on higher dimensional tensor
networks, and (3) exploring the use of correlated wavefunction methodologies for
problems of quantum spin dynamics in electron spin and nuclear magnetic
resonance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the dissemination of science, algorithms,
and code associated with this research, the broader impacts of this proposal are
focused on the development of educational modules for quantum mechanics through
the NETLOGO environment, and the establishment of an online "Ask a Scientist"
resource for chemistry and other sciences.
