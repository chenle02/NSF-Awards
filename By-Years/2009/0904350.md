As networks move outside professionally-managed environments to end-users become
tasked with deploying, managing, securing, and troubleshooting their networks.
Evidence shows that end-users cannot manage networks, and their rejection of
these technologies represents a significant barrier to the adoption of advanced
applications. This research will lower the barrier, by demonstrating how the
challenges of human-network interaction must be solved with new technical
approaches. Through empirical methods, we will produce datasets detailing the
challenges, the needs of the users who both manage and live with such networks,
and the opportunities for network design. We will develop an initial
architecture that centralizes many network functions. This research will extend
this architecture and deploy and evaluate it in people?s homes. The results will
produce sound, generally-applicable principles for more usable network design.
These principles will be particularly applicable to contexts where no formal
network administrator is present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work benefits
society in three distinct ways. Usable home networking is on the critical path
for computing research innovation. Research results will teach the next
generation of engineers how to design usable networking. The integration of
usability concerns into the core of computing reflects the growing diversity of
careers in IT, and opens up the possibility of increasing the participation of
women and minorities in computing.
