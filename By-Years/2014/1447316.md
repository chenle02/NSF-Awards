Systems engineering is the technical activity that coordinates all the parts of
a large system development. To date, a major part of systems engineering
management of the development of large complex engineered systems such as
aircraft, spacecraft or transportation systems has been based on predicting the
outcome of the development project: How much time it will take? How much will
the development cost? Or, how much will the eventual product cost to
manufacture? In current practice, answering these questions almost always
results in underestimates. Despite decades of research on improving such
predictions, no progress has been made. This project will attempt to find a more
successful approach to managing these systems that does not rely on prediction,
but instead focuses on control, controlling cost, weight, schedule and
performance. This is a short, high-risk exploratory research project to
establish the feasibility of a controls-based management strategy. If the
strategy is feasible, further research will be necessary to develop the new
method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan is to deconstruct systems
engineering to its essence and reconstruct an approach based on methods and
ideas available in modern control theory, and then determine how to measure the
performance of this new approach, exploiting promising research methodologies
from other fields. However, actual measurement of the performance of the method
through case studies will be left for future work. The project will employ a
basic optimal regulator as one strategy, and will explore a dynamic-programming-
like approach as a second approach. The results will, if successful, provide
insights into a new and more effective approach to systems engineering.
