Atomic Junction: Nuclear Power in an African Suburb

This project investigates how Ghanaian scientists have sustained a movement to
develop nuclear energy in a suburban landscape over the past forty years. The
starting hypothesis is that scientists have nurtured a dream for nuclear energy
while providing important services in radiation protection at medical
facilities. Preliminary research suggests that the scientific and commercial
sectors in Ghana have become increasingly embedded and co-dependent. Through an
examination of scientists, community leaders and their relationship with
commercial interests, the project will greatly expand our understanding of
scientific practice in a post-colonial nation and provide new avenues for
nuclear energy policy. Ghana has witnessed a variety of financial policies since
independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, including socialist and neo-
liberal regimes. This project will provide important documentation of how
scientists have managed to weather economic downturns. Methods include
collecting archival materials and conducting interviews with select leaders in
business and science engaged in efforts to develop alternative energy sources
and monitor radiation at hospitals and clinics. While energy production is a
future goal, the study examines how scientists with access to a 30kW miniature
neutron source reactor (the GHAAR-1) and Cobalt-60 gamma source currently
provide assistance to entrepreneurs in the agricultural and medical sectors.
Deliverables include a book and short film examine the historical relationship
between scientific research on atomic energy and commerce in and around
Kwabenya, Ghana (an area popularly called Atomic Junction).
