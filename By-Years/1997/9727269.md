9727269 Hu The PI's Hu and Ramkrishna, are experts in their respective fields of
mammalian cell culture and metabolic modeling. This proposal combines these
complimentary areas of expertise in an attempt to understand the protein
productivity factors in hybridoma cultures. The hypothesis is that cellular
metabolism can be manipulated to maximize the efficiency of the process by
minimizing non-productive cell metabolic states. The specific aims of the
proposal are to define the conditions of the cultures that lead to the different
metabolic states, to determine what changes are induced by varying the
concentrations of glucose and glutamine, and to perform metabolic flux analysis
of these different states under steady state and changing conditions. A
cybernetic model will be developed to describe these different states under
limiting environmental conditions, e.g., glucose and glutamine availability and
to account for switching between states. Reactor conditions will then be
established which maximize antibody productivity. ***
