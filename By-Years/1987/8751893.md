Recent technological advances and a growing awareness of the importance of
teaching statistical reasoning provide us an opportunity to simultaneously
advance the state of educational technology and the high school mathematics
curriculum. Our past two years' of research on the role of technology in the
teaching of statistical reasoning have led us to focus on methods for making
inherently abstract statistical concepts more concrete and therefore more
accessible and comprehensible. To implement and test these ideas, system called
ELASTIC: An Environment for Learning Abstract Statistical Thinking, will be
developed. The system's pedagogical power will derive from new techniques for
visualizing and manipulating abstract statistical entities. Students will be
able to interact with concrete representations of statistical objects such as
distributions and statistical processes such as sampling. They will perform
experiments in video-and computer-based statistical microworlds. Their analysis
process will be guided by a planning environment that will include concrete
representations of statistical plans. The system will be tested in the context
of a semester-long high school course on Reasoning Under Uncertainty. In
parallel, the system will also be used in more controlled settings as a tool for
understanding the misconceptions students retain about statistical thinking.
