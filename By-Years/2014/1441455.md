This project will support a one-day workshop to be held in Washington, DC built
about policy relevant themes identified in consultation with representatives of
the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Science of Science Policy established by
the National Science and Technology Council Committee on Science?s Subcommittee
on Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. The worskhops furthers attainment
of two salient objectives of the National Science Foundation?s Science of
Science and innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program by (1) contributing to an
understanding of the means by which federal government support of research and
development fosters scientific and technological change, and in turn the
attainment of desired societal outcomes; and (2) building a community of
practice between academic researchers and federal government officials and
others such that the academic research community addresses policy relevant
questions and that the policy/practitioner community finds that answers produced
by SciSIP-supported research are accessible, relevant, timely, and convincing.

Broader Impacts: Anecdotally, findings from SciSIP-funded research have
demonstrable relevance to several science policy issues currently being
addressed by several Federal agencies. The workshop will examine the evidence to
date and accelerate the dissemination of these findings.
