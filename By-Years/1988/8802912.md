This project is research in mathematical physics. The essential thrust is the
use of random walks to model quantum mechanical systems, with the aim of
predicting what happens in large extended aggregations of particles on the basis
of known short-range interactions. Specific topics to be investigated include
Donsker-Varadhan theory, continuous symmetries, and quantum screening in Coulomb
systems. The work on random walks might turn out to be important in a wide range
of scientific and engineering problems that have no direct connection to
mathematical physics.
