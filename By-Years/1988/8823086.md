This research project by R. Pagni and G. Kabalka of the University of Tennessee
is within the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed at an understanding of
organic reactions on surfaces. Most of our knowledge about organic reactions
comes from experiments run in the liquid or gas phase. It is expected that
reactions which occur on solid surfaces might take a different course, and this
will provide new fundamental information about reaction pathways and also
provide new opportunities for organic synthesis. Two synthetic reactions will be
examined on solid surfaces: asymmetric induction in Diels-Alder reactions and
macrocycli- zation. Asymmetric induction reactions have been studied widely in
solution, but rarely on surfaces. Surfaces have attractive features for these
reactions provided that the surface is chiral. This can be achieved by using
surfaces that are intrinsically chiral or which are made chiral by adsorption of
chiral molecules. Macrocyclization, the synthesis of large rings from acyclic
precursors, is a long-standing problem when performed in solution. For carefully
selected cases this reaction should be easily achieved on solids because
competing intermolecular side reactions will be inhibited.
