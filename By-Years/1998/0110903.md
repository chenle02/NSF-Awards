&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0110903&lt;br/&gt;Yu&lt;br/&gt;This is a SGER award to
support theoretical research and education in the area of bioinfomatics using
methods inspired by statistical mechanics that differ from ones currently used
in computational biology. The research centers on sequence alignment and
clustering. An important problem in this area is how to assign an accurate
statistical significance to a result obtained from these bioinfomatics tools. A
novel alignment method and statistical theory recently developed by the PI will
be enhanced to create a more complete statistical theory and to address the
statistical significance problem. An aim of this work is to develop a better
method to extract appropriate alignment parameters where insertions, deletions,
and substitutions of biomonomers will be treated on an equal footing. Another
focus of this work is to improve clustering methods using variants of the
random-cluster model. The PI's new clustering method assumes no a priori
knowledge of the nature of the existing data and is expected to be more robust
against noisy data.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award supports theoretical
research and graduate level education in the area of bioinformatics. The
research is interdisciplinary with a view to bring the formidable tools of
statistical physics to bear on an important part of the larger biological
problem of understanding the meaning of the enormous amount of genome data that
has been collected. The PI's research addresses the problem of being able to
reliably identify homology among different sequences and to improve clustering
tools that can be used to help identify gene expression patterns associated with
a certain biological process or disease. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
