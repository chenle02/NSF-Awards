Impey, Christopher AST 96-17826 Dr. Impey will continue the discovery and
detailed study of low surface brightness members of the general galaxy
population in two ways. The first is to continue observations at radio and
optical wavelengths to more fully constrain the stellar populations, gas and
dust content, and metallicity of low surface brightness galaxies. The second is
to study the populations of these galaxies from new CCD surveys, especially the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and to better understand the result of any selection
effects. This is a collaborative project with Dr. Gregory Bothun at the
University of Oregon Eugene.
