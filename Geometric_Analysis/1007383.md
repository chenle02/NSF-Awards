Abstract

Award: DMS-1007383 Principal Investigator: Michael Wolf

The principal investigator will continue his research in two-dimensional
geometric variational problems. In particular, he proposes projects in several
areas of classical minimal surface theory, all concerned with using Teichmuller
theory to prove existence or uniqueness or properties of minimal surfaces in
Euclidean three-space. He proposes research in two areas of Teichmuller theory:
Weil-Petersson geometry and grafting. Both bring a Riemannian perspective to
problems often studied via other methods. In addition, he proposes studying
problems arising in convex projective structures on surfaces as well as work on
degenerating harmonic quasi-isometries of the hyperbolic plane. These last are
informed by his earlier work on high energy harmonic maps. In recent years, the
PI has focused considerable attention upon education at all levels. He
supervises graduate students; he coordinates a VIGRE program at Rice University
encompassing roughly a dozen small research groups in the mathematical sciences
whose vertical organization ranges from the undergraduate stratum through the
graduate and postdoctoral level to the permanent faculty; he participates in one
of these groups himself, he lectures to teachers and acts as a scientific
advisor to programs to enhance the mathematical understanding of K-12 teachers.
He serves the broader mathematical community by serving on the editorial board
of three journals, through organizing large and small conferences and through
lectures to general audiences. He is quite involved with undergraduate advising.
The PI will continue with all of these activities.

One of the guiding principles of science is that Nature is efficient: when we
encounter natural phenomenon, we expect that the shapes we find will use the
least material for their construction, or be the thinnest that can be made with
a material or will span the largest region possible, or some other sort of
optimization. At the same time, a common geometric component of many natural
systems is a two-dimensional surface, usually configured in some curved manner.
These surfaces occur at all scales, from the boundary of a protein to the
surface of the brain to the frontier of the magnetosphere. In this project, we
investigate problems that relate aspects of the shapes of surfaces to quantities
they might optimize, and also how deforming one feature of the shape of a
surface affects other qualities of that surface.
