9401519 Tonry This project will complete a large survey of galaxy distances
measured using Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF), delineate the velocity
field of galaxies within a distance of roughly 3000 km/s, and publish a catalog
of these distances and a digital atlas of the galaxy images acquired for this
project. The observations are essentially complete for this project, but
reductions of data are expected to extend for one year. Once the data set is
complete, three topics will be studied during the balance of the proposal
period. (1) The Hubble constant will be measured. (2) The peculiar velocity
field within 3000 km/s will be mapped more accurately and less subject to
environmental effects than in previous studies. (3) The map of peculiar
velocities will be used to estimate the mass distribution within and near this
volume of space, with emphasis on determining the mass and extent of nearby
superclusters and voids without assumptions of a relation between galaxy density
and mass density.
