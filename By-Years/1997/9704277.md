9704277 Meyer This Americas Program award will support Dr. Thomas J Meyer,
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in a research collaboration with Dr.
Barbara Loeb, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, to investigate the
relationship between complex structure and excited-state lifetimes. The major
thrust of the study will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of
a novel class of chemical complexes. The researchers plan to conduct detailed
excited state studies, which will include energy gap law correlations and
molecular orbital calculations on acceptor ligands. The role of rigidity,
delocalization, and redox characteristics will be investigated to determine the
excited state behavior of a series of these complexes. The results of this study
are expected to have an important bearing upon the rational design of compounds
for application in advanced materials. The research will benefit from the
combined expertise of the collaborators. The distinct synthesis expertise and
computational abilities of the Chilean research group complements the US group's
strength in molecular design and photophysical characterization. ***
