The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University is enhancing its
established undergraduate research program with a summer component. The Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program will involve students from Clemson and
other institutions in a ten week program of research, seminars, and workshops.
All of the activities will challenge the participants intellectually and develop
their critical thinking skills as well as their ability to work independently.
The one-on-one contact with faculty and interaction with graduate students will
also introduce these students to the opportunities in graduate education and the
career options in research and academia.. Fifty percent of the faculty have
participated in undergraduate research projects spanning the areas of thermal
and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing systems, engineering mechanics,
and materials.
