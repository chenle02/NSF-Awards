The objective of this project is to advance the understanding of viscous
fingering in fixed beds. Viscous fingering will be monitored in situ in
operating columns using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advanced MRI
techniques will also be employed for direct measurements of fingering during
multicomponent separations, and of intraparticle convection and nonuniform
dispersion. Finger behavior will be compared with theoretical predictions
obtained by linear stability analysis.
