The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to
significantly improve software reliability and developer productivity, as a
result of a new compiler analysis technology. Detecting, diagnosing, and fixing
software bugs are extremely important. Existing solutions are inadequate because
they often generate too many false alarms, miss real errors, incur prohibitive
runtime issues, or lack diagnostic information - these problems are acute for
large, complex software. The new technology enables detecting and fixing complex
software bugs in the programming phase by continuously analyzing code changes
and providing developers with instant feedback. The technology will lead to more
economical, reliable, and secure software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project aims to evaluate the commercialization potential of a new compiler
analysis technology and to accelerate the translation of this technology into
emerging products and services. The innovation offers an incremental analysis
engine that synergistically combines several fundamental static program analyses
to reduce the average computational complexity of inter-procedural program
analyses proportional to the code changes instead of the entire code base. With
the capability to detect complex software bugs with fast speed, the technology
could be used in an integrated development environment (IDE) to help developers
detect and fix bugs as soon as they are introduced into mobile apps. It may also
be integrated into a version control system to detect races in pull requests,
providing much faster feedback than human code reviewers; and it also may be
embedded into parallelization compilers to help automatically parallelize
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
