Modern X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment is requested. The capabilities of the
new equipment will include a powder diffractometer with a heating stage,
glancing angle incidence optics for thin film and multilayer characterization,
and a dedicated double-crystal X-ray diffractometer for defect characterization
of strained-layer epitaxial thin films. A study on thermal oxidation of ceramic
and intermetallic matrix composites by in situ heating in an X-ray
diffractometer and correlation with mechanical behavior is anticipated. Another
research program that will benefit strongly from the new instrument, is
analytical characterization of ceramic composites synthesized by the novel
Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) technique. Similarly, XRD work will be applied
to chemically vapor deposited ceramic thin films for protective coating
applications, as well as investigating in situ environmental reactions and
microstructural changes as a function of temperature. For semiconductor thin
films and multilayers, determination of phase stability and alloy formation by
high temperature X-ray diffractometer is important for optimization of
sequential processing steps that won't compromise device performance.
