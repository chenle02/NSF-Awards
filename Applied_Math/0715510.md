Foundational principles of the theory of dynamical systems, such as the closing
lemma and the Poincare recurrence theorem, suggest that dynamics can be
understood quite generally in terms of periodic motions. This project will use
those principles as a beacon and develop numerical methods that elucidate the
dynamics of systems with more than a million degrees of freedom using accurate
computations of steady solutions, traveling waves, periodic motions, and
relative periodic motions. These methods will be applied to fluid turbulence at
low and moderate Reynolds numbers and to the technologically important
transition-to-turbulence problem. This project will advance the instruction of
computational science by training students to be skillful at using and creating
scientific software.
