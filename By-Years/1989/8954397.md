A two week summer workshop for community college biology faculty in the State of
Illinois on the topics of molecular biology and biotechnology is being held. The
workshop is upgrading the faculty knowledge of molecular biology and
biotechnology, providing hands-on experience with the methods and techniques of
molecular biology, encouraging the formation of formal teaching plan that
includes instruction in molecular biology and biotechnology at the participants'
home institution and encouraging an active educational partnership between the
community college biology faculty and biology faculty at the University of
Illinois. The University of Illinois and the Community Colleges of the state of
Illinois are contributing to the project through the provision of travel funds,
lectures by the Illinois faculty and the follow-up activities.
