ABSTRACT: 9301267, PI-Einstein: The objectives of this research are to
investigate experimentally and theoretically the coalescence between non
overlapping pre existing discontinuities. Theoretical work will involve both a
quasi continuum as well as a discrete fracture propagation model. The
experimental and theoretical research are closely interrelated by using the
experimentally validated analytical and numerical models in parametric studies
to extend the experimental investigations. It is intended to gain a basic
understanding od coalescence fracturing and to develop predictive procedures by
considering the effect of a variety of material properties, of the geometry of
the pre existing discontinuities and of the stress field.
