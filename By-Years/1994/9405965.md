9405965 Anderson The PIs will advance the capabilities of the resonance
ultrasound technique and exploit their present capabilities to investigate the
high temperature elastic properties of iron and other iron-bearing compounds.
They will acquire new data on the high-temperature derivatives of elasticity of
bcc and fcc iron, measurements of changes in the elastic properties of iron when
going from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases, and changes in elasticity
when going from the bcc to the fcc structure. These measurements will provide
new insight into the conditions in the Earth's core. They will also continue and
extend their work on FeO and Fe2SiO4. ****
