9417467 Rajala This is a "TIE" project on the topic of "Realizability of
Potential of Multiuser Detection," to be conducted by the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Communications and Signal Processing at North
Carolina State University and the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Wireless Information Networks at Rutgers University. The proposed
activity is to conduct research to increase realizability and capacity of CDMA
(Code-Division Multiple Access) systems. The proposed project will concentrate
on the ability of multiuser detectors to combat multipath fading present in the
actual mobile environment. This project is being cost shared with the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Wireless Information
Networks at the Rutgers University. The Program Director recommends the North
Carolina State University be awarded $50,000 for 24 months for this "TIE"
project with Rutgers University.
