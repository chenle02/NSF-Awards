This award supports research on ways for computer vision systems to exploit the
Computer Aided Design models available for many manufactured objects. The goal
is to learn how to build a vision system capable of recognizing and locating
instances of curved 3D objects modeled by parametric surface patches and their
intersection curves in the imperfect line drawing obtained by edge detection
from a single image. Ongoing implementation of research system building blocks
will be completed, including specialized components of a solid modeler,
algorithms for constructing exact aspect graphs of object models, and techniques
for locating model instances from image contours. Novel recognition strategies
will be investigated, based on both object- and viewer-centered representations.
New data structures and algorithms will be developed that efficiently implement
these strategies; these will be integrated into a working recognition system. A
notable aspect of this research is the systematic characterization of geometric
constraints by polynomial equations, which may then be solved by application of
available computational and mathematical tools.
