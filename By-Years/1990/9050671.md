A computer laboratory is being established for instruction in and
experimentation with quantitative models in biological systems. The lab is being
furnished with 20 workstations, each equipped with a fast processor and floating
point co-processor, 4 megabytes of memory, color graphics display, color
printer, and mouse, networked to a server/supervisor workstation. The users of
this lab are primarily first and second year biology majors and students
enrolled in the core biology course. Students use software developoed by the
P.I.s to carry out experiments in genetics, population biology, and enzyme
kinetics. The software uses high-resolution graphics, sophisticated numerical
routines and a comfortable used interface. This project demonstrates that
computing equipment can supplement and enrich traditional laboratory approaches
and permit early and effective introduction of quantitative analysis in biology.
The software will be distributed to a wide audience. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
