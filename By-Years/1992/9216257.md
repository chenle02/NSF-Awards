This supplement augments the research program at Northwestern University's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Engineering Tribology by
cost-sharing a joint collaborative "TIE" project with the University of
California, Berkeley's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Sensors and Actuators. The "TIE" project is a joint synergistic effort to study
and model the friction occurring with extremely small devices and loads. The
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Sensors and
Actuators is studying friction in very small devices under extremely small
loads. The I/UCRC for Engineering Tribology is developing relevant solid
mechanism models that satisfy its collaboration's observations. The Division of
Mechanical &amp; Structural Systems is cost-sharing this project. The Program
Manager recommends Northwestern University be awarded $50,000 for a two-year
"TIE" project to be performed collaboratively with the University of California,
Berkeley.
