This award will support cooperative research in chemical engineering between
Dr. Liang-Shih Fan, Ohio State University, and Dr. J.F. Davidson, University of
Cambridge, England. The objective of the project is to define the transport
behavior of three-phase fluidization involving low density particles. The
research will focus on non-rigid bioparticles immobilized with living
microorganisms. Dr. Fan's current research program at Ohio State University is
concerned primarily with the hydrodynamics and axial liquid mixing in three-
phase fluidization, involving rigid particles of low densities such as
polystyrene, acetate, acrylic and nylon particles. The proposed work will
complement the active ongoing research program at the University of Cambridge,
which emphasizes three-phase biofluidization. During his visit to Cambridge, Dr.
Fan will investigate the hydrodynamics and axial liquid mixing involving
bioparticles such as calcium alginate particles with and without entrapment of
cells and activated carbon particles immobilized with cells. Effects of particle
properties on three-phase fluidization will be generalized based on the results
of the experiments. This research will contribute to the understanding of three-
phase fluidized bed applications in biological processing.
