The proposed project aims to determine how social conditions for Alaska Natives
living in small arctic communities have changed since 2000, and differ among
communities and small regions. The Census Long Form Survey historically provided
much of the data for measuring social and economic conditions in the U.S. Its
replacement with the American Community Survey (ACS) after the 2000 Census has
raised serious concerns about whether Census data continue to provide accurate
measures of well-being in rural Alaska communities, at a time when the region
faces unprecedented environmental and socio-economic change. The project
addresses the uncertainty with ACS data by developing a new set of social,
economic, and cultural indicators with increased capability to detect
differences at local scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives include:
(1) systematically examine the reliability of ACS data for rural Alaska by
disaggregating published margins of error into components expressing dispersion
across communities, years, and individuals; (2) construct socio-economic
indicators for rural Alaska communities and regions with substantially smaller
margins of error than published results; (3) estimate key indicators for
communities where observations are sparse or missing entirely; and (4) test
whether communities and regions have changed or differ significantly with
respect to one or more indicators. The project pursues these objectives through
modeling and statistical analyses of multiple primary data sources, including
individual interview data from the ACS and the previous censuses in cooperation
with the U.S. Census Bureau. Project outputs include a set of socio-economic
indicators with improved reliability over published ACS figures that can help
state and local governments and non-governmental organizations allocate funds,
plan, and evaluate social service and economic development programs. A
pioneering application of data assimilation with a social system model aids
arctic social observing system design by revealing highest priority targets for
new data collection for observing and understanding social change in arctic
communities.
