9618276 Stayrook A project to link K-12 students and teachers to practicing
University, industry and agency scientists using networked technology, with the
aim of increasing the practice of authentic, project-based math and science. A
significant portion of science and math teaching, inquiry, and application at
the primary and secondary grade levels can be furthered by the virtually
unlimited possibilities for infommation gathering and sharing via computer
networking. Yet teachers and their students often do not take advantage of the
facilities available, or do not have access to the technology that would make
this possible. Alaska, with its far flung population and limited road system can
especially benefit from networked technology. We should morph into the virtual
classroom where students, teachers, and practicing scientists from throughout
Alaska and the world engage in animated conversations, conduct experiments, and
exchange information using infommation networking. The proposed project will
link practicing scientists from higher education, govemment, and industry with
teachers and students, using the latest information networking technology. It
will be instrumental in igniting a redefinition of technology's place in the
science and math education process in the project school districts. Partners in
Science is designed to serve both urban and isolated students in our state
--students in rural districts and students being taught at home by their parents
(homeschoolers). The main goal of Partners in Science project is to further math
and science learning in grades K-12 in the Fairbanks North Star Borough School
District (FNSBSD), a rural Alaskan school district (Iditarod School District),
and among isolated home-schoolers. In addition, the project will share its
educational experiences and the new concepts developed on a statewide, national,
and global level. To accomplish this, the proposed project has objectives for
students, scientists, teachers and technology enhancement. Key features of
PartnersIn Science: training teachers to use scientist mentors in the classroom
science study content relevant to community concerns/interest establishment of
"virtual math and science" classrooms and use of networked technology in
learning and instruction inclusion of Native Alaska students/traditional Native
knowledge inclusion of homeschooled students comprehensive scope of project
(involves many people at many levels; major impact on teaching, learning,
classroom management, etc.) implementing change and reform quickly impact at the
"floor" level --the classroom where learning and teaching takes place revisions
in high school science and math teaching models, credit granting, and classroom
