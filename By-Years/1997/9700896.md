Raskind 9700896 This award supports work on the theory of algebraic cycles on
algebraic varieties over p-adically complete fields and over algebraic number
fields. The principal investigator will define and study p-adic intermediate
Jacobians for algebraic varieties over a p-adically complete field which have a
p-adic uniformization. It is expected that these will be fundamental tools in
the theory. He will also study higher obstructions to the Hasse principle for
varieties over algebraic number fields. The theory of algebraic cycles is part
of algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial
equations. This is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, but it has
experienced an explosion of new ideas and fundamental theorems over the past
thirty years. Also, new applications of the theory have been found to coding
theory, cryptography and engineering.
