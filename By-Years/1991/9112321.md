A US-USSR workshop on photosynthesis will be held in the Soviet Union during
August 1991. The USSR Academy of Sciences' team is lead by Academician Igor A.
Tarchevsky, Director, Kazan Institute of Biology; Professor V.I. Kefeli,
Director, Institute of Soil Science and Photosynthesis, Pushchino; and
Academician A.A. Krasnovsky, A. N. Bakh Institute of Biochemistry. The American
delegation will consist of 10 senior and 10 junior scientists. This proposal
covers primarily the funding of the junior scientists (Ph.D. granted within past
ten years.) The topics covered in the workshop will include the biophysical,
biochemical, physiological and ecological aspects of photosynthesis. Attention
will also be given to the processes affecting crop productivity. This project
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading researchers in the US and the USSR to combine complementary efforts and
capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of
basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality
of benefit.
