9408994 Burns This award continues support for mathematical research on
geometric problems associated with domains and there boundaries situated in
spaces of several complex variables. Two major areas of study will be
undertaken. Both are concerned with interpretation of renormalized
characteristic classes and their relation to analytic problems on complex
manifolds with boundary. The first involves uniformization and structure of
complex hyperbolic manifolds. The uniformization question is that of determining
when a component of a complex manifold which is a compact, connected, spherical
CR-manifold can be realized as a domain of a ball in n-complex variables modulo
a properly discontinuous group of CR-automorphisms. The second line of
investigation considers certain linear partial differential equations with the
goal of finding analytic interpretations of characteristic numbers which are
finite for Riemannian or Kahler manifolds of infinite volume. Work will also be
done in an effort to prove a converse to a recent result on Grauert tubes.
Namely, to show that all biholomorphisms of these manifolds are induced by
isometries. Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a
natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became
clear early on that the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The
underlying geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had
far more affinity with partial differential operators of first order. It thus
grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of differential geometry
and differential equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in
the last three decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these
basic mathematical forms.
