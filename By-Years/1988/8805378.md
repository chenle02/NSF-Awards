This wide-ranging project is mathematical research that originates in the
theory of operator algebras, with collateral impact in several other areas of
mathematics. Algebras of operators on Hilbert space have long been used to
represent a diversity of mathematical structures, including some that arise in
theoretical physics. Professor Wenzl will pursue several consequences of a
deceptively simple construction for building towers of increasingly larger
operator algebras of a certain special sort. More specifically, he will continue
his research into Hecke algebras and a recently discovered class of algebras
connected with the Kauffman link invariant in knot theory. He will explore the
connections these algebras have to representations of Lie groups. More examples
of subfactors of the hyperfinite factor studied by operator algebraists are
expected to be found. Related issues in mathematical physics, for instance the
quantum Yang - Baxter equations, will be investigated.
