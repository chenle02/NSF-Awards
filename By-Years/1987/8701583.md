It is proposed that this project continue its research on the theoretical study
of transport and other processes in metals and alloys. Five specific projects
will be investigated. 1. They will continue their investigation of transport in
random substitutional alloys. They will concentrate on understanding the dc
electrical conductivity and thermopower in these materials. They will also
investigate other transport phenomena in random and disordered alloys. 2. They
will study the relationships between the theory of transport in random alloys
(i.e. the theory that they are using for their calculations) and theory of so-
called "weak localization." They will see if it is possible to merge these two
theories. 3. They will study the phenomena of resistivity saturation in which
there is a maximum possible resistivity in a metal or alloy (the Mott theory).
4. They will carry out calculations on the electronic properties of a model of
an amorphous alloy (metallic glass). 5. They will complete their theoretical
investigation of radio-frequency-size effect in the metal cadmium. They plan to
carry out extensive calculations on the Illinois supercomputer.
