As ridges approach and collide, "slab-windows" develop as young, hot and
anhydrous subducting slabs lose their integrity. Arguably, the best place to
study magmatism and deformation in relation to "slab-windows" is in southern
Patagonian, where well defined segments of the Chile Rise have collided with the
Chile trench over the last 14 Ma. The purpose of this project is to map the
temporal, spatial and chemical distribution of these Patagonian "adakites" and
plateau basalts in order to understand the thermal consequences of the
intersections of "slab-windows" with continental crust.
