The proposed work includes basic studies of scattering theory of random discrete
scatterers and rough surfaces with the emphasis on developing electromagnetic
scattering models that are valid over a wide frequency range. Analytical and
numerical approaches will be developed to study the following: 1. Scattering by
dense media will be studied to examine effective scattering properties,
backscattering enhancement and localization with applications to snow and ice
terrain. The microstructures of snow and ice and their effects on scattering
will be studied. 2. Scattering by conglomerations of discrete scatterers with
clustering structures will be studied to examine collective scattering and
absorption effects with applications to remote sensing of vegetation and
forests. Electromagnetic scattering by realistic plant structures as grown by
the Lindenmayer system will be studied. 3. Scattering by random rough surfaces
and backscattering enhancement problems will be studied with applications to
remote sensing of soils and oceans. Problems of multiple scales and multiple
slopes as w ell as large incidence angles will be studied.
