9761277 Rao This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
develop microwave resonators based on HTS multilayer technology, which will form
the basic building blocks for a new generation of advanced communications
filters. Improved trilayers will lead to HTS trilayer resonators with extremely
small size and high Q. These structures will enable the production of filters
with orders of magnitude improvement in selectivity over state-of-the-art
technology. The customers for this next generation of communications filters are
providers of cellular and personal communications services, with a projected
market of $1B annually.
