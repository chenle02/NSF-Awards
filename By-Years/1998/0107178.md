This award to Carnegie-Mellon University is supported by the Advanced Materials
Program In the Chemistry Division.The goal of the research by Professor Richard
D. McCullough is to design, synthesize, assemble and engineer new defect-free,
regioregular polythiophenes in order to denonstrate and understand self-assembly
in conjugated polymers as a way to optimize material properties and to create
new functional properties. New synthetic routes will be developed and new
insights into structure-property relationships wil be gained. Specific targets
will be the development of new regioregular, amphiphilic polythiophene coplymers
and polythiophene polyelectrolytes, the synthesis of new multifunctional
polymers that have high conductivities, good mechanical properties and
environmental stability, and the development of sensors and biosensors based on
new polythiophene materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regioregular polythiophenes
are well-defined conducting polymers whose properties can be tuned to novel
applications such as ink-jet printing, wires and contacts, polymer switches and
colorimetric biosensors. The scope of the research in synthesis,
characterization, fabrication and performance measurement will provide students
with broad interdisciplinary training.
