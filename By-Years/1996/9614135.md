ABSTRACT OPP-9614135 WELLER, GUNTER UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA This is a project to
support the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII) Science Management Office
(SMO) and Science Steering Committee (SSC). The SMO will support the activities
of the LAII SSC (e.g. workshops, planning meetings, and coordination with
international science projects), publish a newsletter, promote correspondence of
LAII results at national meetings and between PIs, facilitate logistical
arrangements, and promote integration of LAII activities with other components
of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. The SSC will conduct planning
meetings for future LAII research projects, appoint working groups to conduct
workshops for development of science plans for new initiatives, and provide the
ARCSS Program with an assessment on priorities for LAII global change
initiatives/projects in the Arctic that are developed through the workshops.
