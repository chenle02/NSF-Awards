This project is designed to test whether Cu and other chemical components are
leached from wallrock during deep sodic-calcic alteration in the Yerington
porphyry. It will involve geologic mapping and petrologic phase equilibria
studies of sodic-calcic alteration. S, Sr, O, and Nd isotopic compositions in
fresh and altered rocks will be used as tracers to constrain whether these
fluids and components originated inside or outside the batholith. Integration of
volumes of alteration and gains or losses should yield a mass-balance estimate
of wallrock leaching of Cu, Fe, Zn, Au, K, and other components and allow
assessment of their contribution to the Cu ore body.
