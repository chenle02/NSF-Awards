The research will focus on nonequilibrium dynamical behavior of interfaces
separating phases. Of particular interest will be the dynamics of the evolution
of a system away from an unstable steady state. Such dynamics reveal rich
behavior in the analysis of possible steady states, and here the emphasis is on
the evolution in which there is no available steady state, or one is far-
removed. Investigations will focus on delineating possible universal features of
such growth processes. Systems and models considered include the symmetric model
of solidification and viscous fingering instabilities in fluids in a variety of
situations. The work has connections with the evolution of orderd structures in,
for example, spinodal decomposition, which will be considered in specific
examples. Many of the model systems proposed have direct realizations.
