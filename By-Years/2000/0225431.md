0225431&lt;br/&gt;Zaghloul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the purposes of public
safety, health and wellness, it is often critical to have&lt;br/&gt;available
smart sensors that can detect and identify toxic and poisonous gases in the air.
Here the PIs seek low cost arrays of SAW gas sensors clustered as a network node
that can be placed and operated with minimal supervision, yield continuous real
time monitoring capability through the network and are based on well established
CMOS/MEMS technology. Since the sensors are fabricated employing CMOS
technology, additional signal processing circuitry can easily be integrated into
the chip thereby readily providing functions, such as, multiplexing and analog-
to-digital conversion, i.e., Systems On a Chip (SOC). The proposed CMOS design
offers other potential benefits, such as, temperature drift control and noise
immunity. The chips will be designed at The George Washington University and
fabricated by the MOSIS service. Select post-fabrication steps will be performed
by the MEMS Exchange and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Chemistry
Division. This proposal addresses the critical research issues, estimated time
line of tasks and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
