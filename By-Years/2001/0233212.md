0233212&lt;br/&gt;Louge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-France
collaboration in particle science involves researchers and students at Cornell
University and the University of Rennes. Michel Louge in the US and Luc Oger in
France lead this cooperative project on the gravitational flow of grains down
inclined surfaces. They will investigate the origin and growth of nonlinear
granular waves on a flat frictional plane. These waves can lead to intermittent
jamming of the flow. Experimental data collected at Cornell will be interpreted
using a stability analysis of the corresponding hydraulic theory. This is
complemented by French expertise in nonlinear stability and "particle-In-Cell"
numerical analysis. The second goal is to establish how fully collisional
granular flows can arise on a bumpy incline. If they can be sustained, they
require relatively small angles of inclination. To study their dynamics, the
investigators will utilize a granular facility chute at Rennes and interpret
measurements based on their collisional theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF
will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his
students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the
United States. The project explores fundamental questions in particle science
that have implications for industrial processes as diverse as the extraction and
processing of ores and chemical engineering and geological phenomena like
rockslides and avalanches.&lt;br/&gt;
