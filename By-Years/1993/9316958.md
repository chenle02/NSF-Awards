9316958 Morison The proposed work is part of an integrated research program
("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern
Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the
austral winter of 1994. The work proposed here concerns long time series
measurements of upper ocean temperature, salinity, and current speed from a
drifting buoy anchored to the sea ice. The buoy will monitor the seasonal
evolution of the air-sea-ice system in the central Weddell Sea, which cannot be
assessed in the time that the ship is present. In particular the buoy
measurements will provide data on the cumulative impact of storms or significant
wind events passing over the station. ***
