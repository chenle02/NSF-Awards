This research is directed towards a better understanding of corrosion behavior
in high technology materials. Emphasis is on metal-matrix composites, which can
possess extraordinary mechanical properties from a combination of extremely
strong particles or fibers in a ductile or brittle metal matrix. Corrosion
properties of these materials are not well known, but it is reasonable to expect
galvanic corrosion to occur between the dissimilar constituents and localized
corrosion to be enhanced by reaction products formed at the reinforcement/matrix
interface. This research is devoted to identification of corrosion mechanisms in
such materials and exploration of remedies.
