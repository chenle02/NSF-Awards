This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award funds a post-disaster tsunami survey
of the 28 September 2018 Sulawesi magnitude Mw= 7.5 earthquake. It is estimated
that his tsunami has killed in excess of 2,000 people, making it the deadliest
tsunami initiated by a strike slip earthquake since the 2010 Haiti earthquake
and tsunami. Only a small fraction of tsunamis are triggered by strike slip
earthquakes such as this one, and very little data about this type of triggering
mechanism are available. However, such earthquakes can occur in different
locales in the western US, the Caribbean, and the Mediterranean, in addition to
South East Asia. Scientists and engineers need to understand if there are
unusual features of these strike-slip events which make them tsunamigenic,
compared to the overwhelming majority of similar earthquakes which are not. The
data collected by this reconnaissance team will be invaluable to the research
community. Ultimately, it will help predict the risk to the U.S shoreline from
strike slip earthquakes, and help make the U.S. better prepared for future
tsunami events on our shores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will: (1)
take measurements of maximum inundation and flow depths; (2) analyze survivor
videos; (3) measure co-seismic uplift, subsidence, and lateral spreading where
observed; (4) document coastal landslides directly through a marine geology
survey, or indirectly due to extreme localized runup spikes; (5) measure the
type and severity of damage to different types of buildings and record what
factors appeared to control damage levels; (6) collect information about
survivor experiences and stories through interviews, if appropriate; and, (7)
explore the human and community vulnerability and resilience factors at work in
different places - what made a particular community resilient or vulnerable,
what are the differential experiences of different types of people who
experienced the tsunami? Data on tsunamis generated by strike slip earthquakes,
such as this one, are rare, making up only approximately 10 percent of damaging
tsunamis; therefore, it is particularly important to document this tsunami. A
marine survey will help constrain the seismic source, so the triggering
mechanism can be understood. The data obtained during this project will be
archived through the NHERI DesignSafe Data Portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
