The main objective of this project is to host a symposium entitled "Topological
Field Theories and Quantum Gravity." The two-day symposium is to be held at the
University of Cincinnati on April 3 and April 4, 1992. The focus of the meeting
is on a subject which is at the cutting edge of current theoretical ideas in
Quantum Gravity and interacting relativistic field theory.
