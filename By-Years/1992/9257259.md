Farrens The research is to investigate various configurations of decoupled
architectures and to extend the concept into the field of parallel processing.
It is anticipated that, with several decoupled processors communicating via
architectural queues called Multiple Instruction Stream Computer (MISC), it will
function as a type of dynamic superscalar processor, providing significant
performance gains. The MISC architecture uses multiple asynchronous processing
elements to separate a program into streams that can be executed in parallel,
and integrates a conflict-free message passing system into the lowest level of
the processor design to facilitate low latency intra-MISC communication. This
approach allows for increased machine parallelism with minimal code expansion,
and provides an alternative approach to single instruction stream multi-issue
machines such as superscalars and VLIWs. The relationship between optimal
processor configuration and transistor count is also being investigated. The
goal is to define the design points at which a change to multiple processors
becomes advantageous.
