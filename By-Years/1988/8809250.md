In his initial research, Dr. Pangrle found more powerful models and new insights
upon which to base a high-level synthesis system. His goal is to develop a
design automation system which will synthesize optimized designs based on the
user's behavioral description and design level constraints. This research
concerns two issues in high-level digital design synthesis: behavioral
description languages and design generation. His component model serves as a
unifying thread that will influence the development of the entire system from
the bottom up. Research on the behavioral description language and its compiler
incorporates a new flow-graph model based on the component model. Research on
the design generator involves development of new algorithms for allocation of
operations in the flow-graph, and for a connectivity binder that binds
components to the flow-graph.
