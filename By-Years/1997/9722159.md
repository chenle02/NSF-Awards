This is a continuing research project for the study of many of the unsolved
problems in chiral Potts or generalized chiral clock models. Special cases have
been introduced as effective models for the study of incommensurate states,
wetting, and commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions. Such phenomena can
occur in surface layers when the molecules in different layers have incompatible
sizes; an example is ripple states in biomembranes. From a mathematical point of
view, this research addresses a new class of cyclic hypergeometric functions,
related to exact solutions found recently. New results will be pursued and
connections between various fields of mathematics, physics, and other sciences
will be further explored. New structures and models will be investigated further
with analytic means, symbolic manipulation and numerical techniques, such as
Monte Carlo analysis and systems on finite strips with mean fields on the
boundaries. This should lead to better understanding of more general models.
