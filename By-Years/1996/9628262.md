9628262 Wernicke The South Virgin Mountains, Nevada, occupy the easternmost
portion of the highly extended Lake Mead region. We request funds for completion
of detailed geologic mapping and geochronologic studies in the South Virgin
Mountains Nevada. In terms of exposure, stratigraphic resolution, topographic
relief and a regional datum for reconstruction, the South Virgin Mountains are
among the best examples of upper crustal imbricate normal fault structure in the
world. Mapping to date by the PI and graduate student Robert Brady suggests that
domino-style, "rolling-hinge," and rollover kinematics are all probably active
within the system, but may be operative at different times and places across
strike of the rift. Hence the area offers the potential to test the
applicability of these models, and possibly determine how structural position
within a series of tilted blocks influences their development. In addition to
geologic mapping, we propose to complete Ar/Ar and U-Th/He dating of selected
samples to establish absolute ages of basin formation and unroofing of the
blocks, respectively. In the case of the latter method, which has a uniquely low
closure temperature of about 70oC in the mineral apatite, this project will be
the first application of He dating to the problem of extensional tectonics.
