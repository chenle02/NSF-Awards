This research project involves a study of the relationship between storm tracks
and the low frequency variability of the atmosphere. The main question to be
considered is how synoptic eddy fluxes of heat and vorticity influence the
behavior or evolution of the large scale atmospheric waves in which they are
embedded. The principal investigator will also consider the extent to which
large scale atmospheric flow patterns determine the position of storm tracks. A
broad range of theoretical problems relating to linear and nonlinear baroclinic
instability in a zonally inhomogeneous basic flow, and the attendant potential
vorticity mixing, will be examined. The investigations include theoretical
studies with simple models, analyses of simulations done with a general
circulation model, and some analyses of observed data. These are studies of a
fundamental nature with application to both weather and climate time scales. The
ultimate benefit of successful research will be a better understanding (and
eventually improved prediction) of weather and short term climate patterns.
