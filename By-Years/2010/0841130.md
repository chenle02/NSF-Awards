The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of NSF Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research program of Professor Mary Elizabeth Williams in the
Department of Chemistry at The Pennsylvania State University. Professor Williams
and her students focus on a project titled "Magnetic Manipulation and Selective
Isolation of Nanoparticles and Nanoparticle Assemblies." Small particles that
have nanometer scale dimensions have unique properties that make them
interesting for biomedicine, catalysis and sensing. The Williams research group
is particularly interested in small magnetic particles, which can be pulled and
trapped using magnets. When these are chemically linked together, the particles
are expected to form new materials with improved properties for the above
applications. This research project focuses on magnetically manipulating and
pulling particles with a high level of control based on their size, magnetic
properties, and number of linked particles. The study provides excellent
training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral
research associates in the highly multidisciplinary and cutting edge research
field of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
