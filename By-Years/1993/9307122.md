Advanced materials, such as ceramics and composites, are being increasingly
used in various applications. The high cost associated with machining and damage
generated during machining are major detriments for implementation of these
materials. In some cases, current machining methods cannot be used and
innovative techniques or modifications of existing methods are needed. These
problems are being addressed by researchers in many institutions around the
world; and the results are being communicated in various technical conferences
and published in journals. However, these conferences and journals have a
limited scope, and do not cover the broad spectrum of the problems. For example,
machining of polymer composites, metal matrix composites, and ceramics are
covered in different conferences; and precision machining of optical materials
are covered in others. Nevertheless, the main issues of cost and reliability are
the same for all advanced materials. The goal of this conference is to
strengthen communication and technology transfer among researchers and engineers
involved in various aspects of machining of advanced materials.
