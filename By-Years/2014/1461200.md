This award provides renewed funding for the longstanding Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and Lowell
Observatory. Seven student participants per year will be paired with NAU and
Lowell scientists to conduct astrophysics research into a wide variety of
topics, including lunar impact craters, cryogenic outer solar system ices, near-
earth objects, and exoplanets. In addition, the students will attend biweekly
seminars to learn more about professional astrophysics, responsible research
conduct, and applying to graduate school. The Site will also introduce students
to cutting-edge telescopes, including Lowell's Discovery Channel Telescope and
the Naval Precision Optical Interferometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering
high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of
undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the
nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will develop the
research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and
logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain
current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and
highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its program,
which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.
