In this SGER grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Adamowicz will develop new techniques dealing with the
detailed interactions among the motions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and
molecules. The new techniques will then be applied to obtain an understanding of
highly energetic species. The PI will develop a new approach to treating the
Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, using a non-adiabatic basis set and a variational
functional for the total energy of the system. Instead of a rigorous separation
of the internal and external motions, the new method is based on forcing the
system to stop its translation in space and assume the desired rotational state
by introducing penalty operators into the variational functional.
