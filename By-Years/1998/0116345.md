0116345&lt;br/&gt;Eppell&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to: (1) build a near-field
scanning optical microscope (NSOM) capable of phase, fluorescence, polarization
and second harmonic generation modes, and (2) build a modified NSOM that will
use a solid metallic tip, rather than a fiberoptic tip, as an aperatureless near
field optical probe. The proposed NSOM, having all of the features desired,
cannot be purchased commercially. The investigators will purchase all of the
major components, and then modify and assemble them to yield the desired
instrument. This equipment will be used in a number of biomedical engineering
research projects which include studies on: (1) the mineralization of artificial
bone, (2) synapse function in neurons, (3) self-assembled fluorosomes for
cancer-targeted gene delivery, (4) liquid crystal alignment on solid substrates,
and (5) labeled proteins in the membranes of T cells. &lt;br/&gt;
