9416874 Ozisik This award provides funds to permit Dr. M.N. Ozisik, Department
of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, N.C. State University to pursue with
Dr. Woo-Seung Kim, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hanyang University,
Korea, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on inverse heat transfer
problems. The goal of this collaboration is to make a systematic study of
inverse heat transfer problems of (1) forced and natural convection, (2)
radiation in a semitransparent absorbing, emitting, and scattering medium, and
(3) interaction of radiation with conduction, with the objective of developing
improved, accurate methods of analysis for estimating various thermophysical
properties of materials, unknown surface, inlet, and source conditions from
simulated transfer heat transfer experiments. The results from this study should
provide a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the use of
inverse methods of analysis for estimating thermophysical properties of
materials and unknown surface or interior conditions. Potential applications of
inverse problems arise in many fields of science and technology. Their
usefulness in practical applications lies in the fact that they enable
researchers to conduct experimental investigations under conditions encountered
directly during the operation of engineering devices. The collaborators have
considerable complementary research experience in the field of their proposed
project. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea
Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project is supported
by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
