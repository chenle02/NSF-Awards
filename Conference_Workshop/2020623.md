This award supports participation in the 2020 Workshop on Mathematical Machine
Learning and Application held at Penn State University on April 26-29, 2020. The
workshop aims to bring together active scientists in the emerging field of data
science to discuss recent advances in the study of algorithm development,
theoretical analysis, and applications of machine learning. One focus of the
workshop is on theoretical understanding of why and how deep learning works from
mathematical viewpoints. This grant provides supports of participation of US-
based invited speakers and US-based junior participants (graduate students,
postdocs and early career researchers who lack their own funding). The main
session of the workshop will take place during the period from April 27 to 29,
with about 20 invited talks and a poster session. A short course featuring
introductory lectures on the mathematics of deep learning will be held prior to
the workshop on Sunday, April 26, with junior participants as the main target
audience.

In this workshop, researchers in mathematical machine learning and related
fields from the United States and other countries around the world will discuss
state-of-the-art methodologies and developments and propose future directions in
mathematical data science and its applications. Examples of topics to be
discussed in the workshop include: machine learning in physical modeling and
computational engineering, non-convex optimization in machine learning,
approximation theory of deep neural networks, interactions between deep learning
and partial differential equations, architecture design and interpretation of
convolutional neural networks, deep learning in computer vision and natural
language processing, and deep learning with grammars, automata, and rules. More
details of this workshop are available at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
