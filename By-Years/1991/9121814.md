Japan JSPS Program: Influence of Thyroid Hormones on the Behavior of Larval
Flounder This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. John Burke
of the National Marine Fisheries Service Beaufort Laboratory, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, to conduct
collaborative research with Dr. Masaru Tanaka for 12 months at Kyoto University
in Japan. Utilizing Dr. Burke's knowledge of American flounder, the team will
study the effect thyroid hormones have on larval flounder immigrating from the
sea to coastal nursery gounds. Flounder, like most marine fish, spawn at sea and
their larvae are carried by tidal streams to coastal nursery grounds. During
this migration, flounder larvae undergo a metamorphosis which is controlled by
thyroid hormones. Burke's previous research has indicated that thyroid hormones
induce eye migration as well as muscle development in flounder. Together, Burke
and Tanaka will investigate whether the thyroid hormones actually initiate the
flounders' inshore migration and will predict the impact of water toxicants
which disrupt such thyroid activity. Dr. Tanaka's technique for producing
flounder larvae year round and his expertise in the early life of flounder will
complement Dr. Burke's experience with studying the effects of thyroid hormones
on the American flounder and will facilitate the controlled recruitment of
flounders in the United States and Japan.
