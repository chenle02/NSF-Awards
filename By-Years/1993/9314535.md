9314535 Pittel This Americas Program award will support Prof. Stuart Pittel of
the Bartol Research Institute in a theoretical study of nuclear structure with
Prof. Alejandro Frank of the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares of the National
Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The investigators intend to study
mapping methods to provide reliable approximate treatments of multi-quark
hamiltonian systems. Various approaches will be tested in the context of an
exactly solvable model of quark systems that admits both two- and three-quark
correlations. Exact solutions of this model problem will also be used to extract
useful insight on the quark structure of real nuclei. The proposed research will
benefit from the expertise of the U.S. investigator in mapping techniques and
their application to quark systems, while the Mexican investigator will
contribute his expertise in group theoretical methods in physics. In addition,
the proposed work will involve various groups in Spain that have been
collaborating with the two investigators over the past few years. ***
