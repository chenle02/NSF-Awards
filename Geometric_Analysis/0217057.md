This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Workshop on "Geometry
and Topology of Quotients" to be held at the University of Arizona in December
of 2002. The main speakers are Igor Dolgachev (Michigan), Mikhail Kapranov
(Toronto)*, Janos Kollar (Princeton)*, Robert MacPherson (IAS and Princeton)*,
Jun Li (Stanford), Reyer Sjamaar (Cornell), (* - to be confirmed). The plenary
lectures will survey recent progress and current directions of research in
Geometric Invariant theory and Symplectic Reductions, explain connections with
other disciplines and applications to physics. In addition to principal
lectures, there will be sessions of contributed talks and round-table
discussions. The workshop will provide a forum for young researchers to meet and
interact with leading specialists as well as for interactions across the
traditional boundaries of disciplines. Women and minority researchers are
encouraged to participate. Further information is available at
