Principal Investigator (PI) Patterson leads the Center for Backyard Astrophysics
(CBA), a worldwide collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers to
monitor Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). CVs are two stars in a tight orbit, one
star is a white dwarf (WD) and the other is a star similar to our sun. The WD
steals material from the outer layers of its companion causing rapid and varying
changes in the observed brightness. The amateur astronomers coordinate their
efforts to monitor the CVs throughout the year and conduct intense observing
campaigns during outbursts to further our understanding of these complex binary
star systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CBA is a well-established group and will
continue to provide precise photometric orbital and disk precession periods, and
accurate data on flickering and outbursts for approximately 120 CVs. The members
coordinate observations from a wide range of longitude to ensure near day-long
coverage of CVs during outbursts. The concerted team effort and dedication over
the past 25 years has resulted in over 150 publications. A major result was the
discovery of superhump signals from SU Uma-type dwarf novae. The superhump may
be caused by periodic tidal stressing of the WD disk and the team will continue
their investigation of these strange phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
