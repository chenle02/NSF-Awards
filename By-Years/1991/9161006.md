This project will continue research on a new method to analyze blood flow in
deep tissues of the body which have slow blood flows and small volumes of
movement using doppler ultrasound. In order to optimize the signal-to-noise
ratio from these tissues a contrast agent, consisting of galactose
microparticles that trap air bubbles, will be employed. Due to the nonlinear
properties of this contrast agent, the doppler shifted second harmonic of the
transmitted ultrasonic frequency will provide a signal with desirable properties
for use in the system. At the second harmonic, the doppler shifted echoes from
tissues not containing the contrast agent (surrounding tissues) will be reduced
in comparison to tissues containing the agent (capillaries). The concept
previously was tested using a mock flow system. It is now proposed to do in-
vitro experiments using excised animal organs. The design of hardware which will
allow the transmission of one ultrasonic frequency and the detection of the
second harmonic of that frequency also is a part of the project. This research
is extremely important since no other medical device is available to make such
critical measurements. When fully tested and developed, this device should be
able to compete in the medical imaging device marketplace.
