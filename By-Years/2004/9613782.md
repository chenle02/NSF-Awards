9613782 Harmon Through this planning grant the Center for the Study of testing,
Evaluation and Educational Policy (CSTEEP) will assess the feasibility of
broadly implementing performance based student assessments across Local Systemic
Change (LSC) Projects. One or more prototype sites will be identified to
determine the potential level of interest to develop overall district design, to
revise assessment instruments and reporting software to meet state and local
needs to pilot test assessment instruments and accompanying professional
development strategies for teachers. Results from this planning activity would
provide design elements and resource estimates for a full proposal that would
implement a student assessment component across all LSC sites.
