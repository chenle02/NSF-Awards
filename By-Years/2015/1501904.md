The Engineering Technology Challenge (ETC) program is a collaboration among
Connecticut community colleges, three inner-city high schools, industry, the
Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA), and Catalysts Powering
Educational Performance (CPEP Inc.) to engage a diverse group of
underrepresented students from urban comprehensive high schools in Saturday and
summer programs focused on manufacturing technology. The program will create
teams of high school students, mentored by community college students, faculty,
and industry professionals in industry-driven problem based learning (PBL)
projects, including the integration of professional skills and teamwork.

Specifically, the ETC Program will develop and implement: 1) after-school
programs for high school students, using industry and interest driven PBL
projects; 2) career and college readiness workshops; 3) summer learning
experiences including industry internships; 4) high school teacher summer
workshops using the PBL curriculum and hands-on kits developed in ETC; 5)
manufacturing career pathway experiences for career counselors, STEM high school
teachers and parents; and 6) participation in Mini Maker Faires. Diversity is a
core goal of ETC, directly impacting approximately 240 inner-city/under-
represented high school students and 75 high school teachers. Through teacher
professional development workshops, another 7500 students are indirectly
impacted (~100 students per teacher). ETC will contribute to preparation of
students for continuing their career pathway in manufacturing technology through
credit certificates and degrees at partner community colleges and universities;
and for high-tech jobs in the advanced manufacturing workforce. Project
evaluation efforts will contribute to the general knowledge base regarding the
attributes and practices of successful after school and summer programs for
secondary school students, as well as associated professional development for
teachers, that are carried out in collaboration with community college faculty
and industry mentors.
