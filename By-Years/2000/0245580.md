This proposal concerns problems in number theory and algebraic geometry in four
specific areas. First, in joint work with Avner Ash and Mark McConnell, Gunnells
is exploring conjectures in automorphic forms by studying the action of the
Hecke operators on the cohomology of arithmetic groups in different contexts.
Second, jointly with Robert Sczech, Gunnells is studying the connections between
special values of L-functions and group cocycles for the unimodular group.
Third, jointly with Lev Borisov, Gunnells is investigating the construction of
modular forms using toric varieties. Finally, jointly with Eric Babson and
Richard Scott, Gunnells is studying the geometry of certain configuration
varieties naturally arising in representation theory.

This proposal deals with number theory and algebraic geometry. Number theory is
the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
mathematics. Algebraic geometry studies geometric figures that can be defined by
the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. The questions and phenomena which
arise from combining these two subjects serve as driving forces in much of
contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the combination of these subjects
has contributed many applications in such diverse areas as codes and data
transmission, robotics, and theoretical computer science.
