The ratio of Ge/Si in biogenic opal has enormous potential as a tracer of the
balance between chemical fluxes from continental weathering and hydrothermal
sources and as a tracer of oceanic processes such as productivity. However, the
degree to which this tracer can be successfully applied to these problems
critically depends on the mass-balance of the Ge-Si system and the chemical
behavior of these two elements in the oceans. It appears that the current
understanding of the Ge-Si system is incomplete since estimates of the
hydrothermal Si flux based on the Ge-Si system are much less than fluxes
estimated from other tracers or models. The difficulty with current models of
the Ge-Si system is that they do not account for the probability that the marine
geochemical cycle for the Ge includes significant sinks other than biogenic
opal. A series of experiments will be conducted to evaluate the flux of oceanic
Ge to nonbiogenic sediment components. The Ge content and key Ge/element ratios
will be characterized in eolian source materials as well as in North Pacific
pelagic sediments. The results should provide important constraints on the
accumulation rate of nonbiogenic Ge in the oxic pelagic environment.
