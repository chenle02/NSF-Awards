The principal investigator will conduct research developing a fundamental
theory for distributed microstructure systems. These systems provide a
particularly effective representation of the intricate interface between the
components of a composite medium. The qualitative analysis of the solutions of
such systems is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread
application of such systems to physical systems. Reaction-diffusion equations
are useful as mathematical models in many areas of engineering, chemistry, and
physics. By better understanding the fundamental theory of nonstandard models
modelling flows, better numerical predictions of real single phase flow in
fractured media will result.
