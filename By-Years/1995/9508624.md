9508624 Swartz The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the leading
researchers in the field of fracture mechanics applications to quasi-brittle
materials in order to develop draft standards for testing concrete to determine
fracture mechanics properties. Prior to the workshop, draft reports will be
prepared and distributed to the attendees. The size of the group will be on the
order of 30 to 40 and will include persons from countries in Europe and other
countries who actively involved with the national organizations which develop
testing standards. The interaction of the U.S. participants with those from
other countries is particularly important at this time. It is noted that the
practicing engineers in Europe and Japan are making great progress toward
implementing the concepts of fracture mechanics into forensic engineering and
design practice, while this has been lagging in the U.S. The results of this
workshop will lead to testing standards which will be proposed to ASTM for their
adoption.
