9319380 Srienc This project is to study the interaction of ciliate populations
with their environment. Flow cytometry is the main tool for quantifying
particulate materials, ciliate populations, and ciliate metabolic responses. The
objectives include: (1) the kinetics of feeding, growth, and reproduction of the
organism Tetrahymena pyriformis GL with extensions to concentrated particle
suspensions, particles with modified surface chemistries, and suspensions of
non-viable fluorescent bacteria; (2) the quantification of growth dynamics of
ciliates under transient nutritional shifts in batch and continuous culture; and
(3) modeling of ciliate population dynamics during the different stages of the
ciliate cell cycle. ***
