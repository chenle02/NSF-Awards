Engineering-Mechanical (56) This proof-of-concept project is creating teaching
modules and course materials that integrate probabilistic and statistical
methods into introductory and capstone engineering design courses. The materials
will bridge the gap between a pure "Probability and Statistics" course and
engineering design courses by providing engineering students with the skills to
apply probability and statistics to engineering design
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a "Probabilistic
Engineering Design" capstone course that covers basic probabilistic and
statistical engineering design methods, such as Design of Experiments, Robust
Design, and Reliability-Based Design. The investigators are working
collaboratively with industry to develop a textbook titled "Probabilistic
Engineering Design" with associated Matlab Toolbox and software; to evaluate the
project; and to develop student projects. The Matlab Toolbox of Probabilistic
Engineering Design being developed will help students understand probabilistic
and statistical design methods and apply those methods in engineering analysis
and design. Notes, supporting materials, projects, and exams are provided within
the course website.&lt;br/&gt;
