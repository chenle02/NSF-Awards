This research deals with increasing the resolution of global earth models by
extending the inversion theory to account for non- great circle paths taken by
surface waves as a result of the earth's lateral inhomogeneity. The basic theory
has been developed by the Principal Investigator and the current work will begin
its application and investigate the theory's assumption of non- coupling between
modes with models of anisotropy, earth rotation, and lateral heterogeneity.
Improved velocity models of the upper mantle are expected to result.
