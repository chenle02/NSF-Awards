The Civil Engineering Department at North Carolina State University (NCSU) is a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for ten undergraduate students who
will be assigned to research projects throughout the department under the
supervision of the research faculty. In addition, NCSU has a specific goal of
attracting at least six women and minorities for this program. Applicants will
be selected on a competitive basis in a nationwide search with particular
emphasis being given to those students in the SUCCEED Coalition and HBCUs
including Hampton, Howard, Morgan State, Prairie View A&M, Southern, Tennessee
State, and Tuskegee. Additional applicants from NCSU's Engineering Scholars
Program will be sought to participate in the REU site program. The objective of
the program is to motivate students to pursue graduate study by sharing with
them the excitement, rewards, and work involved in a research experience.
