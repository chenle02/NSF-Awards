9509125 WOOD Many insect species are restricted to feed on specific host plants.
How this specialization comes about, whether it is a requisite for speciation
and whether it requires geographic isolation are open to debate. When insects
acquire novel host plants it is important to understand the mechanisms and
consequences, for a number of reasons. Changes in host plant usage occur in
natural communities and thus are important factors in attempts to understand the
origin / structuring of insect-plant communities and geographic patterns of
insect species diversity. If a new host plant is commercially important, the
result is often the creation of a new pest. In cases of existing pest species
such host plant changes can lead to genetic alterations between populations on
different plants that require new management practices. Thus to understand
natural and managed plant communities the processes that initiate and the
ultimate consequences of insect shifts to new host plants must be understood. In
this proposal insects from a single population will be manipulated by placing
them in seven different environments. Each environment consists of different
combinations of natural and novel host plants. Three environments consist of
novel and natural hosts which allows the determination of whether divergent host
specialization can occur when there is potential free insect movement between
host species. The remaining environments are to examine the process of host
specialization when free insect movement between natural and novel host plants
is prohibited. The experiment will be done in the field utilizing 28 large
screened walk-in rooms. Each of the seven environments will be replicated four
times. Variables to be examined will be host plant species effects on insect
life history timing of egg hatch, mating, and egg deposition. At each of these
life history stages differential host effects on survival will be determined.
The extent of movement between hosts within each of the seven enviro nments will
be determined using marked insects.
