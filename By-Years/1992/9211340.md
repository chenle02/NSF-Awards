This research focuses on resonance suppression design in flexible mechanical
systems. Specifically, the research will investigate the feasibility of
including solid supports to vibration structures to provide damping and
additional stiffness under large amplitude vibration conditions. To design such
a system requires apriori establishment of analytical relations between system
geometry and eigenvalues as governed by moving boundary partial differential
equations. This will be done during the course of the mathematical modeling and
computer simulation effort. The results are expected to provide guidelines for
using solid supports and adjusting design variables for eigenvalue placement as
well as extending knowledge of non self adjoint partial differential operators
