In response to a Project Solicitation, MPC Corporation, representing the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), submitted a proposal to conduct a
Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987. This proposal and eight others were
evaluated by a review panel. MPC proposes a two week Institute for 20 young
researchers from July 20 to 31. Students will be reimbursed for travel and
living expenses during their stay. In addition to training on the use of the PSC
facilities (Cray XMP-48 supercomputer and supporting equipment), students will
be exposed to presentations on advanced graphics, parallel programing,
networking and a special emphasis on the use of a particular numerical
technique, partial differential equations, used in the solution of fluid
transport problems common to a variety of scientific disciplines. The review
panel found this to be a reasonable, but not exciting, proposal with a high
probability of success. The lecturers are for the most part drawn from local
institutions and from within the PSC itself. The course has been taught in an
abbreviated form before; most of the difficulties will have been worked out.
Because of the modest goals, the cost of this Institute is very reasonable, with
most costs centered around support for participants. MPC has asked for
supplement of $4,919 beyond the initial proposal, to partially support the
acquisition of additional workstations to be used during the Institute and to
remain in use at the PSC for future training and visitor programs. This request
seems modest and sensible. In addition, an undergraduate component of $2912 has
been identified. The Centers Program recommends support of a Summer Institute at
the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in the amount of $43,976.
