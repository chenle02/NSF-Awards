The objectives of this research project are to obtain PVT data at simultaneous
high temperatures and high pressures for carbonates and CO2, to use carbonates
to understand the high pressure-temperature behavior of phases containing non-
spherical anions, and to establish a set of internally consistent equations of
state of H2O, CO2, and the carbonates. The in-situ diffraction patterns that
form the basis for this experimental study will be collected using synchrotron
radiation and a resistance heated diamond anvil cell that is capable of reaching
temperatures and pressures up to 1100oC and 2.5 GPa. The results of the research
will ultimately find application in modelling the behavior of fluids in deep
crustal and mantle environments.
