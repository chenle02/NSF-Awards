9631048 Hays An understanding of mutagenic and antimutagenic processes in plants
will be enhanced by knowing the baseline rates of somatic mutation, before
modulation by any internal selection process and by understanding more about how
plant genome-fidelity activities reduce mutational loads. Those insights will be
gained by developing in Arabidopsis thaliana a versatile somatic-mutation assay
system, based on reversion of reporter-gene alleles, by initiating searches for
Arabidopsis "mutator" mutants, by isolating and analyzing plant mismatch-repair
genes, and by beginning to study the effects of UV mutation and mismatch-repair
on recombination in Arabidopsis. %%% The fixed locations, obligatory exposure to
sunlight and oxygen-producing metabolism subject plants to a variety of
environmental mutagens. Nevertheless, estimated somatic mutation frequencies in
trees and annuals do not suggest ongoing error catastrophes. Thus, plants may
employ unusually powerful genome-fidelity functions. This study will begin to
investigate those mechanisms. ***
