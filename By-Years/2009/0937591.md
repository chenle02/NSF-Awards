The Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (CNS-ASU)
is a Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC) funded by the US National
Science Foundation (NSF). It implements an agenda of "real-time technology
assessment" (RTTA) and clusters of thematic research in pursuit of a strategic
vision of the "anticipatory governance" of nanotechnologies. The RTTA agenda
comprises research programs in: 1) research and innovation systems assessment,
which aims to map nano-scale science and engineering research activities using
bibliometrics and patent analysis; 2) public opinion and values, which aims to
understand the dynamics of public and expert opinion regarding emerging
nanotechnologies; 3) anticipation and deliberation, which aims at deploying
novel demonstrations of scenario development and public engagement activities to
anticipate societal dimensions of emerging nanotechnologies; and 4) reflexivity
and integration, which aims to bolster the ability of nano-scale science and
engineering researchers to understand their own roles in responsible innovation
through integrating social science and humanities with natural science and
engineering. CNS-ASU's two clusters of thematic research are: equity, equality
and responsibility; and (beginning in Oct 2010) urban design, materials, and the
built environment ("nano and the city"). To achieve its strategic vision, CNS-
ASU unifies these research programs not only across several universities but
also across three critical, component activities: foresight (of plausible future
scenarios), integration (of social science and humanities research with nano-
scale science and engineering), and engagement (of publics in deliberations).
CNS-ASU also performs educational and training activities as well as public
outreach and informal science education.
