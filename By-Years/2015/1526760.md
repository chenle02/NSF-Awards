Over the last two decades, the speed and capacity of Satisfiability (SAT)
solvers has improved by several orders of magnitude, which enabled the
verification and analysis of larger and more complex real world systems.
However, a weaknesses of contemporary SAT solvers is their limited ability to
obviate needless exploration of isomorphic parts of the search space. This
research investigates an approach to significantly improve the performance of
SAT solvers when applied to problems of graph theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach taken in this project focuses on breaking all symmetries of SAT
encodings of graph-related problems. The key new concept is the notion of
isolators: propositional formulas that avoid evaluating multiple graphs in an
isomorphism class. The project investigates several foundational questions: (1)
how to construct perfect isolators which break all symmetries? (2) whether
perfect isolators that are polynomial in the size of the corresponding graph
problem exist? and (3) how perfect isolators boost SAT solver performance on
hard graph-related problems?
