9507990 PARK This research is to study azimuthal anisotropy in upper-mantle
seismic velocity, which can be related to the preferred orientation of olivine
and orthopyroxene crystals in deformed peridotite. This offers an opportunity to
investigate both active and fossil deformation of the lithosphere and
asthenosphere. This project will develop the software tools, apply them to data,
test whether anisotropy models derived from shear-wave splitting can be
reconciled with observations of long-period Love-Rayleigh scattering, and extend
the results to coupled free oscillations to test the robustness of shear-wave
splitting and other scattering analysis. This research is a component of the
Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior program. ***
