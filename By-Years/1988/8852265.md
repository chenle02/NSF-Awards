This award to Brown University will provide funds to equip an undergraduate Cell
Physiology and Biophysics course, and two undergraduate Independent Study and
Honors research project courses, with patch clamp amplifiers, computer
interfaces and software for experiments on the electrophysiology of single ion
channels in the plasma membranes of excitable cells. Patch clamp recording is a
revolutionary electrophysiological technique developed in the late 1970's and
early 1980's. It has taken cellular electrophysiology to the molecular level,
and is rapidly creating an important new integration of traditionally disparate
fields. These funds will provide equipment for 8 workstations, accommodating up
to 32 students working in pairs, in split sessions of 16 students each. The
major expenses are for interfaces to 8 existing computers, the requisite
computer software, and 5 patch amplifiers to supplement 3 already available.
Students will learn basic technical skills, the characteristics of
representative ion channels, theoretical principles of interpreting channel
behavior in terms of likely mechanisms, and an appreciation of significant
biological problems that have become tractable by this approach. This project
would also significantly upgrade the current teaching equipment from 1960's
vacuum tube technology to the lab computer era.
