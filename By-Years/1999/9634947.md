Application software for 100 TeraOps machines be based on the increasing use of
component software (libraries, GUIs, problem solving environments) and extensive
use of interoperability frameworks (CORBA, OLE, SOM, etc.), producing
applications which are complex conglomerates of variegated programs. To support
these applications, the machine must present a programmable interface (i.e.
efficient shared address spaces and data movement) and scaleable high
performance. This project will study a flexible machine architecture that
recognizes these technological realities and not only supports advanced software
structures, but exploits them to configure its programmable hardware, adapting
itself to the application. The programming flexibility can provide a wide range
of convenient interfaces, ranging from uniform cache-coherent shared memory, to
clusters of smaller shared memory systems, to fully distributed memory. In
addition to a range of interfaces, this flexible machine can customize both
operations and protocols, exploiting appropriate mechanisms and policies to
minimize the critical performance aspect--communication--at all levels of the
system. This machine design leverages the wealth of research into optimal
architectural mechanisms, customizable cache-coherence, as well as technological
advances in interprocedural analysis, programmable hardware, and hardware
synthesis technology, to achieve general-purpose high performance.
