The WGBH Educational Foundation proposes to produce a series of six one-hour
television programs for PBS broadcast on the history of the development of the
computer. Each of the six programs will focus on a period defined by the unique
development of computer technology at that time, such as the first invention of
mechanical calculating machines. The producers will tell the stories of the men
and women whose work evolved into " The Information Age" using dramatic
reconstruction of historical events. Advanced computer graphics, interviews with
the computer industry's past and present leaders, and historical film and still
photographs will be used to capture the excitement of technological invention
and to demystify the inner workings of the computer. An audience of more than
ten million will view the series in 1991, complemented by videotapes and teacher
guides distributed within the education community; the series will ultimately be
seen in more than 70,000 classrooms. Program research products and production
materials will be contributed to a historical archive when the project is
completed. The project budget totals $3.67 million; NSF support is less than 3%
of the total.
