Biological conversion of cellulosic biomass into fuels and commodity chemicals
is a sustainable alternative to present petroleum-based production platforms.
Economic analyses indicate that substantial cost reductions can be achieved by
integrating all required biological functions into a single bioreactor (termed
consolidated bioprocessing). As a proof of concept, the PI has demonstrated
direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to
isobutanol, a promising next-generation biofuel. Due to its efficiency,
modularity, and robustness, the proposed microbial coculture technology platform
has great commercial potential for cost-effective production of many other
biofuels and valuable biochemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed platform
could reduce processing costs for potential customers/partners by decreasing the
number of reactors required and/or eliminating to the need to purchase
hydrolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the proposed system could enable
customers/partners to transition from food-based to more abundant, sustainable,
and lower-cost lignocellulose feedstocks.
