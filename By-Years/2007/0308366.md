0308366&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts provides support for technical services
during NSF-funded programs on research vessels Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus. All
three vessels are operated by WHOI as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. WHOI will provide two
shipboard technicians on each cruise of Atlantis and Knorr, and one technician
on Oceanus, to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and
provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. In addition, the award supports some specialized services
support on both WHOI vessels and other UNOLS vessels on which WHOI technical
staff will provide support. Specialized services include multibeam sonar
operations and piston coring support. The services supported here are expected
to significantly enhance the operation of the research vessels via cost-
effective and expert support of shared-use oceanographic
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
