This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used to support
research on Coupled Oscillators and Neural Networks; Travelling Waves in
Combustion Theory; On the Relation between Painleve Transcendents and Inverse
Scattering; Nonlinear Boundary Value Problems in Ordinary Differential
Equations; and On Systems of Differential Equations which Describe Phase
Boundaries.
