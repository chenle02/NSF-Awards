This project intends to obtain preliminary data to answer the question: how
cells regulate expression of tissue.specific function. Specific experiments will
be designed to quantify mRNA associated with detergent insoluble cytoskeletons
and to see whether changes in actin filament structure can cause changes in
differentiated gene expression. If these preliminary experiments suggest that
actin filament structure can indeed cause such changes, then a more detailed but
separate study will undertaken.
