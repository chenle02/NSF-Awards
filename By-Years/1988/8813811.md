This is a Minority Research Inititation (MRI) Planning Grant to develop new
numerical techniques to study the velocity field in the interface between two
fluids. Small disturbances that occur when one fluid displaces another fluid in
a porous medium will receive special attention. These disturbances cause the
interface to be stable or unstable. Usually, these interfaces are three-
dimensional and difficult to study both experimentally and numerically. The
proposer will use a code which appears to handle problems of this nature. The
planning grant will provide support for a well-trained minority mathematician to
prepare a competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research initiation
component.
