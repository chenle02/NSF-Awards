The encouragement, support, and participation of parents is a vital element in
the motivation of students, especially in low-income and immigrant populations,
where the parental literacy may be inadequate. This program will develop an
interactive bilingual science and mathematics computer program to facilitate
parental involvement in the pupil's education and stimulate the learning process
for both. It will apply the latest interactive computer technology which is
extremely easy for the uninitiated to use, and employ multilingual voice and
text, graphics, animation, and sound effects to build excitement and maintain
interest. The computer program will also stimulate the parents toward better
English literacy, and promote computer literacy for all participants. The
content will be based upon the California Frameworks for mathematics and
science, integrated in the curriculum, and developed in cooperation with the
Long Beach Unified District elementary schools. Materials will first be
developed for Spanish speaking students in the third grade. In Phase I sample
lessons will be generated for mathematics and science and preliminary
development testing conducted. Plans will be created for full development
including the lesson content, and supporting student/parent and teacher guides.
A plan for test and evaluation of the system will be established, and
dissemination methods will be examined. In Phase II, the program and supporting
text material will be completed and initial tests conducted in the Long Beach
Schools, for both Spanish and Khmer (Cambodian). Commercial avenues for
dissemination will be evaluated and selected.
