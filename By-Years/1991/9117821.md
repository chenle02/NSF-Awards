The primary goals of this study are: (1) to examine in detail the long-term
petrologic, geochemical, and isotopic evolution of Kilauea and (2) to evaluate
the nature of isotopic and geochemical heterogeneities in the Hawaiian plume
source. The SOH core presents a unique opportunity to document the magmatic
history of the world's most active volcano and to examine in detail the
geochemical evolution of a Hawaiian shield volcano over a significant portion of
its eruptive activity. Furthermore, Sr and Pb isotopic systematics for Kilauea
indicate this volcano best defines one end-member in the plume source of
Hawaiian lavas. Therefore, results from this study should yield important new
insights into the nature of geochemical heterogeneity in the Hawaiian mantle
plume.
