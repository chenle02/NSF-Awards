This research equipment award will be used to purchase advanced test equipment
and instrumentation for ice testing. The physical properties, deformation
processes, and mechanical properties of both freshwater and sear ice will be
studied. Applications include arctic and antarctic operations, shipping on
frozen sea and river lanes, and development of safe structures subjected to ice
forces.
