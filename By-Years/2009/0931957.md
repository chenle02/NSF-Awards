The objective of this research is to develop numerical techniques for solving
partial differential equations (PDE) that govern information flow in dense
wireless networks. Despite the analogy of information flow in these networks to
physical phenomena such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, many physical and
protocol imposed constraints make information flow PDEs unique and different
from the observed PDEs in physical phenomena. The approach is to develop a
systematic method where a unified framework is capable of optimizing a broad
class of objective functions on the information flow in a network of a massive
number of nodes. The objective function is defined depending on desired property
of the geometric paths of information. This leads to PDEs whose form varies
depending on the optimization objective. Finally, numerical techniques will be
developed to solve the PDEs in a network setting and in a distributed manner.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this project are: developing
mathematical tools that address a broad range of design objectives in large
scale wireless sensor networks under a unified framework; initiating a new field
on numerical analysis of information flow in dense wireless networks; and
developing design tools for networking problems such as transport capacity,
routing, and load balancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
research are: helping the development of next generation wireless networks;
encouraging involvement of undergraduate students and underrepresented groups,
and incorporating the research results into graduate level courses.
Additionally, the research is interdisciplinary, bringing together sensor
networking, theoretical physics, partial differential equations, and numerical
optimization.
