This award supports travel expenses and registration fees for invited speakers,
undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, and
junior faculty to attend and present at the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Complex Active and Adaptive Materials Systems
to be held January 28 to February 3, 2023, in Ventura,
California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will involve cross-disciplinary
researchers in non-equilibrium systems for functional materials and soft
machines that can self-assemble and adapt in response to their environment. The
conference includes a session designed to address diversity and inclusion in the
scientific workplace. The GRS is a dedicated avenue for doctoral and post-
doctoral researchers to present and discuss their work and establish
collaborative relationships with their peers. Mentors and trainee moderators
will facilitate active participation in scientific
discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
