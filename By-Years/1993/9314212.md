1 9314212 Montonye The 1994 symposium on Astronomical Telescopes &
Instrumentation for the 21st Century organized by SPIE -- The International
Society for Optical Engineering, will be held 13-18 March, 1994 at Kona, Hawaii.
The Symposium, held every four years since 1966, is a major event in
astronomical hardware and technology. It is expected that the symposium will be
attended by approximately 500 technical delegates from 15 different countries.
Conferences will provide discussion on the dramatic changes in the design and
capabilities of large telescopes; examine the new developments of the next
generation of optical/infrared telescopes; and report on the development of
synthetic aperture telescopes built for the spectral range from UV to
submillimeter. A new conference on adaptive optics will report on new AO systems
and components, and serve as a forum for scientists and engineers working in the
laser beam control, astronomical imaging, electro-optical sensor, and
optomechanical component communities. National Science Foundation funding would
allow the participation of speakers active in the fields of astronomical
hardware and technology who need partial support to attend and present results
of their research. ***
