The primary objectives of this project are to promote students' interest in
manufacturing engineering at an early stage in the engineering curriculum, and
to increase the retention rate of engineering majors. Two sophomore-level
courses in design and manufacturing are being developed. These courses provide
an integrated body of knowledge designed around the manufacture of a product.
Once the courses are developed, they will be implemented in the Industrial and
Manufacturing Engineering Program at Oregon State University. Additional project
objectives include: a plan to revise junior-senior curriculum around the
fundamental design and manufacturing principles developed in the two new
courses, and dissemination of results through short courses to community
colleges in the Oregon State System of Education.
