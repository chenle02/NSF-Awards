Artificial pinning structures promise dramatically increased critical current
densities in superconductors. We propose: (1) construction and test of composite
conductors to complete the database and (2) use of this database for the testing
of existing pinning theories, expanding on them as necessary to indicate the
feasibility of factor-or-two increases in critical current density to be
achieved in Phase II. The composites chosen to complete the database may have
the highest critical currents every produced in the 0 to 10T field range.
