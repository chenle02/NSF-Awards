This award will provide funds for a study of the use of cadmium-based quantum
dots suspended in scintillator oil as an active target for neutron detection.
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that are highly efficient
fluorophores. The emission wavelengths are tunable by the size of the dot and
have widths of about 25 nm. Most dots are constructed of cadmium, with CdS and
CdSe dots the most common. Cd has a high cross section for neutron absorption,
second only to gadolinium. The goal is to study how a Cd-based quantum dot
target will respond when neutrons are captured. At present, a large scale
detector doped with quantum dots is far too expensive to construct; however, the
expanding market for quantum dots, especially in the biological and medical
industries, is expected to drive the cost down significantly. This project aims
at building the first small quantum-dot-based neutron detector.

The broader impact of this award arises largely from the opportunity it affords
minority students to obtain hands-on hardware experience. This project also
involves students from the MIT Summer Research Program for minorities who will
create webpages, so that the interest and excitement of the R&D can be shared
with the public.
