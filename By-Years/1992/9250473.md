The goal of the project is to improve the instructional laboratory experience of
intermediate-level undergraduate majors in preparation for additional experience
in upper-level laboratories, independent research projects in faculty
laboratories, graduate school, and employment. This course offers students an
integrated, quarter-long experience in modern biochemistry using an experiment
with taq polymerase, a DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus which is used
widely in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The continuity and
integrated format in this exercise will give students a more complete
understanding of how to organize and perform a complex series of tasks to
achieve a final end-product, lay the intellectual framework of experimentation
for other courses where more advanced experiments are performed, and give the
students insight into the importance of standards and into their competence ln
the laboratory. Finally, using their taq polymerase product in a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) system designed for criminal apprehension will help
students connect the abstractness of biochemistry to the world in which they
live.
