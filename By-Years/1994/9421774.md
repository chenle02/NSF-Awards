9421774 Niyogi This project is on research to better understand the dynamics of
growth factors and their receptors, focusing on the epidermal growth factor
system. The object of the work is to manipulate growth factor ligands as a means
of altering trafficking. There are three specific aims for the period of study:
(1) to manipulate parameters in receptor/ligand and receptor/cell interactions
in order to test previously constructed models of receptor dynamics; (2) to
investigate ligand transport through model tissues; and (3) to study model
autocrine/paracrine regulatory systems created by inserting engineered ligands
and regulatory elements into cell lines. The understanding of growth
factor/receptor dynamics and trafficking could lead to improvements in wound
healing, drug delivery, gene therapy, and tissue regeneration. ***
