Description: This project supports cooperative study by a team of Myanmar
geologists and geophysicists headed by U. Tin Myint of the Myanmar Oil and Gas
Enterprise, and a team of U.S. scientists headed by Dr. Michael Fuller of the
University of California, Santa Barbara. The study will be a paleomagnetic
effort to help establish the tectonic history of that country. Paleomagnetism is
a suitable way for documenting the effects of the Indian-Asia collision and also
contributes to the understanding of the accretionary processes, whereby Myanmar
became a part of Asia. This work will complement studies being carried out under
NSF/EAR grant. Scope: This research will benefit greatly from participation of
scientists from Myanmar who have access to data, and to field facilities that
would not be easily available, independently, to foreign scientists. The visits
of the Myanmar scientists to the laboratory at U.C. Santa Barbara will help
break a near total isolation from the west, and enhance the potential for future
collaboration with that country. The project meets the objectives of the Science
in Developing Countries Program.
