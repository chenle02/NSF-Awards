This project will add an important new dimension to the history of twentieth
century science by uncovering how agricultural research influenced the
antibiotic revolution. At the same time, it will consider how a scientist could
both prosper at the core of the high-tech medicine and become a spokesman for
those emphasizing the limits of humanity's technological reach. Focusing
specifically on the scientific research of Rene Jules Dubos the eminent
twentieth century bacteriologist and environmentalist, the project will provide
the intellectual underpinnings for Rene's subsequent environmental studies.
