This award supports Dr. Larry Kevan and a graduate student from the University
of Houston in a collaboration with Jens Weitkamp of the Institute of Chemical
Techonology at the University of Stuttgart. Each group has developed world-class
capabilities in separate methods for studying structure and dynamics of
catalytic agents. Specifically, the U.S. group, which specializes in Electron
Spin Resonance (ESR) techniques, and the German group, which specializes in
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, will come together to study
microporous silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO-n) containing transition metal ions of
catalytic interest. These materials will be evaluated for the catalysis of
methanol to olefins and other resultants.
