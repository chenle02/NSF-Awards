Certain snake venoms contain toxins, called alpha-neurotoxins, which cause
muscle paralysis by blocking the normal action of the neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine, at its site of action on the muscle surface. One of these toxins,
called alpha-bungarotoxin, has been particularly useful to biochemists
interested in studying the acetylcholine receptor on the muscle membrane. In
order to understand the action of these toxins at the muscle receptor and to
determine what it is about the alpha-bungarotoxin molecule that targets it for
the muscle receptor, synthetic genes can be produced for this protein. With the
gene in hand one can develop a procedure for preparing large amounts of
genetically- modified toxin. By systematically altering different parts of the
toxin protein, one can identify the sites on the toxin which "recognizes" the
receptor. The determination of the structural changes in the protein will depend
on sophisticated new techniques taking advantage of instrumentation using high
magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses. This type of recognition is also how
drugs recognize their target sites. This work will help us understand the
chemically-important structures which allow chemicals and biological molecules
to interact.
