9316328 Crozaz Several projects mostly based on the results obtained with prior
NSF support are planned: a) comprehensive microanalytical studies of
interstellar SiC and graphite in order to elucidate their formation in stars, b)
trace element and isotopic studies of eucrites and ureilites to clarify the
origin of these meteorite classes, and c) trace element measurements of Siberian
eclogites to understand their formation and relationship to similar samples from
their kimberlites. Extreme differences in isotopic composition compared to solar
system material identify SiC and graphite grains from primitive meteorites as
circumstellar dust. Isotopic measurements of these grains combined with
astrophysical theory are contributing new insights into nucleosynthesis and
stellar evolution. Future work on interstellar grains from separates prepared at
the University of Chicago will emphasize the complete understanding of the dust,
and to this end will combine ion microprobe isotopic measurements with
determinations of trace element abundances as well as detailed physical studies
in the TEM. To better understand the petrogenesis of eucrite and ureilite
meteorites, minor and trace element abundances (particularly rare earth
elements) will be determined by in situ ion microprobe measurements. A study of
Siberian eclogites will be extended to additional xenoliths assumed to have
sampled a wide range of depths within the mantle. Eclogite inclusions present in
some of the Siberian diamonds will also be analyzed to determine whether the
diamonds are cogenetic with the eclogite hosts.
