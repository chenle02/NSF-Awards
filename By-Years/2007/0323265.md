This study uses the case of Northern Ireland to examine the effect of the
Internet on efforts to build a democratic polity in a deeply divided society
with an historical problem of democratic representation. The Internet both
exacerbates problems of community detachment and opens news opportunities for
communication. Northern Ireland provides an excellent site for this exploration
of information technology and democracy because the region combines a long
history of Western parliamentary politics, a rich free press tradition, and a
developed economy with long-term political divisions characterized by violence
and segmented communities. This research will move forward the relatively
undeveloped literature on the Internet and democracy by charting out the
patterns of the heterogeneous effects of the Internet on political and religious
dialogue and conflict. In moving between the fields of science and technology
studies, particularly its participation and design focus, and media studies,
especially regarding the impact of media, the project will examine in detail the
relationship between technology and democracy in a multi-ethnic society. As a
result, this study will examine the potential impact of the Internet from the
creation and design of web sites through user experiences in comparison to other
communications technologies. The project uses interviews and archival research
to explore how the construction and use of web sites reveal interpretations of a
multi-ethnic democracy, and how the Internet compares with other media in
representing political views of a multi-ethnic democracy. The larger concern of
the project in focusing on the fragility of democracy in a multi-ethnic society
is the potential of technology to reduce divisions that give rise to violence.
This project will contribute to an analysis of democracy, technological
development, and multi-ethnic societies.
