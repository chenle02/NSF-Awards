This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University acquire a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research by six major users engaged in
chemical synthesis. Of the six programs, four have active NSF grants. Four of
these organic chemistry projects involve the stereospecific synthesis of natural
product analogs of bioactive molecules which will require high field NMR to
characterize complex products. One of these will also use NMR to determine the
structure of natural products isolated from marine organisms. The inorganic
project will use variable temperature and multinuclear NMR to characterize new
organometallic species and reactions. The sixth project will use variable
temperature NMR to study the kinetics of free radical reactions. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the
chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
