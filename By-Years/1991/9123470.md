This project is to provide travel support for the U.S. speakers at the
International Workshop on Technology for Hong Kong's Infrastructure Development.
The primary objective of this Workshop is to bring together international
talents to address areas of research relevant to technology for infrastructure
development and maintenance. There will be a particular emphasis on Port and
Airport Development Strategy in Hong Kong, which is one of the largest civil
engineering projects ever attempted. The workshop will include four subject
areas: Building Engineering (focussing on active structural control techniques
to mitigate building response under dynamic environment (;Bridge Engineering
(damage assessment and dynamic response of suspension and cablestayed bridges);
Costal Engineering (effect of storm surges and typhoons on harbors and bays and
new protection alternatives) and Geotechnical Engineering (progress in marine
applications, harbor landfill projects and stability of slopes).
