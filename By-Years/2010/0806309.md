This project hypothesizes that zones of apparently reversed magnetization in
Brunhes age sediments in the Arctic Ocean and Greenland-Norwegian Sea are due to
self-reversal in the mineral greigite formed as alteration coatings from
magnetite. Nine HOTRAX (Healy-Oden Trans-Arctic Expedition, 2005) cores will be
studied in order to establish the stratigraphic control on natural remanent
magnetization (NRM) component directions from core to core. Thermal
demagnetization of NRM determined on Al foil-wrapped discrete sub-samples will
help determine the carriers of NRM. Low temperature remanence loss and high
temperature hysteresis data will establish the magnetic carriers. SEM (Scanning
Electron Microscope) studies and X-ray diffraction of magnetic separates will
augment the magnetic measurements. Successful completion of this project will
identify a cause of reverse magnetization in Arctic marine sediments, leading to
improved age dating of the sediments and correlations and control with global
sediments based on magnetostratigraphy. The project will support one graduate
student, and also involve undergraduate students in the core analysis.
