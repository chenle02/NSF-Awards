Methane oxidation by microbes is an important part of the global carbon cycle.
However, the microbes (methanotrophs) that oxidize methane in ecosystems have
not been identified. Carbon metabolism in freshwater samples using assays of
enzymes that are unique to different groups of methylotrophs will be studied in
order to partially characterize the dominant microflora. Characterization of
methanol dehydrogenases in samples will be utilized to further characterize the
methylotrophs present. Microbes that oxidize methane and ammonia will be
identified by characterizing genes encoding methane monooxygenase and methanol
dehyrogenase and the approximate biomass of each organism will be measured using
DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA hybridization reactions as well as by assays for spceific
enzymes. The quantification and indentification of these bacteria will provide
information on their contribution to the global greenhouse effect.
