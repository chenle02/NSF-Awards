As the most primitive living lineages of embryophytes, bryophytes are critical
to an understanding of the phylogeny of the land flora. A relatively robust
cladogram already exists for the plants based on morphology and chemistry.
However, several aspects of their phylogenetic relationships appear unclear. The
aim of this project is to obtain nuclei acid sequences from a large sample of
bryophyte chloroplasts and to use these in developing and testing hypotheses
about their phylogeny. Two rRNA and rbcL genes will be sequenced for a broad
array of species representing most phylogenetic lineages. The PIs also intend to
use these data sets and analyses to explore various attributes of the
interactions of cladistic methods and types of data. Thus, a better
understanding of both the bryophytes and the methods and applications of
cladistics should be derived from this study.
