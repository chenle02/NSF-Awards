The Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Alaska will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Peripheral computer
equipment for a SUN workstation that is used for accessing and managing large
data sets at sea and at the shore-based laboratory, -Microcomputer and
associated equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing and
communications capabilities, The instrumentation described above will increase
the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and
engineering projects.
