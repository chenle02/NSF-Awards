This project widens the scope of this institution's digital electronics course
sequence by including the ability to customize advanced architecture logic
circuits and by exposing students to logic analyzers for debugging and
troubleshooting complex digital circuits. This project is supported by a
laboratory which includes programmmable Logic Workstations running Altera
developmnet software and HP Logic Analyzers. This collection of hardware and
software permits students to design and simulate a circuit, using a computer,
prior to constructing the circuit. This award is being matched by an equal sum
from the grantee.
