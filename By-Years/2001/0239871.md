&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves dendrimeric molecules.
Understanding the effect of global/local cooperativity in dendrimer folding,
evaluation of the effect of aqueous media on the folding properties of
dendrimers, correlation of peptide helicity and dendrimer folding, transferring
chirality from the central core to the periphery of a dendrimer,and,
interconverting global conformations with light will be the specific goals of
the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jonathan R.
Parquette of the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio State University. Dr.
Parquette will focus his work on the control of the folding process of a
synthetic dendrimer by understanding how various elements of structural order
cooperate to create a compact, three- dimensional structure. The project has
potential broad impact for nanotechnology and provides an excellent venue for
the interdisciplinary training of students at the undergraduate and graduate
level. &lt;br/&gt;
