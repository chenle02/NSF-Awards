Kikim Media requests $743,316 to produce four half-hour television documentaries
and associated outreach programs based on Michael Pollan's best-selling book,
The Botany of Desire. The project explores the reciprocal nature of people's
relationship with plants. The programs focus on the connections between apples
and the human desire for sweetness; tulips and the desire for beauty; marijuana
and the desire for intoxication; and corn and our desire for control over
nature. The project will increase public understanding of diverse subjects
including genetics, evolution, cognition and biochemistry as well as
biodiversity, genetic diversity and the consequences of their loss. The project
will have a broad impact through a national primetime PBS broadcast, an outreach
program targeting adult audiences, and an educational module delivering
appropriate content (excluding intoxication) to middle and high school
audiences. Knight-Williams Research Communications will conduct the evaluation
for The Botany of Desire television broadcast and outreach efforts.
