*** ABSTRACT 9661283 Kessler This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will combine ultra-sensitive optical absorption spectroscopy and
frequency-quadrupled diode laser light sources for the development of an atomic
mass flux sensor for semiconductor fabrication. Increasingly complex nanoscale
electronic devices require that production facilities maintain fine control of
the atomic and molecular fluxes during the fabrication process (e.g., MBE, CVD).
This requires the development of a new class of flux monitors which are species
specific and capable of the precision and accuracy needed for depositing single
atomic layers. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has recently demonstrated sensitive
mass flux measurements by recording velocity and number density measurements of
molecular oxygen molecules in an aeropropulsion field demonstration. PSI
proposes to apply the same technique to atomic species by developing and
demonstrating a frequency-quadrupled diode laser source in a compact and tunable
configuration suitable for various atomic flux measurements. During the Phase I
program, ultra-sensitive dopant atomic concentration measurements will be
demonstrated using a heat pipe atom source. Mass flux measurements and control
will be demonstrated in Phase II in atomic flows produced by an MBE oven source.
The flux sensor/controller prototype demonstration will be applicable to a wide
variety of both atomic and molecular species flux measurements. The proposed
sensor will advance the state-of-the-art for the control of atomic mass flux
during fabrication of electronic devices. The sensor will also be applicable to
molecular species by changing the laser source wavelength and thus will be
applicable to MBE variants and manufacturing via MOCVD. Additional markets may
be found in industrial process controls, aeropropulsion applications, and
environmental monitoring. ***
