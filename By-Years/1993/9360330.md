9360330 Korzhik W.Peter Trower Inc. proposes to develop nuclear/particle
detectors using new fast heavy inorganic scintillators provided to our
specifications by our Belorussian collaborators. These materials are of tow
classes: (1) bright cerium-activated crystals - YAP, GAO, and GSO - which could
displace thallium doped sodium and cesium iodide in certain applications. Our
current YAP crystals (up to 50 x 50 x 10 mm3) have measured efficiencies,
resolutions, brightness, and mechanical properties comparable to, or better
than, those of sodium iodide but are 10 times faster. (2) dense undoped lead
tungstenate crystals which offer an alternative to bismuth germanate. Relative
to BGO, our current PWO crystals ( up to 22 x 22 x 180 mm3) are 12% denser, 10
times faster, and have 10 times better energy resolution but are only 10% as
bright.
