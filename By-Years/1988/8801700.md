This award supports cooperative research on proteoglycan sulfotransferases
between Dr. Carlos Hirschberg of the University of Massachusetts Medical School
in Worcester and Dr. Enrique Brandan of the Catholic University in Santiago,
Chile. The effect of these enzymes on the sulfation of proteoglycans is
important because biological processes such as blood clotting and cell growth
depend on these sulfated protein-carbohydrate complexes. Antibodies will be
obtained against the sulfotranferase enzyme, key to the sulfation of
proteoglycans and the substrate specificity will be determined for the enzymes.
These studies will lead to an understanding of the biosynthesis of the
proteoglycans through the regulation of the sulfation reaction. Dr. Brandan has
already purified N-heparan sulfate sulfotransferase in Massachusetts and now
will purify O-heparan sulfate sulfotranferase from rat liver in Chile. The
antibodies will be prepared in Dr. Hirschberg's laboratory while the
immunohistochemistry will be done by Dr. Jurgen Roth of the Biocenter in Basel,
Switzerland which adds a multilateral aspect to this work. Both principal
investigators have good track records and have worked together successfully so
both laboratories will benefit from the collaboration. Dr. Hirschberg will gain
Dr. Brandan's extensive experience in enzyme purification and Dr. Brandan will
benefit from the use of the facilities at the University of Massachusetts and
will strengthen his new research program in Chile. This is a good example of the
benefits of international cooperation in science. By providing partial support
for Dr. Brandan while in the U.S., this award will help fulfill the objectives
of the Science in Developing Countries Program providing benefits to the U.S. as
well as to the Chilean collaborator.
