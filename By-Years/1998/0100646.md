Crystallizable polymers in the thin film geometry will be studied using
electrical and optical methods. Constraints on molecular mobility that arise
from the thin film geometry will be investigated and compared to behavior
observed in the bulk polymers. Materials chosen for the study are model systems
having well-characterized molecular weights and tacticity, comprising isotactic
polystyrene (i-PS), and miscible blends of isotactic with atactic polystyrene
(a-PS). Effects of film thickness on the glass transition and cold-
crystallization kinetics film thickness and root mean square end-to-end distance
of the polymer chain will be determined for homopolymer i-PS and blends. In
nanometer-scale thin films, optical methods measuring alignment layer
relaxation, and surface studies using elevated temperature atomic force
microscopy, will be used to corroborate the dielectric experiments. Ex-situ
characterization of the films will include thickness measurement by
profilometry, and surface structure analysis by scanning electron microscopy.
Degree of crystallinity of thin films will be assessed using Fourier Transform
infrared spectroscopy. In bulk-scale films, simultaneous wide and small angle
X-ray scattering will be performed to assess structural parameters and to
determine crystallization kinetics from the time development of scattered
intensity. Differential scanning calorimetry and its temperature-modulated
variant will be used to determine the glass transition temperature and degree of
crystallinity of thicker films.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Thin polymer films are
being used more frequently in technological applications, and it is therefore of
great practical interest to understand the structure and properties of
crystallizable polymer nanometer-scale films. This work will provide fundamental
information about the molecular motions and crystallization processes in thin
polymer films, which impact directly the material properties and performance
characteristics of thin films.&lt;br/&gt;
