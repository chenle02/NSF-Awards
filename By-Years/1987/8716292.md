An understanding of how and why a protein folds into its native conformation is
of major biological importance. Although much work has been done on this problem
still relatively little is known about the details of the process. Dr. Fink is
studying the factors which determine a particular folding pathway and hence
native structure. The long-term goals are to learn the "rules" by which the
amino acid sequence of a polypeptide guides the folding path to the native
state. Dr. Fink will use: 1) specific signals or probes in different regions of
the molecule to aid determining the order in which the protein folds and
unfolds; 2) site-specific mutants to facilitate the formation of protein with
environment-sensitive probes in unique and selected sites and probe the role of
individual amino acids on the folding; and 3) subzero temperatures and aqueous-
methanol cryosolvents to permit the stabilization and characterization of
partially-folded intermediates in both unfolding and refolding.
