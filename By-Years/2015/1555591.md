This project creates a Mobile Internet Testbed for Application Traffic
Experimentation (MITATE) - a large-scale mobile application prototyping
platform. MITATE will enable developers to evaluate protocol design choices,
application deployment alternatives, and component mobility mechanisms - all in
live mobile networks spanning geographic areas, carriers, and devices. MITATE
will also benefit the computing research community by lowering the barrier to
experimentation on mobile devices in production
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MITATE allows experimentation with custom mobile
application traffic between mobile devices and cloud infrastructure endpoints,
on which application back-end logic is deployed. MITATE is designed as a
collaborative framework, in which participants contribute their mobile network
resources and are allowed, in turn, to run their traffic experiments on others
devices. The MITATE design, specifically the tit-for-tat data credit system and
the separation of traffic generation functionality from application logic, will
ensure safe and self-scaling testbed operation. This testbed will enable novel
and compelling research at Montana State University on self-optimizing low
latency protocols.
