Research will be carried out on negative muon capture in hydrogen aimed at
determining the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant in electroweak
interactions to an accuracy of ten percent. This work will be done at the muon
facility of the Paul Scherrer Institute cyclotron (Switzerland). Other research
involves experiment and equipment design and construction for a parity violation
experiment at CEBAF. The goal of this work is a 0.5 percent determination of the
Weinberg angle in electroweak interactions. At this level, sensitivity to
radiative corrections emerges, which in turn contain sensitivities to charged
and neutral currents carried by the Z, W and possible higher mass particles.
