The collaborative proposal will connect the researchers from Stanford with their
colleagues in the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health and Aalto University,
Finland to identify the stresses and cognitive demands that are placed on
learners who are participating in multi-cultural and cross-disciplinary
collaborations in a rich technology-enabled learning environment. The research
will be situated in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction Global Teamwork
course in the Problem Based Learning Laboratory at Stanford University that
engages students in teamwork with partners worldwide. Multiple sources of data
will be collected that examine a number of dimensions of student learning
experiences including the number of disciplines embodied by the team structure,
the number of cultures that influence the communication within the teams, the
impact of space and time interactions and the multiple channels by which
communication takes place among team members. Physiological data will be
collected to identify indicators of stress, and ways that learners and
instructions can monitor and self-regulate their well-being and engagement will
be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an increasingly global economy, the
conditions under which teams will be required to work and learn together are
increasingly diverse and require that virtual learning environments become more
collaborative. This research has the potential to inform those who design
virtual learning environments that engage individuals and teams from different
cultural milieus whose interactions are separated by time and space. Ways to
mitigate the stresses that occur across these separations that foster better
communications across cultural differences will contribute to design elements
for learning experiences in not only post-secondary courses, but also
interactions in the global workspace.
