This year's Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University October 13-15, 2011. This series of annual meetings at Northwestern
University has entered its thirty-third year. As in the past, this year's
Colloquium consists of two programs. The central theme of the Research Program
is probability in analysis and other related fields, whose centerpiece will be
two lectures by Russell Lyons of Indiana University. The topic of the Tutorial
Program is mass transportation and applications to probability and will be led
by Karl-Theodor Sturm of Bonn University. In addition to providing full support
for the speakers, the funds from the NSF will be used to cover partial travel
and lodging expenses for graduate students, younger researchers, members of
unrepresented minority groups, and several senior active participants.
