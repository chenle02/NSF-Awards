9729186 Dunn This project entitled Synthesis and Properties of Continuous
Periodic Mesoporous Films focuses on the use of ordered arrays of surfactant
molecules as templetes for the three-dimensional polymerization of silicates.
Thin films of centimeter dimensions form rapidly by a continuous process on
solid substrates. The program consists of three complimentary objectives: to
synthesize new mesoporous films, to understand the process of film formation,
and to design nanomaterials templated by the mesophase structure to produce
metal and semiconductor quantum dots and one dimensional wires in ordered arrays
within the silica film. %%% This project will focus on the prospects for
creating mesoporous films with unique electrical and optical properties. The
mesoporous substrates for quantum dot arrays provides an interesting approach to
growing semiconductor nanostructures. The microstructure of mesoporous films
offers the possibility of incorporating metals and semiconductors to generate
periodic arrays of quantum dots or one-dimensional wires, and of exploring new
types of self-assembled optical waveguides. The outcome of this research will be
nanostructured films possessing interesting electrical, optical, and catalytic
properties. ***
