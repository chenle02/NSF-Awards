This Engineering Department Level Reform Planning grant will integrate service-
learning into a broad array of courses so that students will be exposed to
service-learning every semester in the core curriculum in every program in the
entire college of engineering. Service-learning has been shown to be effective
in a large number of cognitive and affective measures, including critical
thinking and tolerance for diversity. As a result, service learning leads to
better knowledge of course subject matter, cooperative learning, recruitment of
underrepresented groups in engineering, retention of students, citizenship as
well as the meeting of ABET 2000 criteria a-k, well-known to engineering
educators. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This grant will be directed toward planning
for implementation: faculty recruitment and training, program and course
modification, assessment, and dissemination of results. The implementation and
assessment phases of the proposed study are expected to have significant impact
on students, faculty, institution, and community. Expected outcomes of the
project to be planned would include, very briefly, increased experiential
learning of engineering subject matter, recruitment and retention of
underrepresented groups in engineering (particularly women), tolerance of
diversity, cooperative learning, active citizenship, and a more enlightened and
livable local and global community.&lt;br/&gt;
