This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
on the mechanisms of light-induced chemical reactions. Dr. Morrison's focus in
photochemical reactions is the interaction of close, but formally non-conjugated
functional groups which interact in the excited states generated by light
absorption. Such systems are important as models for many of the light-induced
chemical sequences of life processes. In photosynthesis, for example, one
"antenna" group in chlorophyll harvests light energy and then transfers it to a
nearby "receptor" for initiating chemical changes. Photochemical reactions of
bifunctional molecules can be broadly subclassified into those (a) involving
bond formation between the two functionalities, and (b) those primarily
involving only one of the two groups, the non-reacting moiety then serving as an
"antenna" to harvest photons. In the latter case, a variety of mechanisms are
now recognized which can lead to activation of the distal, reacting group. The
reacting group may either be relatively transparent in the ultraviolet spectrum
(examples are chlorine, carbethoxy, and alkene substituents), or be itself
capable of asborption (a ketone, for example), but still potentially selectively
activated by the atenna. This research is primarily addressed to "Class b"
systems. The basic questions for which answers are sought include: (1) How
general, and with what stereoelectronic limitations, are the various mechanisms
for activiting distal functionalities; (2) How may these phenomena be utilized
synthetically; and (3) How are they reflected in the photostability of complex
molecules? As an out growth of research previously supported by Foundation Grant
CHE-8318825, Dr. Morrison has also initiated studies involving metal ion
catalysis in photochemistry and photochemistry in the gas phase. Both projects
have uncovered new and intriguing chemistry, the extensions of which are
included in the present program.
