Polyketides are a large family of natural products found in bacteria, fungi, and
plants. Many of them are used as antibiotics, anticancer agents,
immunosuppressants, and veterinary products. They are also important as natural
food and flavoring agents, or as fungal toxins. Biosynthesis of the carbon
backbones of all polyketides occurs via a highly programmed polymerization
process, which incorporates critical variations on a common theme of enzyme
catalyzed reactions. In each case, the highly selective sequence of reactions is
catalyzed by a complex enzyme known as the polyketide synthase. The aim of this
project is to investigate the relationships that exist between the structure and
the function of polyketide synthases.
