A graphical workstation for use of the UNIDATA system to receive and process
meteorological data at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of
Oceanography will be acquired. UNIDATA is the NSF-subsidized system allowing
university departments access to real-time weather data, forecasts and
specialized satellite images. Data transmitted via satellite are ingested and
decoded by networked computers; they may be stored or used in displays, in
diagnostic calculations or perhaps in experimental forecasts. At URI the
required satellite receiving gear is in place and has been in stable operation
for four years. The workstation acquired would augment the Educational Computer
Laboratory, which presently has microcomputers and workstations on a local area
network. The UNIDATA software will be installed and used in display analysis and
archive meteorological data for the purpose of teaching and research for
strongly interdisciplinary programs. Those studying atmospheric chemistry,
physical oceanography and paleoclimatology are likely to benefit most from the
augmented laboratory facilities. Dedicated computers in laboratories across
campus can access the local network, and the system will also be used in these
research environments. An example of such use is control or monitoring of
conditions for the planning or conduct of field experiments.
