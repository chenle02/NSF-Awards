The curriculum is being enhanced by the establishment of a dedicated
microcomputer laboratory component to supplement and expand the present
laboratory exercises taught in the chemistry courses. Twenty computers, two
printers, two plotters and the requisite software are being purchased. The
equipment is being used to reinforce experiments; to familiarize students with
modern analytical techniques by using computer simulations, particularly in
areas where expensive instrumentation is not available; and to provide numerous
samples for examination and analysis to supplement experiences in the
laboratory. The additional laboratory training is helping students gain further
knowledge and experience necessary for successful entry and completion of upper
division curriculum. Students are also increasing their competency and
familiarity with computers, a basic tool of modern science and industry. The
grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
