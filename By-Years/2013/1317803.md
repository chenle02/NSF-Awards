The Virtual Robot Test and Integration Laboratory (VRTIL) addresses the need to
verify robot software using real data, produced by real sensors, in all its
richness and imperfection. The project is embedding robot software in a
synthetic environment in order to mimic its sensor interfaces. In an advance
over the state of the art, these interfaces are windows into data bases that
store the actual sensor data that a robot did read when it was in a particular
state.&lt;br/&gt;The project goal is to reproduce the real world interface as
exactly as possible using data. Two basic tools enable such ?virtualization? of
a real robot in a real environment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Virtualized reality
provides a means to produce synthetic views from virtual viewpoints that are
near to an actual viewpoint for which a real image is
available;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* High fidelity synthesized motion gathers large
amounts of data to calibrate a model that is valid across all of state
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining these ideas will result in a software test
environment for robot software that has the realism of data logs and the
responsiveness of a simulator. This may fundamentally transform the development
of robots by lowering the cost and time of testing and debugging.
