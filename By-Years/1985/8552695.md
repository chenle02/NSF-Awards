In the preliminary phase of engineering design, many different design concepts
evolve, and the designer must evaluate these concepts simultaneously for
feasibility and relative merit. Currently, most computer-aided design (CAD)
systems are useful only after the completion of this preliminary stage when most
aspects of the design have become fixed and known. In the preliminary stages of
design when the most crucial decisions are made, tools are unavailable to aid
the designer in evaluating concepts or choosing among alternatives. Computer
tools will be developed for preliminary design. The research will be directed
toward creating design tools that allow the designer to choose among
alternatives within a CAD environment. Further, analytical tools will be
developed so that a design can be analyzed at a level appropriate to its current
level of sophistication.
