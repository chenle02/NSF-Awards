The Nordic countries have an international reputation for developing advanced
technologies which are both efficient and humane. What are the mechanisms
through they accomplish this? In reality, how successful are policies which use
government to influence technology? This project aims to answer these questions
through a comparative study of the national networks which foster new
information technology in Norway and Sweden. The comparison i s particularly
timely because of recent government changes in Sweden. The basic method will be
anthropological fieldwork in Oslo, at the National Computing Centre, and in
various sites in Stockholm. Specific areas to be studied include policies to
promote 1) broad participation in computing system design; 2) new technology for
people with disabilities; and 3) computing which equalizes the social roles of
women and men. In addition to documenting one way in which systems get created,
the project will help us understand both the limits and the advantages of
including the public in decisions about new information technology. *** # x \ P
