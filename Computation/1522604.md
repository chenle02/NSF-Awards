Multiphase flows that involve both solid bodies and fluid interfaces are
ubiquitous in many applications such as particle-stabilized emulsions, flotation
technology, and animal locomotion at fluid interfaces. These applications play
important roles in the mining industry, micro- and nanotechnologies,
biotechnology, and environmental science. For example, nanoparticles may self-
assemble on a fluid interface due to capillary forces; this effect can be used
in the fabrication of nanostructured materials. Dry water, a water-in-air
emulsion stabilized by silica nanoparticles, has demonstrated extraordinary
capability to absorb carbon dioxide and is potentially useful in the war against
global warming. Flotation techniques, where gas bubbles are used to remove
suspended particles, have been widely used in wastewater treatment. This project
aims to develop numerical tools for detailed studies of these complex flows and
to resolve fundamental questions that arise in applications. The project will
also provide hands-on training opportunities for graduate students to work in
interdisciplinary research. The goal of this project is to develop hybrid
numerical methods for the direct numerical simulation of flow problems where
deformable fluid interfaces, moving rigid particles, and moving contact lines
coexist. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) algorithm on an unstructured
adaptive moving mesh will be adopted to track the moving boundaries of rigid
particles. Two interface-capturing methods based on the same moving mesh, namely
the phase-field and the level set methods, will be developed to capture the
deformation of fluid interfaces as well as the moving contact lines. These
hybrid ALE-interface-capturing methods combine the advantages of both
components: the ALE method provides an accurate representation of the particle
surface, which is critical for delicate contact-line conditions; the interface-
capturing methods easily handle the topological transitions of fluid interfaces.
In particular, the ALE-phase-field approach satisfies an energy law and is
essentially free of parasitic currents. Finite-element software packages will be
developed to implement the proposed methods. This work will advance the
development of numerical algorithms for different types of moving boundary
problems and also enrich the understanding of contact-line dynamics in complex
systems.
