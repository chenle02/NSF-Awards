ABSTRACT CTS-9622183 The aim of the research project is to obtain an
understanding of the heat transfer processes involved in high-heat-flux spray
cooling, including conduction, convection, and phase change in the forms of
evaporation and boiling. Experimental investigation is the primary research
technique. Recent studies have shown that the heat transfer process in spray
cooling is highly dependent on the spray characeristics and the surface
conditions. In order to obtain a successful model/correlation for he process, it
is essential to have a data matrix with variations in: spray characteristics,
fluid properties, surface conditions, and spray/surface orientation with respect
to gravity. The ability to measure the spray parameters is essential for a
better understanding of the spray cooling process. The research equipment
requested is a Phase-Doppler/Anemometer (PDA) which is capable of measuring
simultaneously the droplets diameters, velocities, and the number flux of a
liquid spray in a non-intrusive manner. The PDA measures these parameters using
the light scattered by the droplets moving through a very small probe defined by
two intersecting laser spray by characteristics. There is no comparable
equipment available at the University of Central Florida. This research
equipment will also be used by several other faculty members in the Mechanical
and Aerospace Engineering department who are conducting research in combustion
and single-phase/two-phase fluid flow and heat transfer. ***
