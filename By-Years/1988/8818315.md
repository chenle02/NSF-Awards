This is a project to perform a petrologic analysis of an unusual sample suite
dredged from the south wall of the Blanco fracture zone. Preliminary analyses of
the magnesium content of these rocks indicate that they may represent primary
liquids derived from considerable depth, but the analyses of iron and aluminum
contents are not consistent with the magnesium content. Additional data analyses
coupled with major and trace element modelling will elucidate the petrogenesis
of this unusual rock suite. %%% Much can be learned about sea floor magmatic
processes by studying unusual suites of rocks recovered from the sea floor. The
samples to be studied by Dr. DeLong fall into that category because most rock
samples appear to have undergone a complex history before arriving at the sea
floor. These rocks may have been derived directly from source rocks that have
melted at considerable depth and this might provide fundamental insights into
the nature of primary source rocks for the oceanic crust.
