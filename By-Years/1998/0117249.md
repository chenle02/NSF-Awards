award&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Summary: This proposal requests support for a
study to test the hypothesis that reorganization of atmospheric circulation and,
specifically, changes in upwelling-favorable winds, was a major factor driving
millennial variability in the intensity of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off the
west coast of North America. The study will employ measurement of 231Pa/230Th
and 10Be/230Th ratios in samples from cores forming a north-south transect along
the continental margin to deduce past changes in wind-driven productivity. The
proxies were selected because they are insensitive to sediment focusing and to
changes in bottom water oxygen content and thus should be reliable indicators of
local productivity variations. &lt;br/&gt;
