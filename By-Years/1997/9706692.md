9706692 Mosher A leading problem in understanding the late Proterozoic of North
America relates to the Grenville orogeny and its relationship to the crustal
blocks involved in it. South of the great lakes exposure of the relevant rocks
is almost non-existent, and thus the exposures of the Llano uplift, and those in
west Texas become unusually critical in deciphering these relationships. In
fact, the exposures that do exist there seem to reveal a rather more complicated
history of not only typical lower crustal Grenville rocks, but also eclogites,
possible fragments of the mid continental Grainte-Rhyolite terrane, and a so-far
unrecognized volcanic terrane. This geochronological, petrological, and
structural study of these rocks will provide fundamental limiting and defining
data that will strongly constrain our understanding of the tectonic evolution of
the southern Grenville region.
