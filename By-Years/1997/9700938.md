This proposal concerns a one-year program of research into nuclear reaction
dynamics at intermediate and high energies. The research, which will be
conducted primarily at Lawrence University, will focus mainly on the nuclear
equation of state, response of particle interactions to the nuclear environment,
collective directed and radial flow, resonance production, propagation, and
decay, features of phase transitions in nuclear matter, relativistic quantum
field theories at zero and finite temperature, non- equilibrium effects,
electromagnetic radiation from nuclear and sub-nuclear degrees of freedom and
dynamical aspects of quark-gluon plasma.
