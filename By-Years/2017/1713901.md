Understanding why the visible matter in the Universe is stable is one the great
intellectual challenges of basic research in nuclear physics. Central to these
challenges is the possibility to link the existence and properties of nuclei to
the underlying fundamental forces and degrees of freedom. New experimental
facilities, such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams being built at Michigan
State University, will probe hitherto uncharted properties of nuclei, allowing
for further insights into the physics of the smallest parts in the Universe. The
new insights span from the physics of nuclei and their synthesis to compact
objects like neutron stars, exotic end products of stars more massive than our
Sun. The theoretical research aims of this project are tightly woven with the
above intellectual challenges and provide an excellent example of integration of
theoretical and experimental studies. The combination of recent theoretical
developments, combined with advanced models for nuclear forces and access to
leading edge computational facilities, has the potential to offer new knowledge
and understanding of how the nuclear forces shape the matter we are made of. In
turn, this cutting-edge research will provide excellent training opportunities
for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this challenge, the PI
and his collaborators will develop, study and apply various many-body methods to
a wide variety of nuclear systems, ranging from stable closed-shell nuclei and
dense nuclear matter to exotic loosely-bound neutron and proton rich nuclei far
from shell closures. The overarching aim of the project is to seek a better
understanding of nuclear systems, as well as better constraints on the
theoretical approaches involved. In this project the PI will develop software
and theoretical tools that are being made available to the scientific community
via modern version control systems and software libraries.
