The PI proposes to develop mid-range theories of new forms of business
organization. He will perform ethnographic case studies of organizational re-
design episodes in Japan and the United States. Primary targets of the study
will be the enabling effects of information technology on the design of new
organizational forms and a comparative study of American and Japanese
transnational corporations. The NSF portion of the funding will support a subset
of the research which includes German, Japanese, and American corporations. The
research program has two phases. During Phase I, the PI will perform comparative
surveys of the organizational design challenges facing managers in companies in
the three cultures. In Phase II the PI will study organizational heuristics
invented and implemented in order to achieve critical capabilities.
