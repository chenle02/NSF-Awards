Theoretical research at the interface of elementary particle physics and
cosmology will focus on how physical processes that took place early in the
evolution of the Universe can help us understand both the fundamental structure
of matter and its interactions, and the large-scale structure of the Universe.
The methods to be used consist of analytical tools from theoretical particle
physics and large-scale computer simulations of non-linear field theories,
designed to model the dynamics of phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in an expanding Universe. Applications to the construction of models of
particle interactions and to the impact of phase transitions on cosmology will
be analyzed in detail. It is expected that the results obtained by this research
activity will help clarify many of the complex issues that arise when one
examines some of the fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology,
such as the excess of matter over antimatter in the Universe, as well as the
origin of its rich large-scale structure.
