OKAMURO 9604507 Arabidopsis flower development is governed by an evolutionarily
conserved network of genes that control the establishment and maintenance of
flower meristem identity, floral organ development, and gametogenesis. However,
little is known about how these genes function together at the cell and
molecular levels. The APETALA2 (AP2) gene plays a central role in controlling
flower development in Arabidopsis, in part, by controlling the temporal and
spatial expression pattern of another floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG). The AP2
protein represents the first of what is now known to be an important new family
of plant DNA binding proteins including EREBPs, AINTEGUMENTA, and TINY. The goal
of the experiments in this project is to understand how AP2 controls AG gene
expression at the molecular level by analyzing its DNA binding activity in vitro
and to identify proteins that may physically interact with and function together
with AP2 during flower development. Specific goals include: (1) identifying
sequences within the AP2 polypeptide that are required for AP2 DNA binding
activity in vitro, (2) identifying sequences within the AP2 polypeptide that are
required for AP2 function in viva, (3) determining how AP2 gene activity is
regulated at the posttranslational level, (4) determining whether AP2 forms
multimers with itself or with other AP2 domain containing proteins in viva, and
(5) identifying proteins that form stable physical interactions with AP2 using
gel filtration chromatography. The elucidation of AP2 function will ultimately
provide new insight into the control of plant growth and development at the
molecular level.
