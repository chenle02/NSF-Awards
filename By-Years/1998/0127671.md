The PIs will investigate the influence of the solar cycle on the general
circulation of the stratosphere and troposphere. Decadal variations operating
coherently with the variation of the ultra-violet (UV) radiation will be
investigated in long records of dynamical and chemical structure characterizing
the circulations of the stratosphere and troposphere. Building on recent
evidence, this investigation will examine the four-dimensional record of
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses to isolate those
months and locations, inclusive of the Southern Hemisphere, tropics and
troposphere, for which interannual changes operate dependently with changes of
ultra-violet (UV) irradiance. Contemporaneous changes of ozone will be
investigated in records from station data and in the satellite record from total
ozone mapping spectrometer instrument (TOMS). The work is important because it
will enhance our understanding of solar-climate interactions.
