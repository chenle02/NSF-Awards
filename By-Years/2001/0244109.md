0244109 Richardson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to the
University of Central Florida for a three-year International Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) Site in France and Germany for research in optics,
lasers, and optical materials. Ten students each year will have an opportunity
for collaborative research on topics such as optical laser propagation in the
atmosphere; x-ray imaging with diffractive crystals; material ablation with
ultrashort laser pulses; and femtosecond lasers. The REU program provides
valuable educational experiences for undergraduate students through research
participation in order to develop a diverse, internationally competitive,
globally engaged scientific and engineering workforce in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;
