This project aims to determine the role of magmatic processes in the
development of large or high-grade tungsten (W) skarn deposits associated with
granitoid plutonism in western North America. Previous work on this subject will
be augmented by further studies of (1) determination of contents of ore metals
(W, Mo. Sn) in whole-rock and mineral samples of the plutonic rocks, (2)
analyses for F, Cl, Li, and ferric/ferrous ratios in granitoid micas, and (3)
stable isotope analyses of the plutonic rocks and associated alteration and ore
minerals in selected intrusions. Goals of this work arc to establish whether or
not the ore metals are intrinsically associated with the intrusive granitoid
magmas, to infer compositions of associated fluids from analyses of the hydrous
mineral phases, and to determine the extent to which mineralization and
hydrothermal alteration are correlated. End results will be an improved concept
of how the W ore deposits form.
