9521929 Nabelek The recent establishment of a braodband seismograph network
along the cost of the Pacific northwest and the availability of data from the
Navy's offshore hydrophone arrays (SOSUS) provide a framework for long-term
monitoring of the seismicity associated with the Juan de Fuca plate and the
surrounding ridge-transform system. This project will use the onshore
seismograph network to determine magnitudes, depths, source mechanisms, and time
histories of earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.0 or greater and will incorporate
epicentral locations from the SOSUS arrays determined by NOAA. ***
