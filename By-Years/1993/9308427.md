9308427 Vaez-Iravani This grant will support research in the area of near-field
optical microscopy. The investigator will combine non- contact force microscopy
with fluorescence and phase contrast near field scanning optical microscopy. It
is anticipated that this technique will improve the resolution significantly
over other techniques. Both biological structures and porous silicon
photoluminescent surfaces will be imaged. This research is important since it is
likely that it will advance the state-of-the-art in the field of optical
microscopy. This new method of obtaining high resolution images should have an
impact in many disciplines including structural biology, immunology and
materials science. ***
