The reorganization of the NSF Chemistry Division has merged theStructural
Chemistry and Thermodynamics Program and the ChemicalPhysics Program into a new
Physical Chemistry Program. As aconsequence of the reorganization and the unique
opportunitiesfor advances in the field, a workshop on physical chemistry willbe
organized by Professors Jiri Jonas (Illinois) and Sandra C.Greer (Maryland).
This workshop will not only review the varioussubfields, but will review current
investments with the purposeof identifying areas of possible duplication or
absence ofimportant work. It is anticipated that the results of this workshop
will impactplanning in FY88 as Professor Jonas is a member of the
ChemistryAdvisory Committee and expects to make preliminaryrecommendations at
the fall meeting of the committee. The workshop organization will also benefit
because Professor Greer was a rotator during the 1985.1986 academic year and
thus understands the reorganization and has a good overview of the programs that
have now been combined into Physical Chemistry.
