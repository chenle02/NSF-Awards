In many practical situations, data are censored, that is the observations are
only known to exceed particular values. This research explores some basic
concepts in decision theory as applied to censored observations. In particular,
product-limit estimators are commonly used in the estimation of survival
functions; the admissibility and minimaxity of these estimators and variants
will be investigated. Undergraduate students will assist with computational
aspects, particularly generation of empirical distributions for small samples.
