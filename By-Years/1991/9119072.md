This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor John Wingfield, Department of Zoology, University of
Washington, and Professor Masaru Wada, Department of General Education, Tokyo
Medical and Dental University. Dr. Wingfield studies the role of environmental
factors in controlling the breeding cycle in birds. His present research
involves assaying reproductive hormones in different species on birds under
different environmental conditions. His project with Professor Wada involves
collaboration to develop and apply cDNA probes for the reproductive hormones in
chicken, since these probes will hybridize with the pituitary DNA of these
birds. Avian reproductive cycles are diverse, spanning continuums from brief to
essentially continuous breeding seasons, and from precisely timed to
opportunistic reproductive periods. This collaborative effort will measure
changes in gene expression for reproductive hormones in response to
environmental signals. This will extend Dr. Wingfield's current research to test
a constancy/contingency model of predictability as a potential unifying
hypothesis to explain how birds, and perhaps other organisms, integrate
environmental maturation under varying environmental conditions.
