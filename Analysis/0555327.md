This project will focus on multidimensional hypergeometric functions and their
q-analogs appear as solutions to differential and difference equations in
representation theory, conformal field theory, and statistical mechanics. The
equations are formulated in terms of representation theory of Lie algebras and
quantum groups. The hypergeometric and q-hypergeometric functions appearing in
these considerations have rich and interesting mathematical structures. Studying
these structures will lead to better understanding of interrelations of the
above theories as well as to establishing new connections among them. A class of
(q-hypergeometric functions is determined by a choice of a simple Lie algebra
and a number called central charge or level. The theory of hypergeometric
functions is better developed when the Lie algebra is sl2 and the level is not
critical. The limit when the level tends to its critical value is the theory of
the Bethe ansatz method in quantum integrable systems. The goal of the proposal
is to develop the theory of (q-)hypergeometric functions for higher rank Lie
algebras and the associated Bethe ansatz method with applications to
representation theory, CFT, and statistical mechanics
