9419617 Springer Evolutionary relationships among orders and families of
marsupials (eg. koalas, kangaroos, opossums) have been studied by
paleontologists, anatomists, physiologists and biochemists. However, a number of
questions remain answered including relationships between Australian and
American taxa. Proposed for study are DNA sequences from two mitochondrial genes
that code for ribosomal RNAs. The study will evaluate the usefulness of
molecular vs. anatomical data in deciphering evolutionary relationships.
Molecular data will also be used to estimate divergence times among marsupial
lineages. These divergence times will be evaluated in the context of what is
known about sea level change and the movement of continental plates in the
geologic past to develop a zoogeographic hypothesis for the early evolution of
marsupials. The database of DNA sequences generated in this study, in
conjunction with sequences that are already available for placental mammals (eg.
rodents, primates, whales, seals) , will allow for detailed study of the
evolution of ribosomal RNA genes in mammals.
