Mesoscale phenomena in physical and biological systems assume prominence when
an intermediate length or time scale is required to assess gross system behavior
or when the finer active scales cannot be directly interrogated. These systems
are frequently metastable. Two broad areas for investigation have been
identified directly from potential application: texture development dependent on
interfacial properties of polycrystals and diffusion mediated transport with
application to ensembles of molecular motors. A central materials science
problem is to engineer a microstructure to attain a desired set of
characteristics. The group of the investigator has discovered a new
characterization of material texture, the description of a polycrystal in terms
of its geometry and crystallography, called the grain boundary character
distribution, which is found to be correlated to interfacial energy. A main
objective of this project is to explain this characterization employing large
scale simulation and analysis and stochastic analysis. Geometric coarsening is
also studied. The goal of the second part of the project is to develop
appropriate modeling and analytical methods to understand how molecular motors
function in various circumstances, and in particular, to examine various
transformation pathways and transduction scenarios. This involves mass transport
theory among other new directions in nonlinear analysis. Understanding the
predictive character of large scale simulations of metastable systems used to
interrogate and model physical and biological systems is an emerging fundamental
challenge for mathematical/computational science. It is a coarse graining or
upscaling question at the informational level. The goal of this project is to
address this challenge.

This project has two related parts. Most engineered materials arise as
polycrystalline microstructures, composed of a myriad of small crystallites,
called grains, separated by interfaces, called grain boundaries. The energetics
and connectivity of this network of boundaries are implicated in many properties
across all scales of use, from nanoscale medicine and electronics to aircraft
structures. A new characterization of material texture is now available, the
grain boundary character distribution, discovered very recently in the group of
the investigator. It is as if each material leaves a unique footprint in the
microscope. A project objective is to explain this distribution by simulation
and innovative mathematical analysis in order to provide materials engineers
with a predictive tool. Eukaryotic intracellular traffic owes to a network of
molecular motors moving on cytoskeletal or actin filaments. This is the second
part. The ability to successfully transduce chemical energy to motion owes to
functional elements and relations in the system. These are modeled and analyzed.
The opportunity to discover the interplay between chemistry and mechanics and to
elaborate the implications of metastability could not offer a more exciting
venue.
