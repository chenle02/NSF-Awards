Boiling heat transfer provides the highest heat transfer rates of any mode of
heat transfer. To keep up with new applications, there is a need to find ways
and means of increasing the heat transfer rates that can be accommodates by
boiling. The investigation sets forth an attempt to enhance boiling. The basic
idea is to boil in a foam; the underlying principle being to keep the surface
wet with a liquid film of minimum thickness. Thin films have, in the past, been
shown to yield increased boiling heat transfer. The research will be directed to
a proof of concept.
