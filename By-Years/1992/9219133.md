Support is being provided for the Eleventh Dissertations Symposium on Chemical
Oceanography (DISCO) to be held March 29-April 2, 1993 at the East-West Center,
University of Hawaii Campus, Honolulu, Hawaii. For five days twenty-six chemical
oceanography candidates will meet informal and informal sessions to present
their dissertations, to broaden their perspectives in the field, and to
participate in working groups to develop recommendations concerning chemical
oceanography research and education. In turn, they will be informed of the
research climate and opportunities for support by the federal agency sponsors.
The proceedings will be published. This will be the eleventh in a very
successful series of symposia supported by the National Science Foundation
(NSF), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).
