The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science will develop "Mystery Solved," a
1500-sq. foot traveling mathematics exhibition with companion take-home
materials. Two copies will be made of the traveling exhibit: one for the eleven
members of the North Carolina Grassroots Science Museums Collaborative reaching
over 500,000 visitors, and a second for travel nationally to nine science
centers reaching an estimated 750,000 additional visitors. A take-home packet
will be developed for visitors to continue informal mathematics explorations at
home. The activities included therein will expand and extend the exhibit themes,
offering multiple levels to meet the needs of K-5 students and their
families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
