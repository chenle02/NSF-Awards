This project will comprehensively investigate the variation of radiation emitted
from supermassive black holes that are actively accreting matter. Almost all
galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole at their centers, and their active
galactic nuclei (AGN) emit an enormous amount of energy, which can surpass that
of all the stars in the galaxy. AGN radiation is varying over time, and this
variability is random or stochastic, which encodes important AGN accretion
physics. The team will analyze the dataset from two surveys: the All-Sky
Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). The combined datasets will allow the team to study AGN
variability in the optical band from minutes to decade time scales, spanning
five orders of magnitude in frequency. The AGN sample of this project is
approaching 10,000, significantly larger than previous studies. Combining with
other surveys in the X-ray band, the team will measure the correlated
variability characteristics of AGN between optical and X-ray bands. The team
will also train a graduate student and several undergraduate students. In
addition, the team will further enrich a portable planetarium program for K-12
schools in central Oklahoma. These activities will impact 1,200 K-12 students
annually, engage participants of the proposed educational programs in quality
learning experiences that strengthen their STEM content knowledge, and inspire
the next generation of students to pursue and excel in STEM careers.

ASAS-SN is a network of small telescopes distributed around the globe to provide
daily, all-sky monitoring of celestial objects brighter than 18th magnitude.
ASAS-SN has accumulated 10 years of monitoring data, and this enables AGN
variability studies in the optical band for a large sample of bright AGN. These
bright AGN will also be monitored from space by TESS in short time-scales with
10â€“30 minute cadences. The combined ASAS-SN and TESS data will allow AGN optical
variability study in five orders of magnitude in the frequency space, probing
minute to decade timescales. The combination of ASAS-SN, TESS, Swift, and RXTE
surveys provide a unique data set to jointly study optical and X-ray variability
of bright AGN.

This project is jointly funded by MPS/Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST)
and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
