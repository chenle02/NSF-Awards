This award is one of a group of three in support of the research program at the
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland (BIMA) millimeter wave interferometer. A consortium
of three major universities, the University of California at Berkeley, the
University of Illinois, and the University of Maryland have pooled their
resources, both financial and human, to develop an outstanding astronomical
facility, clearly a world leader in millimeter wave interferometry. The program
funded here will utilize the existing three-element aray as it is expanded to
nine telescopes. Investigations will study objects ranging from our sun and
planets in our solar system to distant galaxies. The instrument and software
reduction packages will also be made available to users outside the BIMA
consortium.
