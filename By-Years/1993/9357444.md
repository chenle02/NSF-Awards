9357444 Hsu This is a New Young Investigator Award for materials physics
research focusing on problems at the mesoscopic scale (0.01 - 1 m). The project
will investigate how changes at this length scale affect macroscopic behavior of
a system. Of particular interest is the dependence of optical and electronic
properties on structure variations (such as order and disorder) and nearby
defects. The research will employ scanning surface microscopies, particularly
the near-field scanning optical microscope. The information is of fundamental
importance and has technical relevance in the context of ultrasmall electronic
devices. %%% This is a New Young Investigator Award for materials physics
problems at the mesoscopic scale (0.01 - 1 m), that is at the scale where the
physical dimensions of the system become similar to the quantum size or
wavelength of atomic substituents, particularly electrons. The project will
investigate how changes at this length scale affect macroscopic, large-scale
behavior, such as the optical and resistivity properties of the particles. Of
particular interest is the dependence of optical and electronic properties on
structure variations (such as order and disorder) and nearby defects. The
research will employ scanning surface microscopies, particularly the near-field
scanning optical microscope. The information is of fundamental importance and
