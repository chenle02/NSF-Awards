This award will provide travel funding for participants of the Workshop on
Synthesis of Transient Climate Evolution of the last 21-kyr (SynTraCE-2). Newly
developed CCSM3 simulations will be used as a base for a data synthesis and
model comparison workshop that will focus on critical themes in tropical
paleohydrology, global deglacial temperature change, and coupled climate-
vegetation changes during the last 21,000 years. The workshop will feature group
discussion and working group activities that will develop the critical themes
into targeted questions that can be answered through data synthesis and model
comparison, and developing clear strategies for addressing those questions.

This workshop will bring the community together to chart a path towards
addressing some of the most important topics in paleoclimate in the last 21,000
years. Attention will be paid to ensure participation and attendance by
underrepresented groups.
