The project funds attendance of US-based graduate students to the doctoral
consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(IJCAI). The goals of doctoral consortium are for students to discuss research,
have an opportunity to talk about their research, build professional connections
with other researchers, and receive individual mentoring from a senior member of
the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the project will be
assessed with pre- and post-surveys administered to the students. Special
efforts will be made to select students from underrepresented groups and from
smaller groups who have fewer opportunities to interact with international
researchers. Participation will help graduate students network with other
researchers, and develop into global scientists. In the longer term, this will
help advance science and high-tech industry.
