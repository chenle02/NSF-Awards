The computer of tomorrow will be a fault tolerant network in which
communication is a fully integrated function equal in significance to storage
and processing. In such a network, challenging problems arise from the need to
maintain consistency of the data and of processing. These problems are currently
solved using agreement protocols that require many message frames to be
exchanged with adverse effects on network performance. The approach of this
research to maintaining consistency is based on two novel protocols. The Trans
protocol provides efficient reliable broadcast or multicast communication. The
Total protocol promptly places a total order on message frames and achieves
distributed agreement in the presence of communication faults and of fail-stop,
timing, omission, and Byzantine processor faults. The Trans and Total protocols
are intended to be used in local area networks such as Ethernet, token ring or
FDDI ring. By exploiting the inherent broadcast characteristics of the physical
communication medium, substantial improvements in performance can be achieved.
The design of fault-tolerant networks is greatly simplified when consistency
between distributed components of the network is maintained by the communication
function.
