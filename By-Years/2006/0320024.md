This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at the
demonstration of a&lt;br/&gt;compact, Watt-level, single frequency fiber laser
operating around 1550 nm. The laser will take advantage of proprietary, highly
Yb: Er co-doped fiber allowing the total length of the fiber-laser cavity to
less than 5 cm - a task impossible with conventional fiber approaches. Such a
short cavity length is uniquely suited for extremely stable and mode hop free
single frequency operation. High doping levels and a large optical mode field
diameter will be used in order to reduce the influence of fiber non-linearities
and allow for a short and compact linear cavity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high
power and near ideal spectral (spatial output) at an eye-safe wavelength, where
Er-doped fiber amplifiers and other fiber-optic components would be readily
available. This would make such a laser very attractive for many commercial
applications including coherent LADAR, distributed temperature and pressure
sensing and frequency conversion. The project should ultimately result in a
marketable product that will be used in a variety of civil and military
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
