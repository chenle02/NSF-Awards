The University of Illinois research efforts support the Center for e-Design?s
long-term goal of developing a new design paradigm. The specific focus areas
include: 1) business-based design methods, 2) optimization of corporate product
delivery processes, 3) industry-based design education and training, 4) robotics
and human-automation interaction, and 5) design for sustainability. This site
addition strengthens the presence of the Center and increases its capability for
achieving the following results: 1) inclusion of a multi-disciplinary viewpoint
needed to ensure the development of a new paradigm of excellence in the design
of engineered products and/or systems; 2) realization of conceptual modeling
tools aimed at reducing design cycle time and ensuring maximum achievement of
design goals for human use; 3) realization of an environment for economic and
supply chain design optimization; 4) establishment of a critical mass of
expertise focused on the development of an e-Design modeling and simulation
software platform and virtual prototyping tools, as well as strategies for
achieving simulation based acquisition.

The proposed effort will contribute to the development and preparation of
graduate and undergraduate students across both engineering and business
colleges. Results of this research effort will be integrated into the
educational curriculum to enrich the student learning experiences in strategic
business-based design, modeling and simulation, decision analysis, and industry-
based design courses. Students associated with the Center for e-Design will
receive career development opportunities, that include laboratory and field
studies, attendance and presentations at interdisciplinary conferences and
workshops, and participation in interdisciplinary activities and journal
publications. The addition of the University of Illinois to the Center
contributes to the diversity of the Center with the leadership team and several
participating faculty being women. The PI and other U of I faculty will
emphasize recruitment of women and minority graduate and undergraduate students.
Research and educational findings will be disseminated nationally and through
industrial collaboration and technology transfer.
