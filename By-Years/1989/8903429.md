Trellis-coded modulation (TCM) has proved to be very effective as a modulation
technique for bandwidth-efficient communication. Higher data rates over a given
channel are obtainable using this technique. Typically, the decoders for this
modulation format are Viterbi decoders, which perform a maximum-likelihood
sequence estimation upon soft-decision data extracted from the received signal.
The complexity of the Viterbi decoders grows exponentially with code constraint
length, thus limiting practical operation to moderate coding gains and decoding
speeds. The sequential decoding technique gives a performance which is
independent of code constraint length thereby permitting the use of longer codes
to obtain a greater coding gain. This project is concerned with: 1. The
selection of an appropriate sequential decoding algorithm for use with trellis-
coed modulation. 2. The performance evaluation of sequential decoding, using
both analytical and simulation techniques when used with trellis-coded
modulation. 3. The construction of good long-constraint-length trellis codes for
use with sequential decoding.
