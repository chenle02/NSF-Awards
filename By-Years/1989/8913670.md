Funds are requested for the development of an image acquisition and processing
system for spatial analysis of vegetation. This instrumentation will be used in
the fields of environmental science and plant ecology. Specifically, this
equipment will be used to study vegetation changes in the Sevilleta. The
inability to cheaply collect five resolution data over large areas has
restricted the use of this data in ecological studies. If developed, several
proposed projects would greatly benefit from the new equipment.
