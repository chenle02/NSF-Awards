Long-term investments in large equity markets are of fundamental importance to a
wide range of investors including pension funds, mutual funds, and university
endowments. This research supports their decision making by deepening the
understanding of such investments within the mathematical framework of
Stochastic Portfolio Theory. The project advances the transfer of ideas,
techniques, and tools between mathematical finance and areas such as interacting
particle systems, mean-field analysis, and extreme value statistics. A diverse
group of postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students benefits from the
activities organized through this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
focuses on long-term investing in high-dimensional markets through the analysis
of explicit, tractable models of open markets. An open market is one where the
set of available assets varies over time. The recently developed hybrid and rank
Jacobi models take center stage. These models can be viewed as rank-based
interacting particle systems with values in the standard simplex, and are
extremely tractable and amenable to detailed analysis. The research is concerned
with a number of interdependent problems, including parameter estimation, mean-
field analysis of representative particle dynamics, markets of infinite size,
upper edge asymptotics of the capital distribution curve, and propagation of
chaos for the upper order statistics. The tractable setup allows for a more
detailed understanding than that afforded by less specific frameworks. In
addition to being of intrinsic interest, the mathematical and financial insights
generated through this analysis are transferable to more general situations by
means of a model uncertainty and robustness analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
