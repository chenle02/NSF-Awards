9531187 Marder Using both analytical and numerical methods, this grant will
study the connection between the interatomic forces and the behavior of
materials during brittle fracture. Some questions to be asked are: "How does
fracture occur on the atomic scale?" "When do the cracks propagate in a stable
manner and when do the instabilities set in?" "What sorts of interatomic forces
lead to brittle, or to ductile materials?" "What are the effects of thermal
fluctuations upon fracture?" "What are the differences between fracture of
amorphous and crystalline materials?" The proposed program of research also
contains a strong collaboration with experiments. %%% In spite of more than
sixty years of development in the modern understanding of materials, very little
is known about the atomic nature of the strength of materials or how they fail
under stress. This grant plans to develop an atom- level understanding of the
mechanical properties, especially the ones related to failure. What are the
atoms doing when a material fractures? On an atomic level, how is brittle
fracture different from ductile fracture? What are the atoms doing when a glass
fractures, and when a metal fractures? ***
