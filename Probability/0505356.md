The aim of this proposal is to investigate a class of problems on the borderline
between probability and mathematical physics. Altogether ten specific projects
are proposed which can be grouped into four categories. The first category deals
with problems of first-order phase transitions. Here the specific objects of
study include proofs of phase transitions by comparison to mean-field theory,
influence of dilution on symmetry breaking in antiferromagnets, and various
effects accompanying phase transitions in systems with continuous spins. The
second category is focused on droplet and interface phenomena. The corresponding
projects include a study of relaxation to equilibrium in solvent-solute systems
and the mesoscopic concept of pressure in systems at phase coexistence. The
third category of projects deals with problems related to conformal invariance
in 2D critical models. Here the fractal properties of the so-called SLE
boundaries will be investigated and a model of random fractal trees will be
analyzed. The final category involves problems of small-world phenomena. The
specific problem of interest here is the growth of the graph distance in a
critical model of Euclidean-based random graphs.

On a broader level, the proposal hopes to address a series of questions that all
have their origin in physics, chemistry, engineering and/or social sciences. A
particular attention will be paid to the phenomena of phase transitions in which
the overall character of the system undergoes a sudden, and often rather
drastic, change while the external conditions vary smoothly through a
particular, transitional, value. Examples of such transitions are ample in
physical sciences (e.g., freezing or melting in physical chemistry) and
engineering (e.g., jams in internet traffic); but they also have their natural
counterparts in social sciences (e.g., opinion spreading in social networks).
Much of this proposal is spent on studying very specific mathematical problems
of these types. For instance, one of the proposed projects deals with the
appearance of magnetism in transition-metal compounds, another offers to shed
some light on the theoretical aspects of brine-pocket formation in the sea ice,
yet another project is devoted to the "degree of separation" of two individuals
(or computer servers) in a thinly connected (communication) network. The common
ground of several of these problems is the need of proper mathematical tools for
their successful resolution. One of the goals of the present proposal is to
develop such tools and disseminate their main ideas to the scientific community
at large.
