9531745 Wobbe Turnip crinkle virus, a plant pathogen, has been shown to require
two small proteins for movement and systemic infection in plants.
Characterization of the proteins will be continued by site-directed mutagensis
coupled with functional characterization of such mutants. Deletion analysis will
be used to determine regions of the protein which are necessary for nucleic acid
binding and cooperatively. An attempt will be made to separate the two
functional domains. Work will also continue with the TCV mutant which does not
induce the hypersensitive response in certain plants although it replicates and
spreads as does wildtype. %%% Plant viruses are among the best defined plant
pathogens; they have small genomes and are easily genetically manipulated. The
question of how they move through the plant in the course of systemic infection
is important to understand and this work should add to our knowledge of that
process. ***
