This project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, is a combined experiment-theory study of the reaction
kinetics of unimolecular decomposition of chemically activated hydrohaloalkanes
in the gas phase. Unimolecular rate constants, branching ratios, and the H/D
kinetic isotope effect will be determined to test a novel 1,2-halogen
interchange mechanism proposed by the investigators. The experimental work will
be complemented by ab initio and density functional theory calculations.
Thirteen systems will be investigated to investigate specific questions about
the proposed novel isomerization mechanism. The laboratory research will be done
principally by undergraduate students. These students will gain valuable
experience in research planning and execution and will thus be prepared for
advanced graduate studies or employment in industry or government laboratories.
