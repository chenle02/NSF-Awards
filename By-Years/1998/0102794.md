This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science
and Engineering" (NSF-00-119). The resulting grant is co-funded by the Divisions
of Materials Research and Mathematical Sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructures such as quantum dots and quantum wires can
be employed to yield devices with novel electronic properties. One particularly
promising route to quantum dot formation is via the spontaneous self-assembly
process that occurs during heteroepitaxy. To control the quantum dot formation
and self-assembly process to the extent that these novel electronic devices
become a reality, this team of researchers will investigate the mechanisms of
dot formation, and develop predictive models of the dot formation and self-
organization process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving this goal requires an
integrated interdisciplinary effort that can address the quantum dot formation
and self-assembly process from the atomistic to the continuum or nanometer
length scales. The work of this group will thus involve, for example, first-
principle calculations of surface energies and surface diffusion coefficients,
calculations of the evolution of quantum dot shape and composition during
deposition, and the nonlinear dynamics of pattern formation or self-assembly of
quantum dots. Each effort will feed into the other, as the information at the
smaller length scales will be employed in the larger scale calculations,
enabling us to bridge length scales that range from the fraction of a nanometer
to thousands of nanometers. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop an
understanding of the important materials issues governing formation and self-
assembly of quantum dots, and to develop predictive models that enable the
first-principles design of quantum dot nanostructures. The models can then be
used to design and create specific quantum dot structures, providing for
possible breakthroughs in the fabrication of new quantum dot electronic
devices.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
