9311811 Pullin An investigation will be carried out of the relation between
small scale vortex structures and the large scale energy containing eddies
typical of turbulence. A model of this relationship has been developed and is to
be extended and applied. The approach is through small scale vortices which can
be re-oriented, stretched, or compressed driven by the distortions of the large
scale motion. A Large Eddy Simulation model results from this approach. It will
be tested against Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent channel flow. This
research is an attempt to use the known deterministic governing equations as a
basis for turbulence models, rather than ad hoc closure assumptions. This can
lead to a more reliable turbulent flow modeling capability with greater range of
applicability. ***
