The purpose of this project is to extend existing knowledge in the field of
network traffic modeling in two ways. One objective is to develop approximation
and bounding techniques that will provide first-order estimates of the
performance of deterministic servers under arrival process having long-range
dependence. This effort will build upon both our previous work in developing
approximate solutions for closed queuing networks having analytically
intractable service distributions and the more recent work of Norros which
characterized the behavior of a system having a self-similar arrival process and
a constant service rate.
