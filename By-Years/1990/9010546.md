This work will use genetic algorithms to solve two classes of optimization
problems related to neural networks: (1) the optimization of weights in
recurrent and feed forward neural networks and (2) the optimization of the
connectivity of neural networks. To establish a challenging criteria for
measuring success, it will build and test large networks for radar signal pulse
detection. The use of genetic algorithms for defining neural network
connectivity has emerged as an area of research only in the last year. A genetic
algorithm has been used to fefine network connectivities for small problems,
producing nets which learn much faster than standard "fully-connected" nets and
which are suprisingly consistent in the number of data presentations required
for learning. This work will extend the current approach by combining the
genetic algorithm code for weight optimization with a variation on our current
approach to optimizing the connectivity. This combination should allow
optimization of connectivity and weights simultaneously on large problems.
Finally, the successful optimization of feed forward networks using genetic
algorithms is significant because these algorithms make no assumptions about how
the weights (parameters) that the genetic algorithm is asked to evaluate are
actually used. It should be possible to applied the genetic algorithms directly
to recurrent network optimization problems which tend to have restrictive
storage and computational requirements when trained with true gradient descent
learning techniques.
