The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to
lower costs for injection molding, a common method of manufacturing plastic
goods. Unfortunately, injection molding can be a lengthy and wasteful process
because molds are designed, machined from metal, and then shipped to an
injection molder. The proposed project will develop new tooling for low-volume
injection molding applications at strengths and resolutions comparable with
machined aluminum at a fraction of the current cost and lead time, providing
extra resilience to the supply chain. This will be used for applications in
industries across automotive, aerospace, consumer product goods, and medical
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Phase II SBIR will apply advancements in 3D
printing of fiber-reinforced photopolymers to the injection molding application.
This project will apply advancements in fiber-filled photopolymers (such as
ceramic and polymer particle reinforced resins) in combination with magnetically
aligned structures to injection mold tools. Tooling inserts will be tested
across the most common and challenging injection molding
plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
