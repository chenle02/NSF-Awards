9619062 Wagreich The Chicago Secondary Mathematics Improvement Project is
designed to help Chicago Schools: * implement Chicago's new graduation
requirement of three years of high school level mathematics; * provide a quality
mathematics education for all students; and * align curriculum and teaching
practices with city, state and national goals and assessment practices. The
vehicle for attaining these goals is the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) -
the first of five NSF supported high school comprehensive mathematics curriculum
projects to be completed. The proposed project will provide a broad professional
development program for teachers who work in schools that have elected to
implement the IMP curriculum. The project will work with 200 teachers in
approximately 15 Chicago public high schools over three years to assist schools
with IMP implementation. Spring and summer workshops and in-school support
during the academic year are essential components of the project. The
development of teacher leadership and a plan for providing long-term support
beyond the funding period of the grant are also included. The project is
grounded in the experience and practice of three years of successful, NSF-
supported pilot IMP implementation in Chicago and builds upon on work that began
in 1990 as part of the College Preparatory Mathematics Program, a project that
with partial NSF support, led to increases in student achievement and
persistence in mathematics for African American and Hispanic students in
Chicago.
