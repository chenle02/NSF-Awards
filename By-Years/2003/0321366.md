With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Occidental College will acquire a 300 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
NMR studies of biomembranes; b) palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution
reactions on unsaturated cyanohydrins; c) studies of the redox thermodynamics of
the CuA domain of Thermus Thermophilus Cytochrome ba3; and d) studies on
quinones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of
areas, including Biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
