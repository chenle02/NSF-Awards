9450974 Rennels The goal of this project is to enhance the capability of the
Manufacturing Technology Quality Control Laboratory. This facility is utilized
by undergraduate technology students to investigate the various types of
dimensional metrology instruments and nondestructive testing techniques which
are used in industrial quality control. This project expands the capability of
the laboratory by providing geometric measuring capability in addition to the
present linear measuring instruments. The equipment requested includes
instruments to determine both circular and linear geometries with contact-type
instruments which are currently not available. The equipment will allow the
development of a new course in advanced metrology. Also, this proposal requests
funds for instruments which will expand the nondestructive testing capability of
the laboratory through the acquisition of equipment currently not available and
which will supplement the current instruments.
