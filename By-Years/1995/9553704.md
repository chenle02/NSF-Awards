02115-5998 Advanced Technological Education Title: Mathematics for Technology -
Laboratory Investigations Mathematics faculty at Wentworth Institute of
Technology have been employing active learning strategies characteristic of the
calculus reform movement at all levels of mathematics courses for students of
engineering technology since 1989. This student population is motivated
primarily by perceived relevance of subject matter to specific technical
problems. We propose to develop, through joint efforts of mathematics and
technical faculty, laboratory investigations using engineering laboratories and
multi-media simulations that will illustrate and teach mathematical concepts.
The project will begin at the intermediate algebra/trigonometry level and
continue through calculus. 50 sections per year, containing 1500 students, will
be affected at Wentworth. Through an existing network of Tech Prep consortia,
Wentworth will take the lead in extending the secondary level "integrated
curriculum" reforms of Tech Prep to the college level. Collaboration among
faculty from Wentworth and neighboring colleges and secondary schools involved
in Tech Prep, as well as selected industry personnel, will result in a series of
workshops and minicourses to disseminate materials and methods developed at
Wentworth to mathematics teachers at New England area institutions, affecting a
potential 25,000 Tech Prep students. The Wentworth project will serve as a
national model for colleges of engineering technology in integrating the
learning of mathematics with technical applications. Through the American
Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the American Mathematical
Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), a potential 100,000 additional
students ma y ultimately be affected.
