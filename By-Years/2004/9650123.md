The Physics Department is undergoing a major improvement of its Modern Physics
Laboratory Course. This course is a student's first exposure to independent
experimental work, and gives students the initial tools and experiences
necessary to competently execute future independent work, including honors
projects, summer internships at National Labs, and technology jobs in the
industrial sector. Improvement of the lab can be realized by the development of
four permanent computer stations for the measurement, control, and analysis of
nonlinear systems. A sequence of four new modern physics experiments is being
developed (bouncing ball, string vibrations, double scroll circuit, and
capillary ripples) to provide students with an experimental knowledge of the
rudiments of low-dimensional, nonlinear time-series analysis (also known as
chaos theory), as well as the rudiments (at the level of the quadratic map) of
the theory of nonlinear systems. Participants are developing a nonlinear signal
analyzer using LabViewlHiQ, which assists students in their exploration of
experimental nonlinear systems. This nonlinear signal analyzer can be
distributed over the Internet to other students and instructors wishing to build
on this project. The hope is that students_enchanted by both the complexity and
comprehensibility of these everyday nonlinear phenomena (bouncing balls,
strings, and ripples)_will want to pursue additional scientific studies of their
own based on the confidence and competence resulting from these labs.
