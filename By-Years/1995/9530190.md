9530190 Nguyen This program extends the frequency of oscillation for
micromechanical resonators to the VHF, UHF and S bands for application in
wireless communication networks. Investigations will be conducted into material
properties, mechanical design, circuit modeling, transducer design, fabrication,
and electrical evaluation of the resonators. In order to extend the range of
frequencies the resonators require nano-scale electrode-to-resonator gaps. This
research will examine the influence of scaling on thermal and phase noise, the
need to integrate peripheral circuits on the same substrate as the resonators,
new design methodologies and a study of the performance parameters including
reliability considerations. In particular, the research will focus on those loss
mechanisms which limit the achievable quality factor, Q, of high frequency
micromechanical resonators. the ultimate objective of this research is to
realize single-chip transceivers based upon microelectromechanical (MEMS) signal
processors. ***
