The PI proposes to investigate the properties and applications of various models
for random simplicial complexes. These objects are closely related to random
graphs which have been of interest in mathematics for over fifty years, and have
been widely used in computer science and engineering for the modeling of various
networks and the internet. Viewing a graph as a one-dimensional simplicial
complex, it is natural to investigate random simplicial complexes of higher
dimension. In addition to basic algebraic, combinatorial, and topological
properties of these objects, the PI will study a number of related objects of
potential interest in applications such as robotics, including random
configuration spaces and moment-angle complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory
of random graphs is a rapidly growing branch of discrete mathematics, bringing
together ideas from graph theory, combinatorics, and probability theory. Random
graphs have found use in computer science, engineering, physics, biology,
chemistry, and the social sciences. These objects also serve within mathematics
as accessible models for other, more complex random structures. Random
simplicial complexes provide such a structure, one that will combine techniques
and ideas from algebra and topology with those from the aforementioned fields.
