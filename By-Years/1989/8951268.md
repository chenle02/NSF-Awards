This grant supports the development of an undergraduate parallel processing
laboratory based on the INMOS T800 transputer chip. This lab consists of three
IBM PC/AT compatible microcomputers, one containing a reconfigurable 16-node
Transputer network and the others containing Transputer software development
nodes. The laboratory is not dedicated to a specific course, but is used to
illustrate applications of concurency where it naturally arises throughout the
computer science curriculum. This project significantly enhances the
undergraduate computer science program by providing the practical reinforcement
necessary to fully understand parallelism. The institution is providing matching
funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the
Foundation.
