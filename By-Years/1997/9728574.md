9728574 Gannon Afferent Regulation of Circadian Rhythms Most, if not all, living
organisms synchronize the daily activity with the day-night cycle of an earth
day. This synchronization is accomplished in higher-order organisms, such as
mammals, by a network of neural cells in a small region of the brain called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus. This neural network forms a "biological clock" that
acts as the dominant time-keeping mechanism in mammals, and ensures that all
physiological body systems are in synchrony. It is now becoming apparent that
the biological clock in mammals does not act independently, but rather the
clock' s timing can be influenced by input from other regions of the brain. This
study seeks to identify how activation of these other brain regions can affect
the timing of the biological clock. The results of this investigation will
likely demonstrate that the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is
part of a larger pacemaker system in the mammalian brain, and that the clock
integrates input from other brain regions before sending out a synchronizing
signal to the body. This study will also significantly enhance the training of
undergraduate students in the sciences, both by the acquisition of new tools
which can be utilized for research and teaching, and by employing undergraduate
students in every aspect of the research performed in accomplishing the
objectives of this proposal.
