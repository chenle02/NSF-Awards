This project will design, implement, and evaluate a system that integrates
planning, execution, and learning in real time. The four main objectives to this
research are: (1) Develop a usable execution monitor that will control plan
execution in real time; (2) Develop the methods to plan directly from episodes
in memory;(3) Automate the acquisition of cases from execution; and (4) Develop
techniques for learning using a weak domain theory. The system's domain is meal
planning and preparation. The system will plan and assist in the preparation of
meals, then incorporate the results of these into its case memory. A central
concern here is to design a system that is efficient enough to operate in real
time. This will be attained in part by placing computational restrictions on
time-critical processes, and in part by using a case-based approach to plan
generation and repair that use episodic representations of previous executions.
The detail in the resultant plans and repairs simplifies both execution
monitoring and case acquisition. Learning is done at noncritical times, and is
done without a strong domain theory by attributing expectation failures to
failures in the assumptions used to generate the expectations.
