The wind-measuring instrument on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere
Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, TIDI, samples about 15 longitudes per
day at 4 distinct local times between 50 S and 50 N. This observing pattern
allows the definition of planetary-scale waves and diurnal tides on a near-daily
basis. The leading objectives of this project are to assimilate TIDI and radar
winds in order to facilitate studies of short-term tidal and planetary wave
evolution. Ground-based and satellite data will be assimilated using the method
of sequential estimation, a technique chosen because of its potential to
optimize wave definitions that retain short-term variations of dynamical
significance. Tidal and planetary wave coefficients for wavenumbers 0-5 will be
disseminated to the TIMED/CEDAR community. It is expected that wide access to
the data in an easily understood form will help to foster collaborative studies
with the modelling community. The results of the proposed work are expected to
maximize the potential of ground and space-based data to sort out the global-
scale versus the local-scale causes of tidal and planetary scale variations that
originate below and within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). These
goals are consistent with CEDAR Phase 3 objectives addressing coupling of the
lower levels to the MLT.
