This 3-year leadership project will enable 2-cohorts of Houston area 8th and
9th grade physical science teachers to attend a Leadership Institute at the
University of Houston- University Park. Each cohort will have 24 teachers. The
Leadership Institutes have a two week summer institute and six Saturday
workshops during the academic year. Each cohort will attend for two years,
overlapping in year -2 of the project. Physics and Chemistry content will be
delivered with discipline appropriate pedagogy. To broaden a teacher's network,
some AY follow-up will occur at a professional meeting of the Texas Science
Teachers' Association. Leader Teachers will give peer-led workshops in their
local and neighboring districts. They will be supported by LEAs, industry and
the senior personnel from the project. The Principal Investigator for the
project is Dr. Hugh T. Hudson. Cost sharing equals 10% of the NSF award.
