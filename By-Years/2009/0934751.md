This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responding to a nationwide concern
about the future of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
education, Towson University and the University System of Maryland are working
to increase the number of new STEM teachers, and to decrease the rate at which
new STEM teachers leave the teaching profession after just a few years. Towson
University's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is designed to address
both issues. The program is recruiting prospective teachers and awarding
scholarships to 20 select juniors and seniors who are majoring in STEM fields
and who intend to become K-12 teachers. In addition, the program is awarding
stipends to 10 STEM professionals who are seeking to become certified to teach
in the STEM disciplines. The program is designed to attract high caliber
students whose financial needs might otherwise prohibit their entry into teacher
preparation. Noyce scholars are being prepared to teach either middle school or
high school in the areas of mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and earth-
space science. Program funds are being used for recruitment activities, summer
programs, induction activities and monitoring/evaluation. The selection of
scholarship and stipend recipients is targeting those students who are most
likely to succeed in the academic program and to flourish and, therefore, remain
in a teaching career. This project is a collaborative effort of Towson
University's College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Education, in
partnership with Baltimore City Community College and the Baltimore City Public
School System.
