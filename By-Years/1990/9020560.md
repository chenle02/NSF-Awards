This award will support the construction of a prototype instrument for real-time
adaptive compensation of atmospherically induced wavefront distortion. Optimized
for low-order corrections on a 4-m class telescope, the instrument is expected
to produce images with an angular resolution close to the diffraction limit in
the near infrared under average seeing conditions, and occasionally in the
visible under good seeing conditions. It will require a reference star brighter
than mag 17 within a typically one arc-minute field of view to sense the
wavefront errors allowing compensation to be achieved over most of the sky. The
instrument is based on the novel concept of curvature sensing and compensation
and will use an array of 13 photon counting avalanche photodiodes to sense the
wavefront. The goal of this instrument is to demonstrate that such a performance
can be achieved and to serve as a basis for the development of adaptive optics
on existing and future ground- based telescopes. It will provide an angular
resolution comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope with a larger
collecting power, and therefore will have a considerable impact on almost every
field in astronomy especially for narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic
observations.
