9351380 Hayes The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst is increasing the number of students taught in the
innovative mainstream calculus course, Calculus in a Real and Complex World. The
basic philosophy of this course, which was developed with NSF support, is to
introduce the students to calculus as an experimental science using the computer
algebra system (CAS) Mathematica. The computer enables the student to solve real
and engaging problems. An estimated 600 students per semester will be taught in
this alternative course, which is about half the students who now take the
traditional course. ***
