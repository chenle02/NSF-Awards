Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will analyze and publish data that has been
collected over a three year period on an NSF project to improve meteorological
measurements from ships and buoys. The goal of this WOCE long-lead time
development program was to improve the accuracy, reliability and availability of
meteorological and air-sea flux measurements made over extended time periods
from ships and buoys. A major focus of the program was to improve the sensors
used for these measurements, evaluate their accuracy, and reduce errors in
making those measurements. Improved sensors have resulted for barometric
pressure, precipitation, humidity, incoming longwave radiation, air temperature,
sea temperature and wind speed and direction. Analyzing and publishing this
long-term sensor data will provide the research community with a full
description of sensor performance for various models available for use at sea.
Additionally, IMET system software and hardware will be documented for purposes
of technology transfer to commercial vendors and the research community.
