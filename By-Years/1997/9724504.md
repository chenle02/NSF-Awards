Abstract We propose to acquire state-of-the-art confocal microscopy & imaging
equipment to upgrade a well-established confocal laser scanning microscopy
institutional core facility. This facility is available to all Mount Sinai
School of Medicine investigators and serves diverse research programs at Mount
Sinai School of Medicine. This equipment would replace existing outdated
existing equipment. In particular, there is a need for multi-channel (> 3
channels) confocal detection, UV confocal capability, and the ability to
maintain living cells over long periods of time for confocal observations. The
proposed equipment includes: 1) a Leica TCS-NT (UV) confocal laser scanning
microscope (with 5 channels for multi-channel labeling) and UV capability; 2) an
Apple PowerMacintosh computer for off-line image analysis and figure
preparation; 3) Bioptics and 4) a Codonics dye sublimation printer to print
photographic quality color images obtained from the confocal microscope.
