This research, carried out by one of the worlds leading observational
astronomers, is aimed at increasing our detailed knowledge of the more distant
parts of the universe. It consists of four parts. The first is a survey of very
distant clusters of galaxies, utilizing a powerful instrument developed by the
principal investigator, to obtain a statistically complete sample of clusters
with redshifts between 0.5 and 1. The second is a study of active galaxies in
distant clusters. These objects appear to become more common as we look at
greater distances. The object of this part of the research is to investigate the
incidence of these objects at greater distances. It is hoped that this will
extend our set of objects with measured redshifts out to a development of the
software package utilized to reduce and analyze the data obtained in the other
parts of this study.
