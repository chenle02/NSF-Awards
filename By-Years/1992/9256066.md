The Southwest Research Institute will initiate a three-week, commuter, Young
Scholars project in applied physical sciences and engineering for 20 students
entering the 11th and 12th grades. This summer and academic year program will
emphasize computer skills applied to research on electronic circuit design.
Students will conduct research at the Institute throughout the year. They will
build a digital clock from schematics, create computer programs to solve
equations, and observe and discuss research methods and ethics.
