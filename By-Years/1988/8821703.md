Professor Tantaratana will develop detection strategies such that their
performance and cost fall between two widely used detectionstrategies--fixed
sample size test (FSS) and the sequential probability ratio test. The FSS does
not perform as well as the sequential test, but has the advantage of having a
fixed amount of computation per decision. The sequential test, which does not
use a fixed sample size and may not even be bounded, performs better but takes
as inordinate amount of time. The research willinclude both parametric and
nonparametric detection situations indeveloping his new detection strategies.
