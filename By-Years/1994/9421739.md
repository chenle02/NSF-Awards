This proposal will further pursue results of the quality factor, or ratio of
wave frequency to damping rate, of MHD waves. In response to these recent
findings regarding the size and wave modes of MHD waves, the PI will: (1) use
numerical methods in investigating 3D nulls to extend the more exact 2D results
obtained so far and bolster the WKB results, (2) quantify the size of the
'packing fraction' in more unequivocal terms, (3) investigate the effective
quality factor for the case of long wavelength excitations and open field
configurations, (4) study effects of finite pressure and thermal conduction, and
(5) question other miscellaneous events, including nonlinear effects, the
quality factor for collisionless systems, and the possible production of
energetic particles.***
