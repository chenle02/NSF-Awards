This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focusses on the detailed mechanisms of corrosion of iron and aluminum
based materials. A variety of surface analytical probes are brought to bear on
the atomic level characterization of corrosion films, especially X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), analytical electron microscopy, and X-ray
diffraction. These methods are used to identify reaction intermediates, and to
suggest mechanisms for corrosion of these materials. The use of valence band
XPS, in combination with electronic structure calculations to identify specific
surface species, provides a unique and very powerful tool for the identification
of intermediates and elucidation of mechanisms in these studies. A better
understanding of corrosion mechanisms and processes is crucial to the mitigation
of corrosion, which is of serious environmental and economic concern. The use of
electron spectroscopic tools to identify and characterize corrosion products and
processes is the focus of this research project. Corrosion of iron and aluminum
based materials is a serious technological problem, impacting the quality of the
civil infrastructure and the environment in many ways. A clear understanding of
the process of corrosion would be very useful in designing strategies for
corrosion inhibition and mitigation.
