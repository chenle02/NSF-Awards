CTS-9512485 Tsapatsis U of Massachusetts A Powder X-ray Diffractometer (PXRD)
will be procured for research in material characterization. The PXRD will have
capabilities for in situ high temperature, controlled environment and thin film
XRD. Uses for the equipment include characterization of synthetic zeolites,
polymeric materials and amphiphilic association structures, as well as
identification of layered silicates and other minerals in geological samples. It
will support various research projects in advanced materials processing and
manufacturing. The PXRD will also be used for training of graduate students.
