This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate an
approach to the creation of database applications that combines the convenience
of user-friendly non-procedural interactive development with the rich
programming power of an object-oriented database (OODB). Successful completion
of this project will put more power in the hands of non-programmers without
limiting the power available to programmers. Non-programmers will be able to
develop their own simple applications and more easily tailor and enhance the
more complex applications developed by programmers. All users will be able to
develop applications more quickly and more reliably than is possible with
currently available tools. Relational databases (RDBs) often include non-
procedural tools such as schema designers, query-by-example, and report
generators that can be used by relatively unsophisticated users to develop
significant applications. Although OODBs are intrinsically more powerful and
more naturally model many real world application domains, to date OODB
application development has required considerable programming ability. The key
idea that underlies our approach is to provide a seamless interface between non-
procedural tools, like those available in RDBs, and a full general-purpose
procedural programming language that when necessary (and only when necessary)
can be used to write parts of an application. Persistent Data Systems' approach
will be guided by a formal semantic model that will contribute to the design of
an easy to learn and use development system that permits continuous incremental
improvement to its set of tools.
