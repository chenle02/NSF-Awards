This project supports the continuing development of a high school science
course that teaches physical science and mathematics using astronomy as its
major focal point. The material is designed for students who would not elect the
traditional science courses, physics and chemistry, during their last years in
high school. The long range goal of the project is to increase enrollment in
high school science courses and improve the understanding of basic scientific
principles by large numbers of students. The curriculum concentrates on a
limited number of fundamental concepts to avoid overwhelming students. Mastery
of these concepts is promoted by addressing the students' misconceived theories
of nature and by emphasizing a wide range of unique hands-on classroom
activities in both astronomical and terrestrial settings. Two modules will be
developed based on the "Laws of Nature" and the "Nature of Light" which will
form the basis of a year-long astronomy course when combined with the previously
developed module on "Where We Are in Space and Time". Interactive computer
programs for building mathematical models and videos for illustrating activities
and showing how scientists use the principles discussed in activities will be
produced. Teachers from a variety of schools across the country will produce and
revise this material. There will be both formative and summative evaluation of
the program using a number of trial sites. The project has entered in a research
and development agreement with Apple Computer. To date, has donated $75,027
worth of equipment. Both Bausch &amp; Lomb and Celestron International have
donated astronomical telescopes and accessories to teacher training workshops
costing in excess of $23,000. The project shows significant potential for
becoming a widespread program allowing for a useful course in which students may
meet a third-year science requirement.
