Theoretical studies are proposed of the excitation of a molecule by an electron
whose incident energy is near the threshold of that excitation. There are
serious discrepancies with experiment, including the observation of unexplained
threshold structures. The full quantum physics of the system enters the
description of these processes. The goal here is the development of a scattering
theory for this domain. There are three main components of the investigation.
(1) Development of parameter-free model polarization/correlation potentials. (2)
Development of new approximate theoretical treatments of the quantum dynamics of
near-threshold collisions. (3) Examination of the discrepancies between existing
theoretical and experimental cross sections for low-energy excitations.
