The Saint Mary's College Biology Department has identified a need to improve and
expand the microscopy in upper division laboratory activities across a wide
range of biological curricula, including genetics, cell biology, molecular
biology, physiology, microbiology, histology, immunology, and student research.
The entire array of objectives can be met by the acquisition of twenty-two high
resolution microscopes and an automatic photomicrography system that are
interchangeable with the research-grade microscopes already available in the
department. The acquisition will allow for maximal student activity in
conducting laboratory exercises which previously have been plagued with a
shortage of high quality microscopes. The exercises in question include a number
of activities focused on genetic, cellular, and microbial phenomena, all of
which yield results that naturally unfold into numerous biological and molecular
concepts for additional discussion.
