This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support research
experiences for eight undergraduate students per year in the area of
computational astrophysics. This is a new Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site which will serve students throughout the US, but will
recruit heavily for regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) in the southeast. The students will have the opportunity to acquire
programming and data management skills while engaging in research projects
related to modeling, simulating, and analysis of data from high-energy
astroparticle physics. Students will also receive extensive professional
development mentoring over the ten-week period of the
summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects available to the students include
studies of core-collapse supernovae, dark matter annihilation, outflows from
active galactic nuclei, neutron stars, and X-ray transients. The focus will be
on the computational modeling of these systems and the connection with
observational data. The professional development experience will include
understanding scientific computation, science communication, scientific writing,
and preparing for careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
