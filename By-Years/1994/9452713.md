9452713 Bersenyi Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology seeks to initiate a four-
week, residential, Young Scholars project in the field of mathematics which will
offer science enrichment activities for 50 precollege students entering grades
9, 10, 11, and 12. The program will combine the summer residential project with
a nine month correspondence component. The program provides an intensive and
focused mathematical experience concentrating on group activities, and on in-
depth, methodical studies of selected mathematical areas, including axiomatic
set theory and combinatorics.
