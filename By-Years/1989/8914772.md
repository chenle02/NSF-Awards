The project undertakes the visit to the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska on March 24, 1989, for the gathering of perishable data on the immediate
and long- term impacts of the oil spill, as well as on the actual emergency
response, management and mitigation actions. Cataloguing the ongoing and ensuing
documentation will be used to identify gaps in reports and in forthcoming
analyses. A multidisciplinary team of researchers will provide the necessary
systematic approach to determine the effectiveness of the decision making and
support systems used to cope with the disaster.
