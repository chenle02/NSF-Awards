The heat-flow/basement depth relation, which favors the simple thermal boundary
layer model, will be tested to determine if it actually is applicable to older
oceanic areas. To document this, heat flow will be documented in the Late
Jurassic ocean floor of western Gulf of Mexico using both heat-flow measurements
acquired during a proposed R/V Gyre cruise and also analyzing the radioactivity
of DSDP 90 and 91 sites to determine the effect of radiogenic heat from 10 km of
sediments on the surface heat flux. Seismic refraction and reflection data will
be used to compute the water-loaded basement and the possible effect of thinner-
than- normal crust on this depth.
