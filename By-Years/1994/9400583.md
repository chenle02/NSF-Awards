9400583 Pickering Technical Narrative: This proposal represents a collaborative
research effort between the Pennsylvania State University (Dr. H. W. Pickering)
and Cairo University (Drs. B. Ateya and B. El- Anadouli). The investigators
intend to study the problems of de-alloying in corrosive environments. The
proposed work involves physical and mathematical modeling and experimental
measurements on de-alloying. Their objective is to understand the mechanism and
details of the various rate processes involved in de-alloying. Project funding
will enable the researchers to work together for one month each year over the
course of this three-year study. This project in materials science fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents and conduct
research in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. The project aims to
provide a much needed insight into the scientific aspects of this universal
corrosion problem which is of common concern to both groups. ***
