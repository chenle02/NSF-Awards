This Science in Developing Countries award will support a workshop in the
Dominican Republic to compare the geology of island arc terranes in central and
northern Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, Jamaica and the eastern Cayman Trough. The
large separations of the various crustal blocks/terranes in this boundary zone
are poorly known, making it difficult to reconstruct the Late Paleogene
configuration of the early arc. An important aspect of the workshop will be to
actually examine the tectonostratigraphic units in the central and northern
Dominican Republic to see if a correlation can be made with similar units in the
Oriente area of Cuba and in Jamaica. If the earlier rocks can be correlated this
will help to understand the magnitude and timing of terrane movements in the
zone. This workshop, organized by Dr. Grenville Draper of Florida International
University, will bring together geologists working in Hispaniola, Jamaica,
Puerto Rico and eastern Cuba to examine and compare the rocks in these areas.
The workshop will focus attention on important tectonic problems and lead to
better planning of a detailed joint project to be carried out in the future. ***
