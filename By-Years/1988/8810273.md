Equipment to complete a three-dimensional ocean wave simulation facility is to
be acquired and utilized in a broadly based research program on ocean wave
dynamics and wave interaction with structures and boundaries. Electronic systems
and controls for the wave generation device will be the focus of this phase of
the ongoing research program.
