CTS-9504178 Ronald W. Rousseau United Engineering Trustees Inc. ABSTRACT This
grant is to support the sixth Engineering Foundation International Conference on
"Advances and Opportunities in Environmental Separations" to be held July 22-27,
1995 at Snowbird, Utah. The focus of the conference will be on the role of
separations in solving environmental problems. The meeting will bring together
engineers and scientists from the separations and thermodynamics communities.
Topics to be discussed include Membrane, Thermodynamics, Supercritical Fluid
Processing, Separations Involving Dilute Solutions, and Colloids and
Surfactants. Case studies of environmental problems and strategic views of
"Separations and the Environment" will also be included in the program. The
conference should stimulate synergistic discussions among participants on topics
important to separations and thermodynamics and the environment.
