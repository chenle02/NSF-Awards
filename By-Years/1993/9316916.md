9316916 Jacobson The Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary aged Chocolate Mountains
thrust is part of a major, extensive fault zone in SE California that places
Precambrian to Mesozoic gneisses over Cretaceous high pressure/low temperature
schists. The transport direction is toward the NE and this has been used to help
reconstruct a large part of the SW Cordillera during Cretaceous times. Recent
work has shown that several sections of this major fault zone, including the
Chocolate Mts. thrust, may have been reactivated and that they therefore may
represent exhumation rather than subduction and burial tectonism. This project
will resolve the controversy by detailed field work with structural and
metamorphic petrology. The results will allow meaningful plate reconstructions
for the Mesozoic to Tertiary in the SW Cordillera, and will have implications
for similar tectonic settings in other major orogenic belts.
