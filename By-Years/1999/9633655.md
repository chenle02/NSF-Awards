OCE 96-33655 Nof The project will apply an analytical approach to the
investigation of eddy formation in the connecting regions between basins. The
approach will allow nonlinear, periodic flows to be integrated over a control
volume in a manner analogous to that used for steady flows. This greatly
simplifies the problem so that important features of the eddies, such as their
size and frequency of generation, can be determined without resolving the
details of the generation process itself. The investigation will initially
consider simplified analytical models, and later proceed to more realistic, two-
layer, numerical modeling. Results are expected to complement ongoing
observational and modeling studies of the Agulhas and Brazil current systems.
