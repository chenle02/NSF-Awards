The Department of Physics places a high value on undergraduate laboratory
experiences. In recent years, the Department of Physics and College of Science
have made strong commitments to expanding the upper-division laboratory courses.
One of the most recent additions to the laboratory course offerings is the
Lasers and Modern Optics course, which features both lecture and laboratory
components. The Lasers and Modern Optics course introduces students to some of
the many optical concepts beyond the simple ray optics and diffraction theory
found in most introductory physics courses. With this project, the authors seek
to enhance the Lasers and Modern Optics course by providing modern equipment for
the students. Because lasers and modern optical techniques are now found in
everyday life, as well as many research areas, this course appeals to a wide
variety of students. Students experienced with lasers and modern optical
techniques have an employment advantage as they begin careers in a world that is
increasing in technological sophistication. The purpose of the project is to
improve present experiments and add several advanced experiments. The new
experiments can elucidate several principles involving nonlinear optics,
acousto-optics, electro-optics, liquid crystals, atomic resonance excitation,
and laser stabilization.
