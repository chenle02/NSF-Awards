This proposal is for partial support of a conference entitled, "Solar System
Plasma Physics: Resolution of Processes in Space and Time." An equal amount of
support is being requested from NASA. The support is for organization and
clerical expenses, on- site logistical expenses, student travel grants and
advertising costs. The purpose of the conference is to examine temporally and
spatially varying phenomena within the solar-terrestrial environment and to
discuss the current and future role of theory and experiment in resolving their
important aspects.
