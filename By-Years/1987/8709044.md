Multiple measures or the use of several ratios to evaluate performance almost
always results in conflicting performance measures because the organization
being evaluated may appear to be performing better than average on certain
indicators and poorer on others. In addition business unit managers who are
evaluated in terms of achieving multiple objectives are known to be concerned
with the inequitable application of multiple measures because such measures do
not account for factors which affect but are not under the control of the
managers. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was designed to measure
productivity relative to the best practice available and it accommodates
multiple measures of performance (inputs and output) and adjusts for factors not
under the control of management. This research seeks to develop a stochastic
data envelopment analysis method and explore the statistical attributes of an
extended stochastic DEA. The proposed research will be useful for empirical
research and other applied work in production frontier estimation because it
seeks to develop a model, (a) employing a flexible nonparametric form
incorporating the impact of multiple input, multiple output correspondences; (b)
incorporating the impact of both organizational inefficiency and rand factors;
and (c) providing a basis for testing hypotheses within a flexible non
parametric framework.
