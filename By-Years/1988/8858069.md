Dr. Berg is studying the metal-binding domains in nucleic acid binding
proteins. The prototype for these proteins is Transcription Factor IIIA which
has nine such domains. Approximately 10 other proteins have been discovered that
contain repeated units of similar form. In addition, several other classes of
nucleic acid binding proteins have sequences that are highly suggestive of
metal-binding domains. The research will address three aspects related to these
proteins: 1) the three-dimensional structure of the metal-binding domains 2) the
function of the metal ion; 3) the design of modules that will have particular
metal-binding and nucleic acid binding properties.
