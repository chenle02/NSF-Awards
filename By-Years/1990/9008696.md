This award will support a cultural anthropologist studying the social relations
of economic activity in the main wholesale fish market in Tokyo, Japan. The
theory to be tested involves the nature of economic relationships, since the
market has many personalized, vertically-coordinated economic ties. In normal
market theory such a market should be composed of many short-term competitive
relations, yet this market is striking for its institutionalization of
cooperative relationships between apparently competing firms. The methodology
includes participant observation and formal interviews as well as a survey of
market participants. This research is important because it will shed light on
how cooperation can facilitate economic activity in a competitive environment.
It will also have practical significance in illustrating how Japanese customs
operate in a very large, heavily capitalized fish market.
