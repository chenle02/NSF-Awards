This project, called the Appalachian Scholars in Computer Science and
Mathematics (ASCSM) Program, awards scholarships worth $3125 per year to low-
income, academically talented undergraduate students majoring in mathematics or
computer science. Incoming freshmen that meet established academic and financial
criteria are eligible for the awards. Recruitment is carried out through high
school visits, web page publicity and the annual Tennessee Mathematics Contest,
which draws up to 1000 Tennessee high school students to the campus each fall.

The proposed program addresses two issues: 1) under-representation of students
from low-income families at the university and 2) devastating attrition rates
for students in lower level mathematics and computer science courses. The
program builds upon existing student support programs, including the mathematics
tutorial lab, counseling, and mentoring. However, ASCSM scholarship recipients
receive additional academic support through departmental advising, peer and
faculty mentors, and twice monthly meetings of scholars.
