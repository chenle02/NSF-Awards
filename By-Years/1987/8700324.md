The ancestor-descendant relationships of a group of minute Caribbean
crustaceans of the ostracode genus Vargula will be studied using morphological
characters on the carapace and patterns of bioluminescent display behavior. The
geographic distribution of the Caribbean species will also be established,
allowing unique insight into how the evolution of form and behavior might affect
or be affected by geographic dispersal. Underwater video recordings of
bioluminescent displays will be used as a data source, along with light and
electron microscopy of morphology. The wider implications of the proposed work
lie in the use of multiple datasets for constructing and testing phylogenetic
hypotheses. Comparisons between the behavioral and morphological branching
patterns may illuminate the complex relationship between the evolution of form,
behavior, and geographic distribution.
