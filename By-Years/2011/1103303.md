Magnetic reconnection is a universal plasma process that converts stored
magnetic energy into particle energies. The near-Earth space provides a natural
laboratory this process can be studied in-situ. This project builds on recent
discoveries of reconnection in the Earth's magnetosheath of both non-turbulent
and turbulent reconnection. A comprehensive survey of data from the Cluster and
Themis spacecraft in the magnetosheath will be carried out to establish the
observational facts about magnetosheath reconnection. These results will be used
to address fundamental questions regarding onset, structure, heating and
energization in reconnection as well as micro-scale reconnection in turbulent
current sheets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves training of one
undergraduate and one graduate student and other educational and public outreach
activities are planned as well. The database containing all the magnetosheath
reconnection events will be made publicly available and will be useful for a
broad range of other research projects on reconnection and on large current
sheets in general.
