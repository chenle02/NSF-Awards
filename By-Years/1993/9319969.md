IRI-9319969 Myers This is the first year of a three year continuing award to
investigate architectures for script-based and object-based demonstrational
programming interfaces and their use in visualization. The overall concept of
demonstrational interfaces is to allow the user to operate on example values
from which the system generalizes. The approach of script-based interfaces, as
contrasted with object-based approaches, lends itself to generalization when a
specifically given script trace is extended to other cases. The object-based
approach is investigated as it relates to data visualization by generalizing the
properties of the data and the typical graphics used in the domain. The ultimate
goal is to make the design of a custom interface as simple as sketching a
picture on a napkin.
