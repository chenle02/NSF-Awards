An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
The goal of this research is to develop a model of the electron and Ion
distribution functions in regions of open magnetic field lines within the
magnetophere. In essence, the model will provide a steady-state zeroth - order
velocity space mapping of the magnetosphere subject to the constraints of
conservation of magnetic moment, energy and phase-space density along a particle
path combined with the time-of-flight (velocity filter) effect.
