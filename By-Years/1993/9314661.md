9314661 Glyde This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
materials theory between Henry R. Glyde, University of Delaware, and Henri
Godfrin, ILL (Institut Laue Langevin), Grenoble, France. The project also
involves participation of a group at NIST (National Institute for Standards and
Technology) and researchers at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United
Kingdom. Their research takes advantage of unique neutron scattering facilities
at ILL and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory to determine the neutron structure
factors in liquid helium Fermionic and Bosonic systems. The U.S. investigators
bring to this collaboration theoretical expertise in liquid helium. This is
complemented by the French group's experimental work. Other measurements will be
accomplished through the collaboration with UK researchers and through
interaction with NIST which is now involved in quantum fluids in disordered and
confined geometries. ***
