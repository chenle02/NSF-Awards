This grant provides partial support for an investigation of of bound state beta
decay, a phenomenon never before observed in the laboratory. Through the use of
very sensitive resonance fluorescence detection methods, the formation of the
23S1 state of the 3He atom resulting directly from the beta decay of tritium
will be measured. The direct formation of bound states following beta decay is
expected to be of importance in nucleosynthesis. This experiment will utilize a
lanthanide hexa-aluminate laser which is tunable around 1.08 micrometers.
