Multi-TAC is a learning system that automatically synthesizes heuristic programs
for combinatorial problems, including resource allocation and scheduling
problems. This project investigates fundamental research areas that will enable
Multi-TAC to be used for computationally challenging problems. The first goal is
to develop fast methods for searching the space of algorithms evaluated by
Multi-TAC during the synthesis process. In particular, the research focuses on
methods for predicting how well an algorithm will perform based on a quick test
on an example problem instance. The second goal is to enable Multi-TAC to
automatically synthesize very efficient iterative repair algorithms. This
involves the development of generic schemas that capture the structure of wide
variety of such algorithms. The last goal is to enable users to easily specify
new problem domains for Multi-TAC, without needing to worry about how the
details of their specification impacts the synthesis process. In particular, the
work focuses on techniques for rewriting constraints so that they can be
efficiently evaluated. This research project provides an important step towards
problem- solving systems that can automatically configure themselves for a
particular application.
