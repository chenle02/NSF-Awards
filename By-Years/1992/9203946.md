Humans employ diagrams and other pictures, both real and imagined, as aids to
reasoning, and many kinds of problems are solved by an interaction between
propositional reasoning and spatial imagery. This research will explore
computational explanations of this ability. The use of diagrams is in part a
form of spatial reasoning, which is the use of representations of objects in
space for problem-solving, inferring, and learning. Spatial reasoning is an
important ability of humans, and machines with similar capacities will have
certain advantages over machines without them, including a more natural mode of
interaction with people. The proposed research hypothesizes that these are forms
of representation that aid human reasoning by providing psychologically and
computationally efficient ways of capturing and propagating the constraints of
real world events and mathematical abstractions. The creation, modification and
transformation of these representations allow a person to perform mental
experiments that make deductions and test conjectures about the corresponding
physical situations and mathematical relations. The ultimate result of this
research could be a better scientific understanding of the psychology of
reasoning with imagery, and the basis of a technology for machines that can
think directly in images.//
