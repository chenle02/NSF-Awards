Ribonuclease H (RNase H) genes and/or their activities have been identified in
all systems studied to date ranging from archaebacteria to man. This suggests
that they may be one of a limited number of activities required for minimal
biological life. Multiple RNase H isoforms exist in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
and all known for their ability to degrade the RNA strands of RNA:DNA
heteroduplexes. This simple function implicates the enzymes in regulating
RNA:DNA duplex formation during DNA replication, RNA transcription, chromatin
ultrastructure and viral and cellular reverse transcription. The existence of
multiple RNase H isoforms also suggest that what is learned of isoforms in one
system may relate to our understanding of isoform structure and function
elsewhere. The studies described here are broadly significant in scope,
impacting conserved and novel roles for ribonucleases H in all biological
systems. Furthermore,they exploit the genetics of Trypanosoma brucei, a system
that has been the prototype for unmasking unusual nucleic acid metabolic events
such as RNA editing and RNA trans-splicing.&lt;br/&gt;
