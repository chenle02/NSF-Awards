In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, sponsored by the Chemistry
division, Prof. Holmes (Arkansas College) will investigate mechanisms by which
hydrogen halides are eliminated from organic molecules in the gas phase. The
work is important both for an improved understanding of elimination reactions in
general and because many of the reactions are involved in destruction of
atmospheric ozone. In addition, the work will provide strong movivation for
undergraduate students towards a career in chemistry. %%% Prof. Holmes (Arkansas
College) will elucidate and clarify fundamental reactions of chlorinated
molecules in the atmosphere. An improved understanding of this process is
urgently needed in order to develop effective strategies for coping with
destruction of the ozone layer and for dealing with potential global warming.
