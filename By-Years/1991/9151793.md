This project provides the necessary instrumentation to provide a comprehensive
laboratory experience for an on-going course on Colloidal and Interfacial
Phenomena. The instrumentation consists of a laser light scattering apparatus, a
wetting/contact angle instrument, a centrifuge for colloidal size analysis, an
automated capillary viscometer and a film balance. This instrumentation allows
inclusion of experiments in the important areas of light scattering, spread
monolayers and wetting/contact angle phenomena while improving the experiments
concerned with colloid rheology and surface tension phenomena. The resulting
course provides a model for the enrichment of elective chemical engineering
courses and the resulting course materials will be disseminated via national
meetings and publications.
