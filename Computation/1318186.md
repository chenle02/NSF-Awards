In this proposal, the investigator plans to develop and analyze a class of
energy-conserving deterministic solvers for kinetic electromagnetic plasma
simulations. The proposed methods have several features that overcome the
difficulties of many traditional solvers: it conserves the total particle number
and energy of the system; it has a systematic way to incorporate explicit or
implicit time stepping depending on the stiffness of the equations; and it is
designed for implementations on unstructured grids for complex geometries in the
physical space. To achieve the objective, the research topics include a range of
analytical and computational subjects. The investigator proposes to design a new
energy-conserving splitting for the coupled Vlasov-Maxwell system, so that the
splitted equations still maintain energy conservation and can be computed in
reduced dimensions. The investigator plans to set up a general framework to
incorporate various type of energy-conserving temporal and spatial
discretizations. Methods to further improve computational efficiency by using
various local basis, local time stepping and hybrid solvers will be explored.
Issues on how to enforce charge continuity and positivity will be addressed.
Analytical aspects such as the numerical dispersion relation, stability and
error estimates will be considered.

The proposed activity lies between algorithm development, analysis and
applications. The resulting numerical schemes can be applied to a wide range of
plasma simulations. The theoretical studies will provide foundation and guidance
to the design of such numerical methods. The broader impacts of the proposed
activity will be its interdisciplinary outreach and educational components. The
proposed research is multidisciplinary in its nature. The investigator actively
interacts and consults with faculty members in physics, electrical engineering
departments. Training opportunities for students and postdocs will be provided.
Computational math curriculum development will be incorporated.
