This research in the area of manufacturing automation is focused on the study of
linking design and process control through automated process planning. Process
planning is the task of determining manufacturing operations and sequences for
making a piece part or assembly. It links the design, production planning and
control, and manufacturing process control functions. Efforts are underway to
study automated understanding of design models to extract manufacturable
features from geometric models and to examine assembly planning and different
functional modules for an intelligent process planning system. The overall goal
is to develo principles for modeling manufacturing knowledge, for understanding
CAD geometric models, and for generating automated CNC control codes.
