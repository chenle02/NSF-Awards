Plants produce flowers to complete their life cycle and to reproduce. Flower
development requires genetic and structural changes in the tip of the plant
shoot as the plant transitions from its vegetative to its reproductive stage.
During this time, gene expression patterns also determine the overall
arrangement of the flowers, called the inflorescence, into single organs,
unbranched or branched clusters, or into compound structures. In most, but not
all plant species, the reproductive branches terminate their growth after
flowers have given rise to fruits. Our recent study of the oil seed plant
Swedish thale-cress (Arabidopsis suecica), a species that normally produces
single flower spikes, showed that under certain light conditions this
termination is reversed and multiple compound flower spikes are instead
produced. The central aim of this project is to understand the genetic
mechanisms for this abnormal behavior. Using molecular techniques, including in
situ hybridization, gene expression will be compared in normal and abnormal
floral tissues, to determine if and how the different distribution of flower
development genes leads to the differences in floral architecture. The
hypothesis tested is that both strength of gene expression and the distribution
of the gene products (the proteins) within the developing inflorescence are
responsible for these changes. Understanding the genetic pathways controlling
inflorescence development in commercially important oil seed plants could be
applied to efforts to enhance seed yield. Creating types with more favorable
inflorescence architectures might be useful in biofuel production, for
example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide outstanding training
opportunities for undergraduate students. The project will be led by the
University of Puget Sound, a primarily undergraduate institution, in
collaboration with the University of Washington, and Heritage University, a
minority-serving college in central Washington state.
