The Jackson Laboratory will initiate a ten-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in mammalian genetics for 10 students entering the 12th grade. This
summer year program will emphasize the study of experimental genetics using the
mouse. The creation of inbred, genetically defined strains of mice, development
of methods for culture of mammalian cells, and techniques for manipulating
genetic material have made the mouse the preferred mammalian model for this
research. Students design and carry out an original piece of research, interpret
their data, write and present oral reports on their findings, and learn complex
laboratory procedures.
