ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0221833&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much has been
learned in recent years about the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and
isotopic tracers, but progress has been limited by the lack of any large-scale
coordinated research effort in this area since the GEOSECS program. With NSF
funding through this project, researchers at the Lamont-Dougherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University will convene a workshop to lay the foundation
for a coordinated international study of the biogeochemical cycles of trace
elements and isotopes used as "tracers " in oceanography. Such a study would be
disciplinary in the sense that its primary objective would be to improve
understanding of the marine biogeochemical cycles of a suite of chemical
tracers. However, it would at the same time interdisciplinary, in that it seeks
to understand the complex couplings between the biogeochemical cycles of trace
elements and the biological and physical processes that influence those cycles.
The long-range objectives are highly interdisciplinary, in that the improved
understanding of these tracers will be of immediate and substantial benefit to
applications in biological, physical, and geological
oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study has been termed GEOSECS-II
to reflect the fact that many of its objectives follow directly from those of
the original GEOSECS program. Furthermore, the proposed study will be conducted
in the spirit of the original GEOSECS program with the appreciation that a
global perspective is required to understand completely the cycling of chemical
tracers within the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
