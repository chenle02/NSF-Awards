With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Biology
Transitions program is providing support to low-income students with
demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in STEM disciplines
at Lewis University. The project is funding 28 scholarships over 5 years for
transfer students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biological sciences.
The program will expose students to a learning model that emphasizes critical
thinking and problem solving, while providing support to transfer students as
they transition to a 4-year institution from community college. The supports
developed to help transfer students overcome barriers to graduation will have a
broad impact on an array of disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lewis University's
Biology Transitions program will increase the number of underrepresented,
economically disadvantaged students who complete 4-year degrees and enter the
STEM workforce directly or after completing a graduate program, helping to
advance scientific knowledge and provide needed, qualified STEM professionals.
Biology Transitions will establish a sustainable and replicable model of
communication between area community colleges and Lewis University and develop
effective programming between them, providing a supportive pathway for
underrepresented, economically disadvantaged transfer students to be successful
in a 4-year university environment. In addition to scholarships, the program
will incorporate intensive mentoring, academic support, and undergraduate
research opportunities to ensure that at least 80% of Biology Transitions
participants will persist to graduation. Professional guidance in the
internship, graduate, and professional school application processes will advance
students toward STEM professions and increase the number of graduating scholars
who continue in a STEM field through employment or graduate school.
