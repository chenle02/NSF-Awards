Chemistry and physics students are introduced to modern spectroscopic techniques
involving lasers, and at the same time gain experience in assembling modular,
computer-controlled instrumentation. Students assemble modular instruments for
experiments using such components as a N2 laser, fiber optics, a boxcar/gated
integrator, a scanning monochrometer, a photomultiplier, an A/D converter, and
an interfaced MacintoshIIcx laboratory computer with Labview software. The
students learn the fundamentals of using a laboratory computer to integrate and
control instrumentation. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an
equal match for the NSF award.
