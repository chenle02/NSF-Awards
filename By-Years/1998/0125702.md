SoundPrint Media Center is producing a testing a pilot of a radio project that
would examine mathematical models used to simulate phenomena, make predictions
and generate scenarios. During the "What If: Models, Predications and Scenarios"
pilot phase, SoundPrint will produce and test two half-hour documentaries,
follow-up radio updates, and a plan for a web-based model simulation and
educational resources. Educational Support Services will conduct evaluation of
the pilot materials to determine: the programs' ability to translate complicated
mathematical and scientific ideas through a storytelling approach, the types of
models that best lend themselves to illustrate those concepts, and the degree to
which the documentaries as stand alone stories have an impact on listeners. The
formative evaluation also will test a website.
