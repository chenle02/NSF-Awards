The grant investigates the structure and defects of amorphous alloys that
influence their properties. The objective of the project is to study the
structural order over length scales of approximately one nanometer as well as
nanometer-scale structural defects, particularly voids and crystallization
resulting from intense deformation inside shear bands. Because of the inherent
disorder of the structure of amorphous alloys, it is difficult to observe and
quantify the relevant nanometer-scale structural features. A major aim is to use
several complementary experimental techniques including fluctuation electron
microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and resonant x-ray
scattering the results of which will be input to computer simulations based on
reverse Monte Carlo method to develop a detailed understanding of the nanometer-
scale structure of amorphous alloys. This information will be correlated with
measurements of mechanical behavior and crystallization kinetics to reveal
important aspects of structure-property
relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amorphous alloys, also called metallic
glasses, combine the outstanding mechanical properties of metals with the
processing flexibility of glasses, making them promising materials for a variety
of engineering applications. This program seeks to understand how the nanometer-
scale structure and defects of amorphous alloys influence their properties. The
education and training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and local
high school students will be enhanced as part of this program by integrating the
students into a research team that includes the principal investigator and the
other members. A web site will be designed describing the unique properties and
applications of metallic glasses for engineering applications that can help
reach a broader audience.
