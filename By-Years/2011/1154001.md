The PI requests funding to carry out a series of ocean tests of their in situ O2
calibration device This will include eight field tests on three different
moorings in two years to determine the accuracy and at-sea reliability of the
new calibration system. Testing efficiency will be optimized by constructing two
more calibration systems so that they can be swapped when the moorings are
serviced. The new in situ oxygen calibration systems will include moderate
improvements suggested by the testing done so far. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate and precise observations of oxygen are
crucial to understanding biological processes and recent work also indicates
that oxygen can be used as a proxy for determining pH (an extremely difficult
measurement) and important to understanding aragonite saturation in the oceans.
This work will provide extremely valuable data on the performance of oxygen
sensors that will contribute to real-time quality control of oxygen data from
profiling floats equipped with oxygen sensors throughout the world's oceans and
to the development of a research-quality oxygen database over the long term. The
project supports one fulltime graduate student.
