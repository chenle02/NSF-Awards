Gregory A. Voth of the University of Chicago is supported by the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to
perform research developing a new theoretical and computational methodology to
study quantum mechanical behavior of condensed phase systems. The conceptual
basis for the research will be to explore the meaning and consequences of the
multiscale technique of coarse-graining in quantum mechanics, as well as its
practical implications. This approach will provide a new way to represent forces
between molecules in condensed phase systems that can be derived from quantum
mechanics and then to systematically refine them for the condensed phase system
of interest. One important consequence of these concepts will also be the
development of new, flexible, and computationally efficient force fields for
chemically reactive systems, including applications to study acid-base chemistry
and the hydrolysis of CO2 by water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will provide a transformative capacity to better understand, simulate,
and computationally design complex condensed phase systems. There will be also
multiple broader impacts from this project that can lay the fundamental
groundwork for advances in the health sciences (influenza viral infection,
respiration, and aging), in alternative energy research (fuel cell membranes,
solar energy conversion, bioenergetics), and in environmental science (carbon
sequestration/fixation and ocean acidification). The project will provide
enhancement in innovation and research infrastructure, integration of research
and education, and help to increase the participation in the sciences by
underrepresented groups.
