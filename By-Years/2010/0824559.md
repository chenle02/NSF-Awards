This grant supports acquisition of instrumentation to characterize the magnetic
properties of rocks, minerals and sediments. A kappabridge equipped with
variable sample temperature control capabilities (from -196°C to 700°C) for
measuring anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility and bulk susceptibility in weak
variable magnetic fields and a thermal demagnetizer equipped with a controlled
atmosphere chamber and controlled field coil to permit measurement of
paleointensity will be acquired by Michigan Technological University. The
equipment will support PI research on the long-term evolution of Earth?s
magnetic field in the Precambrian, studies of processes of acquisition and
preservation of paleointensity signal in rocks, and studies of magnetism of
sediments and soils for paleoclimatic and environmental applications. The
equipment will support Ph.D. student research as well as undergraduate research
projects both within MTU and also at nearby Lake Superior State University.
Upgrade of the MTU paleomagnetism lab represents a significant research
infrastructure enhancement for an isolated region of the upper Midwest U.S.
