In this project, the PI plans to examine regional labor markets in Japan, Great
Britain and the United States and their response to macroeconomic shocks. He
first plans to investigate adjustment of real wages, unemployment or migration
rates in response to shocks. The effect of cultural and institutional factors
that has an impact on labor market behavior will be mitigated by doing
comparisons across regions within the same country. The second part of the
analysis will be an attempt to cast some light on the causes of these
differences in response patterns. The PI will conduct some preliminary tests for
the causes of the regional differentials by examining the roles of unions,
housing markets, industry structure, education or skill differentials and other
factors. After isolating which hypothesis appear to be most promising, he
intends to develop a full proposal and test a theoretical model about why
regional markets may vary in their responses to these shocks. The investigator
plans to link this work to current research on efficiency wages and insider-
outsider models of the labor market which have been used to explain aggregate
unemployment and real wage movements.
