In recent years, the areas of geometry and low-dimensional topology have
experienced a period of rapid growth, owing to new-found interactions, both with
each other and with a wide array of other mathematical disciplines. This
exciting blend of ideas has led to the discovery of new unexpected phenomena in
mathematics, settling some long-standing questions, and raising new challenges
for the future. The geometry and topology research training grant at Princeton
represents a collaborative effort of a broad group of mathematicians at
Princeton to help train the next generation of mathematicians -- undergraduates,
graduate students, and post-docs -- in these exciting developments, so to help
prepare them to contribute further advances. Components of this project include
undergraduate training and research opportunities, and mentoring of graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers in both research and teaching. The grant
includes intensive summer courses, development of undergraduate courses and
seminars, graduate support, support for research and working seminars, funds for
visitors, and post-doctoral research positions.

The RTG represents the combined effort of twelve geometers and topologists at
Princeton University. The research represented in this group includes low-
dimensional topology, symplectic geometry, contact geometry, conformal geometry,
and geometric analysis. The project will include: (1) summer research
opportunities for undergraduates with close mentoring from faculty; (2) full
funding for 6 graduate students per year in the field; (3) support for two post-
doctoral research associates, whose teaching and research will be actively
mentored by the faculty; (4) three intensive summer programs, where
undergraduates and graduate students will be introduced to recent developments
in topology and geometry; (5) three major conferences at the culmination of the
summer programs; (6) the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses;
(7) a number of research seminars and student working seminars; and (8)
additional lectures aimed at engaging students in mathematics in general and in
topology/geometry specifically.
