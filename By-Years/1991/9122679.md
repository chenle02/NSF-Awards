Recent research has indicated that there is a formal electrical duality between
electrons in semiconductors and fluxons in superconducting thin films. Magnetic
flux can be transported across a superconductor only via fluxons (or vortices),
in analogy to charge transport across a semiconductor via electrons and holes. A
fluxon of either polarity is driven by a current and produces an electric field
in the same way that an electron or hole is driven by an electric field and
produces a current. Superconducting devices that are dual to unipolar
semiconducting devices (such as the field-effect transistor) have recently been
demonstrated. The proposed research will go further to design and fabricate
simple bipolar fluxonic elements that are the duals to semiconducting bipolar
junction diodes and transistors. A bipolar fluxonic transistor is a three-
terminal active superconducting device that can exhibit substantial voltage
gain. These devices will be prepared by patterning of high-temperature
superconducting YBCO thin films, without the need to fabricate Josephson tunnel
junctions or other more complex structures. The research will seek to determine
whether these new devices may provide a promising new approach for the next
generation of superconducting integrated circuit technology.
