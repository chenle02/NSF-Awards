The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), a long term partner in the UT
System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), proposes to
sponsor a cohort of 12 talented, underrepresented minority (URM) Bridge to the
Doctorate (BD) fellows during their first two years of doctoral training in
science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. The overall goal
of this project is to advance the national and university goal of increasing the
number of URM students who enter and successfully complete doctoral training in
STEM fields and develop into leaders and role models in academic, government or
industry sectors. The primary goal of the current proposal is to develop a
sustainable and training environment that provides comprehensive support for new
URM students as they transition into graduate education and begin to develop as
research professionals. This will be accomplished through selective recruitment
of prospective fellows to the exceptional training environment of UTSA, and
implementation of a support and training program developed by melding of
successful strategies developed at UTEP and UTSA, within the foundations of
existing social-science and training literature. A secondary goal is to promote
replication of this program or its components in other emerging research
institutions with similar URM populations.
