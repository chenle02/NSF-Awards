The project described in this proposal is in the general area of Nonlinear
Optimization, and the research issues focus on infinite dimensional convex
optimization problems (IDCP). A large number of concrete problems arising in
various fields of applications in Engineering and Computational Mathematics can
be modelled as (IDCP). An important objective of this project is to demonstrate
that all specific variants of the class (IDCP) can be analyzed in a unified way
via duality methods. The use of duality techniques leads to produce finite
dimensional computationally tractible problems and thus open the possibility of
constructing efficient algorithms for solving (IDCP). The PI has excellent
credentials and resides in a suitable academic environment for gaining promising
results.
