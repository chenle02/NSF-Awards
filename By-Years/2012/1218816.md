Power consumption is one of the primary roadblocks to greatly expanding the role
of computing in everyday life. While server farms allow for instantaneous
storing and retrieval of information, companies struggle with the cost and
environmental impact of high power and cooling bills. On the other side of
computing spectrum, researchers have envisioned true integration of computing
with the environment by deploying networked sensors into all aspects of our
lives. However, their power consumption remains one of the major impediments for
their true integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the PIs advocate
the use of NEMS switches to control leakage in order to advance the low-power
design of computing architectures to the next level. Considering the most
difficult part of promoting emerging technologies is integrating them with
entrenched technologies and design flows, the PIs will investigate all of the
important aspects of incorporating NEMS switches with the industry-standard CMOS
process flow. This approach not only allows for eventual commercialization, but
also provides an economical platform for other researchers to investigate and
refine this approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work also includes
development of an educational module that will introduce the concepts of green
computing specifically for a high school/freshman audience. The goal of the
module is to present the benefits of engineering to the society to students with
the hope of attracting them to the computer engineering discipline.
