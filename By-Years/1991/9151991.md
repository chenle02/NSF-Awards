The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
Spectrometer to broaden the scope of IR applications and introduce new
experiments in the organic chemistry laboratories. The instrument is also being
used in the advanced laboratories in instrumental analysis, physical chemistry,
inorganic chemistry and undergraduate research. A special emphasis is being
placed on the use of the instrument for polymer characterization.
