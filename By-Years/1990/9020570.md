This is a project to continue work on the B-SYS system for biological sequence
comparison. This is a linear array of chips, each chip containing 47 small
processors that can do fixed point arithmetic and the character comparisons
needed for sequence comparison. Previous work has resulted in a 10-chip
prototype. During this project, the principal investigator is expanding the
prototype, developing software to aid in programming and debugging the array,
and studying testability and fault-tolerance issues. The goal is to produce an
inexpensive coprocessor with supercomputer performance on this problem.
