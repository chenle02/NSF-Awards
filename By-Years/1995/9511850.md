9511850 Humanic Research will be carried out in relativistic heavy ion nuclear
physics. Experiments will be conducted at the CERN, AGS, and RHIC heavy ion
accelerators. The main goal of these experiments is to obtain evidence that
collisions of relativistic heavy ions with sufficiently high energy produce a
phase transition from normal nuclear matter into a new phase of matter made up
of a large volume of free quarks and gluons. The above named accelerator
facilities provide a range of energies needed to raise the energy density to
more than ten times normal nuclear matter density, thought to be sufficient to
produce deconfined quark and gluon matter. Experiments will be designed and
carried out which look at the signatures of a quark-gluon plasma as reflected in
particle momentum distributions and multiplicities of each type of particle
produced. Development work will be carried out for purpose of producing a
detector system with sufficient individual particle tracking and identification
capability to handle the huge particle multiplicities expected from central
heavy ion collisions. Some calculations will be carried out to determine
expected interaction regions within the colliding systems. In addition, lower
energy charge exchange reaction measurements will be completed which bear on the
density dependence of nucleon-nucleon interactions. Research in these areas will
advance our understanding of the underlying quark model of nucleons and mesons.
These topics are among the most exciting in nuclear physics. Education of
graduate students and postdocs is integral to this activity, as is development
and construction of major state-of-the-art equipment ***
