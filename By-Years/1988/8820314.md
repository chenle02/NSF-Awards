ABSTRACT "Wh-acquisition" refers to the child's acquiring the ability to use and
understand questions using interrogative pronouns, words which in English
usually begin with the letters "wh": who, what, where, etc. The formation of
such questions involves some of the central abstract features of language: long-
distance relations, bound variables, and empty categories. Existing naturalistic
studies of child language, based on sampling of children's utterances, have not
been very revealing of how various wh- structures emerge, because the crucial
forms appear relatively infrequently. Also, understanding this facet of language
development requires evidence of the child's interpretation of questions, as
well as production of questions. The present project will constitute a
coordinated study of the acquisition of wh-expressions. A combination of diary
studies, longitudinal sampling of a small number of children, and experiments
testing children's interpretations will be used. The experiments will also be
run with a larger sample of 40 children, to obtain longitudinal data on how
interpretations of wh-question structures change between the ages of three to
six. The goal is to provide individual profiles of the growth of wh-movement
where a wide range of structures can be simultaneously examined. Pilot work
indicates the possibility of obtaining important evidence for the theory of
barriers, the semantics of bound variables, and lexical or pragmatic effects.
The data obtained will contribute to a realistic parametric model of the
acquisition of questions.
