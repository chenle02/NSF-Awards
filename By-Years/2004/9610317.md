CTS-9610317 Snurr &amp; Torkelson Northwestern University Project Summary The
Department of Chemical Engineering at Northwestern University will purchase
equipment for performing nuclear magnetic resonance. (NMR) diffusion
measurements on an existing NMR spectrometer at Northwestern. The equipment con-
sists of a diffusion package, including an amplifier and spectrometer software,
as well as a custom-built pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion probe. The
equipment will be dedicated to support research in engineering. It will be used
for several research projects, including 1) and investigation of mass transfer
effects in zeolite catalysis, 2) studies of multicomponent diffusion in
zeolites, 3) research on small-molecule diffusion in polymer solutions, 4)
studies of polymer diffusion in polymer situations and 5) investigations of
small-molecule diffusion in bulk polymers. As part of the general user facility
that maintains the NMR spectrometer, the new equipment will be made available to
researchers working on other projects as well.
