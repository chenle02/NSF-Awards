This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop a new class
of low-dielectric constant organic polymers for integrated circuit manufacture.
The chemical structure of these materials exploits newly defined molecular
concepts of free-volume engineering to reach previously unattainable dielectric
capacitance levels for matrix materials. The research objectives are to develop
synthetic methods for the manufacture of key Iptymer(TM) polymers, manufacture
lead Iptymer materials, evaluate material performance against key performance
specifications, and explore manufacturing and scale-up economics. At the
conclusion of Phase I, lead Iptymer materials with established performance
specifications will be available for sample to potential industrial partners.
The principal commercial application of Iptymer low-k dielectric materials is as
interlayer dielectric matrix materials that are inserted between copper wires of
integrated circuits. The lower dielectric constant of these materials will lead
to faster circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, successful development of
the materials has the potential to be used in a wide array of high performance
electronics such as microprocessors and components for wireless communications.
This is estimated to be a $400M market by 2006. In addition to these
applications, Iptymer materials also have low refractive indices and can be used
as optical coatings to enhance the brightness of displays. The economic and
technical impact of reliable low-k dielectrics is considerable. Higher bandwidth
processing and communication for the same cost is possible with improved
materials, and every country, economic group, and industry will benefit from
such advances. The societal benefits realized through the extension of
electronic tools into areas where their use is now impractical or not affordable
will be tremendous, even if consideration is given only to medical equipment.
