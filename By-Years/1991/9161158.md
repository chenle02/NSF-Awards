This research project is to develop hands-on integrated science materials based
on the phenomenon of bioluminescence. The materials developed will aid in the
observation, discovery, and learning of basic concepts in various scientific
fields. The research will examine the appropriateness of bioluminescent
earthworms for the use as a teaching aid in terms of the ease of raising and
maintenance, and methods of stimulation of the bioluminescence display. The use
would be for grades K-12.
