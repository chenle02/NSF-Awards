Abstract -- CTS-9404607 Sawyer The combustion Institute holds biennial
international meetings for presentation of the latest experimental and
theoretical results across the spectrum of Combustion Science and Engineering.
The 1994 meeting will be held on July 31 - August 5, 1994 at the University of
California, Irvine. The Combustion Institute encourages outstanding scientists
and engineers to participate in the symposium and assists young investigators in
attending. This has maintained a higher level of activity and interest in
combustion than would have otherwise existed. The Symposium proceedings will be
published; funds are being supplied to help offset these costs.
