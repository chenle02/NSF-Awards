9500436 Wittrup This conference will bring together leaders, practitioners, and
students to discuss the latest ideas and discoveries in biochemical engineering,
and will emphasize efforts to expand the intellectual and industrial scope of
biotechnology and the contributions which biochemical engineers can make to this
expansion. The theme of the conference is that biotechnology is increasingly and
interdisciplinary endeavor, requiring knowledge, methods, and expertise from
biochemistry, genetics, chemistry, computer science, and chemical engineering to
identify the most critical problems, to formulate the most creative and
successful strategies, and to implement the most novel and profitable solutions.
This interdisciplinary web of interactions is critical for the development of
new products using biotechnology, and new processes for synthesizing and
purifying the products of biotechnology. ***
