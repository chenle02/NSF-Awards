This project provides undergraduate students at this institution with a hands-
on experience in biomedical instrumentation. The laboratory that supports the
project includes equipment such as: force transducers, EKG machines,
sphygmomanometers, magnetic and ultrasonic flow meters, and A/D and D/A
converters. Experiments in this laboratory familiarize students with the
underlying physiological principles, the application of biomedical instruments,
and the installation, calibration, inspection, preventative maintenance and
repair of biomedical equipment. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
