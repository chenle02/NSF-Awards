In a pilot study motivated by recent results on the lateral connectivity and
dynamic processes in the mammalian neocortex, a new model of coritcal self-
organization called LCSOFM (Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Feature Map) was
developed. This research focuses on LCSOFM as a computational model of the
primary visual cortex. The main hypothesis is that the lateral connectivity in
the visual cortex mediates cooperation and competition necessary for the self-
organization and low-level perceptual phenomena. The hypothesis will be tested
by building a LCSOFM model of the visual cortex and analyzing its behavior
through simulated neuroscience experiments. The LCSOFM model permits
computational study of the visual cortex at a new, more fundamental level than
earlier models, and allows us to test several new hypotheses about its structure
and function. Based on the pilot study, there is reason to believe that the
model can verify whether (1) self-organization can be based on cooperation and
competition among laterally connected neurons; (2) the observed patterns of
long-range lateral connections arise from correlations in neural activity; (3)
plasticity of the cortex results from reorganization of lateral connections; (4)
tilt illusions arise from competition of neural responses in laterally connected
retinotopic maps; (5) gestalt principles can be extracted from visual experience
and encoded into lateral connections; and (6) cooperation and competition
through lateral connection, combine with binding by phase-locking, can be
responsible for segmentation of visual input into coherent wholes.//
