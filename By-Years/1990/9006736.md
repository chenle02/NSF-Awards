This proposal requests funds to develop a new facility for high precision
optical measurements in the submillimeter-to-very-far- infrared (150 - 350 GHz)
spectral range. This facility will be based on a network analyzer and various
cavity and Fabry-Perot resonators and will bridge the gap between the
conventional waveguide configuration and optical measurements. The resonant
configurations will enable precise measurements of the reflectivity with a
sensitivity of the order of the quality factor of the resonators, namely of
order of 104 times single pass optical experiments. This facility will be used
in conjunction with optical experiments to explore the electrodynamics of
several highly correlated metallic systems such as heavy fermion
superconductors, charge and spin density wave systems and unusual
superconductors.
