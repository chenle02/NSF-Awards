The most dramatic geologic events - such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions -
occur along the margins of the mosaic of plates that cover the surface of the
Earth, and are a consequence of plate motions. Plate motions also affect
mountain building, sea level, and climate. Hence, unraveling the history of
plate motions is a matter of considerable importance for understanding much of
the Earth?s history. The objective of this research is to use newly-available
Russian data from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to develop detailed models of motions
between the India, Eurasia, Nubia (West Africa) North America, and Pacific
Plates over the last 20 million years. With their improved spatial and temporal
resolution, these models will be useful to a broad cross section of the science
community who seek linkages between plate motions, continental tectonics, and
climate; they will also provide a framework for understanding the evolution of
western North America, the Himalaya, and the Alps. The program will also
continue an established international collaboration between U.S. and Russian
scientists.
