continue an eight week project for a total of 80 rising seniors, including young
men and women from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. This
Project is designed to engage students in a rigorous laboratory-based program in
biochemistry, biotechnology, microbiology, chemistry, mathematics, history and
ethics of science. Five of the eight weeks of the program will focus on academic
and problem-solving pursuits. During the remaining three weeks, students will
participate in an Intern Program.
