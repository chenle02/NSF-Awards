This proposal will further develop a hybrid fluid/kinetic model and use the
model to investigate the polar wind. In this model, thermal electron features of
the polar wind are described by fluid calculations while the suprathermal
electron features, as well as H+ and O+ ions are described using a kinetic model
in a global environment. Columbo collisions among species are taken into account
and the ambipolar electric field is computed self consistently. This approach is
the first to be able to incorporate the global collisional physics of
photoelectrons into a self- consistent description. Global steady-state polar
wind solutions that vary continuously from a subsonic collisional regime to a
supersonic collisionless regime have been generated in exploratory calculations.
The investigation here will be first devoted to parametric studies in order to
better understand the complex inter- relations between various ionospheric
boundary conditions and their effects on polar wind outflow. Results of the
model investigations will be compared with results being obtained from polar
wind data obtained from experiments on the DE and Akebono satellites.
