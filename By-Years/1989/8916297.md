The Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the East African rift zone meet at a complex
triple junction within the Afar lowlands of East Africa. The PI will measure the
instantaneous velocities of all three plates at this triple junction using GPS
geodesy supplemented locally by a three color geodimeter. The rate of African
rifting , is an ideal target for a newly developed three- color laser geodimeter
that has the range and precision to yield extension rates within a few years.
The proposed investigations will complement French GPS investigations in
Djibouti and Afar. The PI has received a formal invitation to undertake the
Ethiopian study from the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia.
