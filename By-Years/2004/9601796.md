9601796 Lucht This project is an equipment award describing instrumentation to
be acquired. It should be emphasized that, while the below is a simple listing
of the equipment, installation will result in a fully integrated system aimed at
fulfilling the project objective. The instrumentation will fill voids in the new
Fire Science Laboratory, enabling a more robust range of data to support fire
model development and validation. Use of this equipment is described in the
previous section of this proposal. Equipment is: o The NBS Smoke Chamber
manufactured by Superpressure Inc. will be up-dated to attain current ISO 5659
and ASTM E662 protocol. o Conical Radiator Furnace (CRF), and Data Acquisition
System. o Oxygen Analyzer o Automated Infrared Imaging System o Suppression
Agents o Phase Doopler Particle Analyzer ***
