ABSTRACT CTS-9610140 Professor Victor E. Henrich of Yale University is being
funded by the Kinetics and Catalysis-CRP-CTS and the Solid State Chemistry-DMR
programs. He will investigate the contribution of delocalized electronic states
to chemisorption on transition-metal-doped oxides, taking as model Cr-doped V203
single crystal. The electronic structure of the model catalytic oxide will be
varied independently from the structure over a wide range of doping with Cr. The
surface electronic structure will also be controlled by taking advantage of the
hysteresis of the metal-insulator transition with temperature. The system will
be studied with UHV techniques (UPS, XPS, LEEDS, HREELS, Auger, inverse
photoelectric techniques) and by chemisorption and TPD of probe molecules such
as CO, H20, O2, and NO. This work is of relevance to fundamental chemisorption
and catalysis, surface science, and materials science.
