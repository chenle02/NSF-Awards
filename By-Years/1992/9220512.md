The objective of this research is the measurement of lightning channels using a
radio frequency interferometer during a coordinated field experiment deployed
near Orlando International Airport. This interferometer, capable of measuring
the horizontal structure and evolution of lightning discharges, will be compared
with the three dimensional ones measured by a French team using another
interferometer. Both systems are equipped with automatic processing which will
enable the structure and evolution of an electrical discharge to be displayed as
it develops. Cognate observations of air motions and precipitation by three
doppler radars will greatly benefit the interpretation of thunderstorm structure
and lightning activity.
