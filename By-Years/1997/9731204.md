9731204 Bejan This award supports the participation of twelve US engineers in a
US-South Africa Workshop on Energy and Environment, to be held in Durban, South
Africa, in June 1998. The co-organizers are Professor Adrian Bejan, Department
of Mechanical Engineering, Duke University, Professor Peter Vadasz, Department
of Mechanical Engineering, University of Durban-Westville, Durban and Professor
Detlev G. Kroger, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of
Stellenbosch. The focus of the workshop is on thermal sciences, heat transfer
technologies, and environmental phenomena associated with energy flows and
installations. The purpose of the workshop is to promote scientific
collaboration between the two countries by exploring opportunities for joint
research in specific topics of high priority to the scientific community. Among
the topics of discussion are engineering thermodynamics and refrigeration,
energy engineering, and heat transfer augmentation. In the environmental area,
the two major topics are the environmental impact of energy systems, and
convection in porous media. South Africa is the world leader in the commercial
production of synthetic liquid fuel (converted from coal) for motor vehicles.
South Africa also has the world's largest installed capacity of dry cooling
towers. These and other areas of technological leadership will be discussed by
the South African participants. This award is supported jointly by the Division
of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Division of International Programs.
