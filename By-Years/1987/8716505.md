The objective of this research is to determine the rates of specific geomorphic
processes in order to constrain the chronology of events recorded by various
surfaces in the ice-free valleys and nunataks of Victoria Land, Antarctica. The
specific objective is to recover a suite of samples deployed 5-years ago as part
of a long-term experiment of exposure to the Antarctic environment. The results
of this experiment will have important implications for research into the
glacial history of the area, as wind erosion is presently seen as one of the key
factors in the evolution of the area. The results will also have implications
for studies of the evolution of cryptoendolithic microbial communities and their
remnant fossilized habitats, as abrasion is seen as a "rate limiting" factor.
