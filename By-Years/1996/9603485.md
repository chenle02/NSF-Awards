This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research on domain
decomposition methods for science and engineering problems. The investigators
are Charbel Farhat, Jan Mandel, Xiao-Chuan Cai at the University of Colorado,
Olof Widlund at New York University, Yvon Maday, Universite Paris Sud and Armel
de La Bourdonnaye at the French National Institute for Research in Informatics
and Applied Mathematics (INRIA). The investigators will address
interdisciplinary computational problems in large-scale structural mechanics,
fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and fluid/structure dynamics. The research
involves theoretical and analytical studies on domain decomposition, parallel
processing and high performance computing, and technological studies on stress
analysis and mechanical vibration of automotive structures, real gas flows at
high Mach and Reynolds numbers, and aeroelastic analysis of full configurations.
The US and French investigators' backgrounds and skills are complementary. The
project takes advantage of French expertise in applied mathematics and
engineering and will contribute toward the next generation computational methods
and computational mechanics software.
