As members of a minority group become integrated into the dominant society, they
may lose their ethnic identification through a process of assimilation. To test
theories of assimilation, this project examines the self-identification of third
and fourth generation Americans of Mexican ancestry, and how this self-
identification is shaped by high levels of ongoing Mexican immigration. Using
national-level census data and personal interviews conducted in two U.S. cities,
the project makes special efforts to measure ethnic identification. It then uses
quantitative and qualitative methods to first assess the impact of generation,
educational attainment, and residential ethnic concentration of immigrants on
Mexican-American intermarriage and the identity of children of such unions. It
next examines how social context and culture shape the self-identity of later-
generation Mexican-Americans. And it lastly draws out the implications of
Mexican self-identity for deciding how to respond to questions in the U.S.
census about ethnicity.
