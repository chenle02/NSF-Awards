Organic compounds represent on average 30-70% of the fine aerosol mass in both
polluted and clean areas. They contribute to the direct and indirect aerosol
radiative forcing of climate via their own optical properties and their effects
on clouds and precipitation. They are also pose significant environmental risks
via visibility degradation, and health effects through the air that we breathe.
The chemical complexity of the organic aerosol (OA) fraction of aerosols makes
the representation, modeling and understanding of their properties notably
challenging. A range of studies to be investigated here covers a range of
topics, including: &lt;br/&gt;* the ability of organic compounds to promote (or
inhibit) the growth of inorganic particulate matter with increasing relative
humidity (RH),&lt;br/&gt;* the effect of RH on the partitioning of semi-volatile
OA components between the gas and particulate phases, &lt;br/&gt;* the water
solubility distribution of ambient OA, &lt;br/&gt;* and the systematic
estimation of Henry's law constants of semi-volatile organic vapors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will involve a combination of laboratory
experiments, field measurements, and mathematical modeling, with a goal of
incorporating the mathematical representation of OA components into chemical
transport models, designed to track and forecast OA distribution .
