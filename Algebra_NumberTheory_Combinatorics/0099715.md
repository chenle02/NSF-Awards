Tony Pantev uses techniques from both the abelian and non-abelian Hodge theory
to approach concrete geometric questions as well as problems in cosmology,
mathematical physics and string theory. The investigator and his collaborators
study four problems. The first one describes a conjectural Hodge theoretic
criterion for deciding whether a given homotopy type underlies a smooth
projective variety. The second concerns the symplectic topology of four
manifolds, fibered over the two sphere. The third project designs an explicit
construction of sheaves on a gerby K3 surface and discusses its relations to the
physical notion of non-commutative deformation of fields. The fourth project
proposes an explicit construction of the special coordinates on the moduli space
of Eucledian $D$-branes by means of secondary Abel-Jacobi maps. The
understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various linearization
procedures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology and mathematical physics.
It brings us closer to understanding the basic structure of algebraic varieties
and enhances the geometric arsenal of techniques for building explicit models of
string theory vacua.

This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is not
only one of the most intensively researched parts of modern mathematics, but
also a crucial testing ground for the recent influx of revolutionary
mathematical ideas coming from string theory physics. The investigator's
research sets the stage for a rigorous treatment of the hard conjectures
generated by our current understanding of string dualities and enlarges the
arsenal of available tools for understanding the physics of strings. The
investigator's methods are applicable to a wide range of concrete problems in
astrophysics, quantum gravity and string theory.
