Professor Kivelson is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study molecular motions in liquids using both experimental
and theoretical approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of
supercooled liquids as they approach the glass transition temperature, and
liquid systems undergoing chemical reaction. As supercooled liquids approach the
glass transition temperature they become very viscous, and relaxation processes
become slow and more complex than for low viscosity fluids at higher
temperatures. Professor Kivelson's research group is studying the behavior of
small molecules and polymer solutions near the glass transition temperature. In
addition, other studies are aimed at understanding the motion of reacting groups
through surrounding fluid and across activation barriers for chemical reactions.
This area of research is of fundamental importance to the study of chemical
reactions in the liquid phase. The common theoretical framework for
understanding these phenomena consists of a correlation function description of
generalized hydrodynamics. The primary experimental technique used by Kivelson's
group to study these molecular motions is quasielastic light scattering.
