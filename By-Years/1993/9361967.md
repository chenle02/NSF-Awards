9361967 Brandes The unique properties of semiconducting diamond may be exploited
to create novel, compact, low-noise photon and particle detectors.
Photomultiplier tubes are the detector of choice when light levels are low or
when the proper signal must be extracted from a cluttered background. Continuous
dynodes, known as channel electron multipliers, are widely used as particle
detectors. Innovative changes in these devices would greatly enhance their
utility, sensitivity, stability and lifetime. ATM proposes such a change -
utilize the unusual properties of diamond to create a high gain, low-noise,
compact, stable, and sturdy electron multiplier (dynode) chain. Recent advances
in chemical vapor deposition of negative electron affinity (NEA) diamond have
made this feasible. In the Phase I program we propose to optimize the growth of
NEA diamond and to fully investigate the multiplicative and emissive properties
of the material. Phase II will extend the Phase I program to include fabrication
and testing of a prototype photon and particle detectors. A successful
demonstration of the secondary electron emission properties of negative electron
affinity diamond will make possible advance diamond-based photon and particle
detectors. The commercial applications for high gain, low noise, compact
detectors or sensors are many, particularly in medicine (PET or SPECT
detectors), pollution monitoring laser radar and absorption or emission
spectroscopy. *** v s t N I N $ $ $ ( F / N N / 1 Courier Symbol &amp; Arial 5
