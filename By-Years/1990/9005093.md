The Second Edward Bouchet International Conference on Physics and Technology
will be held August 14-17, 1990 in Accra, Ghana. The Conference will bring
together American scientists (most of whom will be African American), European,
and African scientists to discuss recent research findings, and to expose
researchers and advanced graduate students to new research results and
techniques. The Conference will provide African American and African physicists
a continuing opportunity to share research results and to develop
collaborations. Support by the National Science Foundation will provide partial
support for attendance by members of the U.S. scientific community.
