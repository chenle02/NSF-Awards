Steroid hormones profoundly influence the structure and function of the central
nervous system during development and throughout the vertebrates' lifespan.
While the major source of testosterone and estradiol comes from the gonads, the
brain also produces steroids. Aromatase enzymes responsible for the metabolism
of androgen into estrogen are localized within specific target neurons in
discrete brain regions. Since aromatase is not found in testes or adrenals, Dr.
Schlinger will determine whether the major source of circulating estrogen in
these males is derived from aromatization of androgens in the brain. This has
important theoretical ramifications because the brain may not only be a target
of steroid hormones but also a major source of a circulating steroid. Dr.
Schlinger will also examine the role of brain estrogen synthesis in the
regulation of sex differences in brain development and function. These studies
will lead to new insights in the mechanisms underlying hormone- brain
interactions. Increasing our knowledge about the basic processes underlying
normal neuroendocrine events will contribute towards a better understanding of
birth defects that result from insufficient and/or excessive exposure to a
particular steroid hormone.
