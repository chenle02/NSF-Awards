9402469 Taylor In this project the PIs will investigate the relationship between
rift-related and arc-related volcanism behind the volcanic front of Izu arc
using a combination of field studies and geochemistry. In these arcs rift and
cross-chain arc volcanism occur at similar distances from the slab and overlap
in eruption ages. The PIs will also sample the across arc seamounts in the Izu
region. They wish to analyze the samples for trace elements and isotopes. They
argue that by studying arc magmas further away from the trench region they can
get a much better handle on the nature of the wedge mantle. They will also be
able to determine whether the invasion of an enriched mantle component is a
prerequisite to rifting. ***
