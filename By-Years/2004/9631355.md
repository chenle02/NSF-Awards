9631355 Grodzicker Computational Neuroscience represents a timely approach to
viewing the nervous systems of animals. Such computational approaches to
neuroscience have generated many important advances in our understanding of
nervous system function. This grant provides fund for a 2-week course at the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on
experience in a computer laboratory this course presents current concepts in
feature extraction, motion analysis binocular stereopsis, color vision, higher
level visual processing and visual neuronal networks. The underlying theme of
the course is that an understanding of computational problems together with the
constraints on solutions provide necessary help in the guidance of research in
neuroscience.
