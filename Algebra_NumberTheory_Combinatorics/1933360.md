The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held March 27-29,
2020 at the University of California, San Diego. This will be the 16th annual
edition of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and
has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate
student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Boris Bukh
(Carnegie Mellon University), Laura Escobar (Washington University in St.
Louis), Dana Randall (Georgia Institute of Technology), and Jozsef Solymosi
(University of British Columbia). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable
opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of
taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows
graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping
them further succeed as junior researchers.

Combinatorics is a field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines.
It is a vibrant area for new, innovative research that can involve problems and
techniques within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science,
and analysis. This conference will keep junior investigators aware of the
advances that have been made in this lively and exciting field. The GSCC
provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other
young mathematicians with similar research topics, which can lead to potential
joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration.
