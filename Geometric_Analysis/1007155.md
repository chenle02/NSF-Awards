Dr. Santoro proposes to study special metrics on manifolds. This research
project splits into four parts:the construction of complete Ricci-flat Kaehler
metrics with special asymptotic behavior, the explicit construction of examples
of anti-self dual metrics on 4-manifolds, the existence of Yang-Mills energy
minimizers for Calabi-Yau manifolds, and the existence of complete, constant
mean curvature hypersurfaces in Hyperbolic Space with prescribed behavior at
infinity.

It is hard to overestimate the role played by Calabi-Yau Spaces and Yang-Mills
Theory in Differential Geometry and Physics. Calabi-Yau manifolds, essentially
shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six "unseen" spatial
dimensions of the present model of Universe, are a key object of research in
superstring theory. The problems investigated in this project are among the most
natural in their context and possess several interesting additional applications
in neighboring areas of Mathematics, such as Complex Geometry and Topology.
