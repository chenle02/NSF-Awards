This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The PENGUIn team will continue investigating in depth a
multi-scale electrodynamic system that comprises space environment of Planet
Earth (geospace). Several science topics important to the space physics and
aeronomy are outlines in this proposal that can be broadly categorized as the
following objectives: (a) to study reconnection and waves in the southern cusp
region; (b) to investigate unraveling global geomagnetic substorm signatures;
(c) to understand the dayside wave-particle interactions; and (d) to observe and
investigate various polar cap phenomena and neutral atmosphere dynamics.
Cutting-edge science on these critical topics will be accomplished by acquiring
multi-instrument data from a distributed network of autonomous observatories in
Antarctica, built and deployed with the matured technological achievements. In
the last several years, advances in power supply systems and Iridium data
transmission for the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGOs) have proven
effective for providing real-time geophysical data reliably. Five AGOs that span
from the auroral zone to deep in the polar cap will be maintained providing a
wealth of data for science analyses. Additional instrumentation as GPS-based
receivers measuring total electron content in the ionosphere will be deployed at
AGOs. These scientific investigations will be enriched by complementary
measurements from manned stations in the Antarctic, from magnetically conjugate
regions in the Arctic, and from a fleet of magnetospheric and ionospheric
spacecraft. Continued reliance on students provides a broader impact to this
proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its educational mission.
