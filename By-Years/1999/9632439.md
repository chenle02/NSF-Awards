This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program of the
Chemistry Division. With these funds, Professor Frank Mar√£ of Florida Atlantic
University will study fundamental aspects of the structure-activity
relationships of macromolecular assemblies. Small peptides , typically of
thirteen residues, will be prepared and their stability and folding
characteristics will be examined. A minimalist approach will provide information
on strategies for design of novel protein-based materials and modeling of
folding events in proteins. Structures will be studied using circular dichroism
and nuclear magnetic resonance. Understanding of the basic aspects of dynamic
behavior of biomolecules requires the use of small model molecules, for which
careful and exact control of structure is realizable, to test structural
hypotheses. In this study a series of `designer helical peptides` serves this
purpose and the behavior of members of this series will help illuminate the
behavior of larger but related biologically important molecules.
