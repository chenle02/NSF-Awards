The Principal Investigator will use existing observational data and a state of
the art mesoscale numerical model to investigate a wide range of convective
phenomena such as squall lines, severe storms, convective turbulence, tornadoes
and gust fronts. The objective is to advance fundamental understanding of the
dynamics and physics associated with these events with the ultimate goal of
providing guidance which will assist in more accurate prediction of severe
weather events. Specific objectives include: (1) determining the dynamics and
accompanying environment of long-lived tornadoes; (2) investigating the
convective behavior of an observed squall line through the use of a hydrostatic
regional model coupled to a nonhydrostatic convection model; (3) understanding
the role of boundary-layer convergence/shear boundaries in the generation of
non-supercell tornadoes; (4) probing the behavior of individual convection
within mid-latitude squall lines simulated in environments with horizontal
variability; (5) exploring the dynamics of turbulence under dry, moist, and
precipitating conditions through simulation of the multiple scales involved; and
(6) further development of the modeling, analysis, and visualization for
studying convection.
