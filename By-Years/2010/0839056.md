NSF currently sponsors an intensive summer research workshop series in human
language technology and robust intelligence, organized and hosted by Johns
Hopkins University. These workshops have exhibited a relatively unique model of
interactive peer review, dynamic expert team generation, research acceleration
via a condensed and unusually close collaboration environment and intensive
student mentorship. A Scientific Community On-Site Assessment Workshop (OSAW) is
being held on July 30-31, 2008, to review and and improve upon this model and
investigate the potential for its extension to new scientific disciplines.
During the OSAW, a team of expert research-community stakeholders observes
current summer workshop processes, interviews participants, receives detailed
briefs on prior peer-review, topic-selection and research team recruitment
processes, and reaches findings and makes recommendations regarding these goals.

The OSAW workshop will contribute to the progress of science by: (1) improving
the existing NSF-sponsored intensive summer workshop series that has already
engaged over 300 international participants and lead to hundreds of peer-
reviewed publications and major scientific innovations, (2) the insights and
conclusions reached by the OSAW, especially with respect to the interactive
peer-review and intensive mentorship processes employed by the summer workshop,
have the potential to inform and provide ideas for other peer-review and
mentorship processes, such as utilized by NSF and other organizations, (3) the
recommendations of the OSAW will provide a roadmap for the extension of the
intensive summer-workshop model to other fields, with potential for the
accelerated scientific progress and unique collaboration framework already
realized by this model in human-language-technology fields.
