Dynamics in Glassy and Disordered Systems - The intent of this project is to
continue previous studies of dynamics in glassy and disordered systems, focusing
on three areas. The numerical enzyme technique (previously developed by the PI)
will be used to accelerate the dynamics of a two-component Lennard-Jones model,
to test and refine the PI's scaling theory of the glass transition. The charge-
density-wave depinning transition will also be studied, in particular examining
the sparse regime and phase-organization in the avalanches which occur on the
pinned side of the transition. Finally, the study of logarithmic coarsening in
Ising models without disorder will be shifted from three-dimensional to two-
dimensional, and the scaling and critical properties will be extracted from the
simulation. A major theme in the proposed research is development of the PI's
ideas concerning Darwinian selection of numerical enzymes to accelerate Monte
Carlo simulation. %%% One of the principal areas of current research in
statistical physics is the nature and formation of glassy states. Despite the
lack of detailed understanding concerning the glassy state (even the
identification of glass as a well-defined thermodynamic state is unclear), glass
is the standard paradigm for random systems in general. Beyond the obvious
benefit to be generated by obtaining a better understanding of glass (one of our
societies most important structural materials), the possibility of refining the
analogy between glass and other, closely-related systems as is a relevant goal.
The techniques which are being developed for this study (numerical enzymes) are
quite new, and further investigation of their properties, potential, and
limitations is an additional part of the project. The impact of this new class
of simulation techniques on materials science is potentially very great.
