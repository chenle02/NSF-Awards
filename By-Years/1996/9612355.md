This is a 3-year standard award. Computer support for meeting scheduling is a
focus of active research in several areas, including distributed artificial
intelligence (DAI) and intelligent agents, software engineering, and information
systems. It is also of very high applied interest. However, meeting scheduling
is most significant in being one of the first desktop group support applications
that is widely used in some organizations. The researchers will conduct
empirical studies of the use of this group support technology in settings where
existing technical infrastructures and organizational practices enable all
employees, numbering hundreds or thousands, to fully participate in the use of a
shared system. A deep understanding of successful practice will itself extend
knowledge of organizational behavior in this new technological context, and it
can also guide the research and application of technologies and approaches
developed in the fields mentioned above. The researchers will conduct detailed
interviews, longitudinal observational studies, and broad surveys to determine
factors underlying the success of particular applications, adoption trajectory
within organizations, and emergent behaviors including differences in successful
use across settings. They will also explore the possibility of using this newly-
emergent technology to better understand issues of coordination of work and
technological impact within firms.
