9610076 Chen The principal investigators will study second order partial
differential equations of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic types containing
certain types of nonlinearities. The objectives are: (a) The exploration of
spatio-temporal chaotic vibration phenomena for the one dimensional wave
equation with nonlinear boundary conditions; (b) The use of boundary elements
and quasimonotone iteration techniques to analyze and compute controlled coupled
semilinear elliptic and parabolic systems with point observations and inequality
control constraints; (c) Visualization of state and control on annular and
dumbbell-shaped domains by varying the geometries involved in order to
understand the control effects. The two investigators will develop effective and
innovative theoretical as well as numerical tools to study the nonlinear
problems involved. This research promises to enhance, through visualization, the
understanding of complex nonlinear phenomena and pattern formation in many
fields such as mechanical vibration, acoustics, mathematical biology, chemostat
and chemical reactors, and ecology. This in turn will further aid in the
development of new mathematical techniques for nonlinear sciences.
