St. Olaf College will initiate a 2-week multidisciplinary residential Young
Scholars project for 30 students in 9th grade. Approximately 20 faculty members
in the departments of biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology
will participate in this project. The theme of the program is LIGHT AND VISION
and will consist of classroom activities including lectures/discussions and
laboratories, research projects, and field trips. Participants will explore
career options in the sciences and will work to achieve understanding of ethical
considerations scientists face. Follow-up activities will include student
presentations based on their Young Scholars workshop experience to students and
teachers in their home schools. Each participant will also conduct a short-term
experiment at their home school in the Fall under the guidance of a St. Olaf
faculty person and their 9th grade science teacher.
