Title: Quantum Communication and Cryptography: Protocols and Systems

A functional quantum computer would render all public-key cryptographic
protocols (e.g., RSA, Diffie-Hellman), used for secure communication over the
Internet, insecure; conversely, QKD could save the Internet and enable secure
public communication. Similarly, super-dense coding can potentially double the
classical capacity of a channel, if the parties could share EPR pairs in
advance.

This project is aimed at a theoretical study of issues in quantum informatin
processing, including (1) algorithms for entanglement purification and
distillation, (2) Capacity results for various quantum channels, (3) efficient
entanglement manipulation and pure state management via local quantum operations
and classical communication (LOCC), (4) quantum key distribution using practical
systems, and (5) novel informationally-secure quantum cryptographic protocols
that only quantum systems might enable, but are not known to exist using
classical cryptographic protocols.
