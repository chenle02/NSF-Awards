This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the
development of a new non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT/E) sensor for
in situ monitoring of temperature, stress, and corrosive chemical compounds from
within the core of concrete blocks. The sensor, made of a magnetostrictive
ferromagnetic ribbon embedded inside concrete structures, is remotely detected
via the magnetic higher-order signature. Multiple sensors of different
properties can be arrayed for simultaneously monitoring various parameters. The
harmonic sensor is powered by the magnetic query field used to interrogate the
sensor, thus eliminating the need of battery replacement or physical wire
connections to the sensors. The sensor effectively has an unlimited lifetime,
certainly comparable to that of the buildings and structures it could be used to
monitor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since each harmonic sensor costs less than a
fraction of penny, the application of this sensor technology for highway and
building-health monitoring can significantly reduce the maintenance cost of
these structures and, perhaps more importantly, inform as to whether the
building is still structurally stable after an earthquake, explosion, etc.
