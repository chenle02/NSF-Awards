Cells often send messages to each other in the form of proteins secreted from
one cell and received at the surface of a neighboring cell. One important family
of signaling proteins is called the "Wnt" family. Wnt family proteins are
essential for embryonic cells and adult stem cells to polarize, i.e., to
position specific cellular components on one side of a cell. Wnt signaling also
plays critical roles in cancer, and loss of cell polarity is an early hallmark
of many cancers. As a result, there is great interest in understanding exactly
how Wnt signals work to polarize cells. Whether Wnt signals function as
positional cues for cell polarization, or alternatively as permissive signals
that function with unknown positional cues, has long been a matter of debate.
This project uses an innovative system in which one can position a Wnt signaling
source on a single cell and follow cell polarization in living cells by filming
the movements of fluorescently-tagged proteins through a microscope. Preliminary
results using this system have produced a surprise: Although Wnt-expressing
cells can function as positional cues for cell polarization, purified, active
Wnt protein cannot. This result raises the possibility that Wnt proteins may be
permissive signals for cell polarization directed by as-yet unknown cues. This
hypothesis will be examined to reveal the exact mechanisms of cell polarization,
and by identifying important molecules involved in these mechanisms. This
project will also train students to conduct research.
