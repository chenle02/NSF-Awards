This award supports the CyberInfrastructure for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets REU
Site (CReSIS-REU) with a focus in areas of polar science and cyberinfrastructure
(CI). Students participating in the CReSIS REU site will be assigned to research
teams within the CReSIS Science and Technology Center. The project will engage
20 students annually in both center-based research training and professional
development activities. Follow-up activities begin after the 8-week internship
when participants will be involved virtually in CReSIS lectures, seminars,
training, and All Hands events. The program will provide summer educational
opportunities, for undergraduate students, in the area of cyberinfrastructure
and polar science and will attract a diversified pool of talented students into
careers in science, and engineering, including teaching and research related to
polar science and cyberinfrastructure. The intellectual merit of the CReSIS-REU
site is that it will be interdisciplinary and educational in focus and make
innovative cost effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project builds upon
novel partnerships across the discipline areas of radars, engineering, modeling
of ice sheets, and cyber-infrastructure. The broader impacts of this REU Site
are that it will support activities in science, education, diversity and
outreach and will train the next generation of scientists, engineers and
educators interested in polar science and cyberinfrastructure. The vision for
this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on integration of research
and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into engineering,
polar science and cyberinfrastructure related careers including teaching and
educational research. The project will involve 60 undergraduate students over
the three-year period.

This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
REU program.
