The PI propose to test if the prokaryotic EcoRI DNA methyltransferase (MTase)
catalyzes methylation at N6 of adenine via a covalent intermediate involving
cysteine 223 and the C6 position of adenine. This will be tested by constructing
and testing mutant enzymes containing serine, glycine or alanine in place of
cysteine 223. The existence of a covalent intermediate will be further tested
with a mechanism-based inhibitor designed to activate the enzyme by forming a
covalent linkage between cysteine 223 and the inhibitor. In addition to
elucidating the chemical mechanism of this enzyme, these results may provide a
new class of highly specific inhibitors as well as providing insights into the
design of (bio)catalysts with novel substrate specificities and mechanisms.
using both random and nonrandom in vitro mutagenesis methods, the substrate
specificity of the enzyme will be offered. Specificity mutants will be
identified through molecular selection and gene amplification using polymerase
chain reaction techniques. Understanding which amino acids are critical for DNA
recognition will aid in understanding of sequence- specific DNA modification
mechanisms and may aid the design of agents with novel specificities.
