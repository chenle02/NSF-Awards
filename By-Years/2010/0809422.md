The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program at NSF Division of Chemistry will
support the research project of Prof. Sheryl Tucker of the University of
Missouri-Columbia. The objective of the study is to investigate the properties
of recently developed supramolecular capsules in order to gain better
understanding of these unique, manmade nanocontainers, discover the extent of
their versatility through modifications, and push the creative limits of their
use. Prof. Tucker and her students will examine which species are most
successfully ensnared and organized within supramolecular capsules. They will
also create chiral nanopockets to facilitate selective host-guest interactions
and design new nanocapsules with the ability to communicate with each other
through extended space. An increased understanding of the principles governing
the capsule self-assembly, host-guest properties and reaction chemistry in a
nanoscale microenvironment will lead to an improvement of existing materials,
the creation of new nanocapsules and provide insight into living systems. The
study will impact a wide range of practical applications including drug delivery
systems, microreactors, molecular recognition components, catalysts and
separation resins. To further advance research and education infrastructures and
partnerships, this research program includes trainees from traditionally
underrepresented groups, who are involved in an interdisciplinary research
program at the forefront and interface of materials and analytical sciences, and
ignites children's interest in science through the nationally recognized "Magic
of Chemistry" outreach program.
