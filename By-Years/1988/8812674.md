Maps are the fundamental medium of geography. The information they contain and
their underlying cartographic concepts and techniques, register the development
of human thought about the world. Maps are ubiquitous in past societies; they
record innumerable aspects of cultural, scientific, economic, intellectual,
political, and social activity. The historical study of maps is
interdisciplinary, because maps are major parts of the discourse in a wide range
of scientific, social scientific, and humanistic subjects. The history of
cartography has matured to the point where it should survey itself, considering
its weaknesses and strengths. This multi-volume reference work will provide the
first world-wide history of maps and mapping from prehistory to the present that
is truly representative of all major cultures and periods, but it will function
as far more than a fundamental reference. The volumes will make major
philosophical and methodological statements about the importance of maps in
human history, and they will demonstrate the relevance of a proper history of
cartography to a wide range of disciplines. The first volume, Cartography in
Prehistoric, Ancient, and Medieval Europe and the Mediterranean has been
published. Scholars throughout the world are continuing work on subsequent
volumes, (2) Cartography in the Traditional Asian Societies, (3) Cartography in
the Age of Renaissance and Discovery, (4) Cartography in the Age of Science,
Enlightenment, and Expansion, (5) Cartography in the Nineteenth Century, and (6)
Cartography in the Twentieth Century. Contributors and consultants to the work
involve an international group and hence the work embraces non-western
cartographic traditions. This multi-volume history of cartography is important
in the wider context of general knowledge. It also has a defined and significant
niche within the history and philosophy of geographical thought, and it is a
tool of interpretative evaluation for the many systematic branches of geography
that employ maps as historical evidence. The History of Cartography provides the
opportunity to document the history of maps as the visual language of geography,
and it places cartographic interactions within the development of the discipline
as a whole. The volumes also identify specific links between cartography and the
other scientific and technological disciplines that have affected mapmaking and
map development. The completed work will be the most comprehensive assessment of
the field, and it will contribute knowledge to a large number of scientific
fields on an international basis.
