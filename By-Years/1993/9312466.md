This award provides partial support for the Plant Biochemistry Summer Course to
beheld from June 30 to July 18, 1993 on the campus of University of Wisconsin in
Madison, Wisconsin. The general format of the course consists of two morning
lectures and a formal evening discussion led by the lecturer of the day,
followed by an informal discussion by all participants. Tutorials are planned as
well. Approximately 25 lectures will be given by the world experts in various
branches of plant biochemistry fields. The course is organized to accommodate up
to 50 students and is open to graduate students, potsdocs, industrial
scientists, and professors. The purpose is to expose interested students to
modern aspects of plant biochemistry and increase general level of interest to
plant biochemistry. The course is jointly supported by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Energy.
