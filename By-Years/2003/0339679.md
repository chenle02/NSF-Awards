This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of limiting surface oxidation of ultra-fine (1-10 micron) solder
powder for electronic solder paste. Today, the use of ultra-fine powder for
increased resolution of paste printing on printed wiring boards (PWBs) is
impeded by the excessive oxide burden on the powder's huge surface area. If this
impediment could be removed, and ultra-fine powders were supplied commercially,
not only could PWB component population density increase by 10 times or more,
but new forms of solder-paste printing, such as Drop-on-Demand, could be
innovated. In this project, oxide control will be demonstrated with two
approaches: 1) oxygen-barrier coatings applied in the powder-production
apparatus and 2) addition of trace amounts of alloying metals which can protect
the powder surface. Assay methods that can profile, in nanometer steps, the
oxide layer on the solder spheres, will be employed. The ultra-fine powder will
be produced by an existing process developed under an NSF/SBIR Phase II award.

The commercial application of this project is in the manufacture of printed
wiring boards. The world sales of solder paste for surface-mounted components on
PWBs is more than $500million/year. Most of the paste is applied by
stencil/squeegee printing. That process wastes about 30% of the paste or about
$150 million per year. One objective of this project is to reduce waste by
higher resolution printing. However, that cannot be achieved unless ultra-fine
solder powder is available at a competitive price (about $0.05/g). As components
become smaller (e.g., flip chips), the population is controlled by paste-
printing resolution, not by component size. Financial implications of these
outcomes should be sizeable.
