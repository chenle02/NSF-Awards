This project is an ethnographic study of client governance in Project Head
Start. Head Start, a federal pre-school program for poor families that has
gained wide public acceptance, gives parents--generally poor women--substantial
legal power to make management decisions at the local level. Head Start's client
governance component has endured for over a quarter century and remains strong.
As such, the program provides a rich store of empirical data on issues of
institutional design and cultural pluralism that are both timely and poorly
understood. Through demographic and archival research, open-ended interviews
with parents and staff, participant observation, and conversational analysis of
parent deliberations, the study will provide a detailed, comparative account of
the interplay between legal framework and local culture in Head Start's client
governance process. Two broad themes, power and community, will structure the
data collection and guide the data analysis over a one-year period in two field
sites. Parent participation provides an opportunity to explore problems of
democratic control over bureaucracies. This research will address theoretical
and policy-oriented issues relating to the law's capacity to facilitate greater
participation by ethnically and economically subordinated groups in the social
institutions of the welfare state. The study will inform our understanding of
how parent governance is being enacted, how the formal structure of the law is
guiding that enactment, and how that enactment distributes power and facilitates
community at the local level. As such, it will illuminate the complex processes
of citizen governance and will suggest how the law might more effectively enable
the well- being of women and their families within those communities. Also, the
research will provide a basis for more generally assessing the potential and
limits of parent governance reforms in education.
