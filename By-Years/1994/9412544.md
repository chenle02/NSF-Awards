ABSTRACT CTS-9412544 Umit Ozkan This is a fundamental study of the catalytic
phenomena involved in the activation and partial oxidation of methane and
ethane. The objectives include investigation of the natures of the active sites
responsible for alkane activation and oxygen insertion on supported and
unsupported vanadia and molybdena catalysts, control of selectivity on these
sites by modifiers (both promoters and inhibitors) such as alkali metals,
phosphorus, and halides, the roles of coreactants and additives on the reaction
schemes, and the reaction networks responsible for partial oxidation of methane
and ethane. Catalysts are characterized both before and after reaction using BET
surface-area measurements, pore size distribution, X-ray diffraction, X-ray
fluorescence, laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger
electron spectroscopy, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and thermal analysis
techniques. In - situ laser Raman characterization is combined with isotopic
labelling to identify oxygen insertion sites. Steady- state and transient
kinetic studies and isotopic labelling are used as mechanistic probes to examine
the catalytic routes to partial and complete oxidation. Methane and ethane are
readily available inexpensive feedstocks, and the conversion of methane to
formaldehyde or methanol and ethane to ethylene or acetaldehyde has been a major
objective of catalytic technology. These conversions are easy to achieve, but
the fine control needed to isolate these products has been elusive; most
processes produce mainly carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which are formed
both from competitive reaction pathways and from further oxidation of the
indended products. Better understanding of the operative mechanisms will permit
new control strategies to solve this classical problem.
