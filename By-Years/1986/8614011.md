Investigations of the configuration, physical properties, and dynamics of the
portion of the West Antarctic inland ice sheet that flows in to the floating
Ross Ice Shelf will be continued. Two seasons of field work (1987-88 and
1988-89) will be followed by one year of data analysis (1989-90). The emphasis
of this work will be to study further the characteristics and distribution of
the active subglacial till layer found under one section of ice stream B, to
compare and contrast ice streams B and C and the intervening ridge with respect
to their basal characteristics, internal physical constitutions, and surface
configurations, and to conduct a reconnaissance survey of ice streams D and E.
Measurement methods will include airborne radar, seismic shooting, and recording
of microearthquakes. Supplementary investigations will include ground-based
radar studies of crevasse depths, basal reflection strengths and depolarization
phenomena, and electrical resistivity profiles. Gravity measurements,
determinations of ice-movement rates, and core sampling for calculation of
surface net balance rates will be carried out in cooperation with other ongoing
research.
