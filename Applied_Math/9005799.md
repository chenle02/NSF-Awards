This project concerns two problems involving the averaging of partial
differential equations with important applications go Physics. The first one
consists of studying the response tensor, i.e. the tensor of effective
properties of a composite material in which different processes are coupled,
such as thermoelectric or thermoelastic media. The second is to study the long
time, large-scale asymptotics of diffusion-advection equations in which the
velocity is a random, incompressible field, with a continuum of excited space
and time scales. This equation is known to exhibit interesting crossover
phenomena, which are not well understood in the multidimensional case. The
principal investigator hopes to develop new mathematical insight to such
problems, based on the theory of homogenization. In particular, the advection-
diffusion problem involves understanding renormalization of equations with
random coefficient outside the regime in which mean-field theory is valid.
