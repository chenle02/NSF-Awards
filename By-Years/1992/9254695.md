A three-year project, Science And Youth (SAY), integrates the existing
curriculum, instructional design, and training capacity of the 4-H Science
Experiences and Resources for Informal Educational Settings (SERIES) project
with high school students exploring careers in teaching at eleven existing
"teaching magnet" high schools across the country. The SAY project expands the
quantity and quality of informal science education experiences by accomplishing
the following objectives: 1) prepare one thousand teenage teachers/leaders to
present SAY activities to forty thousand elementary school age youth: 2) involve
participating youth in a total of five hundred community service projects; 3)
involve five hundred teenage leaders in mentoring relationships with local
scientists, and; 4) have seventy-five percent of the participants continue their
education in science and/or the teaching profession. SAY uses a teens-as-leaders
model to engage younger youth (ages 9-13) in hands-on, inquiry-based science
activities that result in science-based community services projects. SAY offers
youngsters a vehicle for experiencing how science problem solving strategies are
applied to home and community problems. The pedagogy of the SAY project
represents the best of current research on science education, and offers an
innovative model for the preparation of a new cadre of science teachers.
