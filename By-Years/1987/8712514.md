College of Wooster is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support 8 students for the summer of 1987, of which several
will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include the
following: o Synthesis of low molecular weight polyhedral silsesquioxanes o
Structural studies of compounds similar to vitamin B-12 o Magnetic resonance and
differential scanning Calorimeter studies of the water content in biological
tissues
