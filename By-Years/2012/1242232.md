The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research
(EAGER)award is to explore, characterize, and map the use of user-centric design
methods and tools. TheDesignExchange will provide a mechanism for investigators
to answer questions pertaining to the motivation for the choice of and use of a
particular design method for a design problem. TheDesignExchange will offer a
centralized venue where human-centered design methods will be shared, discussed
and disseminated, so that the research community can then engage in research to
provide explanations as to how the various methods within the design process
relate to each other. TheDesignExchange will increase researchers' understanding
of structured design processes, and will also be an invaluable resource to train
novice and professional engineers and designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the outcomes of this award will result in an interactive web portal
to facilitate the capture, analysis and widespread use of human-centered design
methods, together with the insights as to how these methods will be best used
for maximum success of the design venture. TheDesignExchange will be powered by
a multidisciplinary community contributed database, which will allow
practitioners and researchers to more deeply understand the use of design
methods in practice and will facilitate the exchange of information between
industry and academia. A workshop will be held in conjunction with this work at
the 2012 NSF CMMI Grantees Conference. The outcomes of this workshop will form
the basis of the research agenda for TheDesignExchange platform, including
hypotheses for an ontology that maps human-centered design methods to real-world
design problems, which will be made available to both industry and the research
community.
