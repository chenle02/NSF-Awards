This SBIR Phase I research deals with the development of a type of reinforced
soil. Granular soil will be mixed with small reinforcing elements (synthetic
polypropylene or somewhat similar material). The reinforcing increases the
resistance of the mix to tensile forces, greatly improving the engineering
properties of the reinforced soil.
