This project is the first year of a 5-year continuing Presidential Young
Investigators grant. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Research Summary: This project focuses
on the characterization, kinetics and thermodynamics of mixtures containing
hundreds to thousands of components, particularly air pollutants and hazardous
wastes. Current topics of investigation include the characterization of
hazardous chemical mixtures, thermodynamic and kinetic modeling of synthetic
fuels, the development of a catalytic hydrodechlorination process for recycling
chlorinated organics and establishing new methods for characterizing atmospheric
aerosols.
