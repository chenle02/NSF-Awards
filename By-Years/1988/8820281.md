This award provides support for developing a new technique for sulfur isotopic
analysis in natural samples of geochemical interest. The technique employs
sulfur hexafluoride for measuring mass 33, 34 and 36 sulfur simultaneously. It
will be developed in the laboratories of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington's Geophysical Laboratory by the Principal Investigator. The
developmental work will include the construction of an appropriate vacuum
extraction system and reaction vessels for the fluorination of very small
samples of natural sulfide materials with bromine pentafluoride. The value of
this technique is in the search for non mass-dependent isotope fractionation
effects in meteorites and in terrestrial physical-chemical processes.
