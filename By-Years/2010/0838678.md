This award provides travel support for indigenous scholars and students to
attend the Sixth International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS VI) to
be held August 22-26, 2008 at the University of Greenland, Nuuk, Greenland. The
ICASS is an IPY endorsed project that will bring international Arctic social
scientists, scientists from other fields, indigenous scholars and community
members, and students together to discuss current research, education and
outreach to northern communities, and future directions for arctic social
science research. The primary goal of the NSF support is to facilitate the
participation of underrepresented groups and students in this important
scientific forum.
