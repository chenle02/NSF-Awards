The projects outlined in this proposal are directed toward the interplay between
homotopy theory, group theory, and the topology of function spaces. Artin's
braid group plays a central role. The main projects are as follows: (1)
continuation of a program to finish Barratt's finite exponent conjecture, (2)
computations of the group cohomology for certain discrete groups with varying
choices of representations, (3) a further investigation of the connections
between the cohomology of function spaces, group cohomology, as well as the
connections with the topology of function spaces, configuration spaces, and
hyperplane arrangements, (4) an analysis of the overlap of properties of
homotopy groups with other structures such as the Lie algebra attached to the
descending central series for Artin's pure braid group, and the Lie algebra
obtained from the higher homotopy groups of configuration spaces, and (5) a
detailed analysis of certain groups of coalgebra morphisms as well as their
connections to braid groups, and homotopy theory.

The main goals of the projects here involve geometry of circles moving through
space. These circles can be thought of as the motions of planetary objects in
orbit around each other. The interplay between the geometry of these orbits
occurs in mathematics as well as in mathematical physics. Precise information
concerning these orbits has provided fruitful mathematical applications to
several subjects. The ultimate goal of this project is to measure different
quantities in the subject as well as analyzing concrete useful answers, and
computations.
