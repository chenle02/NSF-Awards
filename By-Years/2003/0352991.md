AST-0352991/Taylor, Caltech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support the
development of a novel tunable filter for astronomy based on two sequential
Volume Phase Holographic gratings. Extensive simulations will be performed and a
tabletop prototype will be built. If successful, such filters may allow higher
efficiency compared to filters of similar bandwidths, and improve imaging
capabilities of a variety of targets of astrophysical interest. This work may
provide important insights in the construction of similar instruments for large
telescopes.
