The ability to control the transport of small molecules through very small pores
in membranes is important for a variety of applications such as the development
of drug delivery systems and separation techniques. An improved understanding of
the fundamental chemistry that controls the transport of small molecules would
have broad biomedical, biotechnology, and environmental implications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN)
Program supports the work of Professor Eugene Pinkhassik of the University of
Connecticut focusing on regulating the transport of small molecules through
gated nanopores and creating nanocapsules capable of rapid uptake and release of
small molecules. The transport will be regulated by controlling the chemical
environment of nanopores and by reversible binding of plugs or lids. This
interdisciplinary project integrates research and training with outreach
activities aimed at underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
