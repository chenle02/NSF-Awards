9625552 Ney ABSTRACT Research will be carried out in two general areas: large
deviation theory, and cascade theory. In large deviation theory, regeneration
and renewal methods will be used to extend the applicability of sub-additivity
arguments to Markov additive processes and to infinite memory chains. This
yields quick and direct methods to establish existence of a large deviation
principle. New techniques for identifying the relevant rate functions will be
investigated. Large deviation of the iterates of certain monotone maps related
to the infinite order chains will be studies by the above methods. Electron-
photon cascades will be studied as special cases of multi-type branching random
walks. An open question on the balance between electrons and photons above a
fixed energy at large depths of an absorber will be studied. Large deviation
theory is the study of the estimation and approximation of very small
probabilities. These arise in the study of transmission errors in information
communication, in studying large exceedances in random networks, in estimating
failure probabilities in large systems (e.g. insurance companies) and many other
settings. New techniques will be developed and applied to study the rate at
which these probabilities decrease as the number of observations increases. A
second subject to be studied is a model for electron-photon cascades, in
particular, the ratio of the number of electrons to photons above a given energy
level.
