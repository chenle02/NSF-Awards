The recent advancements in emerging technologies and the greater integration of
renewable energy resources have increased interest in distributed flexible
energy resources. However, barriers to the deployment of these resources
continue, due to difficulties in evaluating their contributions to the
operability of the power grid, in designing compensation mechanisms, and in
eliciting participation. This project will investigate market models with
several novel features for encouraging the large-scale deployment of distributed
flexible energy resources. In particular, neither the power aggregator nor the
distributed energy resources will be required to commit in advance to buy or
supply power at specific times. Instead, permissions to operate will be sent at
random times to a subset of program participants, who then have the right but
not the obligation to act. The research is expected to provide insights to
utilities, regulators, and policy makers regarding the design of efficient and
attractive deployment programs. Beyond the focus area of Clean Energy, the
expected outcomes of this research will be applicable to many situations where
events arrive at random times at a rate influenced by upper-level decisions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to analyze the proposed market models
in a general setting and to develop theory and algorithmic strategies for the
class of two-level continuous-time stochastic control problems coupled with
point processes. Statistical properties of point processes will make
coordination schemes extensible to more aggregation levels and participants. By
introducing randomness in opportunities to act in order to elicit behaviors,
while remaining nonbinding for the participating resources, a favorable
environment will be created to foster investment and the deployment of flexible
resources at the level of the distribution network.
