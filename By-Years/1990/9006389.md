The Committee on Vision (CoVIS) is a standing committee of the National
Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, which is supported by
contributions from several federal agencies. It provides analysis and advice to
those sponsoring agencies, on issues involving the human visual system,
including questions of physiological and physical optics, neurophysiology,
psychophysics, perception, engineering and equipment, computer vision,
environmental effects on vision, and visual disorders. The committee of twelve
members helps select and define activities of several working groups dealing
with specific topics of concern to the sponsors. Results of this work are
published in reports available to scientists, the public, and to industry, and
have impact on many areas of vision science.
