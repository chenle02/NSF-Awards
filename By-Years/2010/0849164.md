The role of water-backbone interactions in stabilizing peptide conformation has
become an exciting area of study, both by computational and experimental
approaches. This project will build upon the PI''s previous work on the
development of isotope-edited infrared techniques by taking four different
approaches to the study of backbone-water hydrogen bonding: (1) the effects of
high pressure on solvent-backbone interactions; (2) backbone dehydration by
helix-promoting fluorinated co-solvents; (3) selective backbone dehydration in
helices by side-chain shielding effects; and (4) conformation and solvation of
N-methylated peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the work in this project will
be carried out with undergraduate women who are students at Mount Holyoke
College. The research experience gained will be important to the training of
many new scientists. In the past 12 years, the PI has worked with 55
undergraduate researchers. Fifteen of these are currently enrolled or have
completed Ph.D. programs in chemistry or related fields. This project is being
jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division.
