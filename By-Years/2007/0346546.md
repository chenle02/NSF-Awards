Learning in honeybees&lt;br/&gt;M.E. Bitterman &amp; Patricia A.
Couvillon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although invertebrates comprise more than 95% of
all animal species, there has been little systematic study of their learning. To
remedy that deficiency has been the goal of this ongoing research with the
honeybee -- a highly-evolved invertebrate, readily available in large numbers,
and of great economic importance, whose sensory, motor, and motivational
properties are unusually well-suited to the purpose. The experiments are done
primarily with free-flying foragers that are trained to come to a laboratory
window for sucrose solution varying in amount and concentration. Despite the
remoteness of the evolutionary relationship and the vast disparities in brain
size and structure, the experiments show some striking similarities in the
performance of honeybees and vertebrates. The similarities may reflect the
operation of common learning principles, although some very interesting
differences also have been found which invite further study, and the main
concerns of this grant period are with those differences. Experiments in three
major areas are planned: risk-sensitivity in foraging choices, learning about
nonreward, and short-term memory. The work is expected to contribute to the
further development of a rigorous, quantitative theory of learning in honeybees,
as well to as our basic understanding of intelligence and its
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
