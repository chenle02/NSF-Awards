9451359 MacWhinney The laboratory microcomputer has become a crucial tool for
conducting experiments in psychology. This project therefore supports the
deployment of a computer program, called PsyScope, that will remove this
technological barrier. A national prototype is being developed for the use of
this program as the backbone for the teaching of Research Methodology in
Psychology. Construction of this prototype involves completion of (1) an
introductory manual, (2) a series of standard experiment types, and (3) the
building of tools for linking experimental design to statistical analysis
programs. Working through a consortium of universities and colleges, we plan to
disseminate this prototype throughout the nation. It is also expected that
successful deployment of this system nationwide will lead to a major improvement
in the research training of the future generation of experimental psychologists.
