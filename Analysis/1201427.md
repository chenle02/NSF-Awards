The PI proposes to study several problems in geometric function theory that have
as common underlying theme "conformal invariants" such as the hyperbolic and
Kobayashi metric, harmonic measure, Green's functions, and modulus of path
families. One such problem consists in studying dimensionality properties of
p-Harmonic measure on domains beyond simply-connected ones. A second question
deals with generalizations of the Chang-Marshall theorem in space, namely with
exponential integrability properties for the trace of analytic functions, and
their quasiregular counterparts in higher dimensions, when restricted to the
boundary. A third problems studies iteration of analytic functions in one and
several dimensions with a focus on the interplay between complex dynamics and
the hyperbolic geometry of the unit disk in the complex plane and of the unit
ball in higher dimensions.

This research will also draw on the properties of conformal invariants mentioned
above to obtain concrete applications in the study of large networks. This is an
area that has become more salient with the advent of the internet and the need
to analyze large databases (so-called massive data-sets). One example that most
people are familiar with is search-engines. The way internet searches work is
through random processes that continually sample the web and periodically return
averages and other statistics. The simplest such process is called a random
crawler or walker and the mathematics that governs its behavior is derived from
the study of conformal invariants in geometric function theory. The PI is
conducting research that is expected to bring new tools to the task of comparing
the behavior of such random processes to the geometry of the data-set. Because
of the large applicability of such results the PI will also study the problem of
epidemic outbreaks. In this context the PI has already obtained initial funding
from the Center for Engagement and Community Development at Kansas State
University for a joint project with Professor Scoglio in the Department of
Electrical and Computing Engineering and Professor Schumm in the Department of
Family Studies. Our team collected data in the city of Chanute, Kansas, and has
already built a "contact" network, which is now being analyzed using the
conformal invariants mentioned above. The ultimate goal is to provide the city
of Chanute with a concrete set of directions that could help its city officials
mitigate and manage an epidemic outbreak, especially one of zoonotic nature,
originating on a farm.
