The development of geometry as an abstract discipline is based on shared human
intuitions about dimension, direction, and distance. In the setting of non-
commutative geometry where the notion of locality ceases to make sense, these
intuitions usually offer little guidance, so that mathematicians are forced to
fall back on algebraic and computational tools. The study of symplectic
manifolds provides, via mirror symmetry, an approach to non-commutative geometry
that starts from an honest geometric space and produces a non-commutative one
formed by a class of subspaces called Lagrangians. For example, the algebras
known to mathematicians as Clifford algebras and to physicists as Dirac matrices
arise from the study of circles in the sphere. This research project will
investigate such non-commutative spaces in higher dimensions, relating them to a
program whose goal is to understand symplectic manifolds via the associated non-
commutative spaces known as Fukaya categories.

The project focuses on the setting of symplectic manifolds admitting Lagrangian
torus fibrations. The investigator recently extracted a local-to-global
description of the Fukaya category in this case. This research will pursue a
series of projects aimed at extending the applicability of local-to-global
approaches to general symplectic manifolds; this will require developing new
tools for studying and computing Fukaya categories. The investigator aims to
systematically develop these tools, starting from situations where they will
provide alternate descriptions of Fukaya categories (e.g., for cotangent
bundles). The project will also explore applications to the study of Lagrangian
embeddings and to extensions of mirror symmetry.
