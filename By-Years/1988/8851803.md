This project introduces students in this institution's mining program to state-
of-the-art surveying practices. By exposing students to Total Surveying
Stations, not only is their surveying experience enhanced, experiments are
performed that were not possible before the advent of equipment of the type used
in this project. In their field work, students get hands-on experience and
retrieve digital data with portable devices. In their laboratory work, students
have a collection of software tools whereby they analyze their field data and
use graphical programs to display and manipulate collections of their field
data. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
