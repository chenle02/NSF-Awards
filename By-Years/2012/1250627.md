The Web has made humans smarter, providing ready access to vast amounts of
knowledge and facts. The Semantic Web has the capacity to similarly enhance
computer programs and devices by giving them access to enormous volumes of data,
facts and knowledge. This project is exploring the feasibility of automatically
extracting new knowledge directly from data found in spreadsheets, database
relations, and document tables and representing it as highly interoperable
linked open data (LOD) in the Semantic Web language RDF. The extraction is
guided by probabilistic graphical models that use statistical information mined
from current LOD knowledge resources. To demonstrate the potential payoff of the
research, the system is used to extract knowledge from tables collected from
medical journals and tables from web sites like data.gov.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the W3C semantic web languages RDF and OWL are used
to represent the knowledge, the results are applicable to other semantic data
frameworks such as Microdata (Search Consortium), Freebase (Google), Probase
(Microsoft) and the Open Graph (Facebook). The open sourced prototype software
allows other researchers to experiment with automatically producing semantically
enriched data from tables for their domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
such software extraction systems are expected to become part of a new online
knowledge ecology -- both consuming existing LOD knowledge to understand the
intended meaning implicit in a table and producing new facts and knowledge that
will become part of Web. This represents a dramatic increase in the breadth and
depth of public semantic data that can make "big data" analytics more effective.
