Overview and Intellectual merit:

This project extends and combines historical and recent ocean data sets to
investigate ice-ocean-interactions along the Pacific continental margin of the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The synthesis focuses on the strikingly different
environments on and near the cold Ross Sea and warm Amundsen Sea continental
shelves, where available measurements reach back to ~1958 and 1994,
respectively. On the more extensively covered Ross Sea continental shelf,
multiple reoccupations of ocean stations and transects are used to extend our
knowledge of long-term ocean freshening and the mass balance of the world?s
largest ice shelf. On the more rugged Amundsen Sea continental shelf, which
contains the earth?s fastest melting ice shelves, continuing research on
observed thermohaline variability also pursues connections between outer shelf
shoals and vulnerable ice shelf grounding zones.

This interdisciplinary work updates a prior study of ice shelf response to ocean
thermal forcing, and uses chemical tracers to measure changes in shelf, deep and
bottom water transformations and production rates.

Broader Impacts :

Recent and potential future rates of sea level rise are the primary broad-scale
impacts of the ice and ocean changes revealed by observations in the study area.
The overriding question is whether global and regional sea levels will
accelerate gradually, allowing carbon usage reductions to head off the worst
consequences, or so rapidly that they will contribute to major social and
economic upheavals.

Collaborations and data acquired by foreign vessels are also utilized to better
understand the causes of rapid change in these shelf seas and ice shelves, along
with associated wider implications. Data that are re-gridded, re-edited or newly
collated will be archived, and results made available via presentations,
publications, and press releases if warranted.

This proposal does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic
