With this grant in the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Goddard will investigate the mechanisms of
industrially significant catalytic processes (both heterogeneous and
homogeneous). An understanding of these mechanisms will provide the basis for
the design of new and more efficient catalysts. The systems to be studied
include: 1) Oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride by VPO catalysts, 2)
Conversion of methanol to gasoline as catalyzed by zeolites, 3) Activation of CH
and CC bonds by transition metal complexes, and 4) Polymerization of olefins by
Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. Professor Goddard will extend the current
methodology by incorporating the pseudospectral method of Freisner within his
generalized valence bond programs (PS-GVB). This will allow PS-GVB studies on
very large systems including a substantial amount of electronic correlation. In
addition Professor Goddard will be able to calculate GVB wave functions for
infinite systems, allowing direct calculations of bulk and surface properties
instead of using cluster models.
