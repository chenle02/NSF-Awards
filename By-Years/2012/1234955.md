This project studies an approximation methodology known as mean field
equilibrium (MFE), &lt;br/&gt;which can be used for management, design, and
control of large dynamic economic systems &lt;br/&gt;such as financial markets,
power markets, sponsored search auctions, online marketplaces,&lt;br/&gt;and
resource sharing systems such as cloud computing platforms. &lt;br/&gt;In a mean
field equilibrium, individuals &lt;br/&gt;postulate that fluctuations in the
empirical distribution of other&lt;br/&gt;players' states have "averaged out"
due to large scale, and thus&lt;br/&gt;optimize holding the state distribution
of other players fixed. &lt;br/&gt;MFE simplifies system description, making
optimization, design, and&lt;br/&gt;control possible. Such a simplification in
the equilibrium concept&lt;br/&gt;delivers the best of both worlds: not only is
it more believable, but&lt;br/&gt;it provides a tool to understand the impact of
parameter and design&lt;br/&gt;changes on the performance of these complex
dynamic systems. This&lt;br/&gt;project develops methods to mathematically
characterize regimes where MFE&lt;br/&gt;is a viable equilibrium concept, as
well as to develop algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;compute and learn
MFE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research results could be employed
in practice&lt;br/&gt;to leverage the huge advances in computation and
availability of big data &lt;br/&gt;generated by complex economic systems for
developing&lt;br/&gt;more structured and principled prediction of the impact of
design&lt;br/&gt;changes. In support of this goal, the project includes efforts
to make MFE&lt;br/&gt;techniques accessible to engineering students through
educational&lt;br/&gt;materials and course curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
