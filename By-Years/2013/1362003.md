The objective of this award is to study a new class of optimization models where
general shape constraints specify the function form, and a maximin criterion is
used to resolve the function ambiguity. For many data driven decision problems
the functions specifying the problem are obtained from the data through model
fitting. This model fitting is done based on a presumed form of the function.
The decisions are subsequently made by optimizing the fitted functions. In the
modeling framework the function set is specified using properties of the
function and non-parametric model fitting. Such problems are called function
robust optimization problems. Different types of function robust models will be
analyzed and algorithms will be developed for solving these
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
lead to the development of a new class of optimization modeling techniques and
algorithms for solving such models. The solutions obtained from such models are
expected to be more robust and efficient under data uncertainty when compared to
those obtained from the classical known approaches. A general methodological
framework that allows ambiguity in the function form will present a significant
conceptual advancement to the field of optimization based decision making.
Applications of such problems range from topics in management, intelligent
control, and engineering design. Experiments will be performed to validate the
algorithms, and to compare the properties of the solutions generated from the
new modeling technique.
