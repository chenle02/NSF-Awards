This research aims to develop and demonstrate surface microstructures that allow
the control of inter-component clearances in micromechanisms. These self-
assembling microstructures (SAMS) operate by moving elements in the plane of the
substrate both to eliminate undesirable clearances and to provide controlled
pre-load forces. A fabrication process is proposed that builds in prescribed
bending moments to actuate flexures upon release from the substrate.
Interdigitated fingers are used to generate electrostatic forces for component
assembly by local resistive heating. A four-pawl resonant micromotor is proposed
as a research vehicle for demonstrating SAMS concepts in a microdynamic system.
