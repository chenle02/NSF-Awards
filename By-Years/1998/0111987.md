Can some candidates benefit from being in contests with more than two
candidates? Traditional theories of political choice assume that increasing the
number of candidates in an election campaign cannot influence voter preferences.
However, a growing body of literature on consumer behavior suggests that varying
the menu of alternatives can influence choices in systematic ways. This Doctoral
Dissertation Research Support project tests whether these findings apply to
collective choices and electoral politics. The student hypotheses that the menu
of available options can influence a voter's decision. When there are more than
two candidates in the race, a compromise effect benefits moderate candidates.
Consequently, when there are more than two candidates, race and party influence
how voters evaluate candidates differently than when there are only two
candidates divided by party label and/or by the candidate's race. The student
focuses on how perceptions of the alternatives and affect towards the candidates
are affected by the set of alternatives. The hypothesis is tested by collecting
experimental data from subjects in different choice situations with a varying
menu of alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interesting and innovative
project promises to enhance our understanding of the topic.&lt;br/&gt;
