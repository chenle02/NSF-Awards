Support will be provided for a workshop to be held at the University of Alaska,
January 26-27, 1985. The main objective of the workshop will be to: determine
present research requirements in arctic civil engineering in the light of
current knowledge; assign priorities based on the diverse concerns and need
associated with arctic development; and document findings in a report to the
Foundation. Research priorities and guidelines in civil engineering will be
updated and reevaluated for the coming decade.
