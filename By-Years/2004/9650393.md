The Chemistry and Physics Departments are increasing their efforts to
strengthen undergraduate degree programs in the sciences. This effort includes
the construction of a microscope-based Raman system. The benefit of constructing
such a system, rather than purchasing it as a commercial unit, is not only to
obtain a Raman spectrometer, but also to gain a better understanding of laser
techniques. Raman experiments yield information about the vibrational and
rotational nature of molecules. These data are useful when performing structural
and chemical analyses. Raman complements infra-red (IR) absorption spectroscopy
because weak IR absorbers are strong Raman scatterers and vice versa. The open
optical cavity, exposed components, and adjustability of laser optics in this
system afford the student a valuable opportunity to investigate the workings of
a simple laser. As any person who works with lasers will testify, hands-on
experience with a laser is absolutely essential to comprehending its operation.
The primary goals of the project are to train undergraduate chemistry and
physics students in the use and application of a microscope-based Raman system;
to develop new laboratory exercises for several courses, including Organic
Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Optics, and Biophysics;
and to extend the breadth of investigative possibilities for undergraduate
student/faculty research.
