When biological thin-film thicknesses or feature dimensions are less than or
equal to the order of magnitude as the wavelengths of solar radiation, several
optical effects are present. Nature has developed these complex biological thin-
film structures to take advantage of these microscale radiation phenomena in
order to control the reflectance and absorption of solar radiation. There is a
need for improved understanding in this field in order to determine the multiple
functions of these structures. Moreover, as global changes affect the solar
spectrum reaching earth, the effectiveness of the thin-film functions will be
altered which in turn may affect the ecology. Additionally, there are lessons to
be learned from biological thin-film structures which may prove to be important
in sub-micron microelectronics, optical coatings, and solar absorbers. We
propose to develop a numerical and experimental tool, the Microscale Reflectance
Spectrometer, which can be used for these investigations. Specifically, the
proposed technology will allow the radiative properties of biological thin-film
structures to be measured and also compared against numerical simulations. The
phenomenological modeling of light/film interaction will be improved for other
biological instruments as well as for the microelectronics industry. We expect
research that will stem from the use of this instrument to play a critical role
in the understanding of the functions of the biological thin-film structures.
