0129516&lt;br/&gt;Perdue&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Michael Perdue and
students from Georgia Tech in a collaboration with Antonius Kettrup of the
Department of Chemistry at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. The aim
of the international project is to describe the distribution of molecular weight
and the pH-dependent distribution of charge in natural organic matter, which is
a highly complex acidic mixture that occurs everywhere in natural waters. This
project will focus on a sample of natural organic matter from the Suwannee
River, Georgia, USA, which is available from the International Humic Substance
Society, and will integrate experimental results from capillary electrophoresis
and potentiometric titration to elucidate the actual distribution of charge in
the matter. The proposed research has a high potential to advance our ability to
deal with important contemporary problems such as environmental toxicology of
metals and organic chemicals an dthe influences of watershed properties on
aquatic systems. The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate
students in the international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;
