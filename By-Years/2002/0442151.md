This project integrates vesiclar protein encapsulation, silica sol-gel
synthesis, and electroporation into a novel silica sol-gel bio-encapsulation
protocol. Contrary to direct entrapment where a protein is usually found
immobilized on a silica surface displaying restricted mobility, this new
protocol uses lipid vesicles to protect the protein from reactive silanol groups
during silica sol-gel synthesis. The resultant protein-silica biocomposite
material can be "activated" in a subsequent step where electroporation is used
to destroy the vesicles and free the protein. The project goal is to develop a
generic bio-encapsulation approach to enhance protein mobility by minimizing
protein to silica surface attachment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to
Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with
the potential to contribute to national security.
