This project investigates trade and economic behavior of prehistoric rural
people living far from large central sites. Multiple theories exist regarding
potential broader scale relations. The focus is on one such region. The project
will study excavated archaeological goods such as pottery, stone tools, shell
artifacts, and jade to determine whether elite trade networks, merchants, or
community markets structured the local economy. The project results can be
compared to other rural areas to study similar economies far from towns, in
other regions of the world. Project members will collaborate with local
inhabitants, train future researchers, and use the research findings in classes
and public presentations. Students of different backgrounds will participate in
the project which will lead to BA, MA, and PhD degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project examines the late prehistoric period. The research will help to
understand the diverse and complex economic structures of peripheries. These
areas were likely more than just resource extraction zones and unspecialized
rural regions as portrayed in the literature. Prior research indicates that some
regions had market exchange of exotics or, conversely, elites managed the
acquisition and distribution of trade goods. Hypotheses regarding the roles of
elites in the trade economy or community-managed markets in the peripheral
economy will be examined by excavations in several households of different
socioeconomic status. Researchers will determine if different trade goods, such
as obsidian, ceramics shell, and jade from other regions, were restricted to
elites in a trade economy based on alliance building through prestige good
exchange, or if the various trade items found across different households
indicate a community-based market system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
