The broader impact of this SBIR Phase 1 project is to create a more
collaborative and efficient way for scientists to combat species loss. The
project proposes to create the a centralized database for a complete view of all
of the issues affecting species survival which can be tracked in real-time. This
project will allow scientists to expedite their research while offering the
public more transparency about environmental data. The company aims to provide a
high level of transparency about what factors are directly and indirectly
affecting species survival and provide actionable steps that businesses,
organizations, governments, and individuals can take to make a difference that
they can see in real-time, and model well into the future. They seek to
democratize conservation and bring new skills, people, and funding streams to
the science and practice of conservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase
1 project consists of the development of a comprehensive database, which exists
in the cloud, that encapsulates all of the factors that affect biodiversity. The
project will result in a robust data system that can host and pull environmental
data from all over the world, track the populations of the worldâ€™s species, and
measure conservation support and influence from the general public. The project
will also allow users to query data in the cloud and use artificial intelligence
(AI) capabilities to further their research. The project will track both
scientific data and data about support efforts from conservation organizations
and the general public. The tracking of these factors will inform decision-
making bodies on what methods are most effective in preserving biodiversity. The
core technical risk to be addressed through Phase I research and development is
standardizing diverse qualitative and quantitative data so that they can be used
together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
