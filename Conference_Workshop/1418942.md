Travel funds are requested to support the participation of a number of U.S.
scientists in a conference entitled "Geometric Analysis and Relativity", to be
held July 6-10 in Hefei, China. The aim of the conference, which will be hosted
and partially supported by the University of Science and Technology of China, is
to bring together a number of the world's leaders in research on the
mathematical aspects of general relativity and cosmology, and to have them
discuss recent developments and new directions of research in these areas with
leading experts in geometric analysis. A key goal of the conference is to expose
promising young mathematicians in China to the exciting research developments in
mathematical relativity.

Many of the recent advances in mathematical relativity have been strongly
stimulated by its close ties to the analysis of black holes and the study of new
cosmological models, and by its potential importance in analyzing and
interpreting data collected by the Laser Interferometric Gravitational
Observatory along with other gravitational wave detection devices. Geometric
analysis has long been a key component of the mathematics of general relativity,
and the recent developments in geometric analysis - especially those related to
geometric flows - are expected to continue to stimulate new ideas and new
analytical approaches in mathematical relativity. Especially note-worthy is the
role that geometric flows have played in the study of the Penrose inequality,
which relates perceived masses and the effective "areas" of black holes. The
conference organizers hope and expect that exposing new researchers to the
interaction of exciting ideas in the confluence of mathematical relativity and
geometric analysis will stimulate further advances in these closely allied
areas.
