This project contributes supplemental funds to aid the dissertation research of
a student of cultural anthropology. The project studies the meanings of
drinking, drunkenness and sobriety among different groups of urban American
Indians in Minneapolis. Through analysis of conversational and narrative
discourse the student investigates the role of drinking in urban Indian life,
and proposes to examine the differences between situational and cultural factors
affecting the meaning of drinking to urban Indians. Methods include sampling
different levels of drinkers (binge, moderate, abstinent), tribes (Dakota,
Ojibwe) as well as differences between men and women. This research is important
because alcohol abuse is a serious problem in urban Indian communities, and
increased understanding of how drinking is understood by different segments of
the community can help health specialists develop intervention programs.
