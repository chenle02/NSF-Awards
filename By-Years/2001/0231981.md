&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to investigate an approach to measuring the
success of school strategies for reform to be used by evaluators. It tests
whether a social network analysis of professional interactions among teachers
can provide a useful indicator of school leaders effectiveness in supporting
reform. It will demonstrate techniques for measuring networks of professional
interactions, changes in social networks as the innovation is initiated, and the
relationship between both and previous capacity, and the criteria for
representing capacity. The study would use technology integration and describe
how the capacity for technology influences classroom practice, such as the speed
of the reforms in increasing use of the Internet. Thus, the study is intended to
show whether ties that form among teachers by talking about technology use
creates enduring collegial ties within schools. It will give information about
the similarities and differences in formation of social networks on technology
and other reforms supported by school leaders in the school. The project is an
exploratory study intended to explore ways of developing a fine-grained tool
that measures interaction within a professional community, such as teachers.
