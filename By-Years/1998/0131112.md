With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University will
acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector and stereo microscope for small
molecule diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: single crystal and fiber diffraction of
phosphazene-based compounds and molecular inclusion clathrates; design and
characterization of multi-dimensional covalent networks; novel methods of
molecular recognition and the preparation of fluorescent chemical sensors;
structural relationships between bioinorganic analogues and metalloprotein
active sites; molecular recognition and artificial photosynthesis in lamellar
and zeolitic solids; relating structural details to the mechanistic aspects of
organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis; structural characterization
of complex natural products and their synthetic precursors; and structure-
function relationships in enantioselective catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts, chemical
sensors, and biochemistry.
