This award is to support the California-Arizona Minority Partnership for
Astronomy Research and Education (CAMPARE) program, led by Cal Poly Pomona, for
their student internship program in the Summer of 2014. CAMPARE is designed to
advance undergraduate Astronomy research and education among Hispanic and other
minority students, in order to promote their participation and advancement in
Astronomy and closely related fields, and increase their numbers in Ph.D.
programs in those fields. Undergraduate students from their home institutions
(mainly in the Cal Poly system) spend a summer working at one of four research
sites (University of Arizona Steward Observatory, SETI Institute, JPL, and
Caltech) on research in Astronomy, Planetary Science, Space Science, or
Astrobiology. Through robust mentoring and support, the program aims to
significantly enhance the recruitment and retention of students from diverse
backgrounds.
