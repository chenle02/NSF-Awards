This project will deliver in-service training in microbiology and human genetics
and will offer training in science teaching strategies to support these areas.
Twenty-five high school biology teachers who need to update and improve their
biological science content and instructional backgrounds will be invited to
attend. The program will consist of three phases. Phase I will be an Academic
Year Program during 1986-87 and will consist of nine full-day Saturday meetings.
Phase II will be an eight-week resident Summer Program during June and August of
1987. Phase III will be a 1987-88 Academic Year Program of nine full-day
Saturday meetings. A two-day meeting of all participants will be held during
April of 1988 to allow participants to consult with Institute faculty and to
share teacher-developed instructional materials. Two or three site visits will
be made to each participant by the faculty.
