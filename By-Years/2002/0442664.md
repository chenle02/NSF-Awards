The PIs plan to exploit large-scale concentration and serial, preparative
fractionation techniques as a means to separate complex microbial assemblages
into their component populations. The goal is to achieve high degrees of
enrichment, or even purity, with a sufficient biomass yield to allow
morphological, biochemical, and genomic analyses on individual microbial
populations without cultivation. The work should result in the development of
methods for more efficiently mining microbial diversity in complex microbial
communities where many of the constituent populations are not readily
cultivable. If successful, this work will make possible simultaneous analysis of
the genome, proteome, and biochemistry of even uncultivated microbes. Successful
purification of large amounts of biomass of selected populations without
culturing will also allow analyses of natural isotopic ratios that could provide
clues to the metabolic processes of those populations in situ.
