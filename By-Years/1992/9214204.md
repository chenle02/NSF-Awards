Saint Mary's College requires its biology majors to conduct an original
research project and to write an undergraduate thesis. Undergraduate research
and research training are key curricular components in developing graduates who
go on to advanced degrees in the life sciences. Saint Mary's is ranked the
number one Catholic college or university in the nation in the ratio of
graduates going on to earn the Ph.D. This commitment to undergraduate research
serves to create an unusually "research active" faculty. A new addition meets
the needs of traditional fields of cellular and molecular biology, genetics,
anatomy and physiology, etc. Renovation of three research facilities is
essential to: 1) build on our successful environmental program; 2) continue to
obtain outside research support; 3) provide more research opportunities for both
staff and students; 4) provide the best possible research training for students;
and 5) make the facilities handicap-accessible. The more efficient renovated
facilities will increase both the quantity and diversity of research and
research training, increase student retention and recruitment and, ultimately
result in more students entering graduate school and eventually scientific
careers. Outside researchers also will make use of the remodeled facilities.
