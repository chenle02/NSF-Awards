Research will focus on the causes of variation in the number of seeds that a
plant produces by donating pollen to other individuals. Preliminary studies of
rose mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos) showed that 1) pollen tubes, which carry
paternal genes to the ovary, often compete for ovules within a flower, and 2)
some individuals have faster growing pollen tubes than others. These differences
among individuals are probably important in determining which plants sire the
most seeds in natural populations. The investigators will examine the relative
importance of genetic vs. environmental effects on pollen performance. They will
also test the hypothesis that pollen tube growth rates are positively correlated
with seedling growth rates. Results can be directly applied to agricultural
problems by determining whether genetically superior seedlings can be
artificially selected by hand-pollinating flowers with large amounts of pollen
from a large group of donor plants. Fundamental questions will also be addressed
about the reproductive ecology of wild plants, which should be conserved for
their potential role as genetic "libraries". Useful genetic variation in this
wild hibiscus could eventually be introduced into related species, such as
cultivated hibiscus, cotton, okra, and kenaf, to improve their vigor and yield.
