0236455&lt;br/&gt;Brodsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will
support an upgrade to a communal geophysics computer facility in the Department
of Earth &amp; Space Sciences at UCLA. The current computing facility is based
on an aging (vintage 1997) Solaris environment consisting of Sun Ultra and SPARC
workstations. A new multi-CPU SunBlade server, five SunBlade workstations and
five PC workstations running Linux will augment this network and will serve
eleven faculty members and their students. An additional 2 TB RAID system will
add significant additional storage capacity for analysis of massive seismic data
holdings. The University will provide funding for both a portion of the new
equipment and also for an upgrade of the Ethernet connection in the Geology
building to 1 Gbit capacity. A portion of this grant will also provide limited
support for the salary of a computer systems administrator during the
installation phase. This upgraded facility will serve not only the startup needs
of the lead PI, Emily Brodsky, for her theoretical models of explosive eruption
dynamics, but also the needs of many other active faculty members including John
Vidale, David Jackson, Heidi Houston , Paul Davis and John Aurnou, to name a
few. The increased computational speed and storage capacity of this compute
facility will foster leading research in earthquake seismology, seismic
tomography and geodynamics. The proposal's broader impacts include both
infrastructure development for multiple researchers and their students and the
promotion of societally relevant earthquake mitigation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;***
