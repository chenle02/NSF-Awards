This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Utilizing biochemical and genetic
methods to dissect how a cyanobacterium senses and responds to changing light
conditions." The test organism is Fremyella diplosiphon. A detailed biochemical
analysis is being made of RcaE, a putative phytochrome-like photoreceptor that
controls the process of complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA). Specifically,
the experiments address the phosphorelay model which holds that RcaE is the
photoreceptor that differentially controls the phosphorylation state of the
response regulator RcaF in different light qualities, which in turn regulates
the phosphorylation levels of RcaC.
