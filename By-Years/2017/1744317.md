MapReduce systems have great capabilities in processing large amounts of data
and have become a research target for governmental, academic and industrial
organizations. However, their task management and fault handling policies do not
recognize a tacit dichotomy that exists between its inherent two phases (map and
reduce). This results in a number of critical issues, such as resource
underutilization, prolonged task execution, myopic speculation, and failure
amplifications. This project adopts a transformative combination of theoretical
analysis, simulation and modeling, and systems design and implementation
approaches in order to reconcile the dichotomy of MapReduce. The techniques from
this project are potentially impactful to all organizations that deploy
MapReduce systems and support Big Data applications from business analytics,
social networks, and scientific computing research. Instead of empirical
analysis of system behaviors to pinpoint resource management and task scheduling
abnormalities, this project takes a different perspective on MapReduce
efficiency and resilience, and formulates a Markov chain for the transition of
Hadoop MapReduce containers, and a fork-join model for the queueing of map and
reduce tasks. These formulations facilitate a theoretical analysis of the
dichotomy of MapReduce and help shed light on its impact to asymptotic behaviors
of large-scale workloads. This project aims to blend simulation and real system
development together, and addresses the myopic speculation caused by dichotomy,
liberates the scope of task speculation, and ensures task resilience without
failure amplifications. These techniques are developed to enhance MapReduce
platforms such as YARN and Spark. Besides the target on MapReduce systems, the
research from this project addresses a general issue in distributed analytics
environments.
