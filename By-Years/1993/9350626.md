The program begins with a series of four molecular-based laboratories in General
Biology. In these labs students acquire hands-on experience in three areas of
molecular biology: They learn about genome organization by isolating and
examining onion DNA, they manipulate the genome with restriction endonucleases,
and they are introduced to genes and gene products by culturing sensitive and
antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In a variety of upper division courses
progressively more advanced concepts of molecular biology are presented with the
use of increasingly sophisticated techniques.
