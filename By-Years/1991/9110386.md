This research is for the development of advanced electron microscopy techniques
and their use in material science. Specific techniques of interest are in-line
holography in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and high-angle
annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM imaging. In-line holography promises to be a
feasible means to enhance STEM resolution without the requirement of higher
accelerating voltage. HAADF imaging will be well suited to study crystal defects
and surface layers. In particular, the above techniques will be applied to
studying ferroelectric domain structures in thin crystals of barium titanate.
The results of this research are expected to have a major impact on our ability
to characterize technologically important material systems.
