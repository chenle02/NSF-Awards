One of the fundamental problems in statistical mechanics is to bridge the gap
between macroscopic, phenomenological laws - e.g., hydrodynamical and kinetic
equations -and the underlying microscopic description involving interactions
between a large number of particles. The delicacy of the problem can be
appreciated if we consider that the microscopic laws are (time) reversible while
the macroscopic are irreversible (Zermelo's "paradox"). Professor Goldstein
plans to continue his investigations into problems- e.g., the derivations of
diffusion equations, stochastic behavior, and convergence to equilibrium and the
steady state- whose solutions would narrow this gap.
