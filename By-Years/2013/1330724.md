This grant will support travel by students, young researchers and a few senior
researchers unable to afford the cost to attend the AGU Chapman Conference on
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Solar System. The conference will be
held February 10-14, 2014 in Yosemite National Park. Topics will include the
ionosphere as a source of magnetospheric plasma, the effects of cold ionospheric
plasma on more energetic plasmas, how the two regions are coupled, coupled
models and simulations of the magnetosphere and ionosphere system and planetary
magnetospheres and ionospheres.
