This award provides funds for international travel by eight American scientists
and engineers, and four students to Cheju Island, Korea to participate in an
international workshop on Advanced Applications for Carbon Materials. The
workshop will be co-organized by the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for
Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films at Clemson University and Chungnam
University, Korea. The expenses of Korean participation and costs for local
arrangements will be borne by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation
(KOSEF). The conference program will include sessions on novel applications and
processing techniques, carbon materials for environmental applications, carbon
nanomaterials, carbon materials for storage applications, and carbon/carbon
materials.
