This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in behavioral
neurosciences between Robert Muller, State University of New York's Health
Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York and Bruno Poucet, at the Laboratory of
Cognitive Neuroscience, French National Center for Scientific Research,
Marseille, France. The investigators propose experimental studies (involving
rats) on the effect of visual and kinetic cues on structural changes in
hippocampal place cells and postsubicular head direction cells. Their objective
is to provide insight into the determinants of neural activity during navigation
and movement. The U.S. investigator is an expert in electrophysiology of cells.
This is complemented by significant French expertise in behavioral neuroscience.
