9401343 Toole This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean Expedition
(IOE) of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In it, the PI will
participate as a co-principal investigator on two separate legs of the
hydrographic survey, along the lines I4-5W-7C, around Madagascar, I10 between
Indonesia and Australia, and I-1, from Indonesia to Somalia. The PI will then
participate in the analysis and synthesis of the data on these and other
sections collected as part of the IOE. Objectives are to describe water
characteristics, velocity structure, and transport of the boundary currents
thought to exist in the region. The observations will provide the foundation for
the first measurements of the meridional overturning rate in the Indian Ocean.
