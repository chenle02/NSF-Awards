Real-time monitors are designed to filter and analyze patterns in collections
of incoming data streams--for example, to convert low- level signal and image
data into high-level descriptions. In short, they are a solution to the "data
fusion" problem. This project implements the process-trellis software
architecture as a programming methodology and tool for building parallel real-
time monitors. The project will enable data fusion applications to exploit new
developments in parallel computer hardware and processing. The process trellis
supports hierarchical, multiprocess data fusion structures that convert incoming
raw data into high-level abstractions. Intermediate processing is performed by
numerous analysis procedures running asynchronously and in parallel, interacting
only through the flow of data in the trellis. The trellis will be implemented
using Linda (R), a commercial product of SCIENTIFIC Computing Associates, Inc.,
that provides convenient access to parallelism from within high-level languages
like C or Fortran. This will lead to software that is not only efficient, but
also portable across vastly different parallel architectures including both
explicitly parallel computers and LANS of workstations functioning as parallel
"hypercomputers."
