This two year project addresses the mathematical and computer science needs of
40 Memphis middle and high school teachers of minority students by providing an
intense summer workshop with academic year follow-up. Le Moyne-Owen, a
traditionally Black college, will run this project with the cooperation of the
Memphis Urban Mathematics Collaborative (funded by the Ford Foundation). The
objectives include strengthening the mathematics background, improving teaching
skills, fostering cooperation between teachers and college faculty, and
introducing teachers to the microcomputer and programming. During the five week
workshop the teachers will study logic, sets, function optimization, induction
and combinatortics, probability, matrices, linear programming, discrete
mathematics and computers. The teaching strategies include problem solving,
development of mathematical models and teacher presentations. Teachers will earn
three credits for the course work. The academic year follow-up includes two
mini- conferences for all participants and on-site visits by the staff to the
teachers' classes.
