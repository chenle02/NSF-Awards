This research planning grant will assess the feasibility of establishing an
electronic elections database and archive. At present no single machine
readable, constituency level source for election returns documenting the world's
democratic elections exists. The goal of such an archive is to establish "one
stop shopping" via the Internet for all election data needs. Data and codebooks
may be held by the archive with file access and download capabilities or, in
instances of previously collected or copyrighted data, alternative sources and
access information will be provided.
