This award supports research in combinatorics and geometry
with&lt;br/&gt;applications to representation theory. The project investigates
the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and invariant theory of reflection groups. The PI
explores&lt;br/&gt;relations between complex polytopes, Coxeter-like complexes,
Hecke&lt;br/&gt;algebras, and the coinvariant algebra. Techniques may help
develop a&lt;br/&gt;Kazhdan-Lusztig theory of cells for complex reflection
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reflection groups arise in nature as symmetry
groups. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of the cube or dodecahedron (or
any Platonic solid) form&lt;br/&gt;a reflection group. These groups are
generated by mirror reflections&lt;br/&gt;(about hyperplanes) and appear in
physics, biology, chemistry, and&lt;br/&gt;computer science. Reflection groups
also have a rich history of&lt;br/&gt;connecting many different areas of
mathematics: discrete geometry,&lt;br/&gt;topology, singularity theory,
arrangements of hyperplanes, Lie&lt;br/&gt;theory, combinatorics, and invariant
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
