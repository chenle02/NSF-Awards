Recent advances in CCD detector technology have made it possible to obtain high
signal-to-noise, high resolution spectra of stars in wavelength and stellar
brightness regimes that have seldom been explored. Dr. Meyer will use the latest
generation of CCDs and high resolution spectrographs at the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories to push the sensitivity of interstellar absorption line
studies. Such studies impact on a variety of issues concerning the cosmic
microwave background radiation, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Galactic chemical
evolution, and the structure, composition, and chemistry of the interstellar
medium. Dr. Meyer's principal goals are to obtain a detailed understanding of
the cosmic and local excitation of the CN molecule in diffuse interstellar
clouds and to investigate the small-scale structure in the interstellar medium
through observations of the interstellar absorption lines toward resolvable
binary star systems.
