Biological Sciences (61). "Community College Undergraduate Research: Building a
Model of Integration" involves the design, implementation and evaluation of a
model for integrating undergraduate research into a community college science
curriculum. The project involves the use of scientific principles contained
within a portfolio of ongoing research programs to develop inquiry-based
educational materials (such as problem-based learning modules and case studies)
for freshman biology courses. These materials are then being expanded into an
undergraduate research experience within a credit-bearing, transferable,
advanced sophomore-level course. The sophomore-level course curriculum includes
training students as peer-leaders to support the development of new student
projects emerging from the freshman courses and supports the creation of an
educational environment where research and education are integrated. The project
involves a collaboration of five community colleges, one four-year school, four
environmental research organizations, and a state government agency.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in establishing
an adoptable model that supports community college efforts to shift to inquiry-
based and project-based coursework, to get community college students engaged in
undergraduate research, and to make connections to four-year college science
programs and their undergraduate research efforts. The project addresses many of
the barriers associated with conducting undergraduate research at the community
college level. Project evaluation is using a variety of approaches to address
the success of the project in achieving its major objectives, which include
improving student learning, increasing the involvement of both faculty and
students in research, increasing the use of inquiry-based approaches by
participating faculty, and increasing the level of interaction between the
faculty at the participating community colleges and four-year
institutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal include
its strong focus on improving the quality of science education at the community
college level, where there are disproportionate number of students from
underrepresented groups; the establishment of a network of community college
faculty dedicated to project-based learning and undergraduate research; and an
increase in the capacity of community colleges to prepare future scientists with
the skills necessary to conduct scientific research. Plans for dissemination of
project results include presentations and workshops at national meetings and
student presentations at local and regional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
