Toward a Linear Time Sparse Solver with Locality-Enhanced Scalable
Parallelism&lt;br/&gt;Padma Raghavan &lt;br/&gt;Many computational science
simulations concern the numeric solution of partial differential equations using
implicit or semi-implicit methods. Such simulations often involve nonlinear
systems where the dominant costs are those for sparse linear system solution.
Sparse solvers present an array of performance challenges on current and future
generation multicore chip-multiprocessor architectures, and their networked
ensembles into massively parallel processing systems. A new structured hybrid
algorithm is sought to enable reliable and scalable solution. An inner-outer
tree-structured scheme is formulated by exploiting geometry for tearing and
interlacing of the graph of the coefficient matrix. Research issues concern
scalable parallelism, hardware latency-masking mapping of data, and geometric
mechanisms to convey numeric properties of the coefficient matrix to accelerate
the solution process.&lt;br/&gt;
