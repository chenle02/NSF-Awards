Proposal Number: DMS-0140193&lt;br/&gt;PI: Janine
Wittwer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of Bellman
functions is a powerful method that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to bound sums indexed
by dyadic intervals.&lt;br/&gt;Many discrete results in Harmonic Analysis have
been&lt;br/&gt;obtained with this method in the last few years. To
date&lt;br/&gt;it can be used on sums involving inner products of
a&lt;br/&gt;function with the scaling or wavelet functions from
the&lt;br/&gt;Haar wavelet system, but not the scaling or
wavelet&lt;br/&gt;functions of general wavelet systems. Many of the
discrete&lt;br/&gt;results obtained with the current Bellman function
method&lt;br/&gt;could be expanded to the continuous setting if the
Bellman&lt;br/&gt;function method was available for more general
wavelets.&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to expand the method of Bellman
functions&lt;br/&gt;from its current scope to sums involving any MRA
wavelet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavelets have been useful in many areas such
as&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, physics, engineering and signal
processing.&lt;br/&gt;They are the basis of the new world wide web
image&lt;br/&gt;compression standard JPEG2000. They prove to also be
a&lt;br/&gt;useful tool in harmonic analysis. It is
frequently&lt;br/&gt;necessary to estimate the size of sums involving
wavelets.&lt;br/&gt;The Bellman function method is a very useful tool in
doing&lt;br/&gt;so, but currently only works for a very special
wavelet&lt;br/&gt;called the Haar wavelet. The PI is interested
in&lt;br/&gt;generalizing the method where possible to more
general&lt;br/&gt;classes of wavelets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
