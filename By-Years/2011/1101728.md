The Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) Louis Stokes
Alliance for Minority Participation project combines the efforts of an alliance
of&lt;br/&gt;30 colleges and universities, 7 professional organizations, 2
government laboratories, 4 educational&lt;br/&gt;organizations, 12 corporations,
147 academic and support programs, 500 resource
individuals,&lt;br/&gt;approximately 85% of whom are scientists, engineers, and
other faculty, and 15% administrators. The new project is a comprehensive,
concerted, sequenced effort that uses NSF funding for historically
underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate student activities, including the
transition of college sophomores, juniors, and seniors toward graduate school
and the development of&lt;br/&gt;high technology products with application or
dissemination both regionally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the
NSF-funded Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) and the
LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program the alliance will continue the
seamless transition and student support from STEM undergraduate to STEM graduate
studies through the successful multidisciplinary faculty&lt;br/&gt;mentoring
network to transition these students to doctoral completion and into faculty
ranks, as well as other sectors in the Nation's STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the multiple prior successes in
doubling the number of historically underepresented minorities in STEM majors
and being on pace for a similar doubling goal for this population of students by
2016, the recruitment and retention activities will result in the alliance
becoming a national model for strengthening and diversifying the Nation's STEM
workforce to meet 21st century innovation needs.
