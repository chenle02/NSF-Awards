9501499 Vinnakota This research is on analog circuit observer block (ACOB),
structures for testing analog and mixed-signal circuits. Design styles for
analog and mixed-signal ICs and their influences on testing the products are
being studied. ACOBs for circuits of practical importance, both discrete and
continuous time, are being investigated. A second exploration is into fault
models for analog circuits which quantitatively link defects to variations in
the functional parameters, which are traditionally verified in analog circuit
test. These models are being used to validate the effectiveness of defect-
oriented testing and design-for-test techniques, including ACOBs. The algorithms
are being verified on practical circuits. Software for analog and mixed-signal
test is being developed.
