This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in applied
mathematics between two research groups: Dr. Ralph Faudree and others at Memphis
State University and Hao Li and others at the Laboratory for Information
Research, University of Paris (South). The investigators will examine several
problems related to graph theory with particular emphasis on applications to
computer networks and fault tolerance. They will focus on problems related to
paths and cycles of special families of graphs and plan to apply paths,
connectivity and diameter problems to communication networks. Algorithms will be
developed to address some of the applied problems. The project brings together
two research groups with overlapping interests and expertise. It will benefit
from combining diverse approaches to these problems and their mutual experience
in both graph theory and information science. The research has important
applications to a number of complex areas in parallel computing, such as mapping
programs to parallel architectures, and code optimization.
