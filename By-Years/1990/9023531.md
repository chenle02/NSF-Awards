Most game-theoretic applications in economics assume players are rational,
mutually rational, and purely self-interested. In experimental studies of games
one or more of these assumptions often appear to be violated because people do
not play Nash or more refined equilibria (learning sometimes reduces violations
but not always). It is usually difficult to tell from strategy choices alone
which assumptions a subject is violating. Since game- theoretic solution
concepts can be interpreted as algorithms for choosing a strategy, we can test
the algorithms directly using a computer system that records what information in
a game (e.g., which payoffs) a subject is looking at, and for how long, along
with their choices. The information processing data are revealed preferences for
information, which can be used to infer an unobservable thinking process. We can
also measure the effect of learning on information processing to see how
subjects learn, and whether they learn optimal responses or general principles
(e.g., solution concepts). The games and ideas that will be studied in this
project include: sequencing bargaining, forward induction, Nash vs. subgame
perfection, and "almost common knowledge" games.
