Dr. Steven W. Baldwin and other members of the Chemistry Department at Duke
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Additional activities include visits to major industry, private
research institutes, and government laboratories, as well as seminars dealing
with issues such as effective scientific writing and ethics in science.
Participants are accepted from a national pool, while specific recruitment
focuses on the southeastern United States.
