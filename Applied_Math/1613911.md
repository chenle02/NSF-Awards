Nature and human societies offer many examples of collective dynamics that tend
to self-organize into large-scale patterns. The goal of this project is to study
nonlinear transport equations, which give a mathematical description of diverse
manifestations of collective dynamics, such as flocking of birds or movement of
the population of microorganisms in response to a chemical stimulus
(chemotaxis). The principal focus of this research is on the persistence of
global features of solutions of the corresponding transport equations, including
their smoothing behavior, self-organization, and the emergence of patterns, such
as large-scale clustering into consensus, flocking, and the emergence of
leaders. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the
research.

This research project comprises five parts: (i) A study of the ensemble of
agent-based dynamics in order to predict how different rules of local engagement
affect the large-time emergence of one or more clusters. (ii) A study of a new
paradigm of collective dynamics, for which communication takes place along the
projections of those agents that are "moving ahead." (iii) It is known that
smooth solutions of collective social hydrodynamics governed by nonlinear
transport must flock. The question arises, when does the smoothness of these
equations persist? The regularity of nonlinear transport equations in social
hydrodynamics, and their dependence on critical thresholds in the space of
initial configurations will be investigated. (iv) Chemotaxis is a canonical
example for group dynamics driven by (chemo-) attraction and (volume-filling)
repulsion. When a population of bacteria is overcrowded, there is a repulsion
peak; this calls for a new incompressible model for chemotaxis. The vanishing
viscosity limit of such a "peaked" repulsion will be studied. (v) A study of
nonlinear transport associated with social hydrodynamics driven by degenerate
local Laplacians will be undertaken. It is planned to implement the velocity-
averaging techniques used to study the regularization of nonlinear conservation
laws with degenerate diffusion.
