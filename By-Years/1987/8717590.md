The Osmore Project focusing on Estuquina, a Late Intermediate Period site near
Moqueuqua, Peru is providing significant new information about prehistoric
Andean cultures. In this project the student will study the mortuary component
of the project focusing on the human remains. Specifically she will look at
intrasite variation in spatial and biological patterning. This project will
provide important new information on the demographic aspects of prehistoric
Andean society. It will increase our knowledge of health and disease, especially
tuberculosis, cranial deformation and inherited morphology. These data will be
compared with cultural variables to see if there is evidence of increases in
population stress in the society over time. This study is one of the few to
emphasize a population approach to a prehistoric society, focusing on an entire
cemetery rather than single graves. It will provide accurate reconstruction of
the human population at Estuquina with regard to the interaction of culture and
human biology and will be an important addition to bioanthropology.
