This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Overcoming the Geographic/Infrastructure Disadvantage of a Remote
Small Research/Teaching Institution in Nano/micro-scale Engineering Education,
under the direction of Dr. Cetin Cetinkaya, at Clarkson University (CU), will
develop a new undergraduate course with a strong hands-on component. This
undergraduate course will complement and form a sequence with an existing
graduate-level special topics course in Advanced Materials, which is one of CU's
three research thrust areas. Utilizing a remote site within the NSF supported
National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) facility at Cornell
University (CNF), the proposed multi-disciplinary course will educate
undergraduate engineering students at CU in the fundamentals of nanoscale
engineering, with an emphasis on sensor fabrication and design and link their
exposure to the engineering/design/analysis concepts in the meso-scale to the
small-scale world.
