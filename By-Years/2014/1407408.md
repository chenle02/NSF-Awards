This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S.-based graduate
students and new Ph.D's at the "Tenth AIMS International Conference on Dynamical
Systems, Differential Equations and Applications", which will be held on July
7-11, 2014, hosted by the Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas (ICMAT) and the
Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) in Madrid, Spain.

There will be plenary talks given by 12 international experts who are already
confirmed as speakers, mainly from the U.S. and Europe. There will also be over
1000 shorter invited talks and 200-300 contributed talks. There will be a
Student Paper Symposium for the winners of a student paper competition, to
encourage graduate students to write up their new results. The topics covered
will include all areas of the important and diverse fields of differential
equations, dynamical systems, and many applications of these fields.
