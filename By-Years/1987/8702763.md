This project would partially support two activities: 1. A continuation of the
study of heavily ionizing particles produced in high energy collisions.
Experiments are in progress at Fermilab and the High Energy Physics Laboratory
in Japan. 2. A new experiment to measure the flux of antiprotons in space as a
function of energy between 100 and 1700 MeV. This experiment is in collaboration
with others at Boston University, Indiana University and the University of
Michigan. Past work on the search for magnetic monopoles has been of fundamental
importance. The group has pioneered the technique of etched materials to search
for heavily ionizing particles. Those physicists are superbly qualified to
perform the research. NSF support is recommended.
