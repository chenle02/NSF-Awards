This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports acquisition of a state-
of-the-art variable-property material synthesizing instrument (OBJET Connex500)
for leading-edge research on functionally-graded material systems at Texas
A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK). The instrument directly combines two
component materials in specific concentrations and structures to design novel
variable-property material systems. With direct fabrication, complex systems can
be fabricated in a single build process, eliminating design restrictions and
saving energy. The instrumentation will advance fundamental research on the
design of novel variable-property material systems, enabling the development of
compliant mechanisms and smart structures, and formats for organic
semiconductors, superconductors, and other organic electronic devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will support research by a
multidisciplinary team and by TAMUK undergraduate students. Underrepresented
graduate and undergraduate Hispanic students will be given access to enhanced
curriculum and the state-of-the-art instrumentation; this experience will give
them unique skills and broader career options. The instrumentation will be
featured in summer outreach programs and will be made available to regional
educational institutions. The instrumentation will spur enhanced research
competitiveness and innovation in South Texas-an economically challenged area.
Local industry will gain access through the Javelina Innovation Center, which
was established to aid local industry in simulating, designing, and
manufacturing novel products in a low-cost manner.
