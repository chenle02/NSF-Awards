Through examining the ways that values are enmeshed in three scientific research
programs related to psychiatry, this project merges two significant strands of
recent intellectual history: contemporary philosophy and sociology of science,
which tell us that values have an influential role in shaping science; and
social critiques of psychiatry, which are prompting reevaluation of psychiatric
understanding and treatment of mentally disordered people. The project aims to
analyze and specify the particular manifestations of values within the three
programs. It hypothesizes that significant conflicts will be found between
scientific, professional, and social values. These conflicts may partly
determine the results of the research program. The research areas are
psychiatric genetics, psychopathological personality theory, and
psychopharmacology. The project will assemble the relevant scientific,
professional and lay literatures for each focus. The analyses will focus on
specific research questions and scientific controversies within each of the
three areas. The project uses a descriptive-causal model to identify and
differentiate values in scientific discourse. Values are defined as descriptions
or conditions that both guide human action and lead the actor to be susceptible
to praise or blame. The model's classification scheme is used to identify the
various ways that values appear in written discourses and address a variety of
value-related questions such as: What roles do values play in the comparison of
competing theories within a scientific controversy? What ontological assumptions
are involved in the various theoretical and research focuses, and how does the
research privilege these assumptions? What role do practical, professional and
social interests play in shaping the research program and its findings? What are
the ethical implications of the research? A philosophy of science consultant and
scientist-consultants in each of the three areas will aid in collection and
interpretation of the respective literatures, and results of these analyses will
be published in professional and humanities journals.
