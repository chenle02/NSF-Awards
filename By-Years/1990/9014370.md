This project on "Growth of Diamond and Cubic Boron Nitride Single Crystalline
Films" addresses experimental and theoretical aspects of epitaxial crystal
growth. The homoepitaxial growth of diamond films on different crystallographic
surfaces of diamond substrates will be studied using electron cyclotron
resonance assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The role of atomic hydrogen in
stabilizing certain surface reconstructions and in removing graphitic co-
deposits will be investigated, as well as electron and ion assisted growth and
doping phenomena. Transport, optical, and recombination properties of the
epitaxial films will be characterized. Defects will be studied by electron spin
resonance, cathodoluminesence, and Raman spectroscopy, and correlations between
defect concentration and growth rate will be investigated. The results of these
fundamental studies are of importance to the potential use of diamond and boron
nitride in electronic applications with capabilities beyond silicon-based
electronics enabling improved device and circuit performance, and extending
electronic/photonic applications to new areas such as sensor and processor
utilization in the high temperature environments of automobile and jet engines,
and for process control in manufacturing.
