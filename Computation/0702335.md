Large and sparse matrix computational problems are often solved by certain
subspace projection methods -- most commonly Krylov subspace type projections.
The basic idea is to project the original problems (matrices) of high dimensions
onto certain subspaces to arrive at smaller and manageable ones, and the smaller
reduced problems can then be solved by one of the dense matrix algorithms such
as those in LAPACK. Existing projection techniques often do not preserve
structural properties enjoyed by eigenproblems from various engineering
applications, and therefore the reduced problems do not necessarily reflect
their practical backgrounds in any meaningful ways. It is conceivable, as it is
often the case, that approximating a problem by one of its own kind would do
better. Indeed there are cases where structural preserving methods are far
superior to those that are blind to the inherent structures. The objective of
this proposal is to exploit in depth structural properties of matrices from the
standpoint of their application backgrounds and to develop accurate and
efficient structural preserving numerical methods for eigenvalue and related
problems of practical significance. A number of interesting ideas will be
pursued here, including a general framework for carrying out structural
preserving subspace projections, an unifying convergence analysis for all Krylov
subspace type projections that connects moment matching properties in reduced
order modeling and eigenvalue and eigenvector convergence theory, and a sub-
orthogonalization process that will serve as the basis to devise efficient
projections.

Eigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and engineering,
and their solutions are routinely sought and are critical in one way or another
to various scientific computational tasks. Examples includes computational
problems from structural dynamics, control systems, circuit simulations,
computational electromagnetics and microelectromechanical systems, data mining,
and web search engine design, etc. This investigation shall advance
significantly the underlying engineering applications by making the involved
matrix computations much less expensive, more accurate, and most importantly
result in scientific simulations that reflect better the underlying physics.
Graduate students with emerging expertise in numerical eigenvalue computations
will be involved.
