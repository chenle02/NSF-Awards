The Tennessee Information Technology (IT) Exchange Center provides an effective
workforce capacity building system by increasing the IT educational strength in
a consortium of two year colleges, four year colleges, secondary schools and
industries in North Central Tennessee. The goal is to develop a sustainable
Center to meet need by industry for a qualified IT workforce. Faculty and
students in long-term relationships with experts from industry create real world
scenarios based on industrial needs and use them as the basis for instruction in
IT courses. The learning strategies are developed in workshops at the Center for
Learning and Teaching at Vanderbilt University. The cases are used in high
school academies to interest high school students in IT careers. A web site
provides information about the availability and content of education and
training programs in the region, a clearinghouse of job opportunities and
regular communications among partners. Regional stakeholder forums bring
industry and educators together to develop a shared vision based upon research
for effective delivery of instruction. The audience includes both students in
educational institutions and re-careering workers. &lt;br/&gt;
