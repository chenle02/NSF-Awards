This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports the continued development, assessment,
and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) for advanced
undergraduate courses. QuILTs are based upon a field-tested cognitive
apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching, and
scaffolding. The following features of the QuILTs make them particularly suited
for the challenging task of teaching quantum physics: (1) They are based upon
research in physics education and pay particular attention to cognitive issues.
(2) They consistently keep students actively engaged in the learning process by
asking them to predict what should happen in a particular situation and then
providing appropriate feedback. (3) They employ visualization tools to help
students build physical intuition about quantum processes. (4) They attempt to
bridge the gap between the abstract quantitative formalism of quantum mechanics
and the qualitative understanding necessary to explain and predict diverse
physical phenomena. (5) They are based on systematic investigations of
difficulties students have in learning various concepts in quantum physics. (6)
They can be used in class by the instructors once or twice a week as supplements
to lectures or outside of the class as homework or as self-study tool by
students. (7) They consist of self-sufficient modular units that can be used in
any order that is convenient. To aid instructors, the various concept-based and
problem-based QuILT modules will be keyed with most of the common textbooks.
However, every effort will be made to ensure that the different modules fit
together as a coherent whole and help students organize their knowledge in a
hierarchical fashion.
