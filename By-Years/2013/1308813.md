Brian A. Korgel from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the
Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of
Chemistry in research focusing on new chemical routes to silicon- and germanium-
containing nanocrystals, nanorods and nanowires with precisely controlled
dimensions. Novel reaction pathways are being developed to provide exquisite
control of reactant decomposition, semiconductor formation and crystallization,
and effective surface passivation. For the study of quantum confinement-related
optical and electronic properties, silicon and germanium nanomaterials in the
quantum size range are synthesized with the ability to manipulate shape and
chemically passivate surfaces. Silicon and germanium-containing iron
chalcogenides, Fe2MS4 (M = Si, Ge), are also being synthesized and studied for
photovoltaic applications, as new photocatalyst analogs to the earth-abundant
semiconductor, pyrite FeS2, or "Fool's gold" and as alternative electrode
materials for next generation lithium ion
batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon- and germanium-based nanomaterials have
a variety of applications in energy storage and solar energy utilization.
Specifically, they have applications in medicine, for transistors and displays,
as electrode materials in lithium ion batteries, as novel photocatalysts, and as
photovoltaic devices. The silicide and germanide compounds targeted in this
study represent a new class of photocatalysts and light-absorbing films in
photovoltaics made of earth-abundant materials. This project also supports the
education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, along with
additional educational activities that include visits and demonstrations to
local primary and secondary schools, teacher training, and undergraduate
education efforts involving nanotechnology, such as the development of a new
freshman course on commercialization and innovation, team-taught with colleagues
from the business school.
