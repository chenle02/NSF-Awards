Computer programs to perform symbolic calculations to solve mathematical,
scientific, and engineering problems have become popular and highly useful in
the last decade. However, systems for symbolic computation in noncommutative
algebras have not attained the generality of systems for commutative algebra.
This project develops a system for symbolic computation in Hopf algebras, and
supports algebras and Hopf algebras. The project relies on multidisciplinary
interaction between algebraists and computer scientists. The Hopf system uses
the GAP system as a foundation upon which to build more advanced functions. GAP
is freely distributed over the Internet, as is the Hopf system. The Hopf system
is able to support advanced research in noncommutative algebras and their
applications to science, especially mathematics and physics.
