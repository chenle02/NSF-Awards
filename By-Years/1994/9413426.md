9413426 Mogk This award provides 70 per cent of the funds required for the
acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer system to be installed and operated in
the Imaging and Chemical Analysis Laboratory at the Montana State University.
The Montana State University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for the acquisition of the equipment. The Imaging and Chemical
Analysis Laboratory is a centralized facility that operates and maintains a pool
of instruments dedicated to the characterization of the composition, chemistry,
and structure of materials for the physical sciences, life sciences, and
engineering disciplines at Montana State University. The new x-ray
diffractometer system fills a basic gap in their instrumental pool. ***
