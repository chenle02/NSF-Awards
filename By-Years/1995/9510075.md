9510075 Keigwin Water masses of North Atlantic are known to have varied on
glacial/interglacial and millennial time scales. Deep northern water was
suppressed during severe climates, intermediate water flow was enhanced and Gulf
Stream temperature and salinity varies. Long and large diameter cores are now
available from Blake and Bahama outer ridges and the Carolina slope. Using
geochemical proxies the principal investigator will recreate deep and
intermediate hydrographic conditions for the last glacial maximum, deglacial low
salinity event and the deglacial cooling event. ***
