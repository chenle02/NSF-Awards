A century of suppressing wildfires has created a dangerous accumulation of
flammable vegetation on landscapes, contributing to megafires that risk human
life and property, and permanently destroy ecosystems. Small controllable fires
can dramatically reduce the risk of large fires that are uncontrollable.
BurnPro3D is a decision support platform to help the fire response and
mitigation community understand risks and tradeoffs quickly and accurately to
more effectively manage wildfires or conduct controlled burns.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this vision, this project is developing
specific AI innovations to: (i) Use knowledge management techniques to fuse data
coming from diverse sources and prepare it for fire modeling; (ii) Conduct
physics-based machine learning within next-generation fire models to use deep
learning to understand complex processes that drive fire behavior; (iii) Apply
constraint optimization methods to address complex tradeoffs in the decision
process for the placement and timing of controlled burns; (iv) Employ
explainable AI to increase the interpretability of data and models by diverse
users all along the decision-making chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
