Tim Berners Lee has defined the semantic web to support machine understandable
web pages. Much of the development in semantic web has been on standards for XML
(eXtensible Markup Language), RDF (Resource Description Framework), Ontologies
and Information Interoperability. For the semantic web to be useful in an
operational environment, it has to be dependable. By a dependable semantic web
we mean a semantic web that is secure, privacy-enhanced, manages trust,
processes information in real-time and ensures high quality data. &lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this project will be to investigate policies for the semantic web.
In particular, the web rules language will be expended to include the
specification of security and privacy policies. The project will also develop an
inference engine to reason about the policies. Privacy and trust policies for
the semantic web and develop algorithms to enforce the policies.
