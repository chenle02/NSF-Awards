This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program at Drexel University entitled, "The
RET Program at Drexel and UPenn: Bringing two universities together to empower
Philadelphia teachers in the area of nanotechnology," under the direction of Dr.
Yuri Gogotsi. This novel program, led by Drexel in coordination with UPenn, will

teachers in the area of nanotechnology, specifically participating in cutting
edge research in the areas of carbon nanotubes, tissue engineering, advanced
space age materials, miniature electronics, and drug delivery.
