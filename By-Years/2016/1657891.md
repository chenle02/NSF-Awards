This award funds research in macroeconomics that seeks to better understand the
main driving forces behind the large decline in economic activity between 2008 ?
2009 and the subsequent slow recovery. The project seeks to shed light on a
measurement issue that affects the analysis of key macro data from this period.
If firms invest heavily in intangible investments, a drop in measured GDP will
understand the actual decline in total output because measured GDP does not
include all intangible investments. This could result in a rise in labor
productivity during a recession, as observed in 2009. The project will develop a
multisector framework that explicitly models intangible investments and industry
input-output linkages and will use disaggregated data. The goal is to determine
whether models of the business cycle that feature efficient resource allocation
and fluctuations driven by shocks to total factor productivities can explain the
economic experience of 2008 ? 2009. The results will help us understand whether
or not inefficient disruptions in financial markets mean governments should
regulate financial markets in new ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
develops the multisector framework and estimates key model parameters with
maximum likelihood techniques. Working with disaggregated data is very useful
here, because there are vast differences in spending on R&amp;D, trademarks, and
other intangibles across industries, and including sectoral linkages will likely
have an impact on the propagation of productivity shocks. The model will also be
extended to allow for financial factors. Quantifying the role of intangible
assets for business cycle activity will advance economic science in several
ways. The current state of knowledge is limited because previous work has
focused on aggregate data or a specific episode. The previous work was conducted
prior to major revisions that introduced new measurements of intangible
investments into the U.S. system of national accounts.
