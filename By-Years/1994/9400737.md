ABSTRACT CTS-9400737 R. J. Phillips It is proposed to investigate the effect of
non-newtonian fluids on the interactions between suspended particles, and on the
macroscopic behavior of the suspensions. Flow modeling will consider second-
order fluid constitutive relationships as a limit case for viscoelastic fluids.
More realistic constitutive relationships will be introduced later in analysis.
Stokesian dynamics simulations will be performed with multi-sphere systems in
weakly viscoelastic fluids. The computational results will be compared to
measurements on particle concentration in the sedimentation and diffusion
experiments, which will be performed with a holographic interferometer and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. The proposed project has relevance to
the fabrication of homogeneous composite materials and coatings, particularly
from polymeric materials having particles in suspension. ***
