Ascorbate, a water.soluble vitamin found in high concentrations in the mammalian
forebrain, appears to modulate several different neural functions. This
neuromodulatory role is especially evident in the neostriatum where
physiological amounts of absorbate have been shown to alter neuronal activity
and to interfere with the behavioral response to drugs that act in part via
neostriatal mechanisms. To determine the neurochemical systems and processes
underlying these actions of ascorbate a series of experiments will focus on a
ppossible interactions between ascorbate and some well.known neurotransmitters.
Single.unit recording techniques, including electrochemically.quantified
iontophoresis, will be used to examine the effects of ascorbate on the neuronal
response to iontophoretically.applied dopamine and glutamate and to glutamate
released endogenously from cortico.neostriatal terminals. Intraneostriatal
infusions in freely.moving rats will be used to examine the role of the
neostriatum in the behavioral effects of ascorbate. Parellel experiments will
examine the mechanisms that control extracellular levels of ascorbate,
especially the dramatic rise produced by amphetamine. Carbon.fiber
microvoltammetic and electrochemically.modified electrodes will be used to
obtain unequivocal information on extracellular ascorbate levels in the
neostriatum. Follow.up work will extend these investigations to other forebrain
regions known to contain a high endogenous level of ascorbate. These lines of
research will provide basic information about the mechanisms by which ascorbate
regulates and controls some important neural and behavioral processes.
