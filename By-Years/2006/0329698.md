&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a new detection scheme
for biosensing. This involves both biosensor transduction by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and receptor protein genetic engineering for
surface immobilization. EIS can probe both charge transfer and capacitance at
the biosensor interface, providing more information than competing methods that
involve only amperometric detection. The general applicability of this approach
using receptor proteins that undergo large amplitude motion during small-
molecule ligand binding will be explored. This EIS detection scheme is coupled
to the development of methods for oriented immobilization of genetically
engineered proteins onto a gold electrode surface. The ultimate goal of this
research is the development of general methods for detection of both small and
large ligands and substrates of biological interest. In terms of the broader
impacts, the areas of clinical diagnostics, agriculture, national defense, and
the drug industries may benefit. The project will provide graduate education and
training for students in a highly interdisciplinary field, and the results of
this research will be disseminated over the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
