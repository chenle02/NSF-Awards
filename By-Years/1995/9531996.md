9531996 TOWNSEND An X-ray mapping, analytical microprobe technique will be
tested to measure Sr/Ca ratios in the otoliths of larval cod fishes. Success
with this procedure will identify the relationships between successive daily
growth increments,vertical distribution/diel migration patterns, and
hydrographic structure in the water column. Specimens collected from Georges
Bank during the spring and early summer period when thermal stratification
develops will provide information that should broaden an understanding of larval
transport, survival and recruitment. ***
