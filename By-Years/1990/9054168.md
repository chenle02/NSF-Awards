The project, jointly conducted by Georgia State University and the Georgia
Institute of Technology, is aimed at improving the ability of faculty at two-
and four- year institutions in Southeastern United States to teach a modern
program in chemistry. Over a two year period, the project is offering 10 one-
week workshops and three 2-day minicourses. Workshop topics include: molecular
modeling, chemistry of nucleic acids, polymers, chemometrics, and instrument
interfacing. Over the three year period 996 participant days are scheduled. A
compilation of all innovations in the course- work at undergraduate colleges
resulting from the project will be distributed to all participants.
