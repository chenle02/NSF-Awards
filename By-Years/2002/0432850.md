The thirtieth biennial International Combustion Conference will be held in
Chicago, Illinois, on July 30 -August 4, 2004. This award will support the
participation of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the conference
as well as support partially expenses of proceedings publication and poster
sessions. The evaluation of this proposal took into account the two primary NSF
criteria for support as well its potential contribution to development of
technical capabilities among the engineering and science research-and-teaching
community to deal with an important field of
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timing of this particular symposium is
especially advantageous for NSF and CTS as there will be a change of Program
Director in the Combustion and Plasma Systems Program this year. The discussions
and recommendations of the meeting can serve as a useful guide for setting
priorities of the program as it moves into the next fiscal
year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity arises from
the participation of combustion experts, their discourse, and their ultimate
recommendations for future research directions. The broader impact arises
primarily from the involvement of graduate students in the meeting to encourage
their participation in this field. Also, the conference will promote
international collaboration and communication of research progress in other
countries.&lt;br/&gt;
