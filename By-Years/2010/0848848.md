This project focuses on the development and synthetic applications of
stereoselective iminium bis-(silane) cyclization and vanadium promoted free
radical methylenecyclopentane annulations. Recent discoveries in the principal
investigator's laboratory indicate that chiral and achiral
2-propylidene-1,3-bis(silane) bearing imines undergo efficient cyclization with
superb levels of substrate directed stereocontrol in the presence of TiCl4. This
project will continue the investigation of 2-propylidene-1,3-bis(silane) by
studying the stereoselective bond forming reactions between
2-propylidene-1,3-bis(silane) and carbon based electrophiles. Once developed,
such a methodology will be employed to synthesize structurally intricate
isotropanes and their derivatives. The development of free radical
methylenecyclopentane annulations promoted by the novel and highly economical
vanadium reagent (CF3CH2O)VOCl2 is another objective of the project. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Professor Tom Livinghouse, of the Department of
Chemistry at Montana State University. Professor Livinghouse's research efforts
revolve around the discovery, development, and exploitation of novel reactions
for the synthesis of challenging natural products. Professor Livinghouse's
bis(silane) cyclization strategy allows the efficient construction of complex
molecules. The project is of considerable significance to the chemical and
pharmaceutical industry, as it could impact how organic molecules are prepared.
