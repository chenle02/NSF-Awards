Buhler&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1516324&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project systematically
extends a recently discovered data analysis method that allows a precise wave-
vortex decomposition of flow measurements along a fast-moving aircraft, ship, or
satellite trajectory. Such a decomposition is crucial for the understanding of
the observed data in many cases, especially in atmosphere and ocean fluid
dynamics, where we are often presented with a complex jigsaw puzzle of waves and
vortices far beyond the threshold of our contemporary simulation and observation
tools. For example, this is highly relevant for extracting the maximum value out
of expensive measurements obtained by aircraft, ships, and satellite-based
remote sensing. The method plays fundamentally into our understanding of
difficult fluid-mechanical processes that are highly relevant for climate
dynamics. Graduate students are included in the work of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The new method is generally applicable to any
fluid mechanical problem that involves stable stratification and/or Coriolis
forces due to background rotation. Preliminary results with the new technique
have been promising, but the technique is limited by a number of restrictive
assumptions that had to be made to derive it cleanly. These include assumptions
about horizontal isotropy and three-dimensional spatial homogeneity of the data
as well as an assumed lack of statistical correlations between waves and
vortices. The present project seeks to remove these restrictions, to make the
new technique much more broadly applicable. This is achieved through a
combination of theoretical analysis, modelling, and numerical simulation, as
well as comparison and testing with real data from the atmosphere and ocean.
