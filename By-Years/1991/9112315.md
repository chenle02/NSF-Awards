In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how notions about gender have
shaped the priorities, methods, and subject matter of science. While historians
of science have studied many aspects of gender influences on science, there
remains large areas that need to be explored if we are to understand the
pervasiveness of these influences. Dr. Schiebinger is examining gender
influences on what might be called the very skeleton of biological sciences--
that is, its classification system. The studies of species, their relationships
to each other and their evolution are dependent upon and reflected in the
classification system. Dr. Schiebinger is examining how gender influenced the
formative stages of natural historical classification. She argues that notions
of gender lay at the heart of 18th century revolutions in views of nature. This
interdisciplinary and historical study divides into three parts, dealing
separately with the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms. Topics to be
explored include: the social and political circumstances surrounding the
sexualization of plants (a key event in the revolution in 18th century botanical
taxonomy); the question of why (considering the alternatives) mammals are called
mammals- -a term which in the 1750's supplanted the term quadruped that had been
used since Aristotle; an analysis of the first scientific representations of
primates; and a study of attempts to classify humans by race and by sex, a topic
only recently of interest to historians of science. These developments are being
considered in a context of broader social trends affecting the development of
science.
