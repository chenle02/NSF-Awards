This project is for a National Research Council study of Self- Assembly and
Biomolecular Materials. The project will be co- funded by the NSF, DOE, and ARO.
Within NSF, the project will be co-funded by the Division of Materials Research,
the Chemistry Division and the Division of Molecular Biology. An
interdisciplinary group, including physicists, chemists, biologists and
engineers will provide a clearer definition of the field; an identification of
scientific and technological opportunities; short-term and long-range research
goals; an evaluation of these goals in the context of national needs and broader
issues, such as education, interdisciplinary research, institutional
cooperation, and international efforts; and recommendations to federal agencies
with an interest in supporting this field on optimum strategies for achieving
these goals.
