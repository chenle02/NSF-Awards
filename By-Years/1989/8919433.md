MEASURING AND MODELLING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF PINE FOREST ECOSYSTEMS - A WORKSHOP
AND GLOBAL SYNTHESIS Dr. Gholz will conduct an international workshop addressing
the interactions among environment, soil conditions and carbon dynamics of Pinus
forests throughout the world. An emphasis will be on the synthesis of existing
large data sets from ecosystem research projects that have focused on stands
dominated by seven different pine species from eleven different sites in the
boreal, temperate and subtropical zones. Extensive use will be made of existing
computer models, although the focus will not be on the models themselves. Three
days of the workshop will address key questions in forest ecosystem science
through a comparison of the differences and similarities among species and sites
in the controls on carbon cycling processes, including canopy dynamics and
carbon fixation, respiration, and allocation to growth and roots. Models will be
used in two days of hands-on simulation sessions to facilitate synthesis.
