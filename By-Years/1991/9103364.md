It is proposed to use archived data of the western north Atlantic to constrain
an inverse, general circulation model. The inverse model will utilize time-
averaged estimates of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, potential
vorticity, float tracks and current meter data for an improved description of
the mean circulation in the vicinity of the gulf stream. This technique should
be applicable to other ocean basins, such as the South Atlantic in the future.
