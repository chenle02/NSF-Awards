9554130 Herr This three year project, sponsored by Catlin Gable School of
Portland, Oregon, will prepare high school teachers of physics to use teaching
techniques based upon the latest developed instrumentation and to apply this
knowledge in their high school physics classes. Twenty teachers will attend
three-week workshops at three sites: Portland, Oregon; Omaha, Nebraska; and Palo
Alto, California, for a total of 60 teachers enhanced each year. The program
will teach the teachers physics content as well as pedagogy based upon the
latest research on student misconceptions. When the project is over, the
teachers will be able to use instrumental techniques to clarify key physics
concepts. They will be taught how to build some of their own equipment from
components easily found at local electronics and hardware stores and develop
laboratory modules based upon these instruments. In total each participant will
have about 100 instrument based experiments which can be used in the classroom.
Each module developed by the participants is evaluated by a well know physics
educator. When these teachers return to their schools, they will be provided
access to the internet and thus will be given support and information from other
teachers using these techniques. Each participant is required to carry out two
workshops for other physics teachers within a year after leaving the project.
Matching funds constitute about 30% of the NSF award.
