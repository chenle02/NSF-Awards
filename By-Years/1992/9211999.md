In this proposal, we plan to continue our theoretical investigations on the wave
and particle dynamical properties associated with ultra-low-frequency magnetic
pulsations in the Earth's magnetosphere. Specifically, we propose to study the
following aspects of the drift-Alfven-ballooning modes: (i) numerical
investigations of the stability properties in self- consistent, anisotropic,
high-B magnetospheric plasmas: (ii) gyrokinetic analyses of associated particle
flux modulations; (iii) nonlinear wave-particle interactions between energetic
ring-current ions and instabilities; and (iv) nonlinear mode- coupling effects
on the instabilities. (i) and (ii) thus deal with the linear aspect of the wave
excitation mechanism and the purpose here is, by comparing with satellite
observations, to identify the mechanisms both qualitatively and quantitatively.
(iii) and (iv) meanwhile examine the nonlinear consequences of the instabilities
in terms of both the saturated wave amplitudes, spectra and induced particle
diffusion. Theoretical results will be compared with available observations.
This proposal constitutes a major portion of a Ph.D dissertation project and,
hence, a three-year grant is requested.
