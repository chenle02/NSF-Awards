This award supports cooperative research on mixed oxide superconducting films
to be carried out by Professors Emile Schweikert and D.L. Cocke at Texas A&amp;M
University and Professors Barros Leite, Baptista, Patnaik and Silveira at the
Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The research will
focus on the application of several modern analytical techniques to the
characterization of doped anodic films, i.e., mixed oxides grown on amorphous
metals and alloys. Techniques which will be refined and developed for this work
include Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and nuclear reaction
analysis (NRA). In addition, surface characterization by particle induced mass
spectrometry will be developed. These techniques will be used to determine the
thickness and composition of these films that exhibit novel catalytic,
resistance to corrosion or superconducting properties. This work continues a
very productive collaboration between Brazilian and U.S. scientists. The
facilities and expertise of both groups contribute, particularly in the
development of the new techniques, RBS and NRA, in Brazil and the sample
preparation and analytical support at Texas A&amp;M. Students at Texas will be
included in Schweikert's study of the surface and thin layer characterization of
the oxide films and in Cocke's sample preparation and analysis.
