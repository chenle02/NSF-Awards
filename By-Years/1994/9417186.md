Cassineli 9417186 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have winds with very large mass-loss
rates and fast terminal speeds. The resultant wind momentum flux greatly exceeds
that in the emergent radiation field. In contrast with the winds of O stars, the
WR winds appear to accelerate rather slowly so that moderate stellar rotation
can lead to a significant enhancement of the density in the equatorial region of
the stars. This research is to develop two-dimensional models of the winds and
to investigate the consequences of the structure for the observations of WR
stars using the "Wind Compression Zone" model. It is based on the "Wind
Compression Disk" model, which was developed for rapidly rotating Be stars. For
stars rotating at about 10% to 20% critical, the wind compression may explain a
number of puzzling observational properties of WR stars, such as why only some
WR stars show polarization and why WR stars with compact companions can have
strong X-ray emission. In addition, we will study the Luminous Blue Variables
(LBVs) using our 2-D WCZ model. These objects are thought to be a precursor
stage to the WR phase. LBVs are observed to have slow winds, and some appear to
have axisymmetric structure (e.g. AG Carinae), which indicates that these stars
are also good candidates for the application of our rotating wind model. There
is also evidence of non-thermal radio emission from WR stars and that the winds
might be source of high energy particle production. Because of these
observations magnetic fields will also be included in the WCZ picture. This will
allow us to re-interpret the observational evidence, and also allow us to
investigate the consequences of the fields on the wind dynamics. ***
