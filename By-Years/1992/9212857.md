Dissertation student: Douglas Hemken; Topic: "Farmers, Scientists, and Boundary
Work: The Origins of Agricultural Science" Mr. Hemken, under the direction of
Dr. Kloppenburg, is undertaking an historical study of the variation in farmers'
and scientists' conceptualization of `science' and its relationship to
agriculture. In US history, agricultural research and agricultural improvement
went through far-reaching social transformations. As experiments and
improvements ceased to be the province of individual farmers and instead became
the product of professional researchers employed by state and federal
governments, the manner in which `science' was defined was crucial in justifying
transformations. Drawing upon agricultural periodicals, agricultural society
transactions, state experiment station reports, and US Department of Agriculture
publications, this study traces how `science' and `farming' were characterized,
and how these characterizations were used to establish social boundaries and
scientific institutions.
