9501774 Bent This career development project describes research and education
thrusts to be implemented over the next five years. It includes the development
of a research program that addresses a molecular-level understanding of surface
chemical processes that describe microelectronics materials fabrication
processes such as chemical vapor deposition, chemical etching, and lithography.
The education thrusts include focusing on the concepts of "connected curriculum"
and "active learning." The goal is to develop instructional methods and a novel
curriculum that allows for students to actively learn material which they see as
an integral part of the world around them. %%% This award provides NSF support
for a junior faculty member to develop a full, balanced academic career in areas
of science and education of high priority. ***
