Politis The general goal of this project is to develop methods of inference for
the statistical analysis of time series and random fields that do not rely on
unrealistic or unverifiable model assumptions. Bootstrap resampling or computer-
intensive methods offer viable approaches to obtaining valid distributional
approximations while assuming very little about the stochastic mechanism
generating the data. However, many important questions need to be addressed in
order for these modern approaches to be applied. The main issues we wish to
tackle include the following: finding general conditions for asymptotic validity
of computer-intensive methods, especially subsampling, in the presence of
nonstationarity; higher-order comparison of block-resampling and subsampling;
developing computationally efficient and accurate estimates of standard error,
and the corresponding improvement on confidence regions for parameters of
interest; optimal choice of design parameters, as well as practical guidelines
for implementation; assessing goodness of fit in time series settings; and
finally interval estimation with random field data. The statistical analysis of
time series and random fields, i.e., observations that exhibit serial (temporal)
or spatial dependence, is vital in many diverse scientific disciplines, with
applications in the fields of physics, engineering, acoustics, geostatistics,
geophysics, medicine, econometrics, ecology, forestry, seismology, and others.
The general goal of this project is to develop methods of statistical inference
in the context of time series and random fields that do not rely on unrealistic
or unverifiable model assumptions. The main approach that will be pursued is the
utilization and refinement of the bootstrap and other computer-intensive
techniques, which so far have been developed extensively and have been proven
very useful in the setting of independent observations.
