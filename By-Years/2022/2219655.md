This grant supports student travel for selected students to attend the Fifth
Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys 2022), which will be held at
the Santa Clara Convention Center in California, United States during Aug.
29â€“Sep. 1, 2022. MLSys targets research at the intersection of machine learning
and systems, and aims to elicit new connections amongst these fields, including
identifying best practices and design principles for learning systems, as well
as developing novel learning methods and theory tailored to practical machine
learning workflows. Students will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the
technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that MLSys fosters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate student attendance is vital to
the growth of the MLSys community. This grant helps to sustain student
participation, particularly those from institutions where travel funds may not
otherwise be available. Emphasis will be given to directing support towards
underrepresented minorities, including women, African-Americans, Hispanics,
Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Students will have the
opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and
background. Support will increase the attendance of talented undergraduate
students, attracting them to graduate studies and future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
