The research objective of this award is to develop a mathematical framework that
will support the design of high performance, robust MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical
Systems) resonators. The primary focus of the research is on developing methods
to design resonator structures with high Quality factors (Q-factors, the most
critical design parameter for the performance of MEMS resonators), and reduce
the effect of fabrication uncertainties on performance variations. The research
approach is to construct stochastic design optimization upon the numerical
models of Q-factors and collected test data on MEMS resonator samples. The
validity of the resulting design framework will be demonstrated using MEMS
gyroscopes. By building a design framework that combines numerical models of
Q-factors, design optimization, and testing data, this research will result in
methods to achieve design solutions to MEMS resonators with high Q-factors and
design robustness, without the need for trial-and-error
cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
provide a framework for designing high performance MEMS resonators. These
resonators have widespread civilian and military uses including integrated
sensory and wireless communication microsystems, sensing devices, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and consumer/military electronics. Producing MEMS
resonators which are robust to fabrication uncertainties has the potential to
improve US security and the ability of the US to remain competitive in
microsystem design. Based on this research, a K-12 outreach plan will be carried
out which includes research projects, an education module for summer camps for
local high school students, and field-trips for local elementary school
students. Both undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups
will be brought into the research, through collaborations with Norfolk State
University, an HBCU institution in the same city as Old Dominion University
(ODU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
