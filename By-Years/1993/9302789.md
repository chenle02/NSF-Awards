This Research Planning Grant will support preliminary studies into adaptive
algorithms to segment gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid in
magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The segmentation criteria will be based on
intensity and relative location of pixels. The intended use of the segmentation
algorithm is to allow accurate measures of brain changes that occur in
Alzheimer's disease to be made. The Planning Grant will allow the PI to do work
on the project for one year to obtain preliminary results that will form the
basis of a full proposal on the topic.
