Dr. Jennifer A. Griffiths has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Griffiths received the doctoral degree from the
University of California at Los Angeles under the supervision of Professor
Mostafa A. El-Sayed. Dr. Griffiths will continue research at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst under the sponsorship of Professor David Tirrell. The
postdoctoral research will focus on the immobilization of proteins and model
protein systems, such as helical polypeptide polymers, on solid surfaces. The
goal is to develop surface bound monolayers of monodisperse helical polymer
systems in which there is 3-dimensional control of the protein conformation and
assembly at the interface through selective placement of a cysteine residue in
the helix. The helical systems utilized are cysteine analogs of polyglutamic
acid polymer generated by biological synthesis. The work leads to new materials
and applications for biopolymeric systems in interfacial chemistry. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
