This award will provide funds for support of a program of research in high
energy physics at Fermilab by a group from the Universitiy of Michigan. The
proposed research include participation in experiments E756 and E800 to study
the polarization and the magnetic moment of the omega-minus hyperon to a
precision of a few percent. It is very important to measure acurately these
quantities, since the value of the magnetic moment of particles can act as
strong constraint on existing theoretical predictions. The program of research
also includes the study of the production of jets of particles at large
transverse momenta by a tagged high energy photon beam at the Fermilab Tevatron,
to study quantum chromodynamics processes (Experiment E683).
