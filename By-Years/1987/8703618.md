The goal of this project to gain an understanding of the structure and function
of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Specifically, molecular genetic approaches will
be applied to an investigation of two key peptides of the oligomeric enzyme from
yeast: 1) the beta subunit of the F1-ATPase, and 2) the oligomycin sensitive
conferring peptide (OSCP) that links F1 with F0 domain. The beta subunit is
thought to be at least a part of the catalytic site for ATP synthesis. The role
of specific amino acids in catalysis or binding will be evaluated by site
directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides and by random mutagenesis using
chemical methodology. The mutations will be studied by introducing the mutated
genes into a beta subunit deficient yeast strain determining its effect on
function. For the OSCP unit the gene will be cloned, sequenced and studied in a
similar manner as is planned for the beta subunit. The results of the research
should enhance our understanding of how ATP, the key compound involved in
transduction of energy in biological systems, is synthesized.
