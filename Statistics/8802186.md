This research has two components. One is to systematically study mixture models
for multivariate distributions, as they arise naturally in physicaly settings,
statistical derivations, and Bayesian analysis. These models often shed light on
the applicability and properties of derived distributions. In addition,
functional equation techniques are employed, particularly in the study of
multivariate distributions with uniform marginals. The second component is to
generalize reliability models. This research is in multivariate statistics and
aims to create and characterize mathematical models which permit meaningful
relationships between variables.
