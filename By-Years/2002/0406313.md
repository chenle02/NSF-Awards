The workshop will focus on initiating cooperative activities to accelerate
research and the deployment of testbeds for critical and pervasive applications
across academia, industry, and government incorporating advanced information
technologies. It will bring together computer scientists in security,
networking, software engineering, and other fields to work with application
scientists and engineers to gain insight into common problems and to identify
common goals across many pervasive and critical application domains. The
workshop will identify technology needs and major testbed problems in science
and engineering research areas of interest to industry and to the National
Science Foundation. It will identify technical and resource requirements for
achieving significant progress on the global challenges of Digital Government,
National Security, Emergency Preparedness, and Homeland Security.
