Abstract

DRL - 0839209 Building State Representative Samples by Merging State
Administrative Data with National Longitudinal Data to Study Transitions from
High School to College

LoGerfo, Laura National Center for Education Statistics U.S. Department of
Education

This project augments an NCES data collection effort for the High School
Longitudinal Study by including 150 additional schools in up to 10 selected
states to create state representative samples of at least 40 schools in each
state. NCES will create a contract with a survey organization to collect survey
data from students in about 800 schools starting at the 9th grade and following
them to age 26. The student, teacher, and parent survey data will be merged with
state administrative data. Thus the final data set for these states will include
detailed longitudinal data on student education histories, test scores, courses,
demographics, and other survey information about parents and teachers. In some
of the states the student data will be linked with detailed teacher data.

The purpose of this augmentation is to provide support for additional schools to
create state samples. NSF will also be involved in planning for future surveys
of these students as they reach college age.
