In the engineering design process, the decisions pertaining to the topology of
the system are in general, based on intuition and experience. Once the topology
has been selected, the dimensional variables of the system are sized and
optimized for the selected topology. This, however, may not provide the best
solution since other competing topologies have already been rejected based on
intuition. This research plans to incorporate topological decisions in the
framework of design optimization. This will be done by using 0-1 design
variables to represent topological decisions involving a choice between
alternative designs. Another related problem which will be addressed in this
research deals with the support of multidisciplinary considerations in the
design process. This will be accomplished through a use of multiple objective
functions in the problem formulation. This research will furnish a design tool
which can be utilized to (i) generate and evaluate the feasibility and relative
merit of alternative design concepts, (ii) help develop detailed optimum designs
for promising concepts, and (iii) will provide an impetus for the development of
better computer-aided design tools and optimization methodologies to help
support preliminary and detailed design activities.
