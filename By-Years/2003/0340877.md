The purpose of this workshop is to identify and understand various resources and
capabilities necessary for successful pervasive computing and networking
research. To achieve these goals the organizer will invite speakers and solicit
talks. Specific recommendations will address:

-Identify and prioritize the major research problems in pervasive computing and
networking

-Identify and prioritize technological challenges impeding the optimal
integration of various computing and networking technologies toward
pervasiveness.

-Identify specific projects or programs where pervasive computing and networking
could significantly enhance the research efforts.

-Define the new methodologies and technologies being utilized for pervasive
computing and networking research.

-Communicate to university scientists how emerging pervasive computing and
networking technology can improve college- and graduate-level education and
research capabilities.
