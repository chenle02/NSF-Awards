The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting work at the University of Delaware under the supervision of Professor
Szalewicz to obtain state-of-the-art intermolecular potential energy surfaces
for van der Waals molecules using his recently developed many-electron
formulation of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Application will be made to
systems for which experimental data are available but for which the
interpretation may be controversial. %%% Hydrogen bond formation between
molecules is one of the most important but least understood mechanisms for
interaction between many molecules of biological importance or between such
molecules and a solvent. This project attempts a high level examination of
somewhat simpler systems to develop the basis for a more complete physical
understanding of the interaction.
