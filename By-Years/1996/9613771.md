An extensive data set of Lagrangian measurements of sea surface temperature, sea
surface salinity and mixed layer circulation will used in conjunction with
Eulerian measurements from other sources (moorings from the Tropical Ocean
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program's observing system and moorings deployed during
the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE)) to assemble a space-
time description of the surface circulation and sea level of the western
tropical Pacific Ocean over a 40-month period. The goal is to determine the
horizontal structure and evolution of the advective properties of oceanic
dynamic fields in the tropical mixed layer on time scales of days to months. In
addition, the hypothesis that large spatial scale variations of heat and
salinity at the equator are determined by advection from wind-driven Yoshida
jets will be examined. The upper ocean data set will also be used to
parameterize the near surface turbulent flux convergence as a function of
surface fluxes, provide an alternate way to determine surface fluxes.
