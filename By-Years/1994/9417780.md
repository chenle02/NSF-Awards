9417780 Johnson This project is an experimental study of the behavior of
sediments in subduction zones. A major question to be addressed is whether
sediments melt or dehydrate beneath arc volcanoes. Another goal is to determine
rock/melt and rock/fluid distribution coefficients for important element tracers
that can be used in quantitative models. The proposed research will involve high
pressure and high temperature laboratory experiments on natural pelitic samples
and on metapelites. The chemical compositions of aqueous solutes, melts and
residual solid run products will be measured using a new experimental design
derived from recent advances in experimental petrology combined with
ultrasensitive analytical tools. The data collected should generate further
insights into (a) the role of subducted sedimentary material in arc
petrogenesis, and (2) the efficiency of crustal recycling throughout Earth
history, and (3) the thermal structure of subducting slabs.
