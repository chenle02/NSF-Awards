Rotifers are small planktonic animals commonly occurring and often dominant in
the zooplankton of offshore marine environments, estuaries, slow-moving rivers,
and freshwater lakes. They are important in the food chains of most aquatic
ecosystems. The experimentally determined relationships proposed in this study
will increase our understanding of the mechanisms determining the composition
and structure of freshwater zooplankton communities in nature. This study should
help explain patterns of species distribution, size, and morphology (e.g. body
spines, mucus sheaths, flattened vs. oblate bodies) which can not be explained
with current theory. Each species has a body size and form that may influence
its hydrodynamic characteristics and, hence, affect the energetic balance
between swimming and food collection. This may affect reproduction at low food
levels. The kinds of species which can maintain positive population growth rates
in low food environments will affect energy flow and food web relationships. The
species structure of the zooplankton, in turn, affects the production of
organisms higher in the food chain. Therefore, the basic research proposed in
this study has direct application for understanding fundamental zooplankton
community organization which, ultimately, affects energy flow and, hence, fish
production for human or animal consumption.
