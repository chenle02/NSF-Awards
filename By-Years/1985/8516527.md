The objective of the research is two-fold. First, algorithms will be developed
for solving nonlinear optimization problems in which some of the variables may
assume certain combinations of discrete values. These algorithms must be
efficient in terms of minimizing the amount of analysis required to solve the
problem. Second, these algorithms will be tested by implementing them into a
general-purpose computer program for selecting beams and columns for rectangular
steel-framed buildings. The approach for solving optimization problems with
related discrete variables consists of: (1) executing a pre-processing algorithm
which generates constraints enclosing the available combinations of discrete
values, (2) executing standard nonlinear programming software to obtain the
continuous optimun, and (3) executing a post-processing algorithm to find the
discrete optimum within a neighborhood of the continuous optimum.
