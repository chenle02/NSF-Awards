Research principally in electromagnetic nuclear physics is planned. Most of the
experimental effort will be directed towards CEBAF. A photon tagger will be
developed for use in approved CEBAF experiments relating to structure of the
nucleon anomalous magnetic moment, shadowing phenomena in total photo-
absorption, and vector meson decay of nucleon resonances. Research on low energy
nuclear structure using magnetic electron scattering will be carried out at the
Darmstadt microtron in Germany. Work will continue on development of a new
neutral meson spectrometer for use in pion charge exchange and other pion
reactions at LAMPF and elsewhere.
