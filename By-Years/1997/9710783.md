This project analyzes fetoscopy as a network composed of objects and subjects
that form an environment in which tools and ideas become meaningful parts of a
reproductive technology. The objective is to identify how fetoscopy may be
understood as the outcome of multiple social interactions by asking how research
groups, patients, and their larger social and technical networks interact to
develop the new reproductive technology (NRT) fetoscopy. Today, fetoscopy is
being developed as two separate, yet similar, techniques: diagnostic
embryofetoscopy and operative fetoscopy. While both procedures use a scope to
make in utero diagnoses, they are used during different periods of gestation and
have varied therapeutic goals including fetal gene therapy and surgery. To
identify how persons create these new developments and how they may explicitly
and implicitly create meaning from their experiences with the tools, this
research utilizes an ethnographic study including participant observation,
interviews, citation indexes and textual analyses of two hospitals developing
fetoscopy
