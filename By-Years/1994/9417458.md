Peter Kollman, School of Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco is
supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to
continue his research in the development of analytical potential functions for
non-covalent interactions. This research is directed at developing and refining
molecular mechanical models that accurately describe both the conformational
equilibria and intermolecular interaction energies between molecules in
molecular simulation calculations. New models for the electrostatic, van der
Waals and non-additive energies will be assessed, making extensive use of
accurate ab initio calculations to provide calibration. The models will be
tested on condensed phase systems to enable comparison with experimental
energies and structures. Applications of these models will be made to problems
in molecular recognition. Kollman will attempt to determine, through free energy
perturbation theory, binding constants for ionic binding to spherands,
velcraplexes, carcerands, and to the adenine receptor. In recent years computer
simulations have provided valuable insights into the detailed molecular dynamics
of complex organic and biomolecular systems such as proteins. The quality of
these simulations depend critically on the quality of the model potential
functions used. A great deal of effort has been expended in developing more
sophisticated analytical numerical models for the interaction energies between
molecules. Kollman's research is directed at improving the quality of these
molecular mechanics model potential functions used for performing simulations of
complex organic and biomolecular systems.
