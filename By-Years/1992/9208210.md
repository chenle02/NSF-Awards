This is a project to upgrade the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility existing
within the Chemistry Department of Pennsylvania State University. The upgrade
includes an improved detection/frequency generation system for the 11.7 T
spectrometer, the installation of a third channel for triple-resonance three-
dimensional data set collection, and the replacement of the obsolete MicroVAX II
computer by Silicon Graphics workstations. The upgraded instrumentation will be
used to study, for example, the factors underlying catalysis and substrate
binding in DNA polymerase I, T4 polymerase complex, dihydrofolate reductase and
trifunctional enzymes in the de novo pathway for purine biosynthesis; stability
and folding patterns of apo b heme proteins; determination of structural
features of proteins in solution; and the mechanism by which the primary
structure of a protein directs the rapid and efficient folding to the native
conformation.
