0207214&lt;br/&gt;Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope is a major earth science
research initiative that will integrate scientific information derived from
seismology (US Array), geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling
and measurement (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and
geophysics to understand continental scale plate deformation and evolution.
Funding for the EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in Congress
as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002
funds available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e.
activities that will facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication,
installation or operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major
Research Equipment Facilities and Construction) account. Such activities include
meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection or
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds to support
the deployment of dense linear seismic arrays across and along the San Andreas
fault (SAF) near the SAFOD drilling site at Parkfield, CA to record fault-zone
trapped waves generated by explosions and microearthquakes. Since the features
of fault-zone trapped waves strongly depend on the fault geometry and physical
properties, these waves can be used to determine spatial and temporal variation
in fault properties with high precision. This experiment will be a supplement to
other seismic experiments at Parkfield scheduled in the Fall of
2002.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
