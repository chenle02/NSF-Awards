University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next "Weekend
Algebra Conference" is scheduled for the fall of 2003 at Florida Atlantic
University. Over the years, this series of conferences has attracted notable
mathematicians from numerous universities throughout the Southeast, with areas
of interest ranging from infinite abelian groups and modules over domains to
representation type of categories of modules and categories of subgroups.
These&lt;br/&gt;conferences have allowed numerous algebraists from smaller
universities to meet, exchange research ideas, and forge institutional
partnerships and relationships. The proposed project encourages increased
participation by young mathematicians, by providing travel support for up to
fifteen graduate students and recent doctoral recipients to attend this
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dependence of science and engineering (as well
as business and economics) on mathematics is generally recognized. Thus, a
steady supply of skilled mathematicians is crucial to maintaining the health of
the university system. Mathematicians, in order to be effective in their
professional careers, need to pursue a path of intellectual growth and scholarly
activity. A key component of this intellectual activity is the chance to meet
regularly with other mathematicians and exchange ideas. For the last thirty
years, the yearly "Weekend Algebra Conferences" have provided this opportunity
to numerous mathematicians from universities throughout the Southeast. The
proposed project offers travel support to developing mathematicians to attend
the next meeting in this series, in the fall of 2003. By limiting support to
students and untenured faculty, the proposed project focuses on nurturing
mathematicians early in their careers, thus addressing the long-term research
and educational infrastructure of mathematics departments in the Southeast.
Special effort to recruit women and minorities for funding broadens the impact
of the proposed project by increasing the participation of underrepresented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
