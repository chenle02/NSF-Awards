Dynamical systems, a branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of time
evolutions of processes, is widely recognized as a basic tool for science. The
research here is aimed at connecting dynamical systems theory to its potential
applications. It will lead to significant advances within the field, greatly
expanding its scope. It will promote the cross-fertilization between mathematics
and other scientific disciplines including the biological sciences, focusing in
this research on the mathematics of epidemiology and neuroscience. The research
projects will offer training opportunities for students and junior scientists,
and the principal investigator, a female mathematician, will serve as role model
and contribute to diversity within the scientific work force. The research seeks
to connect dynamical systems theory to applications in two different ways. One
is to improve the applicability of existing theory by incorporating ideas of
relevance (such as random noise and finite-time effects) and by introducing
spatial and temporal scales to classical concepts. The principal investigator
will work toward increasing the pool of concrete examples to promote the
usefulness of the field. The other is to use dynamical systems tools to tackle
problems that arise in the biological sciences. There are two specific topics in
this research. One concerns the timeliness of the response to epidemic
outbreaks; the problem is cast in the framework of infinite dimensional
dynamical systems defined by delay differential equations. Another project
analyzes, as a paradigm of the competition ubiquitous in biology, the dynamical
interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in local circuits of the
cerebral cortex.
