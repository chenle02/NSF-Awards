The R/V THOMPSON has a full schedule for 1993, with its primary focus on the
U.S.World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) program in the Pacific. Four
cruises are planned for a total of 151 days. In addition, cruises are planned
for Collier's mooring recovery for the JGOFS program, Kulm's study of the
convergent margin and Von Herzen's heat flow as a fault plane stress indicator,
totaling 72 days. The University of Washington will use 50 days of THOMPSON time
to provide instruction for graduate and undergraduate students in oceanography
during extended transit legs. The R/V BARNES has a light schedule of 61
operating days in 1993. Six NSF programs will be provided a total of 44 days of
ship time all within the inland waters of the Puget Sound region. Thirteen days
of state-funded cruises for academic instruction are planned, and commercial use
of the vessel is projected at a level of four days. Because of the light
schedule and an effort to maintain the BARNES the crewing will be restructured.
