This is a workshop to identify the research needs in the area of power quality.
The topic is a special subset of electric power engineering. The topic of Power
quality refers to the ability of the power distribution system to satisfy loads
with a sinusoidal bus voltage waveform at rated voltage and frequency. Also
included are studies of harmonics, momentary outages, impulses, pulse- modulated
load currents, non-linear loads, power factor correction under distorted
waveform conditions, and modelling power systems for the analysis of non-
sinusoidal signals. The objectives of the workshop are to identify the highest
priorities in research in this area and to stimulate work in those areas.
