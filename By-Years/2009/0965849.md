Character varieties lie at the confluence of many important areas of mathematics
including algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and three dimensional
topology, Kleinian groups, Teichmuller theory, dynamical systems, gauge theory,
and number theory. Their study reveals many deep and rich connections between
these fields. Software developed by some of the investigators has been useful in
studying these problems. Participants will also profit from the opportunity to
interact and experiment with computer experts during the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program brings together leading experts from
these different backgrounds to lay the foundations, explore inter-connections,
report recent developments and to chart new directions. Furthermore graduate
students and young researchers will be exposed to this field. This meeting will
bring together researchers in diverse, but related areas, from all over the
world. Graduate students and postdocs especially will benefit from the
minicourses being offered in the summer school. Researchers working in the
Australasia region, especially Japan, China, Korea, India, Singapore, Australia
and New Zealand will have a chance to interact with their counterparts in Europe
and America.&lt;br/&gt;
