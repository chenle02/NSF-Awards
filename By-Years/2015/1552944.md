Many software systems can be configured by enabling or
disabling&lt;br/&gt;configuration options. As options can be combined flexibly,
the&lt;br/&gt;configuration space grows exponentially. Therefore highly-
configurable systems are notoriously hard to test. While many combinations of
options work well, specific configurations may expose faulty or surprising
behavior emerging from interactions among options. Due to the huge search space,
interactions are difficult to find. In fact, since no complete and sound
techniques exist to study interactions in large scale systems, little is known
about interactions in practice. This research&lt;br/&gt;explores a novel program
execution technique, variational execution, to efficiently execute a large
number of configurations or similar programs and inspect the differences among
those executions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variational execution will aid
understanding and detection of interactions among configuration options in
highly-configurable software systems and contribute to better quality assurance
and development methods. It will transform the way to test configurable systems,
including most of today?s end-user software, software ecosystems, and
critical&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure software, such as SSL libraries and databases.
The insights gained into interactions in real-world systems fill an important
gap in our understanding of interactions, relevant for teaching software design
and quality assurance. Additionally, it will enable advances in exploring
interactions and large search spaces for broader software engineering purposes,
including higher-order mutation testing, program repair, and sensitivity
analysis.
