The goal of this research is to lessen the impact of the increasing speed
disadvantage of memories when compared to processors. The focus in this project
will be the design and evaluation of profiling techniques and hardware assists
to allow better utilization and performance of the memory hierarchy. The planned
efforts are to (1) improve the efficiency of on-chip caches by using better code
and data placement informed by profiling; (2) determine when it is advantageous
to bypass the data cache; (3) take advantage of page and burst modes of modern
DRAMs; (4) investigate methods to reduce data latency by prefetching; and (5)
design hardware assists at the main memory interface for compaction or partial
transfer of data. These techniques will be evaluated using trace-driven
simulations or profiling of binary executables for SPEC benchmarks and
commercial applications.
