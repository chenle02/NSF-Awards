This award supports the research in combinatorics and number theory of Professor
Wen-Ching Li of The Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Li's project is centered
on questions relating modular forms to graph theory. Among the questions she
will investigate are: to realize certain Ramanujan graphs as quotients of trees
associated to projective linear groups over p-adic fields; to continue her
collaboration with Dr. F.K. Hwang of Bell Laboratories on generalized double
loop networks; and to study the Galois structure of p-Sylow subgroups of ideal
class groups. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century
as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had
realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their
basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given
rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular
and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally
concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and
analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots. The work of Professor
Li is in this tradition, but extends beyond the traditional boundaries of the
theory of modular forms in a particularly interdisciplinary thrust.
