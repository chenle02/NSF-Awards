9423032 Segal This dissertation research examines the impact of Supreme Court
decisions on public opinion in local communities in which the cases are
generated. Four decisions by the court (two civil- liberties and two
economic/property rights cases) will be studied. The two-wave panel research
design will measure opinions on the issue both before and after the Supreme
Court decision. Each panel will consist of two geographic samples of residents
of the immediate town where the case originate and residents of the surrounding
towns. This research will investigate the levels of awareness of the case,
levels of opinion change, and citizens' evaluation of the Court after it has
decided the case. This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact
Supreme Court rulings have on the opinions of residents of the community in
which the case originates, how rulings affect their evaluation of the Court, and
their perception of the impact of the Court on their lives. ***
