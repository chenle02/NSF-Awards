This award provides funds to a group of investigators for the development of a
new generation of quantitative fluorescence microscopy/imaging workstations. The
techniques required for the project come from fluorescence microscopy, image
analysis, computer science, and computer animation. One of the workstations to
be developed will be useful in fluorescence spectroscopy of living cells, the
other in immunofluorescence studies and in the use of fluorescent probes for in
situ nucleic hybridization. In recent years, the application of video recording
and computer based image analysis techniques has begun a revolution in the
design and use of light microscopes for the examination of both living and fixed
cells. Continued progress in these developments is dependent on knowledge in a
number of different disciplines. Carnegie Mellon has assembled an outstanding
group of investigators and technical staff in its Center for Fluorescence
Research in Biomedical Sciences; they will bring the necessary level of skill
and diversity to this project.
