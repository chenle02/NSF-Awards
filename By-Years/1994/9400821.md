9400821 Pietsch The islands of the Kuril Archipelago form the eastern boundary
of the Okhotsk Sea and a bridge between Hokkaido, the northernmost island of
Japan, and the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka. They are a natural laboratory for
investigations into the origin of insular populations. Although considerable
information is available for wide-ranging, commercially important species, such
as salmon and marine mammals, the flora and fauna of the Kurils as a whole are
poorly known. At the same time, the current political situation poses a serious
environmental threat to the islands. A team of no more than twelve Russian,
Japanese, and American scientists will conduct a survey and inventory of the
freshwater and terrestrial mollusks of Kunashir and Iturup, two of the most
biologically diverse islands of the Kuril Archipelago. Working cooperatively
with universities and the national and local governments of the host country,
the project will provide training for faculty, students and government
biologists. The results of this preliminary expedition will demonstrate whether
a full-scale biotic survey, of the kind described in the initial proposal, is
feasible. At the same time, the work will represent a significant start toward
building a foundation of information to promote long-term future research and
conservation.
