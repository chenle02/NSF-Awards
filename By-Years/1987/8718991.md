Boston University has several researchers who would benefit from access to
supercomputing. Through this grant for connection to NSFNET, they will be able
to access six federally-funded supercomputing centers which are linked by the
National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). The campus will be connected by a
medium speed (56,000 baud per second) communication line to the JVNC network as
part of a New England extension to their already existing consortium network.
This communication line as well as the gateway/router will be provided by the
John von Neumann Center through a supplemental grant to their current award.
Network management service will also be provided by JVNC.
