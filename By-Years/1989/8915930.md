The objective of this research proposal is to test the hypothesis that specific
types of germ cells in the testis produce proteins that stimulated Sertoli cell
function. Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids are isolated by
centrifugal elutriation and the purified populations of germ cells are incubated
for 24 hours in vitro, after which the conditioned media is collected. These
germ cell proteins are dialyzed, concentrated and lyophilized. Sertoli cells are
grown in vitro on Matrigel coated filters mounted i a novel bicameral culture
chamber system that mimics to a large extent the growth of these cells in vivo.
Using the concentrated germ cell proteins it will be possible to 1)show that
metabolically labeled germ cell proteins are specifically bound and sequestered
by Sertoli cells 2) demonstrate that germ cell proteins stimulate the secretion
of several specific immunopreciptiable Sertoli cell proteins 3) using ELISA for
transferrin secretion from Sertoli cells it will be possible to purify the germ
cell stimulatory protein by liquid chromatography and raise antibodies to the
protein for future functional studies. These studies will provide a significant
insight into the paracrine interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells in
the testis. Furthermore, purification of the germ cell paracrine protein and
production of its antibody will provide probes for elucidation of the mechanisms
that locally regulate differentiation and development during spermatogenesis.
%%% The maturation of sperm cells in mammals requires the interaction of these
cells with surrounding cells. This study will elucidate the mechanisms of some
of those required interactions.
