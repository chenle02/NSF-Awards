9417917 Rutherford This award provides partial (75%) funding for an upgrade to
the electron microprobe installed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at Brown University. The institution is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary to carry out the project. The components of the
upgrade will include a new computer for the operating system and a new wave-
length dispersive X-ray spectrometer system. The electron microprobe is a
heavily used analytical instrument combining accurate chemical composition
measurement capabilities with micrometer scale spatial resolution. Several
active research faculty and their students at Brown are dependent on the
capabilities of the upgraded microprobe for their research in petrology,
volcanology, planetary science, experimental geochemistry, and oceanography. ***
