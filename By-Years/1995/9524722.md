Public agencies and corporate landholders are developing and maintaining major
environmental databases for computerized mapping and analysis. The cost of such
databases increases rapidly with increasing spatial detail. This project
undertakes the development of objective and efficient methods for determining
patterns of spatial variation from such databases - particularly relating to
water resources and landscape ecology - and for making pattern comparisons
between databases having different levels of detail. Comparison of patterns
emerging from data at different levels of detail will enable managers to select
the appropriate spatial resolution necessary for particular purposes. Cost
efficiency will also be increased by the ability to indicate likely zones of
spatial uncertainty and detect areas of disagreement between alternate
hydrologic models, so that detailed data acquisition can be better targeted and
modeling will be more precise. Application of these approaches will provide a
better basis for districting watersheds, reducing the costs of monitoring and
detecting the need for remediation.
