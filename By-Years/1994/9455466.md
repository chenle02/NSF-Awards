The School of Engineering and Mines (SEM) in a partnership with industry in 1988
established three distance-learning undergraduate engineering programs, offered
in parallel with corresponding traditional on-campus degrees. This initiative
gave access to an engineering education to students who, because of locations
and schedules, otherwise could not pursue an engineering education. The
distance-learning students, by virtue of their paraprofessional experience, have
needs, expectations, motivations, knowledge bases, and skills that differ from
those of traditional students. Thus, the curricula must be modified to meet
students' needs efficiently, incorporating their experiential knowledge base and
skills inventory, while simultaneously ensuring validated compliance with ABET
accreditation standards. It is also critical that faculty develop strategies for
attaining maximum teaching effectiveness in the distance-learning environment.
The stakeholders for the "Enhanced Curriculum for Undergraduate Engineering
Adult Learners in Industry" include engineering educators, industry, and
undergraduate adult learners. Program objectives include: (a) completing a
comparison of a broad range of cognitive and performance based competencies of
distance-education students and traditional students; (b) enhancing curricula to
meet the unique needs of adult learners while adhering to ABET standards, (c)
developing faculty members' competencies needed to enhance teaching of non-
traditional learners; (d) evaluating program outcomes using summative and
formative techniques; e) disseminating results which document the evolution of
an ABET accredited, undergraduate distance-learning program in engineering.
