Interactions of phospholipases A1, A2, and phosphatidylinositol- specific
phospholipase C (PI-PLC) with lipid membrane systems will be investigated with
respect to the mechanisms of action, substrate specificities, interactions with
lipid interfaces, and the nature of activation by the lipid interface. Kinetics
will be studied using thiolester substrate analogs a continuous
spectrophotometric assay with mixed-micelles, and with short- chain substrate
homologs in monolayer systems. Protein-lipid interactions will be studied by
fluorescence spectroscopy, and by penetration of proteins into monolayers of
non-hydrolyzable phospholipids. Genetically engineered native hepatic lipase
(phospholipase A1) and mutants (at the putative lipid-binding site) expressed
from cDNA of rat hepatic lipase will be studied. The kinetics of PI-PLC from
Baccilus cereus will be studied in micellar systems with thiophosphate ester
analogs of phosphatidylinositol, and in a monolayer system. The kinetics of
phospholipase A2 (PLA2 from human synovial fluid will be studied in mixed-
micelle and monolayer systems. PLA2S from porcine pancreas, and snake venom
(Crotalus adamanteus) will also be studied. The nature of autocatalytic
derivatization of PLA2 by acyl transfer from the substrate, and its subsequent
dimerization and activation, will be investigated with fluorescent-labeled
substrate analogs. These are very attractive proteins with which to study
protein- lipid interactions since they act preferentially at the lipid- water
interface and have a functional activity which can readily be followed. Although
much enzymology has been done on soluble enzymes with soluble substrates, many
enzymes act at membrane interfaces. The significance of this research is the
understanding of the interactions of enzymes with lipid substrates at an
interface.
