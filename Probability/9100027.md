The principal investigator will continue his work in the general area of
extreme values, inference and stochastic models with broad overlap between the
different areas. Several of the proposed problems are concerned with the
interplay between extreme value theory, point process methods, asymptotic theory
and applications of these ideas to time series analysis and choice theory. In
addition, the investigator will work on problems of random sets and
multidimensional problems. The principal investigator will continue his work in
the general area of extreme values, both from the inference as well as from the
stochastic model point of view. This area of research falls in the interface
between statistics (inference) and probability (stochastic models). One
particular application of this work will be to time series analysis.
