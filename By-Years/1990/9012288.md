This work is concerned with the development of a prescriptive type system for
logic programs, i.e., one in which types are explicitly declared by the
programmer. The system is quite expressive in that it supports parametric
polymorphism, subtypes, and a new notion called bipartisan predicate types that
facilitates the use of subtypes. These features make it possible to impose types
on a wide range of realistic Prolog programs. The research includes the
development of the theoretical foundations of the system, the design and
implementation of type checking and inferencing algorithms, and the application
of the system to compile-time optimization, in particular, to current NSF-
supported work on the automatic parallelization of logic programs. The work is
intended to impact both software development technology and compiler technology.
