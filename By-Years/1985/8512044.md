The Fifth U.S. National Conference on Wind Engineering will be held on the
campus of Texas Tech University November 6-8, 1985. The conference will:
expedite early communication of research activities and research findings,
stimulate exchange of knowledge and research in complementary research areas,
and promote lines of communication between research workers and practicing
architects and engineers for rapid utilization of research findings in
professional practice. The two and one-half day conference will consist of
sessions on a variety of subjects concerning wind engineering research and
applications. Some of the specific subjects are wind tunnel and field testing
for wind effects, characterization of wind, assessment of wind hazard, windstorm
damage mitigation, and application and innovations in wind engineering. The
presentations will consist of invited papers and papers selected from abstract
submission. Proceedings will be printed from the papers received and will be
distributed at the conference. Anticipated attendance at the conference is 200
persons.
