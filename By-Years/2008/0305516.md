This proposal from a Rutgers University group requests funds to support a
program of experimental high energy physics research at the world's highest
energy hadron colliders and a program involving the study of the highest-energy
cosmic rays. The collider program involves the continuing collaboration in the
CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron and the CMS experiment at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The CDF experiment is currently in a tuning/data-taking
phase and is expected to run for a number of years. The CMS experiment is being
prepared to begin operation in 2007. The CMS work includes development of
chemical-vapor-deposition diamond detectors for use in the CMS detector in
radiation environments where Silicon detectors cannot survive. The High
Resolution Fly's Eye experiment (HiRes) in Utah uses atmospheric fluorescence to
study ultra high-energy cosmic rays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
has a strong educational component. It provides direct support and training for
a number of graduate and undergraduate students and through the QuarkNet program
they run summer workshops for high school teachers and Rutgers physicists
participate in summer programs for high school students at Fermilab. &lt;br/&gt;
