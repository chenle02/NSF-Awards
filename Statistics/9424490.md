PROPOSAL: DMS 94-24490 PI: Mike West TITLE: WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL MIXTURE
MODELLING ABSTRACT: The Workshop provides a forum for reviewing and publicizing
widely dispersed research activities in mixture modelling, to stimulate
fertilization of theoretical, methodological and computational research
directions for the near future, and, significantly, to focus attention on the
burgeoning arena of applied problems in complex stochastic systems that are
inherently structured in mixture terms. The Workshop will heavily concentrate in
topical problems with strong cross-disciplinary and computational components,
featuring mixture problems in areas such as density estimation, regression and
time series; mixtures in statistical image modelling and analysis, neural
networks and signal processing; graphical models and networks; stochastic
simulation for mixture analysis; clustering and classification problems; model
selection and combination; alternative approaches to inference in mixtures;
latent variables and incomplete data problems; and applications of mixtures in
various scientific areas. The Workshop is held in recognition of the recent
growth and development in the theory and, in particular, applications of
statistical methods based on mixtures of distributions. Mixture models play key
roles in many complex modelling and inference problems in science, engineering
and social sciences, and advances in computational statistical technology have,
and continue to, promote their wider use. This Workshop provides a forum for
reviewing and publicizing widely dispersed research activities in mixture
modelling, stimulating fertilization of theoretical, methodological and
computational research directions for the near future, and focusing attention on
the wide variety of significant applied problems in complex stochastic systems
that are inherently structured in mixture terms. The workshop will bring
together senior researchers, new researchers and students from various
backgrounds to prom ote exchange and interactions on the frontiers of
statistical mixture modelling, to highlight the development of statistical
technology across these fields, to promote interchanges between researchers in
various applied fields, and to highlight the utility of mixture models in
diverse fields such as genetics, astronomy and physics, the neuro-sciences, and
others.
