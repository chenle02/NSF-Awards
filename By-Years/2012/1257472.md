Parasitic organisms have independently evolved in every major lineage of life on
Earth, however we know very little about the transition from free-living to
parasite. Red algal parasites are ideal model organisms for investigating the
origins of a parasitic life-strategy because most red algal parasites share an
immediate common ancestor with a free-living red algal species. Therefore, a
single pair of organisms can provide direct comparative data on the genetic
changes occurring early in the evolution of a parasite. This project will
characterize the co-evolutionary relationship from three species pairs of hosts
and their parasites, then establish the effect of a parasitic strategy on their
genomes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide information relevant to
dealing with some of the most damaging eukaryotic pathogens and parasites (e.g.
, the causes of malaria, toxoplasmosis, sudden oak death, and the Irish Potato
Famine). Additionally, red algae are important players in marine and freshwater
habitats throughout the world and are among the dominant members of the benthic
coastal community. This study will involve the training of undergraduates, a
graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow. URI's highly successful NSF-
sponsored Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program will
be used to recruit undergraduate and graduate researchers.
