The focus of this project is to design accurate, fast and robust spectral
methods for solving a large class of partial differential equations, and apply
them to investigate several important problems of current interest. More
precisely, it is proposed to develop (i) adaptive sparse spectral methods for
solving a class of higher-dimensional problems; (ii) spectrally-accurate schemes
in space-time for a class of parabolic type PDEs; (iii) robust and accurate
spectral methods for electromagnetic scattering, particularly for layered medium
and with higher wave numbers; and (iv) to apply the proposed fast and accurate
spectral methods to investigate emerging problems in fluid dynamics and
materials science such as drop formation & filament breakup and ferroelectric &
multiferroic nanostructures in advanced materials processing.

It is expected that the proposed numerical simulations will enable us to handle
challenging problems having stringent accuracy and/or memory requirements with a
reasonable cost in CPU and turn-around time, contribute towards better
understandings of the complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide
valuable information for the design of advanced materials and on the rheological
and hydrodynamic properties of complex fluids. Another important goal of this
project is to engage graduate students in learning necessary skills of
computational and applied mathematics so that they can pursue a successful
career in sciences and engineering.
