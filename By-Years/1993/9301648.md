This goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the fundamental
nature of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) displayed in periodic multilayers and
single layer alloy thin films. The main effort is on optimizing GMR in cobalt-
silver multilayers and co- sputtered alloy films. The multilayer variables
include layer thickness, layer number, buffer layer materials, and annealing
heat treatment. Co-sputtered film variables include the cobalt/silver
concentrations and sputtering pressure. Effects of third elemental additions are
to be determined. Structure, magnetoresistance, and general magnetic properties
are measured using a variety of techniques. Also emphasized is computer
simulation of the GMR behavior using a Monte Carlo approach to microstructural
evolution. %%% This research on magnetoresistance in thin films and multilayers
is pertinent to the development of magnetic field sensors, such as read heads in
magnetic recording technology.
