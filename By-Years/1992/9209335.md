The objective of this research is nonlinear thermal convection in layers heated
from below. The goal of the research is the elucidation of basic mechanisms in
laminar and turbulent convection and their use for the interpretation of
observed features in the atmospheres of the Earth and other planets. In
particular: 1. To analyze the nonlinear properties of time-periodic convection
and its stability characteristics. After earlier research has focussed on
traveling wave convection, the attention will be focussed now on the more
complex case of oscillatory blob convection. 2. The interaction of convection
with a mean shear flow will be extended to the case of a horizontal layer
rotating about a vertical axis. 3. Three-dimensional states of convection
evolving from the instability of transverse rolls in an inclined layer will be
investigated. 4. Steady bimodal convection cells and their instability will be
analyzed in the case of asymmetric boundary conditions. 5. The numerical study
of convection in rotating spherical fluid shells will be extended to higher
Taylor- and Rayleigh numbers.
