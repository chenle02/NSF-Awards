9224926 Cano This SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) project will
attempt to obtain dinosaur DNA from the gut contents of swollen and apparently
engorged Ceratopogonidae (biting midges) entombed in amber from two Cretaceous
sites in Canada: Grassy Lake, Alberta and Cedar Lake, Manitoba These midges have
mouthparts resembling those of extant midges that are adapted for feeding on
large animals. The PI is reasoning that the large animals of the Cretaceous
Period were dinosaurs and expecting to be able to, thus, obtain dinosaur
blood/DNA. DNA sequences from slow evolving nuclear and mitochondrial genes will
be obtained and compared with those of representatives of extant amniotes
supplied by co PI Hedges, in order to draw phylogenetic conclusions. This may be
the only way that genetic information from this major, extinct amniote group
will ever be obtained. If successful, it could be of considerable importance in
establishing the phylogenetic relationship of the dinosaurs to the rest of the
amniotes. %%% Gut contents, which are assumed to be blood from dinosaurs, will
be extracted from biting midges preserved in amber. These midges in amber are
from the Cretaceous Period and were collected at two lake related sites in
Canada. The Principal Investigator will sequence DNA from the extracted gut
contents and compare it with DNA from living reptiles, birds and mammals. This
is an exciting and novel approach to le arning something about the relationships
of the dinosaurs to these other groups. ***
