This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provided by the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program will significantly enhance The College at
Brockport's (State University of New York) infrastructure and research capacity.
Drs. Jacques Rinchard and Joseph Makarewicz of the Department of Environmental
Science and Biology will acquire a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS)
and a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Both instruments
will be used by faculty and students to address fundamental questions and
develop an understanding of trophic food web ecology and fish nutrition as well
as research on persistent organic pollutants in Great Lakes food webs. For
example, the instruments will allow state of the art analysis of fatty acids and
vitamins and help us understand their transfer in freshwater aquatic food
webs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, both instruments will substantially
strengthen the capacities of our curriculum and teach students advanced
analytical techniques as part of several classes at both graduate and
undergraduate levels. This proposal will improve the quality and effectiveness
of our research training activities and this play an important role in
developing New York State's and the nation's pool of scientists and technically
trained people for the future.
