The University of Illinois-Urbana Engineering Research Center for Compound
Semiconductors Microelectronics will focus on the research needed for new
optical and electronic concepts, materials, devices, and systems. This research
is based upon gallium arsenide and other compound semiconductors that will
contribute to the elimination of the interconnection bottlenecks that are
beginning to limit the performace of high speed digital systems. Five different
research areas have been identified as essential for a successful realization of
an optically interconnnected high-speed digital system. The areas, which will
form the core research of the Center for Compound Semiconductor
Microelectronics, are: (1) Systems Design and Analysis, (2) Transmission Media;
(3) Optical and Electronic Devices; (4) Semiconductor Device Theory, and (5)
Electronic Materials. A significant number of new graduate students and
undergraduates will be involved in the ERC program. The four new faculty
positions allocated to the ERC will enable expansion of the graduate curriculum
in important areas, such as guided-wave technology. An important feature of the
ERC plan is the "Educator-in-Residence" program. Educators from 4-year colleges
and other major undergraduate institutions are to be included in the research
efforts of the ERC.
