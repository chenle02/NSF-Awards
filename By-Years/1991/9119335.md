This grant supports one-half of the inside-U.S. expenses for hosting Mr. Li
Songlin of China's State Seismological Bureau under the U.S./PRC Protocol for
Earthquake Studies. The State Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological Survey,
and the National Science Foundation are the members of the Protocol. This
support is important to the successful conduct of U.S. projects mapping
seismogenic structures now underway in the PRC by Dr. Mooney of the USGS and Dr.
McEvilly of U.C. Berkeley. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
