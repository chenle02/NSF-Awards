A Workshop on "Hazardous Mass-Flow Phenomena" will be held at the University of
Missouri at Rolla on February 27-28, 1992. The objectives of the meeting is to
develop a research agenda in this area of fluid mechanics, soil sciences and
hydrology; to prioritize key issues pertaining to experimental methods on mass-
flow and instrumentation now used for detecting and measuring this type of
flows; and to promote communication and cooperation between researchers in this
field. Mud and debris flows are among the most hazardous, and not well
understood, natural phenomena that frequently cause extensive damage around the
world. Improvements in the knowledge base through research will result in better
mitigation procedures for this kind of mass- flows.
