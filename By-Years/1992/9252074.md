New experiments using a molecular beam to explore the kinetic theory of gases
and the concept of temperature will be developed for the physical chemistry lab.
A relatively simple apparatus, capable of producing both effusive and supersonic
beams, will be constructed for the project. The principal experiment will use
time of flight methods to directly verify the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of
molecular speeds in a thermal beam. By examining a series of gases and using
computer aided fitting of their data, students will be able to verify the
dependence of the speed distribution on molecular mass and temperature. As an
extension of this experiment, the operating conditions will be modified so that
the beam becomes supersonic. This leads to a nonthermal speed distribution in
which the beam molecules are not properly characterized by a temperature.
Observation of this distribution will lead students to consider the physical
meaning of temperature. The project provides a demonstration of important
classical ideas in physical chemistry while at the same time exposing students
to modern instrumentation and techniques.
