The research on this grant concerns the global structure theory for arbitrary
infinite semigroups. Applications will be given to formal languages, infinite
group theory, and decision problems. The mathematical development will consist
of the following: general machinery, the kernel of a morphism between
semigroups, expansions, the prime decomposition theorem for arbitrary semigroups
and applications. This research is in the area of semigroups. A semigroup is one
of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures, consisting of a set
with one associative operation on it. The structure of these very general
objects will be investigated. Applications will be given to various areas of
mathematics and computer science.
