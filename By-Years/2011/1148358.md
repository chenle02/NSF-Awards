This award will enable an international collaboration for software development
in computational chemistry between San Diego Supercomputer Center and University
of California San Diego in the US and University of Cambridge and University of
Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. This international collaboration arose from a
joint NSF/EPSRC workshop on Software Development for Grand Challenges in the
Chemical Sciences held in Oxford, United Kingdom in June 2011. This award will
provide travel for students, postdocs and software developers between the
involved sites as well as project planning meetings. The project will develop
adaptive Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) simulation capabilities
and incorporate them into the molecular dynamics software package AMBER.
Outcomes of this award will include software for computational chemistry and
improved international collaboration in support of sustainable software for
science and engineering.
