Abstract Mirkovic

The proposal is directed towards the geometry underlying the Langlands program.
A major and expanding influence are the ideas from quantum field theory. The
``Critical Quantization'' program aims to develop a formalism, that would unify
approaches to modular representation theories and to representations of affine
Lie algebras at a critical level, and should have wide including the study of
derived categories of coherent sheaves. The ``Quadratic Koszul Duality'' project
attempts to give a geometric approach to a family of dualities that appear
throughout representation theory, culminating with the Cherednik Fourier
transform. Finally, we propose certain ``completely algebro-geometric'' approach
to Class Field Theory and Langlands program.



The project aims towards relating and unifying developments in mathematics
(representation theory, algebraic geometry, number theory) and theoretical
particle physics (quantum field theory and in particular string theory). The
main development in mathematics in the last decade was the influence of
predictions derived from Quantum Field Theory. This has resulted in some inroads
and I expect the direction to reverse with mathematics contributing essentially
to the understanding of particle physics and the ``Grand Unification'' project
of giving a consistent description of known physical forces. The main goal of
the project is to take certain steps in this direction by explaining
mathematically certain elements of String Theory and Quantum Field Theory in
general.
