Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0455278&lt;br/&gt;Arumainayagam/Wellesley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this RUI
research project, Professor Arumainayagam in the Department of Chemistry at
Wellesley College is studying the interactions of low energy electrons with
halocarbon overlayers on transition metal surfaces. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, post-irradiation thermal desorption
methods are used to identify the formation of active intermediates, and to
follow the kinetics and mechanisms of the electron initiated reaction chemistry.
This work is providing fundamental information about the mechanisms of radiation
induced damage in solids and liquids. This information may be applied in
developing an understanding of radiation induced processes in environmental and
atmospheric systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Arumainayagam and his
colleagues at Wellesley College are examining the kinetics and mechanisms of
electron induced decomposition chemistry of halocarbon overlayers adsorbed on
transition metal surfaces. These fundamental investigations provide a vehicle
for research training of undergraduate scientists, as well as important
knowledge with application to the understanding of environmental and atmospheric
reaction cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
