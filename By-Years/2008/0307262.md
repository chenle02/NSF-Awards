This award supports a laboratory facility (i.e., the Core Lab) to analyze
lacustrine cores archived at the National Lacustrine Core Repository (i.e.,
LacCore) on the grounds of the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Core Lab is to facilitate
interdisciplinary studies of lake sediments by bringing together researchers in
an efficient workspace that provides standard and specialized equipment,
knowledgeable staff, and opportunities for scientific training. The staff of the
Core Lab will aid researchers in producing standardized chemical and physical
analyses, as well as initial core descriptions (ICD), for each core handled by
the facility. The primary impact of the award would be in providing a publicly
accessible facility for paleoclimatic research and education.
