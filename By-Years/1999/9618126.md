Cessi 9618126 A hierarchy of quasi-geostrophic (QG) models (barotropic, two-
layer baroclinic, baroclinic with feedback between sea surface temperature and
wind stress) will be used to examine the time-dependence and stability of a non-
linear system forced by steady winds. Of particular interest is the degree of
intrinsic long-term variability as a function of forcing to dissipation ratio
and in understanding how sea surface temperature/wind stress feedbacks produce
new modes of low- frequency variability.
