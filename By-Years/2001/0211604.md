This award provides funding to Silver Buffalo Consulting, under the direction of
Ms. Rose Von Thater-Braan, for the support of a workshop entitled, "Dialog on
Diversity in Education: A Transcultural Learning Experience." The Dialog on
Diversity in Education will bring together Indigenous, Native American,
scholars, educators, elders and language speakers and staff from various NSF
Directorates in a shared inquiry on diversity. A goal of this dialog is to
encourage the transformation of theory into practicce in developing culturally
relevant educational environments that support and encourage Indian
participation in science and engineering.
