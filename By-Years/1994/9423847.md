Graph drawing addresses the problem of constructing geometric representations
of graphs and networks. It is an emerging area of research that has received
increasing attention both in the theory and systems community. From the
theoretical viewpoint, graph drawing combines flavors of topological graph
theory and computational geometry, and offers many algorithmic challenges. From
the practical viewpoint, the automatic generation of drawings of graphs has
important applications in key computer technologies such as software
engineering, computer-aided-design, database systems, and visual interfaces. The
research project addresses both theoretical and applied issues in graph drawing.
Specific problems studied include: (1) Trade-offs between various properties of
drawings, such as area, aspect-ratio, and angular resolution; (2) Upward
planarity testing for directed graphs; (3) Dynamic planarity testing and
incremental layout maintenance; (4) Three-dimensional drawing; (5) Declarative
approaches to graph drawing and related constraint-satisfaction issues; (6) A
graph visualization system and its applications.
