This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate researchers working
with faculty advisors. Research projects will be chosen from five areas. Five
faculty will contribute to the project. They will focus on topics such as
hyperbolic geometry of surfaces and geometric group theory with special interest
in circle packings of surfaces and how the combinatorial structure of surfaces
restricts their geometry. Also considered will be studies of fundamental groups
and covering spaces with an eye to constructing all covering spaces of spaces
with given monodromy groups. Work will also be done on polynomial factorization
such as the computation of Galois groups as permutation groups. This research
involves computer algebras systems such as Mathematica. Other students will
focus on large- scale numerical modeling of geophysical flow, the application of
optimization methods to the retrieval of the earth's structure and of
groundwater aquifer. Florida State University traditionally conducts several
undergraduate research activities each year. Additionally, there is an Alliance
for Minority Participation program on campus to add to the opportunities for
students to meet and take advantage of seminars, visiting speakers etc. Two
major campus institutes, one in geophysical fluid dynamics and one in
supercomuting also add to the intellectual life and experience of the students.
