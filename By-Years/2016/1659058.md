The University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) will undertake a Noyce Track 1 project
to recruit, prepare, and support a minimum of 25 undergraduate majors in the
disciplines of biology, chemistry, geography/geology, and physics to become
well-prepared secondary school science teachers. Project activities will develop
culturally responsive science teachers with deep STEM content expertise through
the use of specific pedagogies. It will actively involve the Noyce Scholars in
the process of science so that they can engage youth from diverse backgrounds in
the scientific enterprise. Noyce Scholars will participate in professional
development activities from inception through their early years of teaching in
high-need school districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build upon
ongoing collaborative efforts between UNO and the Omaha Public Schools (OPS)
that expand and strengthen the pathways that prepare science majors to meet the
demand for science teachers in high-need school districts. Project activities
will guide students through Bachelor of Science degrees, including secondary
teacher certification. The project will provide structured internships for
first- and second-year STEM undergraduates to gain experience working with
students from high-need schools in OPS; provide financial, academic, and
professional leadership development support for third- and fourth-year STEM
undergraduates to prepare them for teaching in high-need school districts; and
provide ongoing professional development support for Noyce Scholars alumni in
secondary school classrooms. This Noyce project will use a systematic evaluation
plan that continuously measures the overall impact of its initiatives and
provides formative feedback on the effectiveness of key strategies so that
refinements can be made over the five-year grant period.
