This project develops new mathematical algorithms and models involving knowledge
graphs. A knowledge graph represents what is known about a subject in the form
of labeled nodes and edges. More than simply labeled data, knowledge graphs
organize data according to high-level meanings and assign globally unique
identification to each node in the graph to match real-world entities. Much work
on knowledge graphs treats databases and queries. In contrast, in the context of
threat detection, this project focuses on algorithms that identify latent
information in the graph and predictive models associated with data on the
graph. The project will involve a combination of mathematical methods for
subgraph isomorphism detection, time series analysis, agent-based and multiscale
modeling, and pattern recognition. The project will train a postdoctoral
scholar, PhD student, and six undergraduate researchers through involvement in
the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together several
different focused problems with large, multimodal, complex datasets. The data is
organized into a knowledge graph in which additional information is added and
absorbed as it becomes available. This project considers three types of
knowledge graphs each for different applications: (1) knowledge graphs
constructed from complex multi-part narratives; (2) knowledge graphs constructed
from heterogeneous online content; and (3) knowledge graphs associated with
large-scale human interaction dynamics such as a global pandemic. For (1),
algorithms will be designed to identify important causal subgraphs. For (2), the
project aims to identify threats in space and time based on templated patterns.
For (3), desired goals are both a predictive ability for actions from a micro to
macro scale along with tools to assess potential impact versus cost of
preventative measures, from local to regional to country-wide
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
