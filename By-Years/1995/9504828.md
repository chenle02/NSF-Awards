Increases in current density result in greater accumulation of electrostatic
charge on aerosols and supercooled water droplets at the tops of clouds.
Theoretical models and laboratory measurements indicate this will increase the
rate of initial ice nucleation, leading to observed changes in winter cyclone
intensity and in general circulation. The PIs will first clarify and quantify
changes in the global electric circuit in response to changes in the solar wind.
This will provide a basis for more quantitative models of electrostatic charge
effects on cloud microphysics. Second, they will test their prediction of the
return of the Wilcox effect for the winters of 1992-94, when stratospheric
aerosol loading was increased by Pinatubo, and there was modulation of
relativistic electron precipitation at sector boundaries. Finally, the PIs will
test the southern hemisphere meteorological data sets for responses to Forbush
decreases and sector boundary crossings.***
