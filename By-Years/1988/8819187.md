Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of lactate by facilitating the
direct, simultaneous transfer of a proton and two electrons to the coenzyme,
NAD+. Because many other dehydrogenases operate in a similar manner, the
proposed research serves as a model for future explanations of how
dehydrogenases accomplish large accelerations of chemical reactions. Using both
chemical kinetics and Raman spectroscopy to determine changes in the chemical
bonds of both the substrate and coenzyme upon binding to the enzyme, these
changes to the structure, which is known, of the enzyme with substrate and
coenzyme bound will be related. These studies will partially involve the
synthesis of isotopically labeled substrates and coenzymes so that Raman bands
can be assigned to the molecular motions of these molecules both in solution and
bound to enzyme. These studies also will be extended to formate dehydrogenase to
produce a more general picture of the interactions that occur. Recent work shows
that to a large extent enzymes use noncovalent interactions to facilitate the
making and breaking of covalent bonds and to make or break them sterically.
Because the energies of noncovalent interactions are not easily assessed during
an enzyme reaction a description of the contributions to enzyme catalysis
provided by various types of noncovalent interactions is a difficult yet
important goal, and the possibility of rationalizing enzymic reactions in terms
of the observed rate effects produced by simple catalysts has been the goal of
enzyme chemists for many years. Because of this work this may be possible for
NAD dependent dehydrogenasis.
