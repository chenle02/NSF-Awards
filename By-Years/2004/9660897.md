*** 96-60897 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop a unique analytical instrument in which two types of surface analysis -
sputter-initiated laser resonance ionization spectroscopy (SIRIS) and time-of-
flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) - can be carried out
simultaneously, without sacrificing the performance of either. The SIRIS
selective laser post-ionization provides high efficiency and excellent sample
utilization with much less matrix effects and mass interferences than SIMS or
most other mass analysis methods. This leads to high sensitivity in small
volumes (e.g. particulates), high dynamic range, and good quantitation for a
wide range of elements. The principal drawback is that SIRIS analyzes for only
one element at a time. In comparison, the nonselective surface ionization of
conventional TOF-SIMS has proven to be extremely useful for multielement
characterization. By integrating TOF-SIMS with SIRIS, the combined instrument
will enable the best of both technologies; high sensitivity and sample
utilization with negligible matrix effects analysis and insignificant
interferences for single-element trace analysis, and multielement material
characterization from TOF-SIMS. With this combination of capabilities in a
single instrument costing close to a stand alone TOF-SIMS or SIRIS, a SIRIS/TOF-
SIMS instrument will become a significant contribution to the next generation of
TOF mass spectrometry instrumentation. ***
