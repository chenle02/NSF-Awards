Data security and cryptography are growing concerns for the rapidly expanding
information infrastructure. This project treats this emerging engineering
discipline with a systematic exploration of the use of reconfigurable hardware.
The research in this project will: develop arithmetic architectures for public-
key algorithms on reconfigurable hardware; classify private-key algorithms
according to the kernel functions needed in their implementation; establish a
public-domain VHDL library of algorithms for both public and private key
cryptosystems; and develop a board-level reconfigurable device for
implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Educational activities will include
development of material for teaching cryptography to beginning graduate
students, inclusion of VHDL design projects in the undergraduate curriculum, and
an exchange program for graduate students with a cryptography research group in
Germany.
