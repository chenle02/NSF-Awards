The goals of the MagIC (Magnetics Information Consortium) project have been to
develop an open community digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data
with web portals that allow users free access to archive, search and download
data in a broad range of formats. Part of the project has involved the
transition of existing databases developed under the auspices of the
International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) to the new
archive. This award provides funds for the continued development and maintenance
of the MagIC facility and for continued integration of the PI?s efforts to
operate with other online databases. The PIs believe that access to all magnetic
data in a single online data-base and the capacity to link up with data from
other disciplines, will radically change the way rock and paleomagnetic data
contribute to Earth sciences today. In this funding period the PIs will
implement enhanced interoperability with GPlates and IODP and also with
initiatives like EarthChem and Geochron, to provide seamless access to
complementary geochemistry information and radiometric ages on the sample data
stored in MagIC. All this will be accomplished through the use of unique IGSN
sample numbers.
