The chromosomes of most higher organisms show two cytologically distinct domains
known as euchromatin and heterochromatin. These domains differ in biases in DNA
sequence composition and chromosomal protein distributions along the length of
the chromosome. They also differ in gene expression, as first revealed by
studies of chromosome rearrangements in Drosophila. Rearrangements that create
novel junctions between euchromatin and heterochromatin result in the mosaic
inactivation of genes near the breakpoint, a phenomenon known as Position Effect
Variegation (PEV). The most popular models of PEV propose that it results from
the invasion of one chromatin state into the other across the rearrangement
breakpoint. These models view heterochromatin as a highly condensed chromatin
state that represses gene expression. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
aimed at critically evaluating existing models of heterochromatin to account for
its activating influence on transcription of heterochromatic sequences. The
studies will focus on a block of heterochromatin located on the left arm of
Chromosome 2 (2Lh) of Drosophila melanogaster. The transcription of specific 2Lh
sequences will be examined in individual flies with structurally normal
chromosomes and in mutant strains carrying chromosome rearrangements that induce
PEV on heterochromatic genes. Studies of transcription will involve comparing
promoters of the 2Lh genes to determine if they differ in structure from
euchromatic gene promoters. The effects on 2Lh transcription of reducing the
nuclear concentrations of three proteins, HP1, ORC, and HOAP, which modify and
bind heterochromatin, will be assayed genetically and molecularly. The chromatin
immunoprecipitation technique will be used to determine if these proteins
associate directly, as a complex or individually, with 2Lh sequences in vivo.
These studies should identify cis- and trans-regulators of heterochromatin. The
findings should help reveal the molecular determinants of heterochromatin and
the role of its binding proteins in activating transcription.
