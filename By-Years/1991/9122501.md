Geosynthetic materials, such as geomembranes, geotextiles and geonets have been
extensively used for hazardous waste containment for the last ten years. One
problem facing the advancement of modern geosynthetic technology is the lack of
consistent testing methods. The objectives of this research are to develop a
technical method to evaluate long-term chemical compatibility and durability;
study chemical structure-mass transport relationships; evaluate compatibility,
durability and permeation potential; investigate effects of mechanical stress
and pressure on the mass transport of hazardous wastes through geomembranes; and
develop a mathematical model to predict the mass flux of organic chemicals
through geomembranes.
