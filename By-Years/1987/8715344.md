This award supports the Third International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles
in the Atmosphere to be held at Berkeley, California, October 5-8, 1987. The
Conference will be a forum for the presentation and discussion of research on
several aspects of the chemistry of airborne black carbon (soot). Topics to be
covered are measurement methodologies; the sources, transport, and sinks of
particulate carbon in the atmosphere; catalytic and nucleating influences of
black carbon; effects of carbon on radiative transfer, climate, and visibility;
effects on materials; and biological and human health effects.
