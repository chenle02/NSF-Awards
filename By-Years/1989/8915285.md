The research will focus on theoretical studies of the electronic properties of
organic conductors and related systems. The research will concentrate on three
areas: (1) the dynamics of spin density waves (SDWs) and field-induced SDWs
leading to an understanding of such transport phenomena in organics as
magnetotransport and sound propagation; (2) the effect on SDWs and field-induced
SDWs as pressure and magnetic fileds are applied leading to an understanding of
reentrance into the normal state in (TMTSF)2ClO4 and of the interplay between
SDWs and superconductivity; and, (3) theoretical understanding of the existence
of superconductivity in organics.
