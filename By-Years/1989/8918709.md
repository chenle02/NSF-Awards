The large-scale view of the French Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre
(SPOT) satellite images offers a means to study and understand ice dynamics and
to quantify changes in ice sheets over time. Analysis on two SPOT images
covering parts of Ice Stream B in West Antarctica shows that mapping of large-
scale glacial features is feasible. It is proposed to acquire three additional
images to obtain a more complete coverage of this area. Maps will be prepared
from the SPOT HRV imagery showing the major surface features. The maps will be
registered with existing surface elevation maps, flow velocity data, and
selected features identifiable on low-level aerial photographs. The pattern of
these glacial features will be studied in detail during the course of this
project to seek an understanding of their origin. Knowledge gained from this
study will help in understanding any critical changes occurring in the Ross Ice
Streams.
