This Research Initiation grant will allow the investigator to study tumor cell
micromotion during chemotactic stimulation through both experimental
observations and mathematical modeling. The specific aims are to: 1) develop a
system to manipulate tumor cells during pseudopod migration, 2) determine the
factors affecting pseudopod protrusion; 3) develop mathematical models for
pseudopod formation and cell movement; and 4) correlate pseudopod
characteristics with cytoskeletal structure. This research is important since it
will contribute towards and understanding of the mechanics of metastases of
tumor cells and provide basic information needed to understand physiological
processes such as tissue development.
