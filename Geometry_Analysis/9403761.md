9403761 Ji The research entails the geometry and analysis of holomorphic
mappings on classes of complex manifolds. The latter involves such questions as
value distribution and the Jacobian conjecture for polynomial maps between
complex Euclidean spaces. The research has potential applications to other areas
of mathematics including algebraic geometry and complex analysis. ***
