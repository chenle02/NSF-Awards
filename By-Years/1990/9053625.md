The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) is a progressive science and
technology center. Its philosophy toward science education is to make it
enticing, enjoyable and motivating. It accomplishes this by means of "hands-on",
interactive exhibits and programs designed to provide a non- threatening
learning environment, for which we are recognized nationally. OMSI recognizes
the important national need to assist the public in understanding and being
comfortable with advances in, and methodology of applied science. It proposes to
design and build a large exhibit that promotes problem solving using engineering
principles. The exhibit will pose problems, offer basic information for the
solution and provide a variety of tools and building materials from which the
visitor can choose. The visitor then devises one or several possible solutions,
and constructs a prototype to be tested in one of three large scale testing
laboratories. The engineering fields addressed are aeronautical, mechanical and
civil. Our visitors will come away from the exhibit with an increased
appreciation for the way engineering is done and how solutions affect their
lives. OMSI is requesting $577,324 from the National Science Foundation as well
as $427,539 from the Port of Portland to design and build this exhibit. The Port
of Portland is interested in demonstrating how its commercial activities relate
to engineering. OMSI plans to disseminate information about the exhibit to
educators and other museums on a national level.
