Abstract for Lie Groups, Representations and Discrete Mathematics Conference
February 6-10, 2006

The conference is part of a year-long program at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, New Jersey on Lie Groups, Representations and Discrete
Mathematics. The last two decades show some deep and surprising connections
between questions and results in number theory in general, automorphic forms in
particular and seemingly unrelated problems in discrete mathematics and computer
science. These developments led to the constructions of Ramanujan graphs and
complexes and to the solution of several long-standing problems. Many of these
questions are related to the notion of expanders. This is a basic concept in
combinatorics and computer science which found its way to the representation
theory and the theory of discrete subgroups of Lie groups. Recently, it also
found its use in 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry.

The goal of the conference is to bring together experts from these quite
different areas of mathematics and computer science to present their work and to
strengthen the potential cooperation between these scientists who usually do not
meet or attend the same conferences.
