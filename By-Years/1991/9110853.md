This project examines two isolated (pre-contact) social systems, testing
derivations from an extension of world systems theory. The extension predicts
that societies having less internal stratification (that is, more egalitarian
societies) will develop social institutions making them less susceptible to
external conquest or domination. Research focuses on two cases, Califor- nia and
Hawaii, both in the time before European contact. Hawaii at that time showed
considerable stratification, and California, almost none. This project uses
ethnographic records of the societies, including records from interviews stored
at Berkeley and at the Smithsonian, and archaeological studies of the two
regions. Hypothesis testing requires deriving measures of concepts such as
inter- and intra-societal hierarchies from anthropological and archaeological
records. Results of this research will improve theoretical understanding of
conditions leading to hegemonic relations and the causes of institutions which
preserve national independence.
