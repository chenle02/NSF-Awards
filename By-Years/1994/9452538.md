9452538 Grismore The Digital Systems laboratory in Electrical Engineering has
been enhanced through the acquisition of digital oscilloscopes and pulse
generators to permit the incorporation of dynamic and timing based experimental
investigations into the curriculum. Industry standard instruments provide
students the experience of interfacing with state of the art equipment, and add
the capability to observe and measure timing and dynamic effects. The importance
of these effects in digital systems design is emphasized. The experimental
activities are integrated into the theoretical and lecture content of a new
required four-quarter curricular sequence in Digital Circuits and Systems.
