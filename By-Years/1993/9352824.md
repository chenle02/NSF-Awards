9352824 DeTurck A full-scale revision of the entire Calculus program is being
undertaken making extensive use of student projects drawn from scientific and
business disciplines. The three main thrusts of the revision are (1) substantial
reconstruction of the first and second year Calculus syllabi; (2) emphasis upon
collaborative learning techniques; and (3) use of computation as a vehicle to
encourage collaborative learning. The emphasis is on designing and implementing
means of presenting new approaches to Calculus effectively on a large scale. To
carry this out in the context of a large research university with 2000 students
per semester taking Calculus, materials are being adapted from existing Calculus
reform efforts. In addition, materials and support are being developed for
faculty and students getting used to using computers to do mathematics and to
incorporating problems from other disciplines.Some sections of the new courses
are team-taught with Math Education faculty, assisted by secondary Math Ed
students as a portion of their preparation for teaching. ***
