This is a study to determine how the diaphyseal structure and joint size of
long bones are related to mechanical loadings of limbs in the higher primates,
and to use this information to help reconstruct early hominoid and hominid
morphology and behavior. The study has two components: (1) to measure cross-
sectional dimensions of long bones of the forelimb and hindlimb in a comparative
sample of extant humans and other primates; and, (2) to measure the same
properties in fossil specimens and use these data to estimate body mass and
reconstruct behavior of East African Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene fossils.
Cross- sectional geometric properties will be determined through computed
tomography, and digitizing of section contours and articular surface areas
through linear measurements and geometric conversion formulae. The results of
the study will provide new insights into the relationship between structure and
function of the anthropoid skeleton, and new details and clarification of body
size and behavior in early hominoids and hominids.
