Graphene has been shown to exhibit superior properties attractive for potential
applications as 'building blocks' in various energy-related devices and many
other nano- or micro-electronics. For most of the applications, controlled
functionalization of graphene sheets is essential for the region-specific
connections of individual graphene sheets into hierarchically-organized multi-
dimensional functional systems. This award supports travel for research
collaboration between senior participants and students at Case Western Reserve
University (CWRU, Cleveland) and Tsinghua University / Beijing Institute of
Technology (Beijing, China) on the asymmetric functionalization of the opposite
surfaces of graphene sheets with different chemical reagents for self-
assembling. The objective is to design and prepare asymmetrically-modified
graphene sheets and their self-assembled multifunctional materials with
precisely-controlled two-dimensional and three-dimensional architectures useful
for energy-related applications.

An additional benefit from the research collaboration is to create an education
and research training environment where students (graduate and undergraduate)
from participating institutions work together on the transfer of materials
science to functional devices for energy-related applications.
