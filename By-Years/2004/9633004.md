*** 9633004 Shaula Yemini Network event correlation's goal is to identify a
networked system's problems before they disrupt applications. Current approaches
to automating event correlation are slow, sensitive to noise in their data, and
cannot dynamically adapt to a networked system's topology changes. The Codebook
approach uses coding theory as the base of a novel correlation process that is
high speed, robust to noise, and dynarnically adapts to system changes. The key
idea is that since problems are characterized by the symptoms they cause, it
suffices to monitor the minimal set of symptoms that uniquely identify
("encode") the problems of interest. Real-time correlation processing is thus
reduced to a fast process of minimal distance "decoding" of symptoms. Symptoms
can be added to make codes "error-correcting", for robustness with respect to
noise in the event stream. Potential market areas for this project are:
1.automated problem management products for enterprise networks, reducing
exposure of mission critical applications to network down time. 2. Automated
network management solutions for network service providers, increasing quality
of service while reducing operations costs. 3. Selfhealing network, system and
application ***
