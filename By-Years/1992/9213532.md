The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the potential for
establishing primate research sites in the vicinity of Georgetown, Guyana.
Guyana is a promising country for long-term primate research as the forests are
still relatively unaffected by human activity and the government is amenable to
their protection. Additionally eight species of New World monkey are found in
the country. The researchers will conduct a survey of two regions in order to
determine the number of species present, their densities and distribution. If
either of the regions is appropriate for long term research, the investigators
will undertake to carry out an extensive study of the synecology of the the
primates.
