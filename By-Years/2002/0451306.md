The purpose of this grant is to provide support for students from the United
States to travel to Berlin, Germany to attend the 12th IEEE International
Conference on Networking Protocols (ICNP '04). ICNP is a premier networking
conference. The goal of the travel support is to largely defray the costs of
student travel so that more students may attend the conference. These students
will attend talks from top researchers in networking, participate in panel
discussions, and meet members of the networking research community. This grant
will enable students to attend the conference that would not otherwise be able
due to financial constraints.&lt;br/&gt;
