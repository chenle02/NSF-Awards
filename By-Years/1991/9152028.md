This project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to develop their
skills and expertise in experimental Behavioral Biology through a series of
laboratory experiments with weakly electric fish. The major items of equipment
requested include six identical sets of equipment composed of a digital storage
oscilloscope, a microelectrode amplifier, a frequency counter, and a function
generator. This equipment is used by the students to carry out Animal Behavior
Laboratory experiments in communication, electrolocation, receptor physiology,
and physiological behavior. The students' active participation in the design and
conduct of such experiments, rather than observing a demonstration, enhances
their understanding of the concepts involved and research methodology, and
provides an opportunity to become familiar with the type of equipment used in
modern Behavioral Biology research.
