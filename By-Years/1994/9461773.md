This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on applying
coding theory techniques to automate alarm correlation in complex networks.
Alarms indicate exceptional network states or behaviors, e.g., failure or
congestion, which require immediate handling to avoid disrupting network
operations. In a networked system, a single problem can result in large numbers
of alarms manifested by multiple system components. Alarm correlation correlates
these various symptoms to accurately identify the problems requiring handling,
and is thus a central component in network operations and management (OAM). As
enterprises' reliance on networked systems grows, OAM consumes an increasingly
higher percentage of information technology budgets, currently estimated at
65-90%, mainly due to high labor costs. Automation of alarm correlation can
substantially reduce OAM costs while improving their quality. System Management
Arts, Inc., anticipates that techniques based on coding theory can yield up to 2
orders of magnitude improvement in alarm correlation performance over today's
techniques, while increasing both their accuracy and robustness.
