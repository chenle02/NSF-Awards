Title: REU Site: REUMass: A Summer Computing Research Experience in Data
Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides undergraduate students with a
10-week intensive summer research experience focused on data science, an
emerging area with high societal impact and significant student interest. Data
science studies theory and methods that enable efficient extraction of knowledge
from large amounts of data. The intellectual merits of this project include the
investigation and development of new methods for data analysis, methods for
improving the infrastructure for analysis, and the application of those analysis
methods and infrastructure to useful problems. The project's broader
significance and importance include increasing the attractiveness of graduate
study in computer science for students from community colleges and
underrepresented groups, and increasing the technical knowledge of data science
among such students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student project is oriented
around a single type of analysis method, infrastructure, or application, but
projects embed that work within an integrated "deep stack" view of data science
that connects applications with analytics and infrastructure. Students
participate in a number of technical activities (workshops, symposia, field
trips, etc.) and social events that have proven successful in creating a close
and sustained relationship among the participants in past year's cohorts. This
focus helps emphasize how fundamental computer science enables a broad set of
information technology applications as well as showing the breadth of
opportunities in computer science, and these areas have proven to be attractive
to the proposal's target cohorts.
