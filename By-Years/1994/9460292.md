This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to use the
solubilized membrane as the electrolyte in internally humidified proton exchange
membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and to develop a rapid method for its application on
electrodes. The solubilized membrane forms tenacious deposits on electrodes and
have the desirable properties of an electrolyte for the said purpose. The
research objective is to develop an appropriate and rapid method for application
of electrolyte on electrodes. The method of brushing produces nonuniform
deposits. The method of spraying can be developed as a viable method that can be
made rapid and automated. Two solubilized membranes of different equivalent
weights will be used in the experiment. The quality and characteristics of the
electrolyte deposits will be evaluated in 25 and 50 cm2 active electrode area
fuel cells and also in a three-cell stack. Cells will be tested without external
humidification at 30-70√ùC and 0-20 psig pressure. Fuel cells will be assembled
with a proprietary plastic film gasket that will be placed symmetrically around
the electrode edges. Estimation will be made on the amount of active Pt surface
area and the extent of cross-leaks, if any, across a fuel cell. Anticipated
benefits include the availability of a high performance polymer electrolyte for
the PEMFC and the use of much less electrolyte material for the fuel cell.
