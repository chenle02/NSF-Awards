The Principal Investigators (PIs) will observe the upcoming solar eclipses of
2012 (to be seen in northern Australia) and 2013 (to be seen in west Africa) by
exploiting multi-wavelength spectral and polarimetric imaging. The goal of these
solar eclipse observations is to capitalize on the diagnostic properties of many
coronal forbidden emission lines in order to infer electron temperatures, ion
densities, abundances, and charge states, as well as the properties of the
coronal magnetic field, while applying state-of-the-art image processing
techniques. The proposed observations will extend the PI's eclipse data base to
span almost a full solar activity cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs explain
that the spectral emission lines they plan to measure will enable an unambiguous
study of the evolutionary track of coronal density structures, of the transition
from a collision-dominated plasma to a weakly-collisional plasma where the ion
charge states observed in interplanetary space are established, and of the
transition from closed to open magnetic field lines in the corona. These data
are essential for simulation and modeling of the expansion of the coronal
plasma, the physical processes that control the heating and acceleration of the
solar wind, and the evolution of the solar magnetic field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are female scientists who will mentor graduate and
undergraduate students, with graduate students participating in the eclipse
expeditions and with undergraduates being introduced to research through summer
projects. The PIs will develop educational material to be used at both the
undergraduate and graduate level, as well as for public outreach. Results will
be disseminated to the research community through presentations at conferences
and through refereed scientific publications, where it it will be used to help
plan instrument development for the next generation of solar corona observing
tools.
