9423936 Cunningham A new REU Site will be initiated in Physics at Bucknell
University. This grant will support eight undergraduate students, including
equipment and supplies, for ten weeks each summer for three consecutive summers.
Students will be able to select from a variety of projects which reflect the
varied research interests of the faculty in our department. These projects, both
in theory and experimental work, encompass a broad range of fields including
biophysics, gravitational theory and black holes, cometary astrophysics,
positron physics, non-linear optics, laser spectroscopy, and nonlinear dynamics.
A responsible recruiting campaign is planned to seek students in the Eastern
seaboard and Appalachian regions of the country and with specific effort at
targeting institutions which historically draw students who are underrepresented
in the physical sciences. ***
