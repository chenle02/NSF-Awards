&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop design and analysis tools
for these highly nonlinear and complex fuel cell power systems. We will use
control theory not only for feedback synthesis, but also to reveal fundamental
limits of achievable performance, and to make architectural decisions at an
early stage of system design. The tight integration of system components, and
the strong interplay between electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and reactor
kinetics, give rise to dynamic phenomena that cannot be understood with the
physics of individual subsystems in isolation. The development of reduced-order
models that capture these dynamic phenomena, and the design of feedback
controllers that work in harmony with the inherent physical features of the fuel
cell, are timely research directions that would dramatically improve dynamic
performance. The PI's strong background in nonlinear control theory and ongoing
collaboration with United Technologies Research Center will lead to significant
improvements in transient performance for highly dynamic loads, and to
reductions in the number of costly system components through rigorous analyses
of design trade-offs, and advanced feedback and state estimation
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;
