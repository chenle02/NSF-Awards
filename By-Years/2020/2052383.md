The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project creates a platform specifically designed for
more democratic online group-to-group collaboration in a distributed system.
This could provide insights into new ways software can support collaboration,
democratic infrastructure, and improve current understanding of how to optimize
democratic and decentralized IT governance systems more broadly. Once
successful, the technology will accelerate the rate of innovation and
coordination across multi-disciplinary teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is an effort to study how to create software with group-node database
architecture relationships. The goal is to create layers of group network
formation while balancing scalability with resiliency. The main innovation is a
software-based system for decentralized organizations, which will eventually be
using a decentralized underlying infrastructure such as distributed web
technology or blockchain. This paradigm incorporates (a) social protocols for
effective teaming and coalition formation; (b) automation supporting
democratic/cooperative organizations working in a distributed network; (c)
accelerated information discovery across disciplines and sectors, (d) data
science optimization for model thinking for global optimization solutions in
complex systems. The platform would also explore fractal and emergent group
dynamics, as an opportunity for thousands (if not millions) of tiny experiments
regarding the specific nature of group formation, commons coordination, and
effective communication for distributed organizations at
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
