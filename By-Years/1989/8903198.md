This one year, full-time postdoctoral fellowship enables a recent PhD in
Technology and Society, with a masters in engineering- economic systems, to
develop his capabilities in the social study of science. His research project
will investigate the effects of Federal funding policy on research in computer
science, employing a systematic, qualitative research study of relationships
between funding agencies, researchers, and university departments. To gain
formal training in grounded theory methodologies in sociological research, this
investigator will work with two researchers, Elihu Gerson and Anselm Strauss,
who are well known for their development and application of these techniques.
The study will examine how variations in funding environments affect the social
organization, content, and quality of scientific resarch. It will employ a
descriptive, fieldwork approach, consisting of interviews of academic computer
scientists, department chairs and funding officials, selected by a careful, non-
randomized process which maximizes expected variations across the variables of
subspecialty, university, and funding mix. Data analysis will use a social
worlds theoretical framework, which attempts to express the funding-research
relationship in terms of "negotiated arrangements" among participants of the
intersecting scientific "social worlds" of funders, researchers and departments.
This project addresses a central issue in science, technology and society
studies: the impact of context on directions in science. The proposed training
will augment this researcher's ability to undertake research in this area; the
investigator, host specialists, and host institution are very well-qualified to
undertake and support the effort; collaborative work is likely to continue after
the award period. Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and
useful. An award in the amount of $28,000 is therefore recommended.
