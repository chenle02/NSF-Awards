John Tully of the Chemistry Department of Yale University is funded by the
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and by the Materials Theory program of the
Division of Material Sciences to study chemical dynamics at solid surfaces. This
project centers on the creation of advanced theoretical modeling tools and the
application of these tools to study the dynamics of chemical processes at solid
surfaces. Mixed quantum-classical methods will be used to study several systems
of practical interest, such as adsorbates on silicon, hydrogen on metals and
others. The theoretical tools developed in this research are likely to be of
importance in the interpretation of experiments and mechanisms of surface
catalysis, which is of great technological relevance.
