The Ocean Engineering Department at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
undertake an instrumentation and technology development project to design and
construct an unmanned, untethered vehicle for performing and servicing long-term
deep ocean benthic experiments. This vehicle has been named ABE for the
Autonomous Benthic Explorer. Design criteria call for it to be launched from any
oceanographic research ship and be able to remain on site for several months.
During this time span it must periodically move about in its acoustic navigation
net, taking pictures and making a variety of scientific measurements. At the end
of its mission, it is to be recovered on command. ABE will complement and extend
the capabilities of manned submersibles, particularly DSV ALVIN, as well as
remotely operated, tethered systems such as ARGO/JASON. These systems will still
be required for initial surveys and installations. However, ABE shall have the
ability to remain at a deep sea research site for long periods or to return to a
previously surveyed site to observe changes. The instrumentation development
project is in anticipation of planned research initiatives requiring long-term
observations of seafloor features such as hydrothermal vents and mid-ocean
ridges.
