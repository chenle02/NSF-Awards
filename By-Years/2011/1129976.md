One formidable obstacle standing in the way of progress in multiscale simulation
over the past decades is the lack of a concurrent atomistic-continuum
methodology that allows waves, heat, and defects to pass through the atomistic-
continuum interface. To meet this critical challenge, the classical statistical
mechanical theory of transport processes is reformulated so as to unify
atomistic and continuum descriptions of balance laws and to recast the
mathematical representation of the governing laws to facilitate coarse-scale
finite element simulation of discontinuous material behavior. It is anticipated
that this research will lead to a new formulation of continuum mechanics that is
equivalent to a fully atomistic model at the atomic scale and to classical
continuum mechanics at the macroscopic scale, thus naturally leading to a
concurrently-coupled atomistic-continuum methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
new methodology promises to expand current atomistic simulation-based predictive
capability from sub-micron- to sub-millimeter-sized materials, thereby enabling
multiscale analysis of complex materials. It will not only impact the areas of
continuum mechanics and multiscale simulation, but also new materials
development. The research results will be integrated into existing mechanics
courses, and will be used in the classrooms to facilitate understanding of
multiscale materials behavior. Computer codes developed will be posted for
public use and feedback. The PI will also use a Curie Lecture Series that brings
in well-established female scholars to campus as role models for graduate
students.
