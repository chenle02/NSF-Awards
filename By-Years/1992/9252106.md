The objective of this multi-disciplinary project is to improve the quality of
science instruction at Muscatine Community College through the introduction of
computers into the laboratory environment. The physics, chemistry, astronomy,
and meteorology programs are sharing a computer network for use by transfer as
well as technical students enrolled in physics, astronomy, meteorology, and/or
chemistry courses. The laboratory, equipped with Macintosh LC II computers, is
used in conjunction with existing laboratory instrumentation to enhance data
collection and analysis. It also promotes the transfer of knowledge and
procedures from one discipline to another.
