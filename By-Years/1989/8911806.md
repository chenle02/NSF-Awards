This project begins exploratory research in the philosophical foundations of
conservation biology. It involves careful review of the appropriate
philosophical literature and of biological work on the relationship between
stability and diversity for ecological preservation. Two related papers will
result; one will discuss the special role of values in conservation biology,
given its status as a science with a prescriptive goal, and one will examine and
evaluate various definitions of "ecosystem health." The thesis that will be
explored is that conservation biology will need to integrate insights from both
its experimentalist and naturalist traditions, and from philosophical
explorations of the role of values in science, in order to succeed in its goal
of preserving and protecting nature. With the assistance of three advisors
representing different biological perspectives, the investigator will examine
the implications of applying a recent theoretical approach -- systems or
heirarchy theory -- to conservation biology. Philosophical analysis of this
approach may provide a frame of reference within which to satisfy both normative
and objectivist concerns in science; it may allow insights from naturalists to
be integrated with scientific data gathered by experimentalists. This project is
undertaken by a well-qualified and productive researcher with appropriate
contacts and support in the research communities he proposes to study.
Institutional support is adequate. Results are likely to advance our
understanding of the role of values in science in general, and in conservation
biology in particular. Questions about the relationship between science and
values, and between science, preservation of environment and environmental
values are of considerable interest to Ethics and Values Studies in Science,
Technology and Society. Given the project's merit, it has high priority for
support.
