9315661 Ricles The Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) will conduct
its 50th anniversary technical program in 1994. The emphasis of the program will
be on the state-of-the-art and future developments of the major stability
topics. A vision of stability design practice ten to twenty years in the future
is required to establish research goals and to consider how research results and
new technology can be implemented in design practice. With this in mind, the
theme of the entire conference is "SSRC-LINK BETWEEN RESEARCH PRACTICE."
