This project partially supports the work of a task force of the American
Mathematical Society to study the current employment opportunities for new
doctorates in the U.S. Long term demographic studies by the National Science
Foundation indicate potential shortfalls by the end of this decade in our
nation's science personnel base. One the other hand, in 1990 declines in the
number of jobs available and increases in the number of applicants were noted in
the mathematical sciences community. Follow-up surveys indicated disturbing
signs pointing to a shortage of employment opportunities in the short term. This
project supports a task force of the American Mathematical society to assess the
current situation, make recommendations on ways to mitigate what may be a short-
term supply and demand imbalance in the academic employment market, develop
long-term strategies to reduce some of the current inefficiencies in the
employment-seeking process, and report their finding to the mathematical
sciences community. The project is timely and important for the vitality of the
U.S. mathematical sciences personnel base. The results will be made available to
the scientific community, the professional societies, and interested government
agencies. In the latter case, the results may help in developing appropriate
strategies for the support of postdoctoral researchers.
