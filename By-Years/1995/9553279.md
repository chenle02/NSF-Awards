The Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program, Inc. (CPEP) Summer Program at Trinity
College will begin the summer of 1996 until the summer of 1998. Each summer a
five week commuter program will offer an integrated curriculum in science,
mathematics, computer and engineering applications, guidance/career counseling
and language arts/study skills. All subject areas will be offered in an
interdisciplinary manner enabling students to develop an appreciation for the
breadth of the educational experience. The overall instruction will be focused
on engineering applications and practical lab applications utilizing the
knowledge and problem solving skills taught during the sessions. A total of 135
underrepresented minority students entering the 8th and 9th grade from the
Hartford Public School system (45 each year) will take grade appropriate courses
and participate on field trips. The state of the art engineering facilities and
the enthusiastic Trinity faculty will provide students with an exposure to some
of the most exciting technological applications of science and mathematics. The
program will continue to employ a "hands-on" approach to mathematics and science
education. Learning experiences are designed to actively involve students in
science inquiry and mathematics as an integral aspect of investigation. Guidance
will address the need for enrollment in advanced secondary science and
mathematics courses during the academic year. Role models and mentors from the
science, engineering and mathematics community will make presentations during
the program. The language arts component is closely aligned with the science and
mathematics curricula. Opportunities for parents and guardians to become
empowered and actively involved in their child's education will be provided.
Follow-up activities will take place during the school year. Participants in the
program will remain in the CPEP data file for tracking and evaluation purposes
until they graduate high school, CPE P seeks $225,720. ***
