In this project Columbus State University is developing the Columbus Region
Academy of Future Teachers of STEM (CRAFT-STEM). Elements of the project include
a summer STEM Honors camp experience for high-school students, internships for
first- and second-year students, Robert Noyce scholarships for 19 juniors and
seniors majoring in STEM who are preparing to teach secondary school science or
mathematics, and a Teaching Connection Seminar, which encourages preservice
teachers to identify links between their STEM major and topics they expect to
teach in their future classrooms. The program dovetails with existing resources
for outreach, including a regional mathematics collaborative, an environmental
learning center, and a space science center. On-campus academic support is
available through the Math and Science Learning Center, and the State of Georgia
has designated Columbus State University as one of 6 recipients of funding in
its STEM II initiative. The science camp and the Teaching Connection Seminar are
unique features of this project, which expects to quadruple the number of
trained STEM teachers to serve an area of high need. Located near Fort Benning,
the project also recruits students from among military dependents and retirees.
