This project aims to test two alternative genetic mechanisms for the evolution
of reproductive isolation. One possibility assumes that selfish genes compete
for transmission by sperm while an alternative assumes that antagonistic genes
that facilitate male fertilization have negative effects on female reproduction.
Both of these processes can cause genetic arms races within populations, which
may cause hybrids between populations to be sterile. The selfish gene hypothesis
will be tested by locating hybrid sterility factors to determine if they are
near those that influence transmission of selfish X chromosomes and by comparing
DNA sequence evolution between chromosome regions. The antagonistic gene
hypothesis will be tested by comparing the rate of evolution of reproductive to
nonreproductive traits in males and females and by determining if sperm
competitive ability depends on genetic divergence between
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining how reproductive isolation evolves
is essential for understanding the origin of species. The research proposed here
is notable because alternative genetic mechanisms for reproductive isolation
will be evaluated and will utilize isolated populations of stalk-eyed flies,
genus Cyrtodiopsis, from southeast Asia. Stalk-eyed flies are ideally suited for
this work because populations that exhibit hybrid sterility, selfish sex
chromosomes and variable genetic divergence are available for study.&lt;br/&gt;
