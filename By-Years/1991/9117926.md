This award will provide for one half the funds necessary to acquire an isotope
ratio mass spectrometer with small sample capabilities. The University of Texas
at Austin has a commitment to provide the additional funding needed for this
acquisition. This state of the art instrument will replace a 20 year old
instrument, and will be capable of analyzing very small samples. Small sample
capability is necessary to utilize an existing laser-based extraction system,
and to utilize two laser-based systems under construction. The PI and his
students are expected to continue to be leaders in the field of sedimentary
geochemistry. This new instrument should help them to develop new techniques for
small sample analysis. Spot analysis of minerals will then be possible; this can
be crucially important to refine our understanding of the chemistry of
sedimentary materials.
