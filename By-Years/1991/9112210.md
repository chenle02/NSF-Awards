This award is for the purchase of an ion miller, capable of chemically-assisted
ion-beam etching, to be used for the preparation of materials for Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM). This ion miller is dedicated to research projects in
materials engineering including: the surface control of atomic diffusion in
III-V semiconductors; rapid solidification of ceramics; ion mixing of
semiconductor layered structures; interface characterization of epitaxially
grown superlattices; chemical synthesis of oxides; and guided wave optical
devices and materials at the 1.3 micron wavelengths.
