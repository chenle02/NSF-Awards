This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site at the University of Washington. Hooked on Photonics (HoP) is a
10-week REU program where undergraduates participate in research involving the
development of photonic materials and devices with applications ranging from
telecommunications to light-emitting devices to alternative energy. A unique
aspect of HoP is that participants are located on the three campuses: University
of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Arizona.
The advantages of a multi-campus REU program include leveraged recruiting and
educational efforts, substantial program evaluation, and increased diversity of
research activities. The HoP program includes research, content lectures, ethics
training, career seminars, and scientific-presentation skill workshops. In
addition to advancing photonics research, the goals of HoP are to (1) provide
academically appropriate research experiences for lower-level undergraduate
students who traditionally have had limited access to research (community
college students and students from primarily undergraduate institutions), and
(2) increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities who
successfully complete Bachelor's and advanced degrees in science and
engineering.
