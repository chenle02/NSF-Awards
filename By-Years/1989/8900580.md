This award will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the
American Museum of Natural History in the area of evolutionary biology. Drawing
on the research and teaching expertise of the Museum's outstanding scientific
staff, the program revolves around projects carefully designed to introduce
undergraduate level students to the excitement and challenge of original
research in evolutionary biology. Included in the program structure is a series
of bi-weekly meetings at which students will discuss their research, present
informal progress reports, and take part in discussions and seminars on graduate
and research career opportunities. At the end of the program students will
participate in a seminar where they will give a formal presentation for their
work. The AMNH will institute a follow-up program for REU participants aimed at
encouraging them to pursue careers in science.
