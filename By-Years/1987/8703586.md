Base isolation is an attractive strategy for reducing the effects of
earthquakes in certain structures and siting situations. The strategy is being
implemented around the world and in the United States. This research project
considers the feasibility of using a combination of active control and base
isolation for the seismic protection of critical structures. Base isolation
allows the structure to be uncoupled at the base from the ground motion. When
active control is added it should be possible to minimize the absolute
accelerations of the structure thus greatly reducing the accelerations and
forces experiences by sensitive internal equipment or fragile contents. The
research is both practical and experimental. Shake table studies of the combined
active control-base isolation methodology are to be carried out using a large
scale structural model. The shake table tests are very important in establishing
that the theoretical results can be translated into hardware and shows the
limits of applicability of the technique.
