The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a fundamental change in how people
interact with electronic devices. Whether a cell phone or wearable fitness
tracker, the form of current electronic devices is ultimately limited by the
rectangular and rigid display. This project will develop highly transparent and
elastic displays, achieving an order of magnitude improvement in mechanical
elasticity when compared to state-of-the-art flexible displays. The increased
flexibility will result in a transformative technology, enabling a wide range of
novel conformal and wearable electronics. Applications immediately pertinent to
the commercial wearable electronics market include clothing- or skin-mounted
fitness trackers and health monitors. Applications pertinent to the military
include adaptive camouflage and wearable heads-up displays. This project will
enable the development of an elastic drop-in replacement for existing rigid
display technologies, directly enabling a flexible form factor for a wide range
of current electronic devices. This project will bring an innovative display to
market that will permanently change how people interface with electronics.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
fabricate highly elastic and transparent displays. Current displays are limited
in flexibility due to the rigid, brittle materials employed, specifically indium
tin oxide (ITO). This project will replace all rigid materials with stretchable
nanomaterials, specifically graphene and carbon nanotubes, resulting in a highly
transparent and elastic organic light emitting diode display. Graphene and
carbon nanotubes offer the technical advantages of high optical transparency and
electrical conductivity. Most importantly, these nanomaterials provide superior
elastic properties with demonstrated strain limits greater than 20%. The
technical advantages of the advanced nanomaterials employed will enable the
development of a video display with the functionality of a TV, yet as thin as
paper, as transparent as glass, and as stretchable as rubber.
