This SBIR Phase I proposal will investigate the use of laser annealing
techniques to modify the structure and electronic properties of plasma processed
Y-Ba-Cu-O high critical temperature superconducting materials. Innovative
concepts include the use of rapid solidification for the modification of fine-
grained and amorphous phases of rare earth copper oxides, the establishment of
plasma processing and laser annealing parameters for fabrication of Y-Ba-Cu-O
supercoducting materials and thick film devices and the development of
techniques for using lasers to write thin, nonconducting regions in a
superconducting substrate. If successful, a Phase II is planned.
