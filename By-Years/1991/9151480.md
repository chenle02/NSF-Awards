In the process of revising and strengthening its undergraduate curriculum, the
Biology Department will encourage, enhance and stimulate undergraduate research
through a 3 phase program: a) a course in scientific methods and proposal
development; b) execution of directed undergraduate research; and c)
presentation in a symposium format. This proposal is a request for a computer
and light microscopy/microanalysis facility to support these undergraduate
research activities. The program and this request is an essential component of
the Department's desire to seek a high level of excellence in undergraduate
biology.
