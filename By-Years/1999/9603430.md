This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in colloid and
surface chemistry involves P. Somasundaran of Columbia University and Jerzy
Mielczarski of the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine, France. The
objective of the research is to investigate the interaction of adsorbed ions and
molecules, especially, surfactants at solid surfaces. They will study the
mechanisms involved in the interaction of different surfactants and organic
pollutants with minerals, including fatty acids, alumina, calcite and aromatic
pollutants. The project takes advantage of French expertise in calorimetry and
in surface chemistry. The underlying science will contribute towards achieving
an efficient and low cost means of removing toxic substances from water and
other wastes.
