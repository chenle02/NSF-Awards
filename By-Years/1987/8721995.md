Qualitative and quantitative x-ray diffraction analysis plays a very
significant role in atmospheric, geological and material science undergraduate
and graduate programs on the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology campus.
This award provides partial support for purchase of a state-of- the-art x-ray
diffractometer, including automation controls and software allowing rapid
processing of x-ray data for qualitative and quantitative analysis. This system
will replace a out dated diffractometer currently in use which does not provide
sufficient capabilities to be competitive in all areas of research and service
to classes. A number of research programs will be serviced by the new equipment
including the chemical characterization of atmospheric particulates matter, and
a number of earth science projects where identification and quantitation of
mineral species is important to an understanding of geochemical and petrologic
processes. Both undergraduate and graduate students will play a significant role
in the accomplishment of the research objectives of these programs.
