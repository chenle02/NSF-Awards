High-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing technologies (NGS) are causing a
major revolution in life sciences research by allowing rapid and cost-effective
sampling of genomes and transcriptomes (expressed genomic sequences). Assembly
of genomes and transcriptomes from billions of such randomly sampled sequences
is an important problem in computational biology. While significant strides have
been made, much work remains in addressing the diverse and rapidly emerging
platforms, improving assembly quality, and scaling to both large-scale data
sizes and large genomes.

This project will harness the power of high performance computing to develop
effective solutions for sequence assembly. It will lead to the development of
scalable, efficient parallel algorithms and a parallel integrated software
framework for genome and transcriptome assembly. The project seeks to advance
the state of the art by targeting important unsolved problems such as hybrid
assembly of sequences from multiple NGS platforms, making fundamental
algorithmic advances to improve assembly quality, and conducting an in-depth
effort at parallel algorithms development for the entire gamut of problems that
arise in connection with assembly. It will be carried out by an
interdisciplinary team of investigators, in partnership with leading NGS
manufacturers and academicians involved in large plant genome sequencing
projects.

The project will lead to the release of a scalable parallel software package
for sequence assembly that will be made available to the scientific community.
Postdoctoral and graduate students will be trained in computer science driven
interdisciplinary research and in writing efficient high performance computing
software. The project will influence curriculum development and will lead to
educational materials in bioinformatics for next-generation sequencing.
