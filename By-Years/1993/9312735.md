9312735 Yeh The purpose of this United States-Brazil joint project is to study
the Caraibas irrigation project which is under construction and located within
the "drought polygon" of the Northeastern region of Brazil. An automated gate
control system that can function in an open or close loop mode, and sensors for
signaling demand changes and fluctuations in water levels and gateflows are
being installed. Data from this systems will be used to validate and develop
automatic control methods as well as various modes of operation compatible with
on-demand irrigation water delivery and aqueduct systems designed for arid and
semi-arid regions. ***
