9451856 Rhodes Geographical information systems (GIS) are a powerful tool for
understanding the spatial relationships that are fundamental to field-based
sciences like geology and biology. This project therefore provides undergraduate
geology and biology students with instrumentation that can be used to acquire
spatially distributed data, to learn modern techniques for processing the data,
and to gain experience in analyzing and interpreting the information. These
activities provide hands-on involvement that is essential to active learning,
and the instruments are used in lower- and upper-division laboratory courses and
for independent research. It is also expected that the project will enhance
students' understanding of modern field methods, support their exploration of
scientific principles, and provide them experiences in formulating real problems
and proposing solutions.
