9416102 Lelong The small-scale signal in the ocean is made up of internal
gravity waves and three-dimensional turbulence. There is however, increasing
evidence that another type of motion, which can account for the potential
vorticity at this scales, is also present. The role of the small-scale potential
vorticity component (also called "vortical") remain unclear. The objective of
the present study is to assess the role of the vortical mode and its relative
importance to the small scale dynamics. Numerical simulations will be performed
to help observationalists to identify the different signatures expected of the
vortical and wave components.
