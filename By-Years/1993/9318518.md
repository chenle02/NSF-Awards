9318515 Lowman This grant helps support a symposium on the ecology,
biodiversity, and conservation of forest-canopy biota, to be held at the Marie
Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, FL. Leading scientists from many
disciplines and countries have been invited to participate. Forest canopies are
well recognized sites of biodiversity, yet very little is recognized about their
biota and ecology. Intact forest canopies are disappearing rapidly on a global
scale, often before even the rudiments of their biology are understood. Canopy
research has experienced many methodological breakthroughs in the past two
decades, and this symposium will bring together active researchers to exchange
ideas on research results, methods, goals, and priorities. %%% This symposium
will improve the abilities of participating scientists to conduct canopy
research. Results from canopy research can be applied to forest management and
conservation biology. ***
