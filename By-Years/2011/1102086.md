This proposal concentrates on two areas of research: the extremal theory of
graphs and hypergraphs, and the theory of discrete random structures. Both
belong to the main stream of contemporary discrete mathematics and enjoy a broad
range of applications in mathematics and computer science. Extremal theory of
graphs and hypergraphs is at the frontier of combinatorics, demanding more and
more sophisticated proof techniques. Some of the notoriously difficult problems
have remained open for more than 50 years, stimulating steady progress of
research. Randomness continues to play a fundamental role in demonstrating the
existence of combinatorial structures with desired properties, in modeling real
life large networks, as well as in the design of efficient algorithms. The aim
of the proposed research is to get a better understanding of some phenomena
occurring in both these areas, and how they interact. Our specific goals are to
study to what extent the minimum degree in graphs and hypergraphs determines
their structure and to transfer classical results, of extremal and Ramsey type,
to sparse random environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, owing to its
international character, will serve as a means of further development of
collaboration between the best researchers from various parts of the world. The
investigators will work towards popularizing the results of their research by
publishing in high-quality journals and presenting addresses at prestigious
international conferences. Having access to students, both graduate and
undergraduate, they will be in a position to disseminate their achievements also
at these levels of academic education. In particular, the problems described in
this proposal will be a good source of doctoral research topics for current and
future students.
