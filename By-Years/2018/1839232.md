Quantum computers are now approaching a size that will soon perform tasks
surpassing the power of today's fastest classical computers. To attain the full
power of a quantum computer, qubits inside the quantum computer should be well
connected with each other, so that information can be transferred, and
entanglement can be generated between any two qubits as fast as possible. The
qubit interactions will form a complex and time-varying network and their
dynamics will be too complicated for classical computers to predict. This
project will provide a key step in understanding quantum systems of a rapidly
increasing level of complexity and find out how such complexity can be employed
to massively speed up quantum computing over systems with sparse and simple
qubit connections. The project will expand the fields of quantum information
science and condensed matter physics into the territory of complexity science,
via concrete ways to quantify complexity of quantum states. As the quantum
information frontier is fostering a new technological revolution around the
world, the project will train a new generation of undergraduate and graduate
students with expertise in quantum technologies and develop a new 12-credit
graduate certificate program in quantum engineering to accommodate the pressing
need from industry professionals in obtaining quantum
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first half of this project aims to find out
how high qubit connectivity can be used to speed up quantum information
processing, focusing on mathematical quantum speed limits akin to Lieb-Robinson
bounds, optimal entangling protocols for very small or very large number of
qubits, and experimental demonstrations of entangling speed limit using solid-
state qubits. The second half of this project will focus on states created by
Hamiltonians with dense and complex interactions, quantifying their complexity
and understanding their entanglement structure. Various network measures
borrowed from complexity science will be employed to study the experimentally
measurable quantum mutual information network and the recently developed quantum
neural network, in order to bring new insight to quantum critical phenomena,
entanglement area laws, and nonequilibrium many-body
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
