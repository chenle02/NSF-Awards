This continuing grant for three years supports research on how visual
information is used for human spatial orientation. One of the three main spatial
dimensions basic to spatial location, direction, and orientation is "elevation."
Cues about the direction of "up" and "down" are usually present in the visual
world. For the brain to evaluate these visual cues, there needs to be
"extra.retinal" information on the position of the eyes within the head. In
addition, information about head and body position comes from internal position
receptors in the body, called proprioceptors, including the gravitational
receptor system of the inner ear and joint and stretch receptors in the body.
The relative role of these different systems has not been worked out, but there
is some evidence that in humans vision makes a larger contribution than those
non.visual cues. A theoretical approach is developed for the principles by which
visual field structure influences the perception of elevation. Quantitative
predictions from the theory will be tested on subjects placed in a room which
can be pitched forward or back, using visual stimuli that are erect or pitched
relative to the observer who will be erect or pitched at one of several angles.
Measurements will be made on how pitch of the visual field influences perceived
eye level, or perceived elevations of visual objects, or perceived slant of the
visual field, or perceived pitch of the subject's body. These influences will be
tested under conditions that produce substantial distortions of perception. The
importance of central and peripheral vision, and perception of size constancy
also will be assessed. This work will clarify how we establish the relative
spatial orientation between objects and self, which is a fundamental issue of
perception, and an issue of how input from several senses is integrated. This
research is likely to have application to the design and operational criteria
for visual guidance of machines such as industrial cranes and piloted vehicles.
