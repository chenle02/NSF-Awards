This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to study the molecular and
genetic basis of organ system morphogenesis. In particular Dr. Krasnow will
examine the formation of the Drosophila tracheal system using morphological,
genetic, and biochemical approaches to identify gene products and their
biochemical functions which are involved in tracheal tube formation, branching,
branch outgrowth and fusion.
