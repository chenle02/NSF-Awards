The role of quasars (the most energetic objects in the universe) in the
formation of galaxies is a key issue in understanding how our universe evolves.
The PI's program will measure the influence of powerful outflows, emanating from
these quasars, on the formation and evolution of their host galaxy. This project
will involve interdisciplinary research opportunities that will significantly
contribute to undergraduate education. Over the last 10 years, this group has
employed 21 students for a semester or longer, half of them women and under-
represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasar outflows are invoked as the
agents for quasar-mode Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Such outflows come
in many flavors: molecular, atomic, ionized seen in emission, ionized seen in
absorption, and ionized seen in X-ray spectra. The most energetic outflows are
ionized outflows seen in UV absorption spectra. Absorption outflows are the main
candidates for producing AGN feedback effects. The teamâ€™s research project will
expand on the progress they have made previously and will add to the
understanding of the physics and origin of absorption outflows and their role in
galaxy evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
