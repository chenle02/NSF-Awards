9753219 Murnane This POWRE project aims to extend ultrafast studies of dynamic
processes in materials to the x-ray region of the spectrum. Until now, the
possibility of monitoring the dynamics which occur as a surface evolves between
different equilibrium states has been very restricted, because ultrafast x-ray
sources with sufficient flux and time resolution have not been available. X-ray
wavelengths below 3.5 nm source to resolve the first steps in processes such as
melting, adsorption and desorption. The soft-x-rays are generated as a low-
divergence x-ray beam, with pulse durations under lO fs, perfectly synchronized
to an exciting laser, and are tunable throughout the soft-x-ray region. They can
also be generated with more than sufficient flux for time-resolved x-ray
photoemission experiments. The project is co-supported by the Division of
Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%%
This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities
for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will
contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An
important feature of the program is the integration of research and education.
The proposed project provides education and training in a diversity of areas
such as electronic and semiconductor materials, laser and optical technology,
fast electronics, extreme ultraviolet and x-ray science, and vacuum technology,
providing strong preparation for working in fields such as the semiconductor and
optics industries, soft x-ray lithography, and microscopy. ***
