The objective of this project is to study tropical cyclongenesis and, in
particular, what roles different environmental flows play in it. Three research
avenues will be pursued. The first one is to examine tropical cyclogenesis in
the eastern Pacific using data from the East Pacific Investigation of Climate
Processes (EPIC) experiment in which the PI actively participated and the
Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR) data from NOAA. The focus will be the
relationship between the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and easterly
waves before tropical cyclones form. For the second avenue, the PI will attempt
to reconcile two paradigms of tropical cyclogenesis in the western Pacific and
Gulf of Mexico, namely, the spin-up of vortices in the monsoon trough versus
easterly waves interacting with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) as pre-
cursors to cyclogenesis. The working hypothesis is that tropical cyclogenesis
often occurs under the following circumstances: 1) an active MJO producing a
strong monsoon trough with westerlies to its south and 2) upstream waves reach
the active MJO, grow in amplitude, and are ultimately the locus of depression
formation. In this way, the MJO, monsoon trough, and upstream waves all
participate and interact in cyclone formation. The third avenue is to conduct
numerical simulations using shallow water and barotropic models to test the
working hypothesis, using both idealized background states and those extracted
from observational data with MJO signals.

Tropical cyclogenesis remains one of the most challenging tasks in weather
prediction. Increasing the understanding of how environmental flows affect
genesis is important both from the prediction and modeling perspectives. The
planned research has the potential of shedding some light in this area and the
research will provide good opportunities for graduate studies.
