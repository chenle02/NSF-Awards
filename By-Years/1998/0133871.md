In this project, an alternative approach to developing collaborative
applications will be investigated. In this approach (called "incremental
specification and experimentation"), the collaboration infrastructure provides
only the most essential functionality by executing "meta protocols." During the
course of collaboration, new protocols are discovered and specified as they
emerge. Both meta and emergent protocol snippets are plugged, unplugged, and
replaced on the fly. The project includes: (1) domain modeling to find natural
representations of meta and emergent protocols; (2) multi-user authoring tools
to support end-user incremental specification of emergent protocols; (3) plug-n-
play of protocols to support incremental experimentation; and (4) execution,
monitoring and awareness mechanisms to provide the necessary context for
coordination. This proposed research investigates incremental specification and
experimentation of synchronous and asynchronous protocols in the same framework
and attempts to develop more end-user oriented support. The results, when
applied, are expected to improve the flexibility, and thus the usability and
development/deployment costs, of a variety of groupware applications. The
development of a new graduate course on "collaborative systems and models" will
give students concrete experience in experimentation with collaboration
protocols. In undergraduate courses, students will work in teams using
collaboration technologies to identify and analyze their collaborative
activities and the underlying "meta protocols" implemented in those systems that
they would like to change. Through a protocol modeling process, students will
develop analytic skills and begin to understand the dynamic nature of
cooperative work and the importance of flexibility in the design of
collaboration infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
