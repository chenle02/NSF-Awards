The program is designed to bring together 8 very bright undergraduates from
colleges and universities throughout the country, where there is little or no
opportunity for undergraduate research. Participants will be given an
opportunity to learn how to do research in mathematical and computational
sciences and they will be involved in numerical linear algebra and parallel
computing research projects. Activities include instruction and laboratory
experience in numerical algorithms for linear algebra, parallel programming
languages, learning how to use a multicomputer (32-processor Intel iPSC/860,
network of SUN workstations using MPI programming environment), literature
review, design of parallel algorithms and their implementation on the
multicomputer, presentation of research results. The program this summer begins
May 30, 1997 and lasts 8 weeks. The participants may continue on their research
when they return to their home institutions and prepare a paper for
presentation. In the past, students have made presentations at UMR, a national
undergraduate research conference, and at the Annual Argonne Symposium for
Undergraduates.
