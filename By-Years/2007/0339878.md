This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project investigates
efficient stimulated Raman amplification in the 1620-1750 nm near infrared
spectral region. This spectral range overlaps with the first overtone of the
strongest vibration resonances. In addition, no efficient high brightness
directs emission sources exist in this spectral region resulting in either low
power or complex laser systems covering this important spectroscopic region. In
this project, high power tunable laser sources will be developed for the remote
detection and spectroscopic characterization of organic
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direct outgrowth of this program should
enhance the ability to offer to commercial and government customers a qualified
optical sensor array detecting the presence of hydrocarbons. This sensor array
could be useful in particular to the Petroleum and Gas industry in their
refineries and distribution networks. Oil Companies spend over $100M a year in
detecting and preventing gas leaks in their facilities. &lt;br/&gt;
