1661496 (Edwards). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a massive flood in Louisiana,
this RAPID grant will help assist private well owners in the area assess and
address the current safety of their potable water supply. Climate models predict
that the frequency of flooding will increase in Louisiana and elsewhere in the
U.S. The 47 million residents in the U.S. reliant on well water, half of which
normally test positive for microbial contamination, would benefit from a better
understanding of one-time disinfection protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After
natural disasters, residents need low-cost, effective remediation options to
ensure safe, clean drinking water. Shock chlorination is the primary
disinfection method for microbial contamination in wells, but evidence suggests
that this approach may not be appropriate under all conditions, the actual
disinfection effect may be short-lived or incomplete, and there may be short-
term increases in metals such as lead. The recent flooding event in Louisiana
offers a unique opportunity to characterize well water quality after a flood,
evaluate both natural and enhanced recovery after treatments such as shock
chlorination, and assess public health issues experienced by low-income well
owners using compromised wells.
