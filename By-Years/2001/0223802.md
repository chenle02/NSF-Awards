This award is for partial support for the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Conference on Differential Equations, which will be held October 11-12, 2002, at
the University of Tennessee. The conference has met annually since 1981, and
provides an opportunity for young investigators to discuss recent developments
in the field with more senior researchers. Topics to be discussed include
ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional equations,
numerical methods, control and inverse problems, and applications to science and
engineering. Funds will be used primarily for the support of advanced graduate
students and recent PhDs.
