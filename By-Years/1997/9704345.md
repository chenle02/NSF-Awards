9704345 Duan The investigator plans to undertake a program of research in
nonlinear dynamical systems modeled by integral, ordinary and partial
differential equations, arising in fluid dynamics and geophysical flows. The
research will focus on the development and application of dynamical systems
methods for nonlocal, nonautonomous and nondissipative systems. In the area of
nonlocal systems, the investigator proposes to study the effects of nonlocal
integral terms on the dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and other partial
differential equations. The proposed work in nonautonomous systems will
concentrate on the study of geophysical fluid particle motions. In the area of
nondissipative systems, the intended research is focused on dynamical behavior
of the quasi-geostrophic equation and the rotating shallow water equations. The
proposed research deals with complex problems in fluid systems, especially
geophysical fluid systems in the oceans and the atmosphere. These problems are
motivated by the need for better scientific understanding of the environment or
global change. The proposed research is in the general area of differential
equations and nonlinear phenomena.
