Research on how the brain learns and remembers is crucial to basic science and
to our society?s efforts to understand and treat learning disabilities and
memory loss. One productive line of research has been the study of eyeblink
conditioning, which shows a strong correspondence between humans and other
animals in the brain structures and mechanisms involved. The hippocampus is a
critical brain structure shared by all mammals that, if damaged, devastates long
term declarative memory. Two patterns of hippocampal cellular activity are
especially relevant local field potentials (3-7 Hz slow wave or EEG oscillations
known as theta) and the action potentials of output neurons that convey the
results of hippocampal calculations to other target structures in the brain.
Theta rhythm is known to predict how fast conditioning will occur in rabbits and
there are recent findings that it is related to human memory as well. This
project uses a unique brain-computer interface that controls whether theta is
present or absent during training without the need for drugs or other invasive
treatments. Such training during theta is 2 to 4 times faster than nontheta.
Recording from single hippocampal neurons, investigators expect to characterize
the hippocampal output message to target structures and to determine how and why
the message is optimal during theta. Projected results include significantly
different response profiles of output neurons between theta and nontheta states,
with a diverse population of interneurons related to different aspects of theta.
These will be examined with respect to the improvement or impairment of
behavioral learning and will clarify how the hippocampus contributes to memory.
Such findings, as well as the participation of graduate and undergraduate
students, suggest a broad impact of this project on scientific inquiry, student
education, and the important social problem of memory impairment.
