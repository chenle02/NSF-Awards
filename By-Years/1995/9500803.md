9500803 Feldman This project involves many facets of work on probability theory
and ergodic theory. The research includes work on the following projects: A
classification of filtrations of stochastic processes; Zero-one asymptotic
properties of averages of functions transformed under ergodic measure preserving
transformations; Cofiltrations and ergodic group actions; Reparametrization for
Euclidean group actions and for foliations; Ergodic properties of multiplication
on the circle. Collectively, these projects cover a broad portion of the current
ergodic theory research landscape. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average long-term behavior of systems that are too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in real time. Under the heading of "dynamics" can be
placed the modern theory of how repeated applications of transformations effect
measurable quantities. In this way, groups of transformations and abstract
measure theory form the mathematical cornerstones of ergodic theory. This
proposal involves the leading edge of the mathematics of ergodic theory. ***
