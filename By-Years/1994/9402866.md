Jordan This award funds the research of Professor Bruce Jordan into the Hecke
structure of Shimura varieties. Recent advances in crystalline cohomology make
it possible to control the action of inertia on p-adic cohomology groups of
varieties over unramified extensions with good reduction over the rational
p-adic field. Prof. Jordan expects to apply these techniques to Shimura
varieties. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a
subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In
its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be
defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number
theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one
whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in
fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter
century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The result has been an
increased understanding of both areas of mathematics. ***
