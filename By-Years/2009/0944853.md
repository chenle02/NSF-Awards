This SBIR Phase I project will develop novel nematicides using proprietary
chemical design and screening methods. The project will first design,
prioritize, and synthesize a set of entirely novel molecules. The project will
then evaluate compounds for activity in multiple biological assays with
parasitic nematodes and plants. Promising scaffolds will be prioritized for
further development in Phase II including assessment of toxicity, manufacturing
cost, and additional synthetic opportunities.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to protect crops against
nematodes which result in significant benefit to growers and the environment.
The potential value to Divergence is very large, with the current nematicide
market of $1 billion under representing the actual value that could be
generated. REsulting effective nematicides with superior safety to current
prodicts will be of immediate benefit to growers, consumers, and the
environment.
