The integration of electronic and photonic devices on the same chip offers
performance advantages in terms of speed, bandwidth, immunity to interference,
power dissipation and interconnection density. This research explores algorithms
and tools for simulation of optoelectronic Integrated Circuit (OEIC) designs.
The goal is to simulate equally accurately both optical and electronic devices
in the same circuit. Both lumped and distributed-constant elements are included
in the model. Existing models for optoelectronic devices such as light emitters,
detectors, and electro-optic modulators are being refined and incorporated in
the simulator. New models are being developed for optical interconnect and for
those optoelectronic devices for which no models suitable for time-for domain
simulation currently exist. A simulation environment, capable of handling
circuits with optical and electronic devices is being constructed.
