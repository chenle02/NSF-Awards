9255782 Long The Numbers Alive project will model the use of number sense and
provide opportunities for its practice through the production of ten half-hour
television programs for students, one program for parents and care-givers, and
print materials in support of both types of programs. The targeted student
audience is fifth and sixth graders. The print materials supplement the
televised programs. The series emphasizes number concepts and problem solving
strategies in support of the NCTM Standards. ***
