This award supports travel for participants in the conference "Mathematical and
Numerical Challenges in Molecular Simulation and Control," held 15-18 December
2010 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The meeting focuses on chemical
physics, nonlinear analysis, and control theory, with emphasis on molecular
simulation and control. Topics to be addressed include new computational methods
in chemical physics, simulation of chemical reactions and quantum control,
quantum dynamics and nonlinear analysis, and control of linear and nonlinear
quantum dynamics.

The meeting features a one-day pre-conference tutorial for participants on
molecular simulation and control. The conference will include invited
presentations by leading researchers, as well as contributed talks.

The conference will foster collaborations among junior and senior researchers.
Invited lectures and contributed talks will be posted on the conference web
site. The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students,
junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.
