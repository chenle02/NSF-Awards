This research project concerns the value distribution of meromorphic maps from
parabolic manifolds into projective space and projective varieties. Special
attention will be given to moving targets, the Griffiths conjecture, questions
concerning hyperbolicity and the analogy to diophantine approximations. These
investigations will use curvature methods, meromorphic connections, jet metrics,
Nochka weights and Steinmetz maps. Also the splitting of parabolic manifolds
will be investigated by foliation methods. This research is in the general area
of geometric analysis which examines the geometric properties of surfaces, or
more generally, manifolds. The analytic setting of this research will be in the
theory of several complex variables.
