9321458 Full This project addresses a question of major interest to
physiological ecologists: does physiological capacity reflect performance in
nature? Precise measurements of locomotion in nature will test predictions based
on laboratory measurements of the energetics underlying endurance capacity in a
nocturnal lizard, the banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus). Nocturnal lizards
represent a substantial evolutionary shift in environment. Nocturnality imposes
a thermal handicap, which constrains endurance capacity to submaximal levels.
Nocturnal geckos have evolved excellent fuel economy, which partially offsets
the thermal handicap. In this dissertation research project, Mr. Autumn will use
infrared video motion analysis to obtain quantitative measurements of frequency,
speed, and duration of locomotion of banded geckos in the field. He will test
the hypothesis that natural performance loads are limited by nocturnality, yet
exceed the capacity of comparable diurnal lizards. This project will complete a
picture that links (1) effects of evolution of environment on physiological
capacity with (2) effects of evolution of physiological capacity on performance
in nature. ***
