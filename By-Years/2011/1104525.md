The goal of this project is the theoretical study of certain devices that have
been proposed as possible building blocks for photonic quantum computers; that
is, quantum computers where the information is carried by single photons. The
devices considered involve a single atom or quantum dot in an optical
microcavity. Their design is a substantial improvement over previous designs
because of their very low power requirements and potentially very low failure
rate. Several different configurations will be studied as regards experimental
feasibility and potential for best performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many groups
around the world are working on photonic quantum computers, and this research
will have a direct impact on such work. Moreover, even if an all-optical quantum
computer eventually turned out not to be the best choice, photons will almost
certainly still be used for communication between the nodes of quantum networks
in the future (as they are now in commercially available quantum cryptography
systems), and the devices to be studied here would be very useful in such
networks, to provide memory storage and allow for error correction operations.
