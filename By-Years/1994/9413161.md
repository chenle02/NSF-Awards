9413161 Smethie This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI will
collect water samples to ba analyzed for CFC concentration on IO WHP lines I-8S,
9S, 8N, and 5E. These lines constitute legs 1 and 3 of the IO WHP>. Specific
focus will be on formation and circulation of Subantarctic Mode Water, Antarctic
Intermediate Water, thermocline ventilation, and the extent to which equatorial
currents transport recently ventilated water. The additional measurement of
CC1-4 will allow study of longer time scales from the same samples. ***
