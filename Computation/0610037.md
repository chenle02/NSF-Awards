The proposed research deals with polynomial time approximation algorithms for a
class of nonconvex quadratic optimization problems which can deliver guaranteed
high quality approximate solutions. These approximation algorithms are based on
interior point methods for semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations of the
nonconvex problems, followed by some randomized rounding procedure. The
investigator of this project proposes to analyze both the worst-case and the
average-case performance ratios of the SDP relaxations for nonconvex quadratic
optimization problems under some realistic probabilistic models arising from
wireless communication. The focus of proposed research is on (i) design and
performance analysis of SDP relaxation algorithms for quadratically constrained
nonconvex quadratic programs, and (ii) probabilistic analysis of SDP relaxation
algorithms for the binary least squares problem. The choice of these topics is
strongly motivated by the applications from signal processing and wireless
communications. The approach will be to combine the modern interior point
optimization methodology with the theory of random matrices to estimate the
asymptotic performance of SDP relaxations for large systems.

Overall, the proposed research is built on the past successes the investigator
has had in developing new and applying the state-of-the-art optimization
techniques to solve some fundamental problems in signal processing and digital
communication. The latter two areas had been relying mostly on the gradient
descent or the least squares methods in the past thirty years. With the recent
advance of highly efficient interior point methods in mathematical programming,
the opportunity is ripe to use these modern optimization techniques and the
related software tools to help advance the field of signal processing and
digital communication, both of which are known to have intensive computational
requirement.
