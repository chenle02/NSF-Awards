Field mapping studies will be used to evaluate and apply the critical wedge
model of thrust sheet mechanics in an attempt to resolve existing conflicts
between thrust sequences predicted by the model and those suggested by
geological evidence. According to the critical wedge model, the advance of the
thrust belt under the force of horizontal compression, requires that the wedge
deform internally to attain and maintain a critical taper angle. Potential
taper-building mechanisms are: out-of-sequence thrusting; duplex formation; and
synchronous thrusting. Field work began in 1988 and 1989 in the Sawtooth Range
of the northwest Montana thrust belt during a previous award entitled "Sequence
of Thrusting: Implications for Mechanical Models of Thrust Belts". Existing
geological maps proved to be inaccurate or inadequate for the purpose of
detailed structural analysis and the area had to be remapped. Two additional
field seasons will be required to completed the mapping phase. The construction
of regional cross-sections, sequential restoration of the sections, and forward
modelling, will answer two principal questions: (1) which of the taper-building
mechanisms were operative? and (2) have they occurred in sufficient magnitude to
have allowed the critical wedge model to function?
