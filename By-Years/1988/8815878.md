This proposal will continue a comparative study of the population biology and
ecology of Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins at Admiralty Bay, King George
Island, South shetland Islands, Antarctica (62 10'S, 58 30'W). The primary
objective is to determine age-specific demographic parameters for sympatric
populations of Pygoscelis penguins, and to compare these parameters between
Adelie populations in different environments. Another objective is to compare
the foraging behavior/ecology of the three species, and within each, to compare
the feeding proficiency of young, inexperienced, firts-time breeders with older,
established breeders. Results from the latter effort should help to explain
patterns observed in the demographic data. Pygoscelis penguins are major
predators of krill (Euphausia superba); these predators and their prey are major
components of the antarctic marine food web. To thoroughly understand the
structure and function of the Antarctic ecosystem, important information not yet
available would be the factors that drive age structure and regulate population
size of key trophic-level predators (penguins). Such information will result
from the proposed study.
