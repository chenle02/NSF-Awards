This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
Office of Polar Programs, supports a project to conduct a terrestrial age survey
of Antarctic meteorites. More than two-thirds of the world's meteorites that are
available for scientific investigation were recovered from Antarctica since
1969. The NSF Office of Polar Programs, in partnership with NASA and the
Smithsonian Institution, have played a key role in facilitating the collection,
curation, and study of these specimens, and scientific endeavors sponsored by
these agencies have contributed significantly to our understanding of both
terrestrial and extra-terrestrial phenomena. Although the scientific information
garnered from these measurements is essential for determining accurate exposure
histories and delineating pairing of meteorites, these measurements will also
have a significant impact on studies of accumulation mechanisms, mean weathering
lifetimes, and meteorite influx rates. Glaciologists and geophysicists also
might find meteorite terrestrial ages useful in their studies of ice dynamics
and glacial histories. A timely survey of Antarctic meteorites terrestrial ages
from various ice fields may also provide guidance for the planning and the
prioritization of field activities. The principal value of this work, however,
is that it will provide better basic characterization of the Antarctic meteorite
collection and provide a basis for estimating meteorite influx rates.
