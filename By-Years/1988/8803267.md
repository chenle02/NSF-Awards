The Paleolithic period in eastern and southern Asia has been labeled as an area
of cultural retardation compared to Western Europe because of a lack of evidence
and long-held assumptions about early human tool use. Needed to test this idea
is information on the range of variation in early Asian tool assemblages. In
this project, the researcher will study the technological and typological
characteristics of Paleolithic stone tool assemblages from eight sites in China
and India. Data will be collected on manufacturing techniques and use, as well
as factors affecting the assemblages such as raw material availability.
Replication experiments will be conducted. This project will help establish a
much needed basis for identifying variability and inferences about human
technology and behavior in south and east Asia during the Middle Pleistocene.
