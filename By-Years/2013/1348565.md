The project entitled: The SOSS (Student-centered Open Source Software) Community
at Jackson State University seeks to establish an Open Source Software (OSS)
community run by Computer Science majors. It will enhance students' knowledge
and skills in problem solving analysis, solution design, software development,
and teamwork and communication. The goal is to educate Computer Science majors
through real-world software development activities and produce a well-educated
and well-trained workforce. The project will result in a repository and
knowledge base of student development projects; workspaces and opportunities for
real-world software development in a healthy educational environment; a virtual
classroom for students; and the development of an educational model utilizing
OSS products and the OSS community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project educates
African American Computer Science majors and prepares them for graduate school
and the workforce. The educational model is transparent and thus can be used and
adapted to incubate OSS communities in other disciplines and at other
institutions.
