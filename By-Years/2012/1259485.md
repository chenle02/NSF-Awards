The project at Otterbein College is providing scholarships and enhanced academic
and co-curricular experiences to students majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, or Physics. Fourteen
scholars, who entered as first-year students, are receiving four years of
support and fourteen scholars are receiving two years of support following their
transfer to Otterbein after completing a 2-year program at a regional community
college. Scholars, selected based on both previous academic experience, and an
on-campus interview, are participating in an active learning community whose
components include a three day-long summer immersion experience, programming
with the Center for Career Planning, residence in a living-learning house, a
focused seminar program, and a mentoring triad which includes a peer, a faculty
member, and a STEM professional. All S-STEM scholars are eligible for a paid
summer research experience as an explicit part of the program designed to help
students maintain an interest in STEM fields, improve the likelihood they will
earn higher GPAs and persist in the major. The project, through its recruiting
strategies with local high schools, is leading to greater retention in STEM
majors and access to STEM careers for students from groups traditionally
underrepresented in chemistry, particularly first-generation college students.
