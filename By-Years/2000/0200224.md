Telecommunication industry is a highly competitive industry. Since divestiture
and government de-regulations, various telephone services, such as cellular,
local and long distance, domestic and commercial, have been the battle fields
for telecommunication service providers. To remain competitive, it is important
for the companies to establish business planning systems to support management
for strategic planning and decision making. Statistical process control (SPC)
techniques have been used routinely for on-line process control and monitoring
and have resulted in cost-effective returns on investment in manufacturing
industry. Our research builds on the powerful SPC and modeling methods to
develop efficient statistical techniques for data mining and activity monitoring
in telecommunication industry. We identify the limitations of the current SPC
methods in telecommunication applications. We develop efficient methods for
monitoring large volume of univariate and multivariate data and construct
economic models to evaluate and compare various monitoring methods. We also
develop design of experiments and churn modeling methods to identify important
characteristics responsible for abnormal activities and to predict likelihood
that the activities would happen.

The major impact of the proposed research is to improve the existing techniques
and tools in the business planning system for data mining and knowledge
extraction in the telecommunication industry. The enhanced system will allow
marketing and sales managers to apply data mining methods routinely,
efficiently, and effectively to solve their problems. As a result, our research
will help the company reduce cost through efficient fraud detection systems and
improve revenue through customer churn prevention, customer retention programs,
and new business opportunities based on extracted useful knowledge.
