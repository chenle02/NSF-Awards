The primary focus of this research program is the quantitative investigation of
the detailed mechanisms responsible for conversion of fuel carbon into highly
symmetrical, low entropy fullerene compounds in flames. The project includes
three main components: combustion experiments, molecular orbital modeling, and
kinetic modeling. In the combustion experiments, laboratory data on rates of
production and consumption of fullerenes, fullerene precursors, and other
species and flame parameters will be collected. The flame properties to be
measured include profiles of concentrations of stable species, fullerenes,
fullerene intermediates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) along with
OH radicals and temperature through a low-pressure premixed flat flame; these
measurements will be made at various operating pressures, cold-gas velocities,
and feed compositions. Some key intermediates involved in fullerene production
will not be experimentally observable due to their transient nature, so their
thermodynamic properties will be estimated using molecular orbital modeling
methods. This information will then be used in the last component of the
program, mechanism development and kinetic modeling, along with the measured
profiles, for development of a coherent, quantitative explanation of the steps
involved in fullerene production, leading to definition of strategies for
optimization of fullerene production via combustion synthesis. Considerable
interest in fullerenes (also referred to sometimes as the third form of carbon,
alongside graphite and diamond), has developed over the past few years.
Potential uses for these compounds are just beginning to be defined; such
definition and subsequent actual utilization are limited by a lack of material
with which to work and its extraordinarily high price. Combustion synthesis of
fullerenes offers a potentially attractive route (alternative to the currently
more widely used electric arc method of fullerene production) for cost and
scale-up reasons. Thus, development of an understanding of how fullerenes are
formed in flames, leading to optimization (in terms of operating parameters and
apparatus configuration) of combustion synthesis of these materials, is of major
interest.
