The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Board of Education, in collaboration with the
State Education Agency and the Winston-Salem Foundation, has set up a four-phase
program for the training of all elementary school teachers. The first two phases
of this long-range program have been accomplished. Phase 1 of the project
involved one teacher in each of the 36 elementary schools in the county who
attended a summer institute, and then shared ideas and expertise with colleagues
during the school year. Phase 2 featured the training of teams in four specific
disciplines, physical science, biological science, earth-space science, and
mathematical problem solving. Phase 3 will provide for an increase in the number
of team training sessions and a 10-day institute for formative training for the
teaching team. Peer training will be carried out in each of the elementary
schools by these teaching teams. Phase 4 will be devoted to dissemination and
replication throughout Region V. Evaluation of this project will allow for
continuous assessment and feedback which will enable potential problems to be
corrected before the program is fully operational.
