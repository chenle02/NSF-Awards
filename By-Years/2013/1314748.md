A quantum spin, like a classical magnet, can point at any direction, but a
collection of quantum spins generally behave in a more exotic way and can point
to many more directions than classical spins do. This usually translates to the
feature that quantum many-body problems are much harder than classical problems.
However, in some physical models, quantum spins, even though they can point to
more directions (which originate from large spin magnitudes), turn out to behave
much like classical magnets, with only small fluctuations around the direction
they point to. It seems that even in the quantum world, there are regions that
look more or less like the classical world. Where is the boundary between the
classical and quantum territories? When do quantum problems become easy and when
do they become hard? These two intimately related questions are the subject of
this project. A clear characterization of such a `transition' will help to
understand the exotic properties of quantum many-body
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of the research findings of this
project into education on quantum information and quantum many-body physics will
help to nurture a new generation of students with new tools of thinking. This
project also includes training of a graduate student and mentoring of a
postdoctoral researcher. The planned outreach activities such as giving public
lectures, mentoring high school students for summer research projects, and
developing materials and activities for high school students in science and
mathematics education will complement the research activities and lead to
sustaining impacts.
