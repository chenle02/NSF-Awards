Abstract(Jarosz,1400661):

This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of approximately 60 US
participants, primarily graduate students and young researchers, and 10 invited
speakers participating in the "7th Conference on Function Spaces" to be held on
the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville from May 20-24, 2014.

There will be talks by internationally known speakers on a wide variety of
topics including spaces of functions, topological and Banach algebras, and
operators. In addition to plenary talks there will be many contributed talks by
graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers, up to 10 a day in parallel
sessions. There will also be a two hour recorded open forum led by experts to
discuss recent trends and new problems in the field of function spaces.
