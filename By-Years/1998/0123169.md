This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in
the Computational Mathematics Program (CMP). The Humacao Research Scholarship
(HRS) program uses existing programs to recruit high school students and provide
them with academic support. The program uses undergraduate research as a
strategy to increase student academic achievement and retention and to establish
mentorship relations. This strategy has proved to be successful in the CMP. A
summer bridge program is offered to HRS students admitted from high school to
the CMP. Another component of the program are workshops, which cover topics such
as careers in the mathematical sciences and information on graduate programs.
Faculty coordinate and oversee all activities relating to the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
