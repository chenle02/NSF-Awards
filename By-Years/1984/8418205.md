Partial support is provided for the design and construction of a geotechnical
centrifuge facility. The centrifuge system will be capable of performing
geotechnical tests upon payloads up to 2 tons and with accelerations up to 200g
(400 g-ton). A medium- to large-size centrifuge system (above 100 g-ton)
provides an excellent opportunity to perform parametric studies simulating
;itin-situ;ro conditions for large geotechnical systems such as reservoirs,
dams, and foundations. The size and capacity of a centrifuge system have a
considerable influence on the types of geotechnical experiments that can be
performed. A specially designed large capacity (above 100 g-ton) centrifuge
facility dedicated to geotechnical experimentation is not currently available in
the United States. The absence of such a facility limits the ability to verify
and apply appropriate geotechnical models for the design and repair of large
geotechnical structures.
