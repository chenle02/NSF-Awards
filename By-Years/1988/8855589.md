The Florida Museum of Natural History proposes to prepare two versions of a
traveling exhibit in the context of the Columbus Quincentennary. The purposes of
the exhibit are to show the natural history of the Caribbean at the time when
Columbus arrived and to describe the rapid modification of those natural
environments for European economic gain. The exhibit will manifest two
components, both of which will travel to other museums. One exhibit of
approximately 3000 square feet will originate at the Florida Museum of Natural
History and then will move to eight other museums around the country. Another
exhibit of about 1000 square feet will travel to a different series of smaller
museums, libraries and college galleries.
