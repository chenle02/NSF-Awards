This award adds five higher education institutions to the MOREnet state
network. Four of the institutions are primarily undergraduate colleges, and one
is a junior college. The new institutions connect to a hub located at the
University of Missouri at Columbia. Faculty and students at the institutions
will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries
and supercomputer. In addition, they will be able to communicate and collaborate
with colleagues at other campuses in pursuit of research and educational
projects.
