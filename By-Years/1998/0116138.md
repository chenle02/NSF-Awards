Partial funding is provided for the support of a workshop (Gordon Research
Conference) on coastal ocean circulation. Twenty-two invited talks and a series
of contributed poster presentations will be made. These will cover a breadth of
topics in coastal ocean circulation occurring on a variety of space and time
scales. Related topics in coastal meteorology and biogeochemical-physical
interactions will also be discussed. The priority use of the funds is to defray
travel and attendance costs for young investigators.
