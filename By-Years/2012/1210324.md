Swordtails (Xiphophorus) are live-bearing fishes native to Central America and
they are excellent models for studying animal behavior, especially mate choice.
In many swordtails, males have an elongated ornament on their tail fins called a
"sword", which has evolved in response to female mating preferences. Females
also prefer the smell (pheromone) of males of their own species. Recent studies
revealed that olfactory preference is either positively or negatively affected
by early learning experience, depending on the species. X. malinche, for
example, dislike the familiar male smell while its sister species X. birchmanni
prefers it. Animals smell thanks to olfactory cells in their noses, which
express odorant receptor genes, each specific to a particular set of molecules.
There are about 200 types of odorant receptor genes in a Xiphophorus. This study
will use high-throughput DNA sequencing to look at how many copies of each
odorant receptor gene are expressed in the fish exposed to different adult
species early in life. By comparing the expression patterns across the three
experimental groups, we will try to pinpoint candidate receptors that are
specialized for detecting species-specific pheromone cues. Broader impacts: This
study can help us understand how learning and brain development work at a
molecular level. During this project, one to two undergraduate students will be
trained in biological computing and programming. Popular articles will continue
to be contributed to Fishchum (http://fishchum.okstate.edu/), a web platform
connecting fish biologists and aquarists. The findings from these studies will
reach a multilingual audience as articles will be written in English, Chinese
and Spanish and some findings will be used for outreach via popular hobbyist
websites and/or magazines.
