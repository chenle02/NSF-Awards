This grant provides funding to conduct an international workshop February 20-22,
2007 at the Savannah campus of Georgia Institute of Technology. This workshop
will bring together researchers to address, discuss and lay the groundwork for
the development of new methods and tools to handle engineering analysis and
design problems under uncertainty with a focus on problems that have incomplete
or imprecise information. Topics of the workshop include uncertainty modeling
with incomplete information, analysis and design of engineering systems with
imprecise parameters and design-based decision making with imprecise
information. A group of approximately 45 participants from various disciplines
including mathematics, computer science, computational mathematics and
engineering, are expected to attend. The Scientific Committee associated with
this workshop includes distinguished researchers from around the globe which
will facilitate participation from the international community.

Results from this workshop will have important implications for the economy of
the United States. Reliable and dependable analysis and design are crucial for
the health and safety of the U.S. population. More reliable analysis and design
of our systems will contribute to our ability to respond to life threatening
failures and disasters of engineered and natural systems. This grant will
support the education of the next generation of scholars in this area by
providing support for graduate students and mid-career faculty to attend the
workshop. The results of this workshop will be disseminated broadly through the
publication of the proceedings, a workshop web site and journal publications in
an international journal. In summary, this grant has the potential to greatly
enhance the infrastructure for research and education in the United States.
