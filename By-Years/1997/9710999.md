This research project traces development of engineering education for women from
the 19th century to the present, concentrating on how institutions and
individuals related to the complex and changing relationship between gender and
technical expertise. The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to science,
technology and society, combining history of engineering and professionalization
with related issues in social history, history of education, women's studies,
and current policy. The first objective is to explore historical patterns in the
relationship between women and the professionalization of engineering, looking
at how different decades brought new questions about the role and importance of
technical professionals in American life. The second issue is to look at how the
engineering profession itself addressed the issue of technical education for
women. The third question asks how different universities addressed the question
of opening the engineering curriculum to women. The final question takes the
students' perspective, asking how women viewed the profession and the changing
opportunities and obstacles it presented. The project will blend oral history
interviews with extensive work in engineering and university archives.
