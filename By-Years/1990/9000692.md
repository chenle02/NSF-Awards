This award provides continuing support to The Institution of Ecosystem Studies'
Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE. The program will immerse students
in a highly interactive, research oriented environment. The major tenet is that
success in science depends on understanding the context of research, as well as
the substance and procedures of a particular discipline. Program goals are: (1)
to provide intensive training in ecological research; (2) to broaden students'
perspectives; (3) to give students direct exposure to the life of a research
scientist; and (4) to promote an understanding of ecology. Eight students will
be brought to the Institute for a twelve-week summer program. The program will
include the following components: (1) Student Research Projects; (2) Research
Strategies for the Undergraduate, a series of intensive training sessions; (3)
Research in Context, a seminar series designed to broaden students' perspectives
on the various components and applications of science; (4) Forum on
Opportunities in Ecology, a full-day program with representatives from a broad
spectrum of ecological and related disciplines; and (5) supplementary
activities. Under the guidance of a mentor scientist, each student will
delineate a research question and associated hypotheses, select appropriate
methods, and develop a research plan. Students will then implement the project,
finishing with analysis and report writing. Presentations in a formal Research
Symposium will conclude the summer program. Final Papers will be collated and
published as an IES Occasional Publication.
