9410768 Beck Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
with the goals of determining the contribution of strange quark to the nucleon
charge and magnetization distribution. A new magnetic spectrometer utilizing
superconducting coils will be constructed for use in the GO experiment at the
CEBAF facility in Newport News, VA. The asymmetry in the scattering of polarized
electrons from a liquid hydrogen target will be measured. Research in this area
will advance our understanding of nucleon in terms of constituent quarks and
sea-quarks (quark-antiquary pairs surrounding the constituent quarks). This
topic is among the most exciting in nuclear and particle physics. Base support
for the personnel who will work on this construction project comes through a
separate award to the University of Illinois Nuclear Physics Laboratory.
Education of graduate students is thus integral to this grant and to the overall
research program which will be carried out. ***
