0427481&lt;br/&gt;McGlynn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project
planning trip to Perth, Western Australia, for Professor Terrence McGlynn of the
Department of Biology of the University of San Diego. Professor McGlynn intends
to discuss and refine the details of a collaborative research partnership with
Professors Jonathan Majer and Byron Lamont and others of the Department of
Environmental Biology of Curtin University of Technology in Perth. The mutual
interest of the investigators is the role of soil nutrients in trophic cascades
in animal communities. The short term objectives of this visit include
evaluating potential field research locations in Southwestern Australia,
integrating existing data sets and designing a series of experiments. Professor
McGlynn's prior field research in Costa Rica and that of his hosts in Australia
have found similar strong direct effects of soil nutrients upon the density of a
terrestrial faunal community. They now intend to collaborate directly and
indirectly to increase the efficiency and comparability of their research in
different ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first direct benefit of the visit
will be to strengthen a planned research proposal to NSF seeking funding for
Professor McGlynn's future research involving Australian field sites and
collaborators. Beyond this, the anticipated broader benefit of obtaining such
funding will be to provide international exposure and research experience for
undergraduate students at the University of San Diego, with a significant
proportion of them from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
