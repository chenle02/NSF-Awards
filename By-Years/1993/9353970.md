9353970 Winfrey This project involves an intensive two and one-half week
laboratory workshop in molecular biology for undergraduate faculty. The workshop
allows 20 participant faculty per year to learn the basic principles, techniques
and applications of modern molecular biology. Consideration is given to faculty
in need of re-training or those who teach women and minorities. The principal
goal of the workshop is to provide participants with hands-on techniques,
experiences, and educational materials to implement effective undergraduate
molecular biology laboratory instruction into their curriculum. Participants
isolate and separate DNA, clone genes, and analyze the cloned genes by Southern
blotting, nucleic acid hybridization, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA
sequencing, and computer assisted sequence analysis. Also, laboratories are
supplemented with lectures on the principles of methods used and by seminars
presented by experts from academia and industry on various applications of
molecular biology. Sustained interaction among the participants will be
maintained by networking and holding follow-up workshops and a mini-symposium
after completion of the original two and one- half week workshop course. ***
