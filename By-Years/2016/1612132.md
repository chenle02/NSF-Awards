This country's dependency on correct, robust software drives the significance
and importance of this work. Vital aspects of national security depend on the US
government's ability to withstand daily cyber intrusions. Likewise, the national
infrastructure depends on the smart grid and thousands of other software-driven
control systems that regulate water supplies, run factories, and operate cars.
Yet, teaching students how to write efficient, error-free software continues to
be a challenge. This project investigates a new programming pedagogy that will
significantly improve training for the programmers we rely on, by advancing
ideas on three fronts. First, the project investigates the integration of
literate programming ideas into technology supporting learning and into
classroom environments, i.e., marrying informal writing and programming. Second,
the project contributes to the writing-to-learn (WTL) literature by
incorporating WTL principles into a new domain of programming. Third, the
project contributes to computer science education literature by investigating
the learning processes associated with learning to program in order to improve
programming pedagogy.

The goals and scope of this project include advancing the understanding of
learning in technology-rich environments by examining how WTL strategies can
support novice programmer development. This project employs a case study design
that emphasizes concurrent qualitative and quantitative data collection and
analysis with mixing occurring during the final interpretation stage. Through a
combination of interviews, writing samples, programming metrics, and writing
metrics, this project will 1) capture understanding of how writing helps
students connect big-picture concepts to specific implementations of programming
solutions; 2) identify roles that intermingled writing takes in promoting
programming mastery; and 3) identify types of learners (e.g., computing majors,
non-computing majors) that most benefit from intermingled writing while learning
to program.
