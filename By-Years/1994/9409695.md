9409695 Yang Efficient scheduling of computational task execution and data
movement is essential to high-performance computing on massively parallel
machines and workstation clusters. This research focuses on the study of graph
scheduling algorithms and the run-time schedule executing methods for mapping
program parallelism on message-passing architectures. The goal of optimization
is to minimize the parallel time by balancing load among a limited number of
processors, eliminating unnecessary communication and overlapping computation
with communication. There exists two types of parallelism in a program, task
parallelism is expressed as a collection of functional tasks with communication
between them. The dependence structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Loop
parallelism is expressed as a collection of iterated computation with loop-
carried dependence. The main research topics identified in this project are to
develop scheduling algorithms for both task and loop parallelism and run-time
methods to execute the scheduled graph, study the methods of loop transformation
to help graph scheduling algorithm to explore more parallelism, apply these
algorithms in scientific computing such as sparse matrix factorization and
iterative methods, analyze the impact of program partitioning on scheduling
performance. Research activities include developing and implementing algorithms
for the above problems and evaluating the performance on parallel machines and
workstation clusters, integrating these algorithms in a scheduling tool and
distributing the implementation. ***
