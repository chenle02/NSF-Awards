Metal ions figure significantly in the activity of many enzymes biological
systems also make very subtle distinctions among metallic elements to control
fundamental information transduction processes. Moreover, proteins with active-
site sulfhydryl groups (potential metal binding targets) play key roles in DNA
replication and repair. Presently, our understanding of what determines specific
protein-metal interactions and of how alternative metals can modulate protein
behavior is incomplete. Summers studies the bacterial mercury (Hg) resistance
(mer) locus, an operon controlled by a small, Hg-responsive, DNA binding,
transcriptional activator/repressor, MerR. Her work has focussed on MerR
interactions with its cognate DNA site, merOP, and with RNA polymerase. She will
use molecular genetics and biochemistry to discern the MerR domains which enable
it to sequester RNA polymerase at merOP prior to induction and those responsible
for the DNA distortion which takes place during activation. She will dissect the
relationship between the mer operon and the chromosomally encoded oxidative
shock regulon. Finally, she will employ random and site specific mutagenesis to
obtain MerR mutants responsive to transition metals other than Hg(II). These
variant MerR proteins will be examined in vitro for their metal and DNA binding
properties. %%% Certain micro-organisms have the ability to grow in the presence
of chemicals which are toxic to most other organisms. One way this is
accomplished is through conversion of the toxic form of the chemical to a non or
less toxic form. This proposal investigates the genetic mechanisms which
regulate and control the expression of a set of genes in bacteria which function
in the detoxification of mercury. $$$//
