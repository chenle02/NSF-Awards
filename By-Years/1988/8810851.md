This proposal from the University of Kentucky requests support toenhance the
planning of a Science and Technology Center forMembrane Sciences. The proposed
Center is planned as acollaborative effort, also involving the University of
Louisvilleand the University of Cincinnati. The interdisciplinary researchwill
involve participation by members of the Departments ofChemistry, Pharmacy, and
the medical school. The goal of theCenter would be investigations into the
structure and chemistryof biological membranes and their constituents,
transportprocesses, and information transfer in living systems. Understanding
the means and mechanisms by which cellulartransmembrane signal transduction
occurs is one of the majorresearch thrusts of modern biological chemistry. The
Planning Grant activity will enable three institutions tobegin a systematic
inventory of existing research capabilitiesand resources. This will allow for
the identification of areasof potential collaboration and, ultimately, the
primaryscientific thrust areas for the Center for Membrane Science.
