This project aims to develop innovative capacity planning models for health care
delivery. The research project will model a general health care system as a
network of queuing stations and incorporate the queuing methodology into an
optimization framework. The queuing reflects the unpredictable or random
elements of health care systems, whereas the optimization framework captures
tradeoffs between costs and levels of service. Capacity cost and performance
functions are likely to be nonlinear, so the optimization will fall in the
challenging category of nonlinear integer
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capacity management is increasingly recognized
as one of the critical issues in making health care delivery more flexible and
cost-efficient. Resources must be allocated among levels of the delivery network
(primary care clinics, acute care hospitals, rehab centers, nursing homes), as
well as among units of these facilities. Successful development of optimization
tools adapted to this task could have a tremendously positive impact on
decision-making and facilitate better understanding of tradeoffs and their
consequences. Furthermore, the project will foster development of
interdisciplinary collaborations among engineering and hospital administration
researchers and benefit from strong interactions with delivery facilities of
three different types. &lt;br/&gt;
