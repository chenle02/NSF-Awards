This is a doctoral dissertation project to study the discourse and collective
action of anti-crime activists in order to understand the social and
institutional forces that engender a fear of crime and the circumstances under
which fear of crime gives rise to anti-crime activism. The principal source of
data will be videotapes and transcripts of focus group conversations with
members of Boston area "crime watch' groups. This study will contribute to
ongoing debates about fear of crime, and the politics of crime, and it will
clarify the political effects of fear of crime and anti-crime activism by
identifying the kinds of anti-crime initiatives that are likely to receive broad
public support.
