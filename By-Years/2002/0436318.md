This project establishes an undergraduate training program in mathematical
biology based on a core group of six faculty, three biologists and three
mathematicians, that will serve as an accessible bridge between the departments
and foster long-term collaborative teaching and research. The main focus is on
paired undergraduate mentoring, with each student being mentored by a
mathematician and a biologist on a multi-year research project studying the
dynamics and viability of animal metapopulations. New bio-math courses will be
developed and a regional bio-math conference will be organized
biannually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and faculty will study how the
survival, growth and dispersal of sub-populations of animals affects the long-
term viability of the (meta)population these sub-populations comprise. As
urbanization and habitat fragmentation continues, understanding how dynamics of
small sub-populations affects the viability of large metapopulations is
fundamental to conservation science and assessment of extinction risk. This
project offers students the opportunity to blend theoretical mathematical and
field-based biological techniques to answer ecologically-important questions.
The primary educational objective is to produce more graduate and professional
bio-mathematicians through offering enticing research opportunities and exciting
coursework. By partnering with a local community college, recruitment will focus
on students currently missing these opportunities - Hispanics and African-
Americans. Over five years, this project will enable faculty to mentor 35
undergraduate researchers, teach hundreds in new bio-math courses, and affect
thousands through our biannual bio-math conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
