Description: This project supports participation of a U.S. team of computer
scientists and engineers in a Indo-U.S. workshop on "Cooperative Research in
Computer Science" to be held in Bangalore, India, August 4 to 6, 1992. The areas
of expertise to be represented include: robotics and computer vision, computer
systems and networking, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. The
objectives of the workshop are to: present papers by U.S. and Indian
participants about the recent advances in the various topical areas, identify
research needs in each of these areas, identify suitable areas for Indo-U.S.
collaborative research, and establish firm collaborations between U.S. and
Indian scientists. Scope: This is the second Indo-U.S. workshop in the area of
computer science. The first was held in 1989 in the city of Hyderabad, India
with participation from India's main governmental and private research
organizations with interest in computer research and applications. Since that
time a number of collaborative activities have resulted. The present project is
designed to continue and intensify this mutually beneficial interaction and
collaboration. The project meets the objectives of the U.S.-India Cooperative
Science Program.
