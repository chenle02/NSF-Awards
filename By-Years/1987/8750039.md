Undergraduate chemistry majors at DePauw University are being provided with
routine access to a significant number of modern instrumental techniques in the
areas of spectroscopy, separations, and electrochemistry. A number of modern
instruments have been recently acquired: cyclic voltammograph, gas
chromatograph, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer, which coupled with existing departmental instrumentation,
have allowed the development of a new laboratory curriculum in Instrumental
Analysis. This course has an emphasis on methods for instrumental optimization,
methods of data collection and analysis, and methods for studying chemical
reactions and reaction mechanisms.
