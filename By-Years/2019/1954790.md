Many physical phenomena are modeled as particles interacting randomly. Moving
cars in one-lane traffic are one of such examples. Sometimes the interactions of
the particles in a small area have a lasting influence on the far away location
over time. It is of great interest to find out how fast such influence spreads.
This project is concerned with some of the fundamental questions on the spread
of local random interactions on a global scale for a class of random processes.
The project provides research training opportunities for both undergraduate and
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more concrete terms, the investigator
will perform research on spin glass, interacting particle systems, and random
growth models with a focus on the fluctuations of large systems. In particular,
the investigator will study the free energy and overlaps of the two-spin
spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with critically-tuned external field,
the random field for periodic KPZ universality class, and also the last passage
time for a class of directed percolation models. There are deep connections to
random matrix theory which the investigator will utilize and also expand. The
exactly solvable nature of the models will also be used in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
