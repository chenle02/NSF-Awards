95290545 Wunsch In this project, the PIs will use a global inverse model based
on long-line hydrographic data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) plus some other sections that pre-date WOCE, to investigate oceanic
budgets of heat, fresh water, oxygen, and nutrients, and the interchange of
these components with the atmosphere. The model is based on the geostrophic
inverse method, and can be updated with new hydrographic data, as well as with
other types of data such as those from floats, current meters, and altimetry. A
particular feature of this approach is the ability of the model to
quantitatively estimate uncertainties in the results. Additional methods for
determining the time variability of ocean circulation will also be sought. ***
