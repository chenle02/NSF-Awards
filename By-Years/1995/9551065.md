06320 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Chemistry Title: A Versatile Laser-Based
Experimental Setup for the Chemistry Curriculum A versatile experimental setup
is used to introduce modern laser-based physical chemistry to the undergraduate
curriculum. Requiring minimum reconfiguration to switch between different
experiments, the system can be used to demonstrate a variety of concepts, such
as laser-induced fluorescence, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, Doppler
broadening, photodissociation, radiative lifetime, Boltzmann distribution,
resonance Raman spectroscopy, and computerized data acquisition. Six new
experiments have been designed around this setup for incorporation into upper-
level physical chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and
instrumentation laboratories. In addition, a program of original research
projects for majors has been developed based on the setup. The project can serve
as model for schools wishing to modernize their curriculum in a broad, yet cost-
effective way. Laboratory "handouts" and descriptions of experiments and student
research projects will be generated during the project and disseminated in
journals, meetings, and on the Internet.
