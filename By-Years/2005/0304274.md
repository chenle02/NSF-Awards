PROPOSAL NO: 0304274&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: U of Cal
Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: King, Tsu-Jae&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
Scaling Si-based FET's Atomic Dimension&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This
project will pave the technological pathway for scaling silicon transistors down
to atomic dimensions (~1 nm minimum feature size). A promising new transistor
structure (the back-gated thin-film MESFET) will be developed, one that is more
scalable and much simpler to manufacture than the conventional MOSFET structure
employed in integrated-circuit (IC) devices today. The MESFET will provide for
tremendous gains in functional density, not only by transistor scaling but also
by three-dimensional integration (stacking multiple layers of transistors in an
IC) for maximum circuit layout efficiency and system performance. This work will
enable improvements in performance and cost to continue for at least 20 more
years, supporting the growth of the semiconductor industry over this time
period. It will also serve to bridge the technological gap between CMOS devices
(scaling limit ~10 nm) and molecular/nanotube devices (~1 nm minimum
dimensions), while easing the manufacturing challenges of nanometer-scale
fabrication. Given the key role of information technology and emerging role of
nanotechnology in modern society, this project will have very broad impact.
Graduate and undergraduate students will directly benefit from it via hands-on
research and course lectures, and new knowledge will be disseminated widely via
presentations at international workshops and conferences, as &lt;br/&gt;well as
in archival journals. &lt;br/&gt;
