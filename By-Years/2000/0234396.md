Three-dimensional (3-D) modeling studies will be carried out aimed at an
improved understanding of the global budgets of several important atmospheric
trace gases. Specifically, the project will focus on oxygenated organics
(methanol, acetaldehyde, propanal, and acetone), methyl halides (methyl chloride
and bromide), and carbon-containing gases from combustion (hydrogen cyanide,
acetylene, ethane, and carbon monoxide). A combination of forward and inverse
modeling will be used. Forward model simulations based on best a priori
estimates of sources and sinks will be compared to both observed concentrations
and species-species correlations. Airborne data from various field programs will
be used for this purpose. Inverse analysis will be used when appropriate to
better quantify the magnitudes of individual source terms and corresponding
errors. The work on trace carbon gases will be carried out in collaboration with
Jennifer Logan (Harvard University), and will use data from a worldwide network
of IR absorption measurements and ship cruises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved
knowledge of the atmospheric budgets of the above gases will have important and
general implications for the understanding of global atmospheric chemistry and
broader problems of biogeochemical cycling. This award will provide educational
opportunities for graduate students and a post-doctoral student.
