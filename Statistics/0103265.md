Four areas in Bayesian analysis and its interfaces with frequentist statistical
reasoning will be pursued. The first is model selection, in particular the
greatly needed development of automatic Bayesian methodology for choosing
between models. Other problems in model selection that will be considered
include the question of optimal choice of a model when prediction is the goal,
and study and comparison of large sample approximations in Bayesian model
selection. The second area of research is objective Bayesian analysis, which
will culminate in the preparation of a research monograph on the subject (with
associated software for practical implementation). Included in the research that
must be performed to reach this goal is the development of objective prior
distributions for covariance matrices and the practically very important class
of hierarchical models. The third area is nonparametric Bayesian analysis,
especially involving use of wavelets. The final area of research that will be
addressed is conditional frequentist testing, and its unification with Bayesian
testing.

The advances in model selection and nonparametric Bayesian methodology will be
utilized in the study of Cepheid variable star oscillations, which are key to
establishing astronomical distances. The work on objective Bayesian inference
will impact the setting of confidence limits in physics. The development of
conditional frequentist tests will be undertaken in a variety of biostatistical
settings, especially involving clinical trials. In addition to these
interdisciplinary impacts, the research will benefit education and human
development through intensive training of graduate students and the
incorporation of the developed methodology in statistics courses at Duke
University and elsewhere.
