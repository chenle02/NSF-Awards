9414376 Havner The objectives of this research are a comprehensive assessment
of hardening theories against experimental data through investigation of their
finite-strain texture predictions in f.c.c. crystalline aggregates and
mathematical prediction and analysis of the basic experimental phenomenon of
progressive subgrain formation (including microshear bands in subgrain walls)
during plastic deformation. Achievement of these objectives would provide a
comparative assessment, previously unavailable, of hardening theories in
relation to texture formation in specific metals and an analytical basis for
continued subgrain formation and microshear- band development with increasing
deformation. This study has the potential to develop models and constitutive
equations that will enhance the understanding of large deformation processes in
metals and could lead to the development of new computational codes. Such codes
might be useful for the prediction of the results of metal forming and
manufacturing processes. ***
