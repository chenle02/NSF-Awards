Proposal: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is There Cosmogenic Radiomethane in Polar
Firn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.I.:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey P

0806450&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at the University of California - San
Diego?s Scripps Institute of Oceanography have received funding to test the
hypothesis that cosmic rays produce small amounts of the 14C isotope of methane
(14CH4) in the upper layers of snow turning in to ice (firn). This research will
help determine present and past sources of methane in the atmosphere and refine
our understanding of methane?s role in climate warming. Methane and other gases
will be extracted from firn at Summit, Greenland by melting 1.5 tons of firn
under vacuum. The ratio of 14CH4 to 12CH4 will be determined to test the
hypothesis that cosmic rays generate 14C atoms that react with hydrogen to
produce 14CH4 in the ice. The study is expected to provide a definitive test of
the hypothesis that fossil sources of methane contributed to the rapid increases
in methane concentration at the end of the last glacial period.
