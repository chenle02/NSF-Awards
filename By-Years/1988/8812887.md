This program continues the same experimental and theoretical research into
nonlinear waves and acousto-optics sponsored under previous NSF grants. The
ultimate goal of the program remains to devise heuristically understandable
formalisms of important interaction phenomena that are commonly described by
highly abstract mathematics (nonlinear waves) or by models that often bear
little relation to physical reality (acousto-optics). In the case of nonlinear
waves, the emphasis is on the mutual and self interaction of coherent and
incoherent spatial soliton entities such as pulsed and CW beams, and the
description of such interactions in terms of attraction/repulsion, coupled
modes, self focusing, frequency chirping, beam bending etc. Physical experiments
will be performed, provided they are relatively simple in terms of
instrumentation and technology. Numerical simulations will form an increasing
important part of the program. The emphasis on acousto-optics will be on the
weak and strong interaction of arbitrary sound and light fields in physically
realistic configurations. Formalisms will be in terms of mutual scattering and
rescattering of acoustical and optical plane wave spectra. Relatively short term
device research may be part of both research areas, either as a convenient route
to familiarization or simply to follow up some promising applications.
