In 1991, the university undertook a complete overhaul of its Computer Science
curriculum. The overhaul was provoked by a critical self-analysis which
concluded that contemporary curricula, including that at the university, did not
prepare students well for either industry or graduate study. Students were
training to write 300-line programs, by themselves, from scratch, in a dead
language. Obviously, this system is the antithesis of what is needed by a
contemporary computing professional both more rigor and more skill development
were sorely needed. As part of the overhaul, a new curriculum philosophy and
overview were detailed; seven new core courses were developed, incorporating a
closed-laboratory component in four of the courses. With the closed laboratory
playing such a critical role in the success of this curriculum, the laboratory
equipment must be up-to-date and reliable. In this project, support for two
types of equipment purchase is provided for the closed-laboratory activities:
new PCs for the laboratory classrooms and a new robot for software engineering
projects.
