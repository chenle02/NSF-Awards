This grant supports the National Council for Science and the Environment (now
doing business as Global Council for Science and the Environment {GCSE}) in the
delivery of the 2022 Annual Conference. The theme of the 2022 Annual Conference
is Biodiversity, Conservation Science, and Climate Change and will be held
virtually on June 21-24, 2022. The Conference will explore the complex
interactions between biodiversity and climate change, and how these complexities
factor into conservation strategies to protect global biodiversity. A main goal
of the conference is to reframe the "tipping points" dialogue to emphasize the
necessity for regenerative thinking, solution creation and action. The
conference will highlight success stories in conservation that should help guide
us toward discovering more science and evidence-based solutions to conservation
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the GCSE 2022 Annual Conference,
Biodiversity, Conservation Science, and Climate Change, encourages scientists,
decision-makers, civil society leaders and practitioners, and youth to rethink
the traditional "tipping points" narrative in order to address crucial issues
impacting biodiversity conservation and climate change. The most recent report
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it abundantly
clear that humanity is rapidly running out of time to confront the climate
crisis before global warming makes conserving global biodiversity much harderâ€”if
not impossible. The central objective of the conference, is to identify
practical ways to engage in regenerative decision spaces regarding climate
solutions that protect life on earth and ensure a sustainable and resilient
future for humanity itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
