Research aimed at development of systems approach for optimum siting, design and
coordination of power system stabilizers. The system approach is to be based
upon decomposition techniques, eigenvalue analysis and adaptive control
methodology. Research aimed at analysis techniques for better engineering design
of devices used to damp electrical oscillations.
