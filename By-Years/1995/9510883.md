This project supports a workshop of an interdisciplinary group of scholars now
studying organizational processes in high-hazard productions systems and a
collaborating group of industry experts. The workshop is structured to help
participants identify significant research questions, fertilize nascent research
directions, catalyze cross- disciplinary and academic-industry collaborations,
and contribute to a supportive infrastructure for this potential community of
scholars and practitioners. Participants will write positions papers in
preparation for the workshop and prepare reaction papers critically examining
analyses of incidents during the workshop. The organizers will prepare a
workshop summary that highlights suggestions for high- hazard organizations and
organization theory, and the nature of communication among academics and
industry participants.
