Laboratory training is a fundamental aspect of good physical anthropology
training. This award permits the purchase of needed equipment for a new physical
anthropology laboratory. The courses utilizing this equipment include,
Introduction to Anthropology, Human Origins, Human Skeleton, Health Culture and
Disease, and Physical Anthropology Laboratory. The pathology material is used in
the areas of pathological processes of bone and forensic analysis. The skeletal
material is used for identification of parts of the skeleton and the landmarks
and features of individual bones. The microscopes are used for the study of bone
histology. The anthropometric instruments are basic tools required for
anthropometry. They are used to demonstrate variability by age, sex, and
breeding population. The award will be matched by an equal amount from the
grantee.
