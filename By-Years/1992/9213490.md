This award will provide support for research using data from the 1990 Census to
be published as a two-volume 1990 Census Monograph series. One of these volumes
will examine the main social and economic changes that have occurred in the
1980s, and the other will assess the status of the many diverse groups that make
up American society. Among the major trends covered in Volume I will be changes
in family structure and the rise of female-headed families, educational
attainment and skills levels, employment and the distributions of earnings and
income. Volume II on social diversity will cover gender differences in
education, economic participation and family responsibility, differences in the
well-being of children and the elderly, racial and ethnic differences in
educational and economic achievement, and the increasing diversity of the
American population brought on by the large wave of immigration that continued
in the 1980s. The 1990 Census Monographs will provide a wealth of information
about social and economic changes during the 1980s. As its predecessors based on
earlier Census data, the 1990 Census Monographs will be extremely useful for
teachers, students, decisionmakers, and researchers.
