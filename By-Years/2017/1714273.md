Algebraic topology is the study of topological spaces via algebraic methods. The
principal investigator will study various naturally-occurring topological
objects from the perspective of algebraic geometry. A fundamental goal of the
project is to place mathematical concepts in reach of computational methods. The
investigator plans to use recent theoretical advances in algebraic geometry and
topology in order to develop calculational tools to explore a relationship
between quantum field theory and the elusive notion of elliptic object.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generalized cohomology theories are arguably the most
useful and important tool in modern algebraic topology. In addition to ordinary
cohomology, examples such as K-theory, elliptic cohomology, and complex
cobordism admit surprisingly close connections to algebraic geometry via the
theory of formal groups. While the formal groups associated to ordinary
cohomology and K-theory are additive and multiplicative, respectively, elliptic
curves carry much more complicated group structures (in fact, their relative
intractability has been exploited in real world applications such as public key
cryptography). The advantage of formal groups that arise from global geometric
objects, such as the multiplicative group or elliptic curves, is that their
corresponding cohomology theories are very highly structured. For instance,
K-theory is structurally similar to ordinary representation theory, whereas the
analogous "elliptic representation theory," while related to diverse fields such
as arithmetic geometry and mathematical physics, remains a mystery. Important
work over the past few decades has led to a construction of a universal elliptic
cohomology theory, a topological refinement of the classical theory of modular
forms. Exploiting its structure allows one to associate to a topological stack
an algebro-geometric object over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. While the
derived ring of functions on this object is technically the elliptic cohomology
of the original topological object, elliptic curves are not affine objects,
meaning that this passage from geometry to algebra loses significant
information. The more fundamental structure is that which exists on the algebro-
geometric level itself, before affinization, and one retains considerably more
conceptual and calculational control by manipulating these objects directly. An
interesting twist is that, while there is no a priori understanding of elliptic
cohomology classes (in stark contrast to K-theory, where cocycles correspond to
formal differences of vector bundles), it may be possible to gain insight into
this fundamentally important problem by interpreting calculations in several key
examples.
