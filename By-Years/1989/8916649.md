Root growth is frequently less inhibited than shoot growth in water stressed
plants. Despite the importance of this response to plant performance under
drought, the physiological mechanisms regulating the differential growth
sensitivities are not known and little studied. This proposal will examine in
detail the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in the growth responses
of maize to water stress. Preliminary results suggest that naturally-occurring
ABA maintains root growth while inhibiting shoot growth of water stressed maize
seedlings. Additionally, the PI has shown that large differences in the growth
response to water stress exist among closely related tissues within the growing
zone of the root and shoot. In the proposed work, internal levels of ABA will be
manipulated in the growing zones of roots and shoots using a mutant deficient in
ABA synthesis as well an inhibitor of ABA synthesis. High resolution techniques
will be used to determine growth rate, ABA levels and molecular indicators of
tissue response to ABA in one-millimeter sections of the growing zones. Results
will greatly assist in determining the biochemical and biophysical processes
regulated by the hormone and will set the stage for breeding strategies to
improve maize performance drought-prone environments.
