9350766 Buttles This project will furnish previously-impossible laboratory
experiences to undergraduates in biology pursuing careers in teaching, health,
research, and industry. The emphasis is on learning through student access to
instrumentation rather than by observation of teacher-executed demonstrations.
With the acquisition of modern equipment for biotechnology, students will be
able to culture living cells, isolate cellular organelles and biomolecules,
perform intricate analysis of these, and investigate the behavior of cellular
components in normal and abnormal states. Phase-contrast microscopes will permit
study of structure and function in intact, living cells. In all instances the
experiments will foster basic inquiry skills associated with the scientific
endeavor and will be models of science as it is practiced in the technological
arena. The results will be to provide future teachers with appreciation and
understanding of the interdependence of science and technology and to train the
all students in skills vital to achievement of their career goals.
