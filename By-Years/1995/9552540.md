9552540 Anderson ABSTRACT: The Cincinnati Museum of Natural history, working
with MacGillivray Freeman Films, will conduct developmental work on an
OMNIMAX/IMAX film about caves. This pilot phase will include: o Development of a
treatment for the film that takes advantage of the qualities of the IMAX medium;
maintains the high quality science which is in the preliminary draft treatment;
and adds the storyline, adventure, and interest factors needed to attract and
hold an audience. o Conduct trial filming in a cave to test the feasibility of
working in this "hostile" environment. No post production will be completed on
this short footage at this stage of the project. However, the film will
demonstrate the ability to film with the bulky IMAX equipment well into a cave,
to produce moving camera shots if they may be part of the film, and to get
sufficient lighting into the cave to shoot high quality film.
