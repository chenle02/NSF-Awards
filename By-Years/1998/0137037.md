0137037 Rossby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative effort with the
Bjerknes Center for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway to study the formation
and structure of the Iceland-Faroes Front (IFF) and its continuation into the
Norwegian Sea. This front delineates the boundary between the cold Arctic waters
north and east of Iceland and the warm waters of the NE Atlantic. It is also a
major supply route of warm saline water to the Nordic Seas. A Lagrangian study
of the inflow of warm water along the IFF into the Norwegian Sea will be
conducted using a total of 60 constant depth RAFOS floats. These will be
deployed sequentially from Icelandic and Faroese research vessels at the
southern entrance to the Iceland-Faroe ridge to determine from where the warm
waters come, and continue their transit north across the ridge and beyond into
the Norwegian Sea via the IFF. The Norwegian partners will study the spreading
of the Arctic Intermediate Waters, an expanding water mass that appears to be
displacing the Norwegian Deep Waters that overflow into the northeast Atlantic.
The observations will be used together for detailed studies and syntheses of the
circulation, and they will also be immensely valuable for the many modeling
studies of the Nordic Seas circulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
