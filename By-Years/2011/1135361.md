This award supports a one-and-a-half day early-career symposium focused on
helping participants develop personal technology research agendas, to be held at
the Annual Meeting of the Association for Education Communications and
Technology (AECT). The organizing committee has selected three members of the
learning sciences community to mentor advanced graduate students and pre-tenure
faculty from this community, to help them focus on taking a theory-based
approach to designing potentially-high-impact learning technologies.

The goals of this early-career workshop are (i) mentoring of advanced doctoral
students into the social/professional network as partners in idea-making, (ii)
supporting advanced doctoral students and early career faculty in developing
viable technology-oriented research agendas, (iii) providing specific feedback
and guidance to advanced doctoral students and early career faculty about their
research agendas, and (iv) further developing a community of researchers
interested in ways technology can transform teaching and learning.
