The structural properties of a range of materials, including quasicrystals,
fullerenes, and high-temperature superconductors will be investigated by x-ray
and neutron diffraction experiments. The project will also include computer
modelling and simulation of diffraction work, as well as theoretical
collaborations in support of the project. The quasicrystal work will focus on
alloys and will provide data on the nature of defects and disorder, including
fluctuations in the tiling patterns invoked to interpret these materials.
Dynamic structural properties of fullerenes will be investigated. A further
project involves structural investigations using gazing angle x-ray scattering
to investigate phase transitions in metallic alloys which are initiated at the
surface. Such transformations include martensitic phase transitions among
others.
