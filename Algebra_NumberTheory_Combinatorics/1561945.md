The central questions in this project concern how events are distributed in
diverse systems, such as energy levels of heavy nuclei, leading digits in sets
of data, and the prime numbers among the integers. Similar to the central limit
theorem in probability and statistics, there seem to be universal spacing laws
that govern these and other phenomena; thus studies in one of these topics can
frequently provide useful insights in the others. Understanding these systems
requires the development of tools and techniques in complex analysis, Fourier
analysis, number theory, and probability. Some of the topics have immediate
practical applications; for example, the Internal Revenue Service uses Benford's
law to locate corporate tax fraud. Many of questions under study in this project
have components that are amenable to numerical experimentation; these and
tractable special cases will be investigated with undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral research assistants. The investigator will also continue work in
mathematics education. In addition to providing professional development
opportunities to students (such as arranging for them to referee for journals,
contribute to Mathematical Reviews, write expository articles for journals, and
co-organize special sessions at professional society meetings), the investigator
will involve students in expanding the Math Riddles web page
(mathriddles.williams.edu), a site that is used in junior high and high schools
around the world to excite students about mathematics.

This research project studies a variety of problems on L-functions, additive
number theory, and Benford's law. A central theme is an analysis of gaps between
events. The main topic concerns zeros of L-functions; connections have been
observed between these and high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory
(RMT). Among the questions under study are: n-level densities (main and lower
order terms) for zeros of L-functions, alternatives to the Katz-Sarnak
determinantal expansions that are more amenable for comparisons between number
theory and RMT, determining the optimal test functions to bound excess rank,
biases in second moments of Fourier coefficients of L-functions, modeling zeros
near the central point through excised RMT ensembles, large gaps between zeros
of L-functions, the density of states and behavior of the eigenvalues of
structured random matrix ensembles, generalized Zeckendorf decompositions and
the gaps between summands, generalized sum and difference sets, Ramsey theory
for sets avoiding 3-term geometric progressions in finite fields and non-
commutative settings, and Benford's law in fragmentation problems and fraud
detection.
