This investigation is an on-going study of processes at a glacier bed. The
objectives are to study time and space variations in the coupling between the
glacier and its bed, to develop a relation between water pressure variations and
sliding velocity, and to study the nature and evolution of internal drainage
within glacier. The field part of the study will be conducted on Storglaciaren
in northern Sweden, which is readily accessible from the University of
Stockholm's tarfala Resedarch Station. Weekly and, in some cases, daily
measurements of stake movements will be made, combined with measurements of
water pressure variations and internal deformation in holes bored to the base of
the glacier. Continuous measurements of strain and tilt, studies of internal
drainage with the use of dye tracers, and monitoring of surface ablation and
water and sediments discharge at the ternimous will also be carried out.
Understanding of basal processes and, in particular, the effects of subglacial
water pressure is critical in the effort to understand basal sliding.
