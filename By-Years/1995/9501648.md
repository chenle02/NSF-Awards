9501646 Gedra The objectives of the research are to include the effects of
various typed of system security into power system pricing. Another objective of
the research is to evaluate a particular transmission pricing methodology which
has been proposed recently. These are very important issues in the wake of the
1992 National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) which, among other things, deregulates
generation and requires open access to the transmission. The utility industry
will become increasingly competitive as a result of the Act, and systems are
expected to be increasingly stressed. Some fear that, in a competitive
environment, system security will be neglected. It is important to include
security in the pricing of electricity to encourage security resources to be
availa`le at the right location when they are needed to encourage users to
facilitate rather than hinder system security. At the same time, proper security
pricing will help to prevent unneeded or inefficient expenditures to increase
security, thus jeopardizing a utility's competitive position. Proper
transmission pricing is also essential to the efficient functioning of the newly
competitive market in generation. ***
