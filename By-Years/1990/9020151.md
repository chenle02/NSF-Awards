This action is to support research at an undergraduate institution which
concentrates on learning and memory at the cellular level. The hippocampus is a
part of the brain which is known for its involvement in learning and memory. The
studies proposed by Dr. Julio Ramirez will evaluate the behavioral significance
of sprouting in the intricate layers of the hippocampus after cortical lesions.
Two criteria will be used to assess whether the sprouting is behaviorally
meaningful: 1) The time course of the reinnervation must parallel the time
course of the behavioral recovery; and 2) Systematic manipulation of the
sprouted fibers must produce a concomitant change in behavior. Because of the
employment of anatomical and behavioral techniques this project will provide
fundamental knowledge about the functional significance of sprouting in the
central nervous system.
