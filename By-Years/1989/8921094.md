This project will continue research on the variations of the Earth's magnetic
field in high latitudes in both hemispheres. Magnetometers are located at South
Pole; McMurdo; Iqaluit, NWT, Canada, and Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, with most
of the research activity focussing on the magnetically conjugate sites of
Iqaluit and South Pole. Specific subjects to be studied include the coupling of
the interplanetary medium into the magnetospheric cusp regions and the causes
and propagation of low frequency hydromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere. A new
magnetometer and data collection instrumentation will be installed at Iqaluit.
This project is jointly supported by NSF and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. The
grantee institution, New York City Technical College, is an undergraduate
institution and consequently the NSF funding is jointly provided by the Research
at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program and the Division of Polar Programs.
