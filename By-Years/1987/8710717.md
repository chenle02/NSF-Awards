The objective of this project is to investigate fluid inclusions in high
temperature veins of hydrothermal origin in oceanic rocks. Samples recovered by
dredging from the mid- Atlantic Ridge and the western Pacific will be examined
and classified using standard heating/freezing techniques. Data will be used to
infer the temperatures, fluid compositions, and the pressures within the ancient
hydrothermal systems. These results will be combined with petrography and
mineral chemical analysis to determine the sample histories from the primary
igneous stage through metamorphism/metasomatism and hydrothermal veining. The
project is unique because the fluid inclusion technique provides a method of
"sampling" deep hydrothermal fluids in sub-crustal oceanic systems. The research
to be performed under this award will be done in an undergraduate institution.
