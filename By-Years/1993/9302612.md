ABAG recently developed estimates of uninhabitable dwellings in future
earthquakes affecting the San Francisco Bay Area. George Washington University
used these estimates in developing projections of shelter populations in future
earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area. This project expands these efforts by
more systematically examining data on the residential structures tagged by local
government building officials as unsafe (red) or limited access (yellow)
following the Loma Prieta earthquake in accordance with the ATC20-California
Office of Emergency Services procedures for postearthquake safety evaluation of
buildings. The data on daily occupancy load of Red Cross shelters following that
earthquake also are examined. The project has five principal objectives: (1)
develop models of housing habitability based on intensity, distance from fault
source, and underlying geologic materials for the San Francisco Bay Area; (2)
model how shelter populations are related to structural damage, including data
on buildings that are redtagged as uninhabitable, as well as yellow-tagged as
damaged based on actual Loma Prieta data; (3) assess the demographic
characteristics of the shelter population versus the overall impacted population
through use of the 1990 Census (conducted only five months after the earthquake)
and Red Cross data from the Loma Prieta event; (4) relate the recovery time of
the impacted housing stock to the structural type of those buildings for Loma
Prieta; and (5) apply these lessons to future Bay Area earthquakes. The goal of
the project is to improve the nation's emergency planning, disaster response and
residential rebuilding efforts in future earthquakes.
