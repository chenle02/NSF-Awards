9312858 Rosakis This work studies the micromechanics of dynamic twin growth and
the evolution of phase boundaries in crystalline alloys of engineering
importance. The study of twinning is a prerequisite to the understanding of
martensitic transformations and of the shape- memory effect. The general method
of approach is base don the modern theory of nonlinear elastodynamics of
materials that change phase. An important ingredient will be the choice of a
constitutive law, namely a strain energy function which has many local minima
(potential wells) as a function of strain and exhibits and appropriate type of
anisotropy. A class of dynamic problems involving rapid propagation of twinned
zones into untwinned crystals will be formulated and analyzed. ***
