The project is for a continuation of research focused on the theoretical
understanding of current sheets and the particle signatures resulting from
kinetic processes in the magnetotail. The project will extend these
investigations to the examination of more realistic configurations by using less
idealized particle and field models as well as the examination of the two
dimensional and time dependence aspects of these models and of neutral line
signatures. The particular focus of effort will be to examine four areas in
which particle kinetics may have a profound role as either a driver or
diagnostic of magnetospheric behavior.
