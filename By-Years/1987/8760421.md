Graphite composites have many attractive mechanical and thermal properties,
these properties degrade substantially with oxidation. A novel graphite fiber
has been developed which has superior properties for tensile strength and
modulus. This research will measure the oxidation properties of this materials
as a function of temperature in several preparations designed to enhance the
oxidation resistance of the fiber.
