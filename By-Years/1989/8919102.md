Despite two decades of affirmative action, Blacks have made little progress in
gaining proportional representation in science professions. The percent
representation is typically less than two percent. And in the marine, ocean,
aquatic, environmental and fisheries sciences, it is much less. Historically
Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCUs) have played a key role in providing
qualified minority graduates for entry into science careers. A program will be
initiated at Savannah State College, and HMCU, to increase the participation of
undergraduate minorities in marine sciences by offering student support,
instructional opportunities, research exposure and laboratory/field trips to
other marine research institutes and laboratories.
