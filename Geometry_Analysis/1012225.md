This international symposium will bring together leading mathematicians to
discuss the latest work and developments in geometry, topology and related
&#64257;elds. The distinguished invited speakers at this conference will speak
about the current edge of our knowledge and highlight the areas that are likely
to lead to future progress. The conference makes it possible for the community
of geometers and topologists from the region and around the country to learn the
most recent developments, to meet with each other and to share mathematics.
Since the topics cover a wide range from geometry, topology, algebra, and
mathematical physics, we expect a great deal of interchange of ideas during the
symposium.

The symposium will provide a rich environment in which US graduate students and
recent Ph.D.?s can learn about new and important developments in geometry and
topology. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and
encouraged. An important component of the conference is to attract and help
graduate students, recent Ph.Ds, and members of underrepresented groups to come
from all over the country and other parts of the world to learn and interact
with the leaders of the &#64257;elds featured during this conference. A special
poster session will be held to allow participants, especially young
mathematicians, to present their work and to interact with senior researchers.
