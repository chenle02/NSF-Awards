0119382&lt;br/&gt;Tung&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop new
tools that will ultimately allow in vivo sensing of multiple protease activity.
The project will focus on specific proteases prominently involved in
angiogenesis, cancerogenesis, metastasis and which are being pursued as
therapeutic drug targets, i.e., cathepsin B, cathepsin D and matrix
metalloproteinase. This newly developed technology may be applied to tumor
detection, localization, metastatic characterization and evaluation of anti-
tumor therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
