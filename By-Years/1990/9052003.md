This project establishes an undergraduate laboratory for large- scale
programming that permits the instruction of students in the necessary
disciplines for team development of today's larger software systems. The
laboratory is based on state-of-the-art Solbourne and Sun Workstations using the
CADRE "Teamwork" CASE environment. Computer Science majors use the laboratory
for the courses Software Engineering I, Software Engineering II, Systems
Project, and Unix and C Programming. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
