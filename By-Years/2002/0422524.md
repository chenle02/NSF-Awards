Students at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) are usually
self-supported, with approximately 43% of Engineering and Applied Science
freshmen and 70% of seniors working during the academic year. This significantly
increases their time to graduation. Because UCCS has few scholarships available,
students work longer hours than those on many other campuses. UCCS also serves a
sizeable under-represented minority (12.7%, not including Asians) and rural
population. These students often have lower family incomes and need to work to
pay for their education. To enhance enrollment, retention and graduation rates,
and to increase the quality of students, this project will award 40 scholarships
at $2,500 each. The scholarships enable the recipients to pursue studies full-
time, enhance their educational experience, and enter the workforce in CSEM
fields. The scholarships are awarded to freshmen, sophomores, juniors and
seniors, after a rigorous selection process. The students are selected based on
two sets of criteria: academic and professional. Academic criteria include high
GPA, strong letters of reference, and a well-thought out written plan of study.
Professional criteria include participation in mentoring or other service
activities, student organizations, leadership roles, career goals, and
interviews. Awardees are monitored carefully and meet every month with their
assigned mentor and other faculty.
