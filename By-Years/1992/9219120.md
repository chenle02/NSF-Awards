The purpose of this project is to study and document the progression and fire
behavior, from inception to containment, of the now called "Tunnel" Fire that
occurred in the Oakland Hills in late 1991. It will involve basic combustion and
heat transfer fundamentals, vegetational and structural analysis, and a concise
overview incorporating all existing records. The issues to be addressed are
concerned with: a) the response of domestic and wildland vegetation to weather
and climate such as drought and wind, b) the heat transfer processes occurring
during the fire, and c) the interaction of structural and vegetational fuels in
fire. The results of the research will be useful in evaluating the hazards in
the urban/wildland interface, the effects on these areas, vis a vis the fire
risk, of extreme climatic and weather events, and the potential effectiveness of
mitigation measures being proposed.
