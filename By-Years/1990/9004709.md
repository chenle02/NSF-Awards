The project will utilize the loss estimation procedures developed in a previous
work in which a Damage Assessment Handbook was also generated. These methodology
will be applied to estimate the damages produced by two consecutive natural
disasters occurred some months ago, Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta
earthquake. These two events of a quite different physical nature, will be the
test cases providing a unique opportunity for determining the extent and
magnitude of economic dislocations and direct losses produced by each of them.
The comparison between these two cases will also validate the effectiveness of
the new damage assessment procedure as applied to any natural hazard. Five
issues will be addressed: a) what procedures did agencies follow to estimate
direct damages, and what is the quality of the data used; b) using the Damage
Assessment Handbook, what were the direct damages and how sizeable were the
economic dislocations; c) what were the measures taken to soften the impact of
the economic dislocations; d) what was the impact on historical sites and
cultural patrimony; and e) what accounting stance (local, state or national) was
used. The results of this work will benefit the research community, post-audit
process, the insurance and construction industries, the agencies, planners and
administrators.
