Clemente (University of Nebraska), and C. Nathan Hancock (University of South
Carolina - Aiken)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soybeans provide the single greatest
source of vegetable protein and oil worldwide, and uses of this important crop
now range from human food to alternatives for petroleum-derived chemicals. The
goal of this project is to create molecular tools to make it easy for
geneticists and breeders to identify and study the function of genes associated
with desirable agronomic traits. The project will provide laboratory and field
research opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students,
including students from a predominantly undergraduate institution. In addition,
yearly workshops will bring together soybean researchers from across the nation
to participate in hands-on training in precision genomics and in screening plant
populations to identify new traits of interest. The resources developed by this
project will advance soybean improvement, which in turn can lead to designer
oils and proteins for healthier diets, industrial compounds, and biodiesel to
meet a growing global demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will add to the
current set of forward and reverse genetics resources available to the plant
research community. A key activity will be to develop and characterize the
publicly available soybean fast neutron (FN) mutagenesis population with a goal
of attaining a biologically relevant amount of genomic coverage. Concurrently,
individual genes within FN deleted regions that alter traits of importance to
the soybean community (e.g., yield, oil, protein, stress tolerance, and nitrogen
fixation) will be mutated using CRISPER/Cas9 technology to pinpoint the genes
responsible for specific phenotypes. In addition, a set of complementary,
transposon-based mutagenesis populations will be made to specifically tailor
gene discovery for the highly duplicated genome of soybean. TheTnt1 insertional
mutagenesis population will result in traditional loss-of-function phenotypes,
the Ac/Ds activation tagging population will cause gene mis-expression, and the
mPing transposon will be used for both gene silencing and overexpression. These
strategies are expected to result in recovery of novel phenotypes not previously
observed in soybean. Data, phenotypes, seeds and other information will be
available via the project website at http://soymutants.uga.edu and at
SoyBase.org.
