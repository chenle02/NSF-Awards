TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The organizers propose an
interdisciplinary graduate student oriented two half-day symposium at the March
2014 meeting of the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry and the ACS younger
Chemists Committee. The symposium is intended to provide recognition of
outstanding graduate students engaged in polymer research, to foster fundamental
scientific exchange, networking, and to help develop the careers of future
leaders in polymer science and engineering. University departments in the US and
Canada were invited to submit nominations for one outstanding graduate student
each to speak on his/her's original research at this special symposium. Research
presentations selected by the organizing committee will cover interdisciplinary
topics in polymer science and engineering, encompassing novel synthetic
strategies, structure/property evaluations and performance in rapidly emerging
technologies.
