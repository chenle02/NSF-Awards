The Bayesian Method of Moments (BMOM) approach to statistical and econometric
estimation, prediction, and model formulation allows to the researcher to obtain
parameter estimates without the distributional assumptions required for
traditional Bayesian analysis. The objectives of this research project are (1)
to develop further and provide additional applications of the BMOM approach; (2)
to compare BMOM and traditional Bayesian and non-Bayesian inference techniques
and develop procedures for choosing between and/or combing BMOM and traditional
Bayesian results; and (3) to utilize BMOMs and other procedures in applied model
formulation and forecasting applications involving multivariate dynamic
statistical and econometric models useful in gaining understanding of past
experience and in point and turning point forecasting. Applications will involve
modeling and forecasting output growth rates for 18 or more industrialized
economies and analyses of U.S. regional petroleum markets. Past experience has
indicated and it is anticipated that new experience with the BMOM approach will
indicate that it is operational, simpler than previous approaches, and yields
very satisfactory results.
