In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education EAGER project, the PI proposes a
research program and set of events for educators, policy makers, students,
designers, researchers, and makers to present, discuss, investigate, and learn
about digital fabrication in education. Digital fabrication and "making" is a
new chapter in the process of bringing powerful ideas and expressive media to
schoolchildren. Yet the making that happens in classrooms is usually
disconnected from what is known about promoting learning from such making. The
PI is organizing a series of activities aimed at better understanding what is
needed so that teachers will be better able to use making activities to promote
learning and what research and development needs to be done to meet those needs.
Activities include (1) a conference as a venue for stakeholders (including
educators, students, researchers, and others) to present, discuss, and learn
about digital fabrication, the culture around it, and what is known about
learning from making; (2) a summer institute that would help teachers deepen
their fabrication skills and learn more about learning and assessment; (3) a
research summit to share findings, receive feedback, and develop collaborations;
and (4) a fellow program to support teachers in activity planning and curriculum
development. Throughout, the PI and team will be taking notes and convening
discussions with an eye toward formulating a research agenda around promoting
learning in classrooms in the context of design and fabrication activities.
