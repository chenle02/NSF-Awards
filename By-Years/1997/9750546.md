An important goal in any advanced physics laboratory is for students, with
minimal supervision, to design and implement an experimental scheme to study a
physical phenomenon. This project concerns a teaching strategy for the advanced
laboratory that systematically develops experimental design skills. A unique
feature of this course is the requirement of students to write at least a small
section of LabVIEW code for each laboratory experience directly pertaining to
data acquisition or system control. Since LabVIEW is icon oriented, students are
able to progress from simple experimental design tasks to more complicated ones
fairly quickly. The department is purchasing computers, data acquisition and
GPIB interface boards, and LabVIEW software. This project is enhancing the
advanced laboratory course, which is significantly improving the experimental
skills of physics majors.
