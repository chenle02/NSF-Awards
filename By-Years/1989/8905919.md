This award provides for purchase of a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC).
The instrument permits both quantitative and qualitative analysis of physical or
reactive properties of materials as functions of temperature and time. It will
be used to provide information to characterize polymers, organic and inorganic
chemicals, metals, glass, and ceramics. The instrument will be used in eight
separate ongoing projects: (1) Thermal analysis of microemulsions and other
surfactant systems, (2) Characterization of novel polymeric materials obtained
from microemulsions, (3) thermal analysis of mineral reinforced polymer
composites, (4) studies of the structure and critical behavior of macromolecular
systems, (5) fundamental studies of colloidal processing of superconductors, (6)
correlation of structure with physical properties for amorphous alloys, (7)
colloidal engineering for improved ceramic processing, and (8) interfacial
modification for quality enhancement in dispersive mixing.
