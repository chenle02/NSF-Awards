9316282 Mosley-Thompson This award is for support of a project to conduct
analyses of the concentrations and size distributions of the insoluble
particulates preserved in the Taylor Dome ice core from East Antarctica. A
combination of high and low resolution sampling is proposed to look at annual to
decadal-scale and century-scale variations. These analyses represent one
component of a larger collaborative effort to compile a long (glacial/inter-
glacial), multi-parameter paleo- environmental history for the Taylor Dome area.
The record of dust concentrations within the ice core, in conjunction with the
other proxy records to be extracted, will contribute to a comprehensive view of
the atmospheric and glaciologic conditions in this region. ***
