The purpose of this project is to understand the selective pressures that drove
the evolution of cellular differentiation in the colonial volvocine algae
(Volvox and its close relatives). Some species of volvocine algae have two cell
types: germ cells specialized for reproduction and sterile somatic cells
specialized for motility. Trends among species suggest that this differentiation
may have evolved in response to the increasing cost of reproduction in large
colonies. To test this hypothesis, costs of reproduction will be measured in a
colonial volvocine alga, Pleodorina starrii, artificially selected for large and
small size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of sterile somatic cells was a
critical step in the origin of multicellular organisms, allowing further
differentiation into many cell types and the development of complex body plans.
The increase in complexity allowed by the development of different functional
cell types facilitated the dramatic radiations of large multicellular organisms
such as plants and animals. The volvocine algae are a model system for the
evolution of multicellularity; understanding the origins of cellular
differentiation in this group can shed light on how such differentiation
originated in other groups. Furthermore, because somatic cells sacrifice their
own reproduction to benefit the colony, understanding the evolution of soma has
implications for the evolution of altruism and cooperation in
general.&lt;br/&gt;
