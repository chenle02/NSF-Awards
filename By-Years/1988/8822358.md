This proposal develops a new approach to the study of strategic decision making
among firms over time. Decisions made by firms with respect to repositioning
themselves vis.a.vis other firms are important in understanding the behavior of
organizations but, to date, have been studied very little in terms of a dynamic
process that is induced by stress but made difficult for reasons of
organizational inertia. This proposal will develop a dynamic model of the
strategic decision.making process typically employed by firms, focusing not on
any single dimension of the search process (e.g., the spatial aspects of search
behavior) but on a broad set of concerns that include organizational, cognitive,
and political factors. The project is believed likely to make a contribution to
the study of organizational behavior and includes an empirical analysis,
involving a longitudinal study of strategic mobility decisions within two
industrial sectors, that is considered to be both appropriate and original. The
study will furthermore compare the empirical model to an existing data base,
developed from a study of the pharmaceutical industry, and to alternative models
of strategic change. The principal investigators on the project are highly
qualified and well able to explore both the theoretical and applied lessons of
the project.
