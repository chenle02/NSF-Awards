The physical oceanography of coastal regions is a major research issue for the
near future. This project will convene a workshop in Mississippi immediately
after the American Geophysical Union/ American Society of Limnology &amp;
Oceanography joint national meeting. The workshop will consider the scientific
input from a large and representative group of ocean scientists, formulate a
long range plan, and select a representative steering group. A final outcome
will be a published document discussing the results.
