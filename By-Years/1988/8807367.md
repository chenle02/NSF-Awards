The objective of this proposed research is to investigate the deposition of
superconducting and ferroelectric thin films via computer controlled dual ion
beam sputter deposition. This new and evolving technology should allow
deposition of high quality, multi-component oxide (not limited to oxides) films
with carefully controlled stoichiometries, with homogeneous or
modulated/superlattice structures, and under conditions (e.g., low temperatures)
compatible with integrated device processing. Detailed characterization of the
structure, chemistry, and electrical properties of the films will be done.
