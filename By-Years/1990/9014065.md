The state-of the-art control system design methodology for complex nonlinear
systems is best described as a "black art". The traditional approach (gain
scheduling) is an arduous, multi-step process: multiple linear controllers are
employed in an ad hoc fashion requiring substantial manual adjustment. Although
an extensive and well-developed theory exists for linear systems, a similarly
effective theory for nonlinear control system design remains elusive. A further
difficulty arises after the control system has been designed. Because the
physical models used during the design process rarely accurately reflect the
actual plant dynamics, extensive on-line manual tuning of the nominal control
system is required to ultimately achieve satisfactory performance. Artificial
neural networks (ANNs) offer unique capabilities that may be exploited to
overcome the limitations of conventional nonlinear control system design
methods; namely, the inability to accommodate spatial nonlinearities and adapt
to time- varying dynamics. The potential benefits of practical neurocontrol
systems apply to a wide assortment of complex nonlinear systems and processes;
these include atmospheric and underwater vehicles, manufacturing processes, and
robotic systems. For such applications, a neurocontrol system might be used
advantageously to synthesize the required nonlinear feedback control law
automatically, objectively, and near-optimally (given the appropriate
reinforcement). To fully realize the potential benefits of this approach, new
conceptual and empirical tools for designing and analyzing ANNs for feedback
control will have to be developed. The main objective of this project is to
develop the techniques, algorithms, and theory required to implement ANNs for
the control of complex multi- input/multi-output systems having spatial
nonlinearities and time- varying dynamics. An important underlying is to develop
a sound theoretical framework that may be used to refine, formalize, and extend
research results in this area.
