The close relationship between the admissibility of an estimator and its
Bayesness with respect to some (possibly improper) prior distribution will be
studied in the finite population sampling situation. A Bayesian interpretation
of classical procedures such as the maximum likelihood estimator will be
provided for samples from finite populations. The stepwise Bayes technique will
be used to provide a noninformative Bayesian justification for procedures in
finite population sampling which reflect the statistician's prior beliefs that
members of the population which are close together are more alike than those
which are far apart.
