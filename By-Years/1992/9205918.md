Bacteria contain numerous genes and complex regulatory systems that are
necessary for survival in nature, but are not required for growth under
controlled conditions in a bioreactor. The inherent complexity of bacteria makes
bioprocess development unpredictable and modeling of bacterial growth and
metabolism difficult. The goal of this project is to reduce the complexity of
Escherichia coli, the best understood bacterium and one of industrial
importance. This will be carried out by selective deletions of the genome of the
bacterium. Successful deletions will be those that allow normal growth on a
defined medium.
