A partnership of the University of South Carolina, the South Carolina
Geological Survey, the Mining Association of South Carolina, and the South
Carolina Earth Science Teachers Association will: 1. Mobilize, develop, and
disseminate those resources available in South Carolina which will strengthen
the teaching of earth science at all levels; 2. Develop a cadre of fifteen
geographically distributed Earth Science Teacher Resource Agents capable of
distributing these and other resources to their peers; 3. Implement a peer
education and support system utilizing the Earth Science Teacher Resource
Agents. This program will respond to three broad needs which have been
identified among the state's earth science teachers: 1. South Carolina mandates
that earth science be taught in the eighth grade, and the state has established
earth science as one of three broad areas of science which will be tested as a
"basic skill"; 2. South Carolina's earth science teachers are under-prepared
with respect to knowledge of content, teaching strategies based on "inquiry",
and recent advances in science education; 3. There exists no mechanism to
mobilize and disseminate human and material resources for the earth science
classroom, or to identify and develop such resources where they are needed. Cost
sharing by the partners will total 73% of the National Science Foundation
funding.
