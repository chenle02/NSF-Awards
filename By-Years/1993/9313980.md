Saccocia 9313980 The PIs will study oxygen-siotopic and D/H fractionation in
serpentine, talc, and brucite from mid ocean ridge environments, ophiolites and
alpine peridotites. The results will provide much needed foundation of
experimental data to apply stable isotopes in interpreting alteration history of
ultramafic rocks. The new data will also lead to an understanding of the
mineral-mineral and mineral-water geothermometers. It would also lead to an
understanding of the depth of circulation of hydrothermal fluids and impact of
serpentinization on tectonic evolution of mid-ocean ridges.
