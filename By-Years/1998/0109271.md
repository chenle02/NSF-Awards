This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop thin
film (less than 50 microns) crystalline silicon (Si) photovoltaic (PV) cells. At
present, Si wafers account for approximately 50 per cent of the completed PV
module cost. Weak near-infrared absorption requires 250-micron thick Si films to
absorb available optical radiation. Preliminary calculations indicate that
appropriately designed subwavelength structures can achieve comparable
absorption in films 20-50 microns thick. These subwavelength structures can now
be fabricated using recent advances in Si reactive ion etching (DRIE)
technology. Preliminary tests with DRIE techniques have demonstrated aspect
ratios (depth to linewidth) greater than 30 for grating periods less than 1
micron. Phases I will explore a technique of microstructured thin films lift-off
from a conventional Si substrate. The lift-off film is bonded to a low-cost
substrate for subsequent solar cell processing. Original wafers are re-used
following a simple planarization step. Several lift-off steps from the same Si
wafer will offset added processing costs and permit savings in Si material
costs.

The underlying technology is expected to find applications in homo- and hetero-
epitaxial growth on nanostructured Si substrates. Commercial applications are
anticipated in this new approach to thin film Si solar cell technology.
