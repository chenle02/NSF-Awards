9408322 Godschalk This study will analyze the hazard mitigation efforts carried
out under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act since its
passage in 1988 for three major types of recurrent natural disasters:
earthquakes, hurricanes and coastal storms, and floods. To provide a systematic
understanding of the practice and potential of mitigation, the study will carry
out several tasks. It will assess the content of the mitigation plans required
by the act, the mitigation grant program expenditures, and the outcomes of
implementing these plans and programs. It will also describe and analyze the
planning and decision making processes that created the mitigation plans for a
selected set of disasters. ***
