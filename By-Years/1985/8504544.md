This work is aimed at an automated arc welding system, i.e., a system that will
automatically track a seam in both two- and three-dimensions, and will
compensate for misalignments of the parts to be joined. The system is based on
voltage sensing through the arc, and use of a triangular array of three
electrodes rather than one. A substantial increase in inches welded per hour
should result. Several control algorithms will be evaluated by computer
simulation.
