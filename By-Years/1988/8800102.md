This award, supported under the U.S.-Japan Program of Cooperation in
Photoconversion and Photosynthesis, will enable collaborative research between
Dr. Judith Croxdale of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Kenji Omasa of the
Japanese National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan. During
this research the investigators will study the sequence and timing of component
assemblage as photosynthesis develops in light-grown leaves. Using non-
destructive methods, reactions of the photosynthetic system will be evaluated by
the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence transients, and stomatal opening
will be assessed by infrared thermography. These measurements will be made using
recently developed equipment that is interfaced with a digitial imaging system
which provides in situ determinations. Dr. Omasa has developed the new
instrumentation at his laboratory at the National Institute for Environmental
Studies of the Japan Environment Agency. Dr. Croxdale will provide the
experimental leaf material and the data on structural and biochemical
differentiation of light-grown leaves.
