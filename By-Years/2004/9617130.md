This project connects Butler County Community College's And over campus to the
Internet over a T1 line. Faculty and students at the school benefit from access
to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In
addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other
institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides
partial support of the project for one year.
