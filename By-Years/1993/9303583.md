9303583 Scheuermann This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. Large arrays of small disks provide an attractive approach for high
performance systems since they allow for low-cost, reliable storage and can
achieve higher throughput compared to large disks. This project proposes to
develop an integrated set of algorithms and an intelligent file manager which is
applicable to any multi-disk architecture in which the operating system can
access the disks independently. The emphasis of the approach is on the use of
modular building blocks for file partitioning, allocation, load balancing, and
reorganization that can be invoked independently of each other. Thus, the
procedure for load balancing can be called regardless of whether striping or
declustering is employed and does not depend upon the unit of declustering. The
development of a generalized method for load balancing is considered which can
be applied to an environment where some files exhibit periodical access patterns
and which considers explicitly the cost of performing the cooling actions. The
investigation also focuses on reorganization procedures that perform restriping
when higher performance standards need to be enforced. The anticipated results
of this project are of importance to massively parallel computers to support
scalability and to ensure that the I/O is not the limiting factor in achieving
high speedup. ***
