This award provides funding for a new Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI)
project focused on acquisition of a LiDAR scanner, a GPS unit, and an
omnidirectional video camera to collect indoor and outdoor 3D positional data
and imagery at George Mason University (GMU). Several research and educational
opportunities will be enabled by the requested infrastructure. The intellectual
merit of this project revolves around enabling research on several CISE research
fields at GMU, including three-dimensional (3D) mapping for robotic navigation
and manipulation, semantic parsing, motion planning and visibility-based
tracking under significant environmental uncertainties. The equipment also
provides data sources for studying and evaluating important geometric algorithms
under significant sensor uncertainties including data compression, scene
segmentation, and object recognition.

The broader impacts of this project, beyond enabling research in robotic
navigation and manipulation, include support for research in other disciplines,
and education. The new infrastructure will also enable multidisciplinary
research teams at GMU to conduct research on important problems in homeland
security, home and factory automation, disaster recovery, and environmental and
infrastructure monitoring; and lead to enhanced research collaboration with
other institutions. Research results, collected and processed geometric data,
and software developed using this instrumentation will be made available to the
wider research community. With strong institution support from GMU, the
acquisition has sustainable management and maintenance plans to support STEM
programs for underserved communities at GMU, activities in undergraduate and
graduate courses and independent studies in robotics, computer vision, geometric
computing, computer game design and GIS, and will help spawn student learning
and interest in these cutting-edge technology areas.
