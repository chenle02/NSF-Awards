Pillay intends to investigate (1) The spectrum problem for uncountable theories,
in particular, for uncountable unidimensional theories, (2) some problems in
"applied" stability theory, specifically, Zilber's conjecture for algebraically
closed fields, the construction of new strongly minimal groups, and superstable
differential fields, (3) groups definable over o-minimal structures. These
problems all belong to a branch of the foundation of mathematics known as "model
theory", which treats such issues as the consistency of axiom systems (the
existence of models) and categoricity (the uniqueness of models).
