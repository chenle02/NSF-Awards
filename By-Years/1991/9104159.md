As a leaf develops it is converted from a net user of carbohydrate to a net
exporter. This event influences patterns of growth and productivity. The
transfer of sugars form leaf to phloem is called phloem loading. The accepted
model for this process is that surcose is transferred across cell membranes by
selective carriers. An alternative mechanism is proposed in which sucrose passes
from cell to cell to the phloem through plasmodesmata, tiny protoplasmic
connections that provide cytoplasmic continuity between cells. In the phloem,
the smaller sucrose molecules are converted to larger sugar molecule that cannot
pass back through the plasmodesmata. The sugar is thus trapped in the phloem
cells. The morphology and dimensions of plasmodesmata will be studied along with
the enzymes involved in converting sucrose into larger sugars.//
