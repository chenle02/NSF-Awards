A cone and plate rheometer will be utilized in an experimental determination of
shear viscosity, and the two normal stress differences, for various liquid
crystal polymers (LPC). Through the capability to measure the internal pressure
profile in the rheometer, it will be possible to determine the degree of
homogeneity of the oriented liquid crystals throughout the strained liquid
volume during the experiments. The measurements will test the ability of
currently used methods for determining the rheological characteristics of LPC
materials, since these are based on assumed homogeneity. The existence and
extent of a homogeneous state during LCP processing is currently controversial,
and resolution of this issue is important in establishing reliable means for
characterizing such materials.
