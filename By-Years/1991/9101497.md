This is a study of the oxidation and reduction chemistry of the trace elements
Co and Ce in the upper marine water column to evaluate the role redox processes
play in their geochemistries. Existing data suggest that both elements have
similar upper water column distributions and undergo similar redox
transformations analogous to Mn in seawater. Particularly, all three elements
frequently exhibit surface concentration maxima. For Mn this has been partially
attributed to a dynamic photochemical/microbial redox cycle, although the
relative importance of redox and non-redox processes are not known. Measurements
of redox and adsorption kinetics made at ambient levels in the field will be
incorporated into an upper ocean scavenging model for these elements and
compared with actual distributions to evaluate the importance of the redox
reactions. Non-redox processes for Ce will be constrained by following its non-
redox reactive neighbor lanthanides simultaneously. Ce and Co will be studied
comparatively to determine how the role of Co as a biologically essential
element (cf. Ce) influences its upper water column geochemistry and
distribution.
