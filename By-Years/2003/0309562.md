Proposal CCR-0309562&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Physical Random Functions and
Secure Hardware Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Srinivas
Devadas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing elements are becoming small,
disseminated and unsupervised, and significant responsibilities are being placed
on them. Physical attacks present an increasing risk that must be dealt
with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical Random Functions (or PUF as in Physical
Unclonable Function), which are a tamper resistant way of establishing shared
secrets with a physical device are introduced. They rely on the inevitable
manufacturing variations between devices to produce an unclonable identity for a
device. PUFs can be used directly for authenticated identification applications
such as key cards and smart cards. In current smartcards, it is possible for
someone who is in possession of the smartcard to produce a clone of it, by
extracting its digital key information through one of many well-documented
attacks. With a unique PUF on the smartcard that can be used to authenticate the
chip, a digital key is not required; the smartcard hardware is itself the secret
key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enable more sophisticated applications, Controlled
Physical Random Functions (CPUFs) which are PUFs that can only be accessed via
an algorithm that is physically bound to the PUF in an inseparable way are
introduced. CPUFs can be used to establish a shared secret between a physical
device and a remote user. Once established, the shared secret can be used to
enable a wide range of applications, including certified execution and
intellectual property protection.&lt;br/&gt;
