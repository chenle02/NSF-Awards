The ability to identify, recognize and manipulate patterns is fundamental to
knowing the world. Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) is developing "Pattern
Place," a new collections-based traveling exhibition, to introduce children ages
7 to 10 to the structure, meaning and importance of patterns. The exhibition
will incorporate an array of objects from BCM's collections and open-ended,
hands-on inquiry skills. The 1,200-square-foot trilingual exhibition will open
at BCM in 2002 and then travel to eight other museums in the U.S. and Canada. A
range of family programming, a Web site and a portable museum kit will provide
further dissemination and support educators in incorporating object-based
inquiry into the classroom curriculum.
