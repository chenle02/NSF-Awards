This is a career advancement award (CAA) request from R.Y. Ofoli, an associate
professor at MSU, for training in experimental and theoretical colloid science
in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He will
perform a series of experimental components deal with the initial rate of
flocculation of colloids, and evaluation of the internal reflection microscopy
as a tool for studying adsorption at the liquid-liquid interface. The
theoretical foundation will be built also through coursework. It is expected
that the present award will allow Dr. Ofoli to redirect his efforts to new
research areas and with new investigation techniques. During his training at CMU
, Dr. Ofoli will prepare a detailed plan for his independent research after his
return at MSU.
