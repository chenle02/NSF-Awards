9411172 This grant will support a working conference entitled "Specific
Language Impairment and Williams' Syndrome: A Double Dissociation of Language
and Cognition?", that will bring together linguists, neurolinguists, and
clinicians for an intensive week-long working session. The conference is to be
held in conjunction with the Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of
America, which will be held at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, during
July 1995. The Working Conference on "Specific Language Impairment and Williams'
Syndrome: A Double Dissociation of Language and Cognition?", will focus on the
theoretical implications and clinical realities of two sharply contrasting
developmental disorders, Williams' Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment. It
is designed to present current results on these disorders to a much wider
audience of linguists, and to bring those linguists into contact with the first-
hand knowledge of clinical researchers.
