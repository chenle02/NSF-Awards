The polar cap potential is a very important quantity in the coupling between
the solar wind and the magnetosphere. It is a quantity which gives a direct
measurement of plasma flow in the magnetosphere and can also be related to the
energy input into this important region of the earth's geospace environment. In
the past, there have only been a few studies of the correlation between the
polar cap potential and the solar wind. This grant is for the following four
tasks (1) assemble a large data set of polar cap electric potentials from
instruments on the two Dynamic Explorer satellites, (2) determine how the solar
wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control the polar cap potential,
(3) investigate the relationship between the size of the polar cap and the total
potential drop, and (4) use AE indices in combination with the polar cap
potential measurements to find how the potential behaves during magnetospheric
substorms.
