This project will establish one General Chemistry laboratory with twelve
workstations equipped with microcomputers and interface units. The workstations
interface the microcomputer with sensors that function as a voltmeter, ammeter,
pH meter, light detector, or thermometer. The computer allows students to
control the experiment, collect and analyze the data, and obtain real-time
results. Interfaced microcomputers provide valuable experience for students in
functional uses of computers. Second, properly designed experiments encourage
in- depth thought resulting in better understanding of experiments and, hence,
chemistry. The units will be also be used in a summer institute for high school
chemistry teachers.
