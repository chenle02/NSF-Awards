The objective of this research program is to study mixed-mode fracture of
aluminum alloys containing two types of precipitates. Deformation behavior is
examined in tension and compression, using plane strain and bend tests. The
topography and extent of shear localization, void nucleation and growth, and
fractography are followed for specimens with different particle sizes and
particle spacings. Surface roughness is determined and related to surface
plastic instability. Theoretical calculations are carried out for dislocation-
crack tip configurations near a two-phase interface.
