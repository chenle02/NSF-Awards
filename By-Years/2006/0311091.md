This project will explore the use of neural learning in micro architectural
predictors such as branch predictors. Neural branch predictors replace commonly
used counter-based techniques with neural learning, providing better predictive
capabilities. Special emphasis will be placed on reducing the latency of neural
predictors, which hinders their contribution to overall performance. We expect
the following results: (1) improved accuracy for neural predictors, (2)
decreased impact of neural predictor latency on performance, (3) a deeper under
understanding of the properties of the branch prediction problem that are
exploited by neural predictors, and (4) new digital circuits for implementing
neural predictors in micro architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microprocessors
predict the near-term behavior of a program so that work on future instructions
may begin early, reducing the amount of time the program takes to run. These
predictions must be highly accurate. Borrowing concepts from neuroscience, we
will explore the use of artificial neurons to replace the predictors used today.
Artificial neurons have been used as predictors in other domains, and
preliminary results show that they work well for predicting program behavior. We
will improve these results by exploring ways to make the neurons work faster,
more accurately, and with a larger scope, thus improving overall performance of
computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
