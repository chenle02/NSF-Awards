The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Arthur W. Bull assisted by co-PIs Amanda Bryant-
Friedrich and John V. Seeley. This is a planning grant to integrate research
into the curricula at community colleges and four-year colleges in southeast
Michigan. In this phase, research experiences will focus on students from three
community colleges: Wayne County Community College, Oakland Community College
and Macomb Community College. Students will have 6 weeks of research training in
the summer and will continue to do research on a part-time basis during the
academic year. The research will center on environmental and chemical
toxicology. Other activities during the planning phase will include development
of criteria for evaluating applicants, development of introductory materials for
the course on basic research skills, consideration of logistical and scheduling
issues for students and discussion of avenues for sustaining the program.
Meetings will be held with potential college participants to assess interest and
potential program size. A high school outreach program will be integrated into
the URC.
