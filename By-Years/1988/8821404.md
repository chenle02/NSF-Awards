This project will examine the so called Freiheitssatz for noncommutative
associative algebras, which states that for any non trivial relation there
exists a nontrivial algebra with generators satisfying this relation. The
principal investigator will also investigate the structure of skew fields which
are infinite dimensional over their centers concentrating primarily on the
search of free subobjects in such skew fields. A ring is an algebraic object
having defined on it both an addition and a multiplication. These objects occur
frequently in many branches of mathematics. They are also of interest in physics
and computer science. This project will examine several constructions in order
to answer some fundamental questions concerning the existence of rings with
certain properties.
