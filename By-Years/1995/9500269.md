DMS-9500269 PI: Johnston Johnston will use the unitary representation theory of
discrete groups to unify the continuous and discrete wavelet transform theories.
The square-integrability of unitary representations of certain discretized
countable subgroups of the real affine group and the real Heisenberg group will
be investigated. This will give new frame constructions as well as group-
theoretic proofs for well-known results about discrete wavelet sets in Hilbert
spaces. Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics best
exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One seeks to decompose complex problems
into fundamental components. These components are then analyzed for their basic
characteristics. Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination
of the components. The Fourier series and Fourier transform are examples of
tools used in this context; one discrete , the other representing a continuous
decomposition. More recently the theory of oscillatory integrals added new
dimensions to some of the more classical approaches to harmonic analysis.
