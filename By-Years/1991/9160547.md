Microcomputer-based Laboratories were developed to give students a hands-on
learning method and have been shown to improve student performance. Electronic
advancements now allow for the research of integrating existing, state-of-the-
art, low cost, palm-sized, portable data acquisition equipment into a portable
Microcomputer-based Laboratory. The feasibility assessment will be based on two
experiments performed by sixth graders. This concept, if successful, could be
applied to benefit science and math education at all efforts.
