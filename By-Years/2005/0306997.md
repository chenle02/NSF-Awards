This grant emphasizes a fundamental study of thin film growth morphology and
composition selection for Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). A major goal is to make
a direct comparison between growth by PLD and by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)
performed under identical conditions to facilitate the extension and
modification of the extensive body of MBE knowledge to the PLD process. Initial
experiments will be conducted using simple fcc and bcc metal systems, in
particular Cu, Ni and Fe on Ag and Co, Fe, Rh, Pd and Pt on Cu. Characterization
involves examination of non-wetting island nucleation, growth, coarsening and
coalescence in the formation of thin metal films on insulating substrates, along
with surface roughness evolution in homoepitaxial growth. Along with the
experimental study of segregation of alloying elements at the surface and their
burial and incorporation into the growing film, modeling efforts include
simulations using 3-D Kinetic Monte Carlo code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research program is designed so that its results will have broad applicability
to a variety of nonequilibrium processing techniques for a wide variety of
materials. The experimental effort will permit the formulation of broad
principles that can be related to the research enterprise concerned with film
growth. This research will facilitate the fabrication of new, interesting, and
potentially useful and combinations of materials. The project supports the
training of two graduate students contributing to their professional
development.&lt;br/&gt;
