A program of detector and instrument development will be undertaken in support
of four program areas: 1. absolute measurements of the diffuse submillimeter
background from sounding rockets; 2. development of a photometer and telescope
that will be flown on board a Japanese satellite in 1992; 3. construction of a
novel array detector for millimeter.wave observations on the California
Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea; 4. the search
for dark matter using large bolometric detectors operation at approximately 20
