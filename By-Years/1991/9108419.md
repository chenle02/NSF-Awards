A systematic study of the electronic structure and reactivity of a new class of
molecular carbon clusters (fullerenes) is proposed. The program is aimed at the
following issues: investigating the electronic energy level distributions for
isolated and derivatized fullerene molecules, studying the changes in occupied
and empty electronic states due to solid-state formation, with an emphasis on
energy band formation, surface and interfacial studies of bond formation and
stability of Fullerenes with metal and semiconductor adatoms and overlayers;
catalysis, and photon- and electron- enhanced oxidation.
