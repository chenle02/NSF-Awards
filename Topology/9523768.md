9523768 Emert The Department of Mathematics of Ball State University, Muncie,
Indiana, will host the Joint Spring Topology Conference and Southeast Dynamical
Systems Conference, March 7-9, 1996. This will be the 30th meeting of the former
conference and the seventh meeting of the latter conference. There will be a mix
of one-hour and half-hour invited talks and contributed talks in areas ranging
from general/set theoretic topology through continuum theory and dynamical
systems to geometric topology. The Spring Topology Conference has long
established itself as one of the largest and most successful annual topology
conferences in the U.S. Over the years, this conference has managed to maintain
its traditional identity and at the same time to expand its breadth. In
particular, the area of dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in
1987, and its evolving link to the more traditional areas of topology has become
a central emphasis of the conference. ***
