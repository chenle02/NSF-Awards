Research continues on the development of efficient algorithms for computational
problems arising in several application areas, including Optimization,
Artificial Intelligence, Logic Databases, Distributed Decision-Making, Testing,
Parallel Computation, and Mathematical Economics, as well as on the foundations
of Complexity Theory. This project focuses on: (1) the approximability of
several optimization problems, in the light of recent important advances in this
area; (2) work on the competitive analysis of on-line algorithms along three
lines, using competitive analysis as a yardstick for measuring the performance
of distributed decision-making algorithms, as well as the value of information
and communication; applying the methodology to problems motivated by parallel
compilers; and trying to resolve the K-server conjecture; (3) work on several
problems related to the efficient implementation of logic database queries, as
well as in further developing a computational theory of rapid informal reasoning
based on model selection; (4) the study of certain complexity classes that
appear to lie strictly between P and NP, capturing limited non determinism and
total functions; (5) the use of computational complexity as a `scientific
metaphor` for capturing bounded rationality in Mathematical Economics; looking
from the algorithmic point of view at some key problems in the Theory of Games
and that of Implementation; and (6) work on some interesting computational
problems related to testing large distributed systems.
