Dr. Cochran plans to continue his studies on concordance of links and on
invariants of manifolds of dimensions 3 and 4. The linking phenomena Dr. Cochran
is studying are indicative of new phenomena relating to the classification of
four-dimensional spaces. He will also study aspects of manifolds which have
significance in the context of physics. Three and four-dimensional manifolds are
important to us, since we live in a three-dimensional manifold if we ignore the
time dimension and a four-dimensional manifold if we do not. What is intriguing
about some of this work is that ideas from physics are solving purely geometric
problems, not only the other way around, which is more to be expected.
