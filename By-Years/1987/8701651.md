Professor Chan proposes a series of experiments that draw on his established
expertise in sensitive heat capacity measurements. The phase transition in films
adsorbed on porous glass substrates will be investigated. Particular attention
will be given to the possible 3-D weakly interacting Bose gas behavior of very
thin helium films at milliKelvin temperatures. Supercooling of a confined fluid
will be studied with particular emphasis on hydrogen A superfluid transition
predicted at 6K. The heat capacity of critical binary fluid mixtures confined in
a porous glass matrix may exhibit random-Ising-magnet behavior. Heat capacity
measurements will be made of molecular films beyond monolayer coverage so as to
understand the relationship between two dimensional melting and film growth.
