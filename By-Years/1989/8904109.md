This research deals with the development, testing and mathematical analysis of
adaptive signal processing algorithms based on higher-order statistics of the
signals involved in the adaptation process and their applications. Different
"criteria of goodness" in higher-order statistics domains and different adaptive
filter realizations are being considered in the development of the new
algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on the investigation of the numerical
properties and performance of the algorithms. Performance metrics being
considered include probability of error in the restored sequence as a function
of SNR, sensitivity to signal statistics and data conditioning, rate of
convergence, choice of sliding windows and finite work length effects. The
performance of the new algorithms is compared to that of the existing ones to
establish strengths and weaknesses. Finally, applications of the new algorithms
are considered, e.g., in decision feedback equalization, in blind equalization,
noise cancelling, and system identification.
