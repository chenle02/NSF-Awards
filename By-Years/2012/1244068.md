Intellectual Merit: Programmed cell death is an essential process for
development and immune responses in most organisms. In plants this process plays
a role in leaf senescence, development of xylem tracheary elements, and host
responses to pathogens. Relatively few plant genes have been identified that
have a direct role in the signal transduction pathway that leads to programmed
cell death. The investigator discovered the Adi3 kinase in tomato that appears
to be a central component of the pathway that controls the suppression of
programmed cell death. Adi3 protein localizes to the nucleus of the plant cell;
but, the precise mechanism of how this protein functions is unknown. The
investigator postulates that Adi3 interacts with specific nuclear proteins. This
project is designed to identify and characterize these interactors using
sophisticated proteomics and computational approaches to simulate and
reconstruct the network of the Adi3-specific signaling pathway. Broader Impacts:
Understanding how plants suppress cell death in most cellular functions, and
allow the cell death to occur during senescence, xylem maturation, and
protection from pathogen infection, is a very important question and has obvious
potential benefits for agriculture. The integrated research and educational
activities will provide training and educational opportunities for students to
gain multi-disciplinary training in how to solve complex biological questions
through iterations of experimentation and theory.
