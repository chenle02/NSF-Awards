ABSTRACT This project will investigate a number of current theoretical issues
in the acquisition of language, through the detailed experimental study of the
development of one module of linguistic competence, the anaphoric phenomena
which are the subject of binding theory, in English and Chinese. The project
will chart many important aspects of this development. The English data will be
collected in the United States, and the Chinese data in Taiwan, in collaboration
with colleagues there. Among the topics to be considered will be (1) the
interaction between the formulation of Chomsky's "Principle B" with regard to
bound variables and referential pronouns, and the child's knowledge of the
principle; (2) the apparent lack of long-distance binding in the Chinese of the
young child; (3) the possibility of explaining anomalous acquisition phenomena
by the Subset Principle and a parameterized theory with independent parameters,
on the one hand, versus a richly interrelated developmental theory on the other
hand; (4) the explanation of long-distance binding via LF movement of the
reflexive, and the slow development of long-distance binding; and (5) the
development of non-canonical patterns such as chain-binding and binding of
adjuncts. %%% The study of language acquisition by children has moved in the
direction of seeking much more comprehensive and more formalized theoretical
modeling, informed by developments in linguistic theory. This project reflects
that trend, and furthers it. It also responds to the increasing emphasis on
cross-linguistic study of language acquisition, in the attempt to discover
patterns of development which are general to human beings, not just to those
speaking a particular language.
