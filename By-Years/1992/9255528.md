Calvin College's Physics Department offers a one-week Diode- Laser Experiments
Workshop in the summer of 1993 to physicists and chemists who wish to introduce
diode-laser demonstrations and experiments in their teaching of undergraduates.
Participants see a variety of experiments including high- resolution
spectroscopy, the Zeeman effect, saturated absorption, optical frequency
doubling, the optogalvanic effect, optical heterodyning, and Rydberg-state
spectroscopy. Emphasis is on training, skills, and supports that will make these
experiments replicable at participants' home institutions.
