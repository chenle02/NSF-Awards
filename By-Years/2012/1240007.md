Missouri State University is coordinating the development of a program for
science teacher preparation to increase the number of science teachers who are
well prepared to teach science in high-needs middle schools and high schools.
The Science Experts Teaching Students (SETS) capacity-building project is a two-
year collaboration between middle school and high school science teachers,
university scientists and teacher education faculty who are working through two
intensive summer workshops to design a teacher preparation program that prepares
individuals who have a STEM degree to become certified to teach middle school
and high school science through a dual-undergraduate degree program or through a
one-year post-baccalaureate program. The SETS project is based on a model of
science teacher preparation that is designed and taught through true
collaboration of master middle and high school science teachers, university
science teacher educators and university scientists. It is being designed in
accordance with research-validated best practices and the teacher preparation
standards of the National Science Teachers Association and builds on the work of
other Noyce projects, especially those with induction programs delivered to
teachers in rural areas. The project is expanding the capacity of Missouri State
University to address defined teacher shortages in middle and high school
science teaching. All SETS participants are learning about effective mentoring
practices and induction programs through training led by an expert consultant
from the Exploratorium Teacher Institute. Since many novice teachers work in
isolation in small rural schools, the SETS project is developing a region-wide
induction program that connects the novice teachers to peers and to science
instructional coaches located throughout the region.
