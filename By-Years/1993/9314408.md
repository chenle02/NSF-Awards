9314408 Huggins Many luminous red giant stars eject significant amounts of
material from their outer layers. The star then evolves rapidly into a white
dwarf while the matter is seen for a time as a planetary nebula. It is now known
that the star and the visible nebula are surrounded by a large shell of neutral
gas. The properties and evolution of these shells will be studied by observing
their molecular emission at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. This
information will be used to develop a description of the formation and evolution
of the nebulae. These studies should substantially improve our understanding of
this important but little understood phase of stellar evolution. ***
