This proposal is concerned with thin film materials with a one-dimensional,
spatially periodic composition variation. These are referred to as composition
modulated alloys (CMAs), and they can exhibit extraordinary mechanical, magnetic
and optical properties especially when the periodicity wavelength is of the
order of nanometers. The proposal suggests using electrochemical deposition,
rather than the conventional vacuum deposition, to fabricate the CMAs, and the
study will focus on the deposition of NiFe films. NiFe alloys with uniform
composition are used, because of their high saturation magnetization and high
initial permeability, for read/write heads for computer disk drives and as
underlayers for perpendicular recording media. CMAs of NiFe have the potential
for high performances in magnetic data storage because of the extra degree of
freedom. The films will be deposited using a uniform injection (rather than
rotating disk) flow cell. Flow pulsations are used to periodically vary the
composition of the film as it is deposited on the electrode surface.
