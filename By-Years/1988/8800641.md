Research will be conducted in the general area of the dynamics of
conformational change in polymer molecules in solution. Experimental studies of
oscillatory flow birefringence (OFB), viscoelasticity (VE), oscillatory flow
dichroism (OFD) and time resolved elastic light scattering from solutions
subjected to periodically time varying flows are to be carried out. Some studies
will utilize existing instrumentation for wide effective frequency range
measurements in highly viscous solvents which also provide extensive temperature
dependence information; new instrumentation providing moderate to high frequency
VE data will be employed to obtain wide frequency coverage in low viscosity
solvents. Additional OFB instrumentation for high frequency studies in low
viscosity solvents will be constructed and characterized. Detailed experimental
studies of the effects of concentration, temperature, molecular weight, and
overall chain topology on OFB and VE properties will be continued and compared
with various theoretical predictions. Bead-spring model calculations of the
frequency dependence of the polymer contribution to VE and OFB properties
(dilute solutions) will be continued for regular combs with randomly placed
branch sites, stars with unequal arms, and randomly branched chains to assess
the potential of chain dynamics in general, and these techniques in particular,
for detailed branching characterization of more typical industrial polymers than
have been modeled in our previous work. Studies of the role of local structure
(side groups, tacticity, microstructure) and solvating environment modifications
in the neighborhood of polymer chains will be continued and expanded to include
more widely different polymer structures.
