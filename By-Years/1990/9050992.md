This project establishes a modern, advanced Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
(CIM) Laboratory for the improvement of the undergraduate curriculum in
Mechanical Engineering. The objectives are to include (CIM) projects within
Computer Graphics and Manufacturing as well as to offer a new course titled,
"Computer- Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM)." This new course is
designed to familiarize the students with computer-aided design, numerical
control, computer process control, robotics, group technology and computer-
integrated manufacturing. The major equipment selected includes a robot, a CNC
lathe, and a milling machine along with a workstation, personal computers and
appropriate software. This project provides the opportunity for students to work
with modern equipment and "state-of-the-art" software in an important area of
manufacturing. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
