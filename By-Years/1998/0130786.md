With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
Riverside will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.
Among the research programs in which EPR spectroscopy will play a vital role
are: a) bioinorganic chemistry or iron porphyrins, redox chemistry of
fullerenes, metalloporphyrin/fullerene supramolecular chemistry and reactive
radical cations across the periodic table (Reed); b) characterization of
porphyrin pi-cation radicals in multiporphyrin arrays (Bocian); c) studies on
carbon nanotubes and neutral organic conductors (Haddon); d) investigations on
the mechanism of manganese catalyzed water oxidation in photosystem II (Debus);
e) trapping of fluorocarbonyl radicals (Morton); and f) development of new
analytical tools for assessing chirality (Mueller). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to
obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It
may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
particular biological chemistry and materials sciences.
