Abstract: The focus of this project is to apply methods from differential
topology, geometric analysis and algebraic geometry to study symplectic four
manifolds. For symplectic four manifolds, the equivalence between Seiberg-Witten
invariants and the symplectic Gromov-Taubes invariants has led to many striking
results in symplectic topology. In collaboration with Liu, Li has set up the
parametrized Seiberg-Witten theory and derived a wall-crossing formula. The
parametrized Seiberg-Witten theory is particularly interesting for families of
symplectic manifolds. Li proposes to develop further the parametrized Seiberg-
Witten and the parametrized Gromov-Taubes theories and show that these two
theories are equivalent for symplectic families. The parametrized theories
should be useful for studying the isotopies of diffeomorphisms as well as
symplectomorphisms. And the equivalence between the two theories is expected to
play an important role in the classification of symplectic four manifolds,
especially those with torsion canonical classes. Recently, it has been shown
that smooth Lefschetz fibrations provide a link between the topology of
symplectic four manifolds, the geometry of the moduli space of curves and the
algebra of the mapping class groups. The investigator plans to explore the
beautiful and rich interplay to advance understanding of all these objects.

An n manifold is a space that locally looks like Euclidean space of dimension n.
For example, the space-time universe we live in is a four manifold. A symplectic
structure is a very basic structure that underlies almost all the equations of
classical and quantum physics. A symplectic four manifold is a four manifold
with a symplectic structure. Thus symplectic four manifolds play a central role
in mathematics and physics. The fundamental problem is to classify all
symplectic four manifolds. The investigator aims to gain some understanding of
the general shape of symplectic four manifolds.
