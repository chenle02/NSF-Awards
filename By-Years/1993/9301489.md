The primary objectives of this research are (1) to establish the scientific
basis for gas-assisted injection molding, (2) to develop an engineering tool for
characterizing the process, and (3) to improve the process technology with
computer simulation, modern sensors, and design guidelines. The Phase I research
proved the technical feasibility of simulating the mold-filling dynamics. It
also demonstrated the various merits of computer-aided engineering (CAE) which
enhance engineers' capability in handling all aspects of the process. In the
Phase II research, both experimental and computational work are conducted to
further the basic understanding of the process and integrated
filling/holding/cooling/part-performance analysis. Collaboration with industry
and universities is emphasized to jointly verify the analysis and consolidate
engineering know-how. Successful completion of this research enhances
competitiveness of the nation's polymer-processing industry by fully utilizing
the new process with CAE.
