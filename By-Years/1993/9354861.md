9354861 Attewell We propose a graduate research training program in the area of
Organizational Effectiveness, within a doctoral program in sociology, but
drawing upon an interdisciplinary faculty involved in organizational studies
within the social and behavorial sciences. The training program is oriented
toward African-American and Hispanic doctoral students, and will involve an
initial cohort of five trainees. Our doctoral program has successfully recruited
and graduated substantial numbers of minority doctoral students in sociology for
two decades: we propose building up and extending an existing sub-speciality in
organizational studies to focus specially on organizational effectiveness. We
shall use existing recruiting bridges to outstanding minority students in the
senior colleges of the City University of New York, as well as national
searches, detailed below. The proposed program involves a sequence of courses on
organizational theory, assessment methodologies, and research techniques. It
includes student apprenticeships in existing faculty research projects on
effectiveness and restructuring efforts in three organizational domains: private
industry, government, and schools. This will be followed by research internships
in private and public organizations, which will form the bases of their
dissertation research. ***
