The goal of this program is to develop a microscopic description of metal
surface phase behavior, especially at elevated temperatures where the role of
fluctuations is expected to be important. By means of high-resolution x-ray
scattering, the researchers will investigate roughening, metal facetting and
surface-melting transformations of both reconstructed and unreconstructed
surfaces. In addition the two-dimensional phase transformations associated with
reconstructions will be investigated. The program will contribute to a detailed,
microscopic understanding of the statistical physics of real metal surfaces. In
particular, it will contribute to our understanding of the morphology of metal
surfaces versus temperatures and to our understanding of the thermal behavior of
metal equilibrium crystal shapes.
