This project will support the evaluation and development of micro-sequential
Lab-On-Valve methodology used for determination of trace elements in seawater,
which has potential as a new analytical system to be used in ocean observing
systems. Sequential Injection methodology will be adapted to oceanographic trace
element determinations and thus become a significant contributor to a new
generation of analytical systems that are needed to utilize the expanding array
of platforms dedicated to unattended data gathering. These platforms such as
moorings, floats, and gliders, provide an opportunity to extend data gathering
beyond the reach of conventional shipboard sampling and hence improve our
understanding of long term temporal processes as well as access to areas that
are logistically difficult to reach. The ocean sciences community at large will
therefore benefit from the development of the new micro-fluidic technologies for
trace element analysis. A further benefit will be the training of graduate
students that represent the next generation of specialists in the development
and application of this novel trace element analytical technology.
