The computing industry recently experienced a major shift in CPU architectures
with the advent of multicore chips. This shift has necessitated the adoption of
new programming models, algorithms, and analysis methods to fully exploit the
parallelism inherent in multicore chip designs. While advances in these areas
are well underway, industry has already begun yet another architectural shift
towards systems with heterogeneous processing elements. Heterogeneity creates
new challenges because the availability of different types of processing
elements means that nontrivial choices must be made when allocating hardware
resources to software components.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the
most successful applications of heterogeneity today is in architectures in which
powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) are used alongside general-purpose
CPUs. Though originally intended as special-purpose graphics accelerators, GPUs
are now being widely used for non-graphics processing in numerous application
domains, including many domains in which real-time constraints (e.g., deadline
requirements) exist. For example, envisioned automated automotive systems will
require real-time sensing and tracking features that GPUs can accelerate. The
goal of this project is to determine which resource allocation methods best
facilitate the support of such real-time applications on heterogeneous platforms
that may have multiple CPUs and GPUs. This goal is being met by undertaking a
broad study of issues affecting the deployment and analysis of real-time
applications implemented on GPU-enabled multicore platforms. Broader impacts
include joint research with industry colleagues, and the development of
publicly-available open-source software that can be used by other institutions
for research and teaching purposes.
