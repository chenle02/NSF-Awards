This award to Florida State University is to develop a workable 'proof of
concept' X-ray diffractometer to take advantage of the new 25T split-coil magnet
at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). X-ray diffraction and
scattering techniques in high magnetic fields will be used to investigate spin-
lattice coupling, magnetostriction, and orbital ordering effects in strongly
correlated materials. This 'proof of concept' system will address the effects of
large fringe fields on detectors, X-ray sources, and mechanical components.
Potential materials to be investigated will include, multiferroic,
magnetoelectric, and, thermomagnetic materials, spin-cross-over systems, and
geometrically frustrated magnetic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'proof of
concept' X-ray diffractometer will be the first available at steady state
magnetic fields above 13T. It will provide a unique capability to probe the
magnetic responses in materials and is expected to lead to new science. The new
instrument will pave the way for a next generation diffraction system with
enhanced capabilities open to the scientific community through the NHMFL.
