The research proposed will investigate some important thermoelastic effects in
the solidification of castings. The quality of a casting depends critically on
the thermal boundary conditions at the interface between the casting and the
mold. These are largely governed by the contact resistance there, which, in
turn, depends on the local contact pressure. This pressure is affected by the
thermal distortion of the partially solidified casting, thereby leading to a
coupled thermal and mechanical problem. Experience shows that this coupling can
led to an instability which results in profile errors in a nominally plane cast
surface. The wavelength of the instability which is most favored to grow under
such conditions. The of more realistic constitutive laws and of thermal
deformations of the mold will be studied. A similar investigation will be
carried out for axisymmetric castings in the form of cylinders and spheres.***
