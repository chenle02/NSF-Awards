The concept of underplating of continental crust by magma is fundamental to
tectonics but is difficult to evaluate because there is as yet little documented
geological evidence. This project is a field-based study of an exposed zone of
probable crustal under- plating in the Ivrea-Verbano zone of the northern
Italian Alps. This zone provides an exceptional cross-section of lower
continental crustal rocks extensively intruded by mafic igneous rocks. A new
1:25,000 geologic map will be prepared across the Ivrea-Verbano zone, and
structural and kinematic studies will be undertaken at the same time. Close
collaboration with Italian geologists working in the area will be maintained
throughout. The field mapping will form a basis for future detailed
petrological, geochemical, and geochronological studies aimed at understanding
the physical and chemical evolution of the underplated region. The results of
this study will allow development of a general model, for and will considerably
improve our understanding of, the origin and evolution of underplated
continental crust in tectonically active regions.
