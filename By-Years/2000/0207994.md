&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claflin University, the oldest Historically Black College
&amp; University in the state of South Carolina will implement the project
entitled: "Programs for the Retention and Enrichment of Science, Engineering and
Mathematics Students" (PRESEMs). This five-year project consists of a
comprehensive approach to strengthen Claflin University's undergraduate science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research
infrastructure with the goal of broadening the participation of underrepresented
minorities in the STEM disciplines and workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRESEMs
will focus on approaches that enhance student learning in STEM, such as peer-led
instruction, problem-based learning, and a research-based curriculum.
Aggressively recruiting students, offering effective pre-college outreach and
summer enrichment programs, implementing programs to increase successful
completion of gate-keeper courses, enhancing undergraduate STEM curricula by
modernizing instrumentation, laboratories and classrooms, utilizing
undergraduate research as a teaching tool - these are the strategies required to
bring about institutional reform while preparing students for graduate study and
successful careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;
