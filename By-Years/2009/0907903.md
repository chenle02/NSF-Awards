This is a three-year award to sustain the Center for Astrophysics Supernova
Program, which obtains observations of supernovae in low redshift galaxies using
the 1.5 meter, 1.2 meter, and robotic 1.3 meter telescopes at Mount Hopkins
Observatory in Arizona as well as the 6.5 meter MMT and Magellan telescopes. It
will obtain spectra and multi-color optical light curves for supernovae north of
-20ยบ and brighter than 18 mag. This work is aimed at answering questions about
supernovae: which stars explode, by what mechanism, and with what result? The
work has also been applied to cosmology, providing part of the foundation for
the discovery of dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
work include training of students and outreach through public lectures
