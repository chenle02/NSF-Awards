This conference proposal requests support that will assist 80 US doctoral
students with travel expenses so that they may attend and present at the
Cognitive Science Society 2009 Meeting to be held at the Free University, from
Wednesday, July 29th to Saturday, August 1st, and so that they may participate
in pre-conference tutorials and workshops held on Wednesday, July 29th. The
location of the conference was selected specifically to provide opportunities to
create a more connected international community of cognitive scientists.
Workshops and tutorials will give both junior and more senior scientists an
opportunity to develop connections around meaningful points of intersecting
interest. This proposals intellectual merit is the dissemination and exchange of
knowledge in cognitive science and learning science within the international
community. Its broader impact is in support of the training of young
investigators and the development of interdisciplinary and international
collaborations in cognitive research.
