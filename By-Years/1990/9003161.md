A fault-tolerant, distributed program is a program that can continue executing
despite processor and network failures. The general goal of this research is to
develop techniques and support systems that facilitate the design, construction,
and verification of this type of software. To accomplish this goal, a number of
topics will be investigated in areas ranging from communication protocols to
formal verification. In particular: operating system support for fault-tolerant,
distributed programming; programming language abstractions that facilitate
construction of fault-tolerant, distributed systems; extension of existing
software engineering techniques and programming environments to encompass fault-
tolerant programming; and verification of fault-tolerant programs will be
studied. The first, second, and fourth topics represent the continuation of
investigations currently underway and natural extensions in those areas, while
the third is a new initiative. Since fault-tolerance is difficult to study in
isolation, this work is based largely on existing systems and languages,
including the SR distributed programming language, the Psync interprocess
communication mechanism, and the Software Designer's Associate project. This
approach also facilitates immediate progress on research issues by eliminating
the need to construct necessary infrastructure.
