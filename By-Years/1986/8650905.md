The Physics Department will develop a new undergraduate program in optics for
students in physics and engineering. The program will consist of a sequence of
upper division courses. For electrical engineering majors, the program will be
offered as an option. For physics majors, the entire uppper division program can
be structured to provide a strong optics concentration. Initially, the program
will be offered by the Physics Department. Ultimately, courses will be offered
by both academic depart-ments and will be open to either group of students. A
major portion of the program is the development of a modern undergrad- uate,
two-semester Optics Laboratory course. The first semester will emphasize
traditional optical experiments which illustrate the principles of geometric and
physical optics. In the second semester, contemporary topics in optical science
and engineering will be treated. In both semesters, microcomputers will be used
to interact with the optical components in selected experiments.
