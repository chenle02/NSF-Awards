This project enabled the institution to acquire a Hewlett-Packard High
Performance Liquid Chromatograph, complete with diode array and refractive index
detectors, PC, monitor, plotter, software packages and columns. They have made
extensive use of the instrumentation in Organic Chemistry and upper division
laboratories. In Organic Chemistry laboratories, students are introduced to HPLC
techniques of separating natural materials such as dopamine and norepinephrine,
nucleosides, and polypeptides. Students are also introduced to the determination
of polymer molecular weights by gel permeation phase chromatography. Theory and
practice of liquid normal and reverse phase chromatography are introduced in
Analytical Chemistry and more fully developed in Instrumental Methods, and
Industrial Chemistry. Since significant portions of Advanced Laboratory
Techniques and student research courses are devoted to the study of polymers and
biomolecules, the instrument finds extensive used in these laboratories. In
Advanced Laboratory Techniques, students prepare a Universal Calibration curve
for determining molecular weights of polymers and then complete a series of
experiments from which they may formulate relationships between polymer
molecular weight, catalyst concentration and polymerization temperature. Several
ongoing student research projects use this instrument for polymer molecular
weight determination and for separation and characterization of biomolecules,
such as nucleotides and nucleosides. The institution has contributed to this
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
