This grant supports a collaboration between a group at the University of Texas,
led by Dr. Frank Bash, and the California Institute of Technology Submillimeter
Observatory (CSO) with the objectives of improving the performance of the CSO
telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii at the shortest wavelengths, providing
instrumentation for observing in the submillimeter wavelength region of the
spectrum, and exploiting the capabilities of the telescope for scientific
problems which require submillimeter- wave observations. The process of star
formation is an area in which interest has been recently enhanced with
developments in instrumentation and techniques for observations. Because of the
presence of obscuring material, the depths of star forming regions can only be
probed with observations in the millimeter, the submillimeter, and the far
infrared regions of the spectrum. The principal scientific areas to be pursued
by the University of Texas group using the CSO telescope are the formation of
stars out of interstellar matter and the structure of galaxies as outlined by
molecular material.
