Questions about arrangements of lines have been studied extensively in various
areas of mathematics throughout the ages. Despite its central role in
mathematics, some of the most fundamental questions in this area remain
unanswered. This research project's main objective is to develop new techniques
for studying arrangements of lines and to make progress on longstanding
geometric questions. The investigator will continue to develop new techniques
that can be used to make significant advances in this area and to apply this
understanding to problems in computer science. The investigator will also
continue his commitment to the education and mentoring of students at all
levels, develop and disseminate materials for a new course in this research
topical area, and organize tutorial-style workshops to expose students to major
research trends and emerging techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project focuses on two broad types of problems. Kakeya type problems ask about
the "best" possible way to pack lines pointing in different directions into a
"small" set. Questions of this type appear in various contexts including in
analysis, partial differential equations, number theory, combinatorics, and
theoretical computer science. The principal investigator introduced a new
technique, called the "polynomial method" to the study of problems of this kind
and used it to give a complete solution to the finite field Kakeya conjecture of
Wolff. This project will continue developing the polynomial method in various
ways and use it to attack other problems. In Sylvester-Gallai type problems, one
wishes to convert information about local dependencies in a point set into
global bounds on the dimension of the entire set. The principal investigator
developed a technique to study questions of this form by bounding the rank of
"design-matrices". This project will develop this method further and use it to
make progress on several central questions in incidence geometry and additive
combinatorics.
