Project MANEUVER (Manufacturing Education Using Virtual Environment Resources)
is developing an affordable virtual reality (VR) framework to address the
imminent demand for well-trained digital manufacturing (DM) technicians. Over
half of the 3.5 million required manufacturing positions in the US are expected
to go unfilled due to a "skills gap". Employment projections show a decline in
conventional manufacturing jobs with marked growth in DM jobs. This VR
instructional framework, targeted at two and four year programs, will not only
advance the field of DM, but will also strengthen education by remedying the
lack of clearly defined career/educational pathway(s) for entry-level DM
technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MANEUVER is developing an innovative multi-
modal VR framework for DM instruction. This framework decouples the 3D DM
database from functionalities, thus giving the instructional designer access
through immersive, augmented, and desktop VR. Instead of pairing functionalities
with the VR database, which prevents access by other modes, the decoupled
approach allows for mode-independent approach, facilitating affordable access
and broader implementation. The resultant curricular modules can be replicated
for use on multiple machines without additional costs. During manufacturing
process training, VR tools serve as a viable alternative offering a cost and
material-efficient solution. Industry standard software and hardware is being
used to develop and deliver advanced DM exercises for instructional and training
purposes. Using a "train-the-trainers" approach, a replicable faculty
development model is being developed for secondary and post-secondary
institutions. By addressing regional and national entry-level workforce needs,
the project benefits society and contributes to national economic progress and
prosperity.
