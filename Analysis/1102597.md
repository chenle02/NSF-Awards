This research project focuses on the dynamics of rational maps in two or more
complex variables. Such maps have been studied for about twenty years, with
specific examples playing a crucial role in the development of a more general
theory. Based largely on these examples, there is a clear conjecture describing
what one should expect from the "most unstable" part of the dynamics for these
maps, i.e. the support of the measure of maximal entropy. Significant progress
has been made and verification of the conjecture is almost complete for rational
maps in two variables. The dynamics away from the support of this measure of
maximal entropy is also of significant interest. In certain cases, there is a
physically relevant invariant real slice that is away from the support of this
measure. In other cases, one may be interested in the topology of the Fatou set,
on which the dynamics of the map is stable. For these types of questions, we
need new conjectures, which the PI believes will be best developed by studying
appropriate examples. The PI proposes three different projects, each providing
examples that can motivate a deeper theory of complex dynamics in several
variables. They are: (1) study of rational maps arising as renormalization
operators for the Ising model (a model for magnetic materials) on hierarchical
lattices, (2) study of Fatou components for globally holomorphic maps of the
complex projective plane, and (3) investigation of the first properties for a
family of postcritically finite rational maps that have indeterminate points.

All three of the proposed projects will work out details for the dynamical
behavior of specific rational maps in several variables. This will push the
contemporary theory and also help to develop new conjectures. Moreover, the
project related to the Ising model will help to build new connections between
three fields (real-dynamics, complex dynamics, and statistical physics), while
potentially leading to a deeper theoretical understanding of magnetic materials.
There is significant potential for broader impact, particularly by fostering
better communication between researchers in dynamical systems and mathematical
physics. Work related to these projects can influence students of all levels,
from very talented high school students (with whom the PI actively works)
through Ph.D. candidates, by exposing them to contemporary research that crosses
between disciplines.
