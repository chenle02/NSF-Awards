Galveston College is modernizing its chemical laboratory. The aim of this
project is to use modern IR and GC equipment in the undergraduate laboratory.
The instruments are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of spectroscopy and
chromatography in solving chemical problems. They are used in laboratory
experiments including separation, isolation, and characterization of products
obtained through chemical reactions from natural products or household
chemicals. The acquisitions enhance the chemical skill of students who advance
to upper level courses at universities or find employment in the chemical
industry. In addition, non-science majors benefit from the experience of working
with modern instruments commonly used in chemical laboratories. The institution
is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
