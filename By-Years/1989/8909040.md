The overall purpose of Dr. Cook's research is to understand how different kinds
of pattern recognition systems perceive and process visual information. This
project contributes to that important purpose by studying visual perception in
pigeons. Birds are ideal for comparative visual studies because flight requires
accurate and rapid visual perception. This requirement, combined with the need
to minimize body weight, has produced in birds a small, compact visual system
that is structurally different from that of mammals. Dr. Cook's research
investigates how pigeons discriminate different kinds of computer-generated
visual stimuli. He is using a new type of visual discrimination task, which
specifically allows the direct comparison of visual perception in pigeons and
humans. The results of these experiments will reveal whether the mechanisms
proposed for vision in humans are present in pigeons, or whether the birds use
an entirely different set of mechanisms for producing their extraordinarily keen
vision. Thus, the project will supply evidence on the type, number, range and
generality of specific visual information-processing principles and mechanisms.
Such information will lead to a better understanding of vision in humans and aid
in the implementation of visual pattern recognition in computers. This
information will also be useful for developing diagnostic and remedial
procedures for visual-related health problems in humans, such as computerized
visual prostheses or substitutes for the blind.
