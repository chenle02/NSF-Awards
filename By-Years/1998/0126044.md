The 2001 International Working Conference on Active Networking (IWAN) will be
held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from September 30, October 2nd, 2001. This
conference is the pre-mier international workshop in the emerging field of
active and programmable networking. This proposal requests funding to assist
fourteen United States-based graduate students in attending this meeting.
Participation in workshops such as IWAN is an extremely important part of the
gradu-ate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers and be exposed to leading edge work in the field. In
addition, IWAN offers the opportunity to interact with international researchers
in this area, as both the presenters and the attendees have had strong European
and Asian presences. The support requested in this proposal will enable the
participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend IWAN 2001.
