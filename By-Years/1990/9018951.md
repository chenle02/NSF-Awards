This study will extend earlier work on time control of the major deformation
and syntectonic deposition events on the southern flank of the Pyrenees. Active
shortening occurred on the southern margin of the Ebro basin at the same time as
strike-slip faulting occurred along the Catalan Coast Range transpressional
margin. This project will investigate the timing of the deformation and the
amount of rotational strain along the Catalan Coast Range by dating a series of
fan-deltas, and will relate the findings to deformation in the Pyrenees to the
north. The fan deltas will also be studied for contrasts in size, position along
the range front, source area(s) and syntectonic sedimentation characteristics.
The results of this study will allow the relative roles of tectonism and
sediment supply to be evaluated for these foreland basins, and will have
significance for foreland basin development in other orogenic belts.
