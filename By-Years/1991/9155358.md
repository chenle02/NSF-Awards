The grant funds a 3 year project to develop a nationwide network for science
teachers based on the work done with LabNet. The primary purpose of the network
is to promote project-enhanced among the accessible features. Of the 1,375
teachers and the rest are high school teachers. The project produces a self-
sustaining community of science teachers who are network users. This "community
of practice" provides the basis for indepth studies on the uses of networks and
produces a usable workshop model and materials. Research on the network users
provides an understanding of how networks, and eventually Internet, is used to
improve classroom science instruction.
