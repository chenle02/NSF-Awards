This funding supports the continued development of a physics laboratory
curriculum for freshman and sophomore science majors. The students principally
affected are those majoring in physics and engineering. This laboratory
development provides for the computer interfacing of laboratory equipment in a
mechanics laboratory to aid student understanding, experimentation and data
processing. The computer-interfaced equipment enables students to perform
investigations in linear and rotational dynamics and the conservation of energy
and momentum in a variety of experiments. This award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
