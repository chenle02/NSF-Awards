9318544 Kolattukudy Plant cuticle, the outermost layer of plants, plays a
significant role in the interaction of plants with the environment including
pathogenic fungi. The structural polymers of plant defensive barriers, cutin and
suberin, will be examined using a new technology, atomic force microscopy, that
gives images at molecular dimensions and thus could directly reveal for the
first time the molecular architecture of these complex polymers. The nature of
the enzymes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cuticular components
will be elucidated by direct isolation of the enzymes and by cloning genes
uniquely expressed in the epidermis, the site of synthesis of the cuticular
components. Molecular mechanisms involved in the fungal penetration into plants
will be elucidated. How cuticular components and the ripening hormone, ethylene,
trigger germination and differentiation of fungal conidia to form appressorium,
the infection structure, will be studied by elucidating the structure, function
and regulation of expression of the unique fungal genes regulated by the plant
signals. How the unique cutin monomer acids trigger fungal cutinase gene
expression will be studied by isolating the transcription factors that bind the
promoter elements and by cloning the kinases that activate the transcription
factor binding. After breaching the cuticular barrier the fungal pathogen
penetrates the pectinaceous barriers using pectin degrading enzymes including
pectate lyase. The role of regulation of expression of the various members of
the family of fungal lyase genes in pathogenesis will be studied by elucidating
the conditions under which each gene is expressed and by assessing the effect of
inhibition of expression of the genes by gene disruption and antisense on the
virulence of the pathogen. The results of the proposed studies will help to
elucidate the basic mechanisms involved in the interaction of pathogenic fungi
with the defensive barriers of pl ants. Manipulation of these interactions could
provide new approaches to plant protection. ***
