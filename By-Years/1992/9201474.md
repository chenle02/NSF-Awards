The Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of formulating a novel coating
system for wooden structures, which through improved bonding between the wooden
substrate and the coating, effectively protected the wood from attack by marine
borers, such as shipworms. In addition, it was demonstrated that a waterborne
system could be formulated which also effectively protected the wood, but also
contained no hazardous or environmentally suspect components. The Phase II
program continues and expands upon this promising early work. This study
includes a systematic examination of the many formulation variables, and their
impact upon the coating's physical and handling properties, aesthetics, and
biofouling characteristics. An expanded series of ocean tests is planned to
establish the long-term effectiveness of the advanced coatings.
