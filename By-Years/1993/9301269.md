The MOSAIC-PM (Machine-Tool, Open-System, Advanced Intelligent Controller for
Precision Manufacturing) is a broad-based integrated program. It includes the
development of new algorithms which use touch-trigger probes to simplify two-
dimensional and three- dimensional fixturing, development and evaluation of
sensor systems, effective burr removal using computer-vision guided deburring
tools and the development of expert systems for set-up planning and tolerance
descriptions. The laboratory system is based on a DecStation/VMEbus/Real-time
Unix/C environment. This research plans to integrate results so that a normal
machine-tool becomes a mid-range precision machine. If successful this research
will permit significant increases in machine-tool precision with little extra
cost. This would lead to its use as a relatively low cost manufacturing research
platform and could lead to a prototype of a next-generation controller for U.S.
industry.
