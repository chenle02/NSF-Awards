Traumatic shoulder dislocation occurs in approximately 1.7% of the US
population, and can result in chronic instability, pain and limited range of
motion. Orthopaedic shoulder braces are a primary treatment method for the re-
stabilization of the shoulder, and are an alternative palliative, low-cost
treatment method to surgical reconstruction of the shoulder. The growing active
and elderly populations are placing a high demand for innovation of orthopaedic
bracing devices that can provide supportive shoulder bracing, while enabling
sufficient ranges of motion to facilitate the return to sport and leisure
activities. A new orthopaedic shoulder brace has been developed that enables
active ranges of motion for most sport and leisure activities, while limiting
specific ranges of motion that are at high risk of recurrent anterior
dislocation. The brace consists of a soft, breathable upper torso and shoulder
wrap, adjustable compressive straps, and a custom heat-moldable stabilization
insert. Preliminary testing of the device has validated its ease of application,
comfort, the ability to limit at-risk shoulder motions, and the maintenance of
functional shoulder motion. Although traumatic shoulder dislocation occurs most
commonly in young active males between the ages of 15 and 29, the impact of
recurrent dislocation risk (as high as 90%) affects the population as a whole in
cumulative medical costs, lost wages and lost productivity. Recurrent
dislocation risk is strongly inversely correlated to the age of initial
dislocation, and older patients are more likely to incur higher rates of rotator
cuff tears with dislocation. Although initial trauma is usually required to
induce dislocation, re-dislocation can occur more easily during common sporting
and work-related tasks. The design of a functional brace that limits at-risk
shoulder behavior and supports active shoulder function will broadly impact the
fields of rehabilitation, physical therapy and sports medicine. Reduced
incidence of re-dislocations will reduce medical costs, increase workplace
productivity, and promote a more active population.
