Chayes This research involves the use of mathematical models and analysis to
study problems arising in materials research. Three specific projects are to be
studied. The first concerns the dynamical behavior of large droplets of one
phase immersed in a second. The second project is a study of a recent model of
aerogels. And the third project is a study of some problems of first passage
percolation. This research involves the use of mathematical models and analysis
to study problems arising in materials research. While the problems arise in
materials research, new mathematics will need to be developed to study these
problems. In particular, tools from functional analysis and probability will be
useful. ***
