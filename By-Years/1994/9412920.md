9412920 Prasad The goal of this project is to initiate high speed electrical
characterization of optical components in optoelectronic integrated circuits
(OEIC's). This is to be followed by the characterization of full OEIC's. An
existing automatic network analyzer and on-wafer probe station with measurement
capability up to a frequency of 40 GHz is to be suitably modified with a
photodector and auxiliary optical equipment to allow optical as well as
electrical RF measurements. Laser diode, light emitting diode and detector
models will be extracted using scattering parameter measurements and the
microwave modulation response of the devices will be measured with a view to
optimization of the modulation bandwidth. Optoelectronic circuits and systems
will be investigated with particular attention being given to a critical
comparison between the performance when a) both input and output are electrical,
b) both input and output are optical, c) the input is electrical and the output
is optical, and d) the input is optical and the output is electrical. This part
of the research will be initiated with measurements of an optoelectronic
transceiver with LED sources as well as with lasers, M-S-M detectors and GaAs
MESFET VLSI electronics. The measurement and characterization methods developed
in this initial phase will be sufficiently general so that they can also be
applied to other optoelectronics circuits and systems. ***
