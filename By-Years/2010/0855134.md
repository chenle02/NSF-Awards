This project at the University of Toledo focuses on the acquisition of new high-
performance scalable computing (HPSC) and storage infrastructure to
further&lt;br/&gt;collaborative multi-disciplinary research, education, and
outreach activities. The instrumentation integrates easily expandable energy-
efficient high-performance rackmounted servers with an enterprise storage
system. The main objective of this project is to dramatically expand research
and educational opportunities for faculty and students in the College of
Engineering (COE) and the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). The proposed
infrastructure opens the door for collaborative basic as well as applied
multidisciplinary research in semiconductor technologies, wireless electronics,
sensors and networks, fluid dynamics, new materials and geospatial technologies.
Cutting-edge research enabled by the HPSC infrastructure will enhance the
content and quality of curriculum at undergraduate and graduate levels in
participating departments and colleges.&lt;br/&gt;This project facilitates
recruitment, retention, and training of world-class engineers and scientists in
strategic science and technology frontiers.
