Compilation of a new lithotectonic map of the Appalachian Orogen, sponsored
largely through NSF-EAR, is nearly complete. The new map incorporates more than
20 years of new data and ideas that were generated mainly in response to the
publication of the original Tectonic Lithofacies map of the orogen in 1978. The
original map has had a lasting impact on the tectonics community, both from the
standpoints of regional conceptualization and application. The new map has
similar, if not greater, promise; not only will the new map give a significant
facelift to the dated original, it will also incorporate modern technological
advances in geographic information systems (GIS). Thus, the new map adds an
entirely new dimension to the Appalachians and will surpass the capabilities of
the original map by allowing for i. construction of new theme maps, ii. Addition
of new databases, and iii. ease in updating the lithotectonic base. A
substantial portion of the production costs of the map is being shouldered by a
collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey and the Geological Survey
of Canada; however, they cannot support the entire financial burden of map
production. Herein, we request funds mainly for printing of the hard copies of
the new map.
