This proposal requests funds to obtain an amino acid analyzer and a protein
sequencer. Six investigators have proposed projects that require extensive use
of the instrumentation. The projects are: the isolation and characterization of
the enzymes involved in SV40 replication, development of a retroviral based in
vivo gene transfer procedure, embryogenesis and the elucidation of the mechanism
that regulate expression of T-cell surface protein-protein interactions
governing prokaryotic DNA replication systems, studies of cell-surface receptor-
ligand interaction and the mechanism of insulin action.
