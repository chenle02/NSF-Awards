Transition metal catalysis allows for the efficient and economical syntheses of
organic compounds that finds widespread applications in chemical,
pharmaceutical, and polymer manufacturing. In comparison to the very commonly
used precious metal catalysts, catalysts based on nickel represent an
inexpensive and earth-abundant alternative. In addition, nickel provides access
to new types of chemical reactions and products, as well as unprecedented
reactivity. In this project, Dr. Tianning Diao is conducting a fundamental study
to understand how nickel forms chemical bonds between elements of importance in
organic chemistry, thereby providing the basis for solving practical challenges
in this critically important class of chemical reactions. In addition to
training students at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry, Dr. Diao
is developing a summer workshop program to help teachers from institutions with
underrepresented minority students overcome challenges in teaching science. In
addition, Dr. Diao is actively engaged in creating, editing, and updating
contents in ChemWiki, a free online textbook, serving students worldwide.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the
Chemistry Division, Dr. Diao of New York University is establishing bimolecular
reductive elimination mechanisms for a variety of Ni-mediated bond formation
processes. Well-defined bimetallic Ni complexes undergo oxidation to generate
mixed-valent and high-valent intermediates, which rapidly proceed to form
carbon-carbon, carbon-halogen, and nitrogen-nitrogen bonds. Spectroscopic
characterization of Ni-Ni bonds and their roles in stabilizing reactive
intermediates provide the mechanistic basis for developing new reactions for
chemical synthesis. Dr. Diao is actively contributing to Chemwiki, a free online
textbook, serving students worldwide, especially the financially disadvantaged.
In addition, Dr. Diao is developing a summer workshop program to help enhance
teaching of science at institutions with underrepresented minority students.
