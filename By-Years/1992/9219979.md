The amalgamation of crustal and oceanic lithospheric fragments along
continental margins represents a fundamental process for the growth of the
continents. The southern Appalachian Mountains are a product of such an
amalgamation that occurred during Paleozoic-Mesozoic time. This project will
determine the structure, timing, and nature of the fragments that comprise the
Carolina Slate Belt and Milton Belt using a combined field and laboratory
approach. Results will have important implications for both the evolution of
continents and for the development of most major mountain belt systems of the
world.
