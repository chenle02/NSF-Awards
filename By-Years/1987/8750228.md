Xavier University will upgrade and update the x-ray physics component of the
atomic physics laboratory program taken by physics, applied physics, and physics
concentration education majors. By replacing an aging and obsolete x-ray tube
power supply with a modern, high-power, highly stabilized and regulated DC high-
voltage power supply for the generation of x-rays, significant improvements in
x-ray diffraction experiments using cameras and diffractometrers will be
achieved. By adding a timer and a counter to the data acquisition system and
interfacing system to a computer, students will be able to perform experiments
using modern digital techniques. The new power supply and new instrumentation
will improve the way students perform existing experiments: Bragg diffraction,
back-Laue reflection, and diffractometry. In addition it will make possible new
experiments, for example the measurement of x-ray line intensities and intensity
ratios and the study of line shapes and fine structure, as well as the
computerizing of data acquisition in all experiments. Finally, the new
instrumentation will provide a reliable x-ray system for student research
projects.
