PI: Kalkan, Kaan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 1512157&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project seeks to develop new types of optical probes that are faster and more
efficient at switching, while reducing effects of photobleaching. They will
study the photophysics of energy transfer between metal nanoparticles and
fluorescent proteins to develop stable photoactivatable probes for super-
resolution microscopy applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesized
photoswitching is based on photocreation of the intermediate state in the
Forster cycle of the FP using surface-enhanced optical pumping. This
photomodulation of the Forster cycle will be verified and studied by single
molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering and micro-optical spectroscopy. This
effort will develop a photoswitch using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) - silver
NP conjugates as its prototype. The photomodulation is based upon
photopopulation of the intermediate form (I-form) of GFP by excited state proton
transfer that red-shifts the optical absorption from 395 to 490 nm. This
spectral shift in absorption, in turn, is expected to modulate the Mie
scattering of the plasmonic NP by resonant energy transfer to the FP.
