Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a topic of exploration for
addressing the growing challenges in complex traffic and topology management in
environments such as large-scale data centers, private wide-area networks
(WANs), and virtual hosting environments. Unfortunately, little is understood
regarding the security challenges that SDN-enabled WANs introduce. The need for
modeling the spectrum of adversarial challenges early in the design stage of
this next generation of networking is critical for avoiding an explosion of new
exploitable vulnerabilities that will likely plague SDN WANs and hinder their
adoption.

This project facilitates a leap in our understanding of the security challenges
that arise across SDN-enabled WAN topologies. It focuses on the creation of a
multi-site (and reproducible) distributed security testing infrastructure for
several SDN-WAN topologies, as well as the development of adversarial models
against each topology. The testbed incorporates strong perimeter isolation and
environment recovery services. It instantiates a range of SDN WAN topologies,
and facilitates the integration and evaluation of security extensions to the SDN
infrastructure itself. The project will also produce a pluggable software-
testing framework of exploit methods across the attack surface of the various
SDN-WAN topologies instantiated within this testbed. The project will result in
an early assessment of concrete security threats and potential solutions that
can inform and influence SDN standards, enhance commercial solutions, drive
deeper threat assessments of these emerging networks, and stimulate the
networking and Information Security (INFOSEC) research communities.
