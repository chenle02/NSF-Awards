This grant to the University of Notre Dame supports nuclear physics research on
a broad range of topics. The primary areas of interest include studies of heavy
ion reactions of importance to nuclear astrophysics, studies of nuclear energy
levels, in particular those levels involving nuclear superdeformation and very
high angular momentum, and studies of nuclear giant resonances. The experiments
carried out at Notre Dame will make use of the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator
system. Other experiments are conducted using facilities at other laboratories
which are appropriate to the problem being studied.
