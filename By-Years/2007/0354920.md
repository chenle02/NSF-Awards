A Research in Undergraduate Instituions (RUI) grant has been awarded to the Hope
College Nuclear Group (under the direction of Dr. Paul DeYoung and Dr. Graham
Peaslee) by the National Science Foundation to support a variety of
undergraduate research projects for the next three years. The activities will
center on radioactive nuclear beam (RNB) studies at the National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University and the Nuclear
Structure Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame (ND). Experiments at the
NSCL will include a number of new investigations using the MoNA facility. These
studies will increase our understanding of the way nuclei far from stability are
constructed and interact with other matter. To prepare Hope College
undergraduate students for graduate work or other scientific careers, they will
be involved in every aspect of the work: experimental setup, data acquisition,
analysis and modeling, and presentation of results. Undergraduates will also be
involved in interdisciplinary studies based upon the new Hope College Ion Beam
Analysis Laboratory (HIBAL). These projects will investigate applications of
nuclear physics techniques to questions in other scientific disciplines. Our
results and the results of our collaborators will be disseminated in standard
journals
