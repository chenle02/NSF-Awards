Detailed three-dimensional models of urban environments provide critical
information for many applications, including emergency response preparation,
security analysis, urban planning, and augmented-reality maps. For example, if
3D models of complete cities were publicly available with detailed labels for
all semantic objects (e.g., buildings, fire hydrants, fire escapes, doors,
windows, trees, etc.), then fire fighters, police forces, and other emergency
response teams could use them to make plans for rescue operations, taking into
account possible access points, lines of sight, and risks to the neighborhood.
Or, if the 3D model contained labeled representations of stop lights, traffic
signs, parking spaces, store locations, mailboxes, and ATMs, then augmented
reality displays could help people navigate their daily
lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to develop
algorithms to build detailed, labeled 3D models from currently available data.
Several companies (e.g., Google, Nokia, Microsoft, etc.) are currently
collecting photographic imagery and LIDAR data with scanners mounted on cars
driving up and down streets of cities throughout the world. This data contains a
vast amount of information about our world, but in a very primitive form: pixels
and points. The PI is developing algorithms to analyze this raw data to build
semantically labeled 3D models: 1) new methods for discovering correspondence
relationships between heterogeneous data types, focusing on LIDAR, images, and
3D polygonal models found in online repositories, 2) new ways to infer surface
geometry, segmentations, and labels simultaneously based on a model learned from
examples, 3) new interactive systems to allow users to visualize and guide the
algorithms as they operate by incorporating user input into incrementally
updated solutions, and 4) data management algorithms for multiresolution
storage, compression, and retrieval of massive scanned 3D data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goals of the project include educational
programs, industrial collaboration, free distribution of software and data sets,
and outreach activities. Besides the published research results, the PI will
disseminate 3D models of major cities that can be used directly in applications
developed by other people. He will also distribute code, benchmark data sets,
and statistical models that could benefit researchers in a variety of
disciplines. This proposed work is integrated with educational programs,
including interdisciplinary workshops and courses at the graduate,
undergraduate, and professional levels, and diversity enhancement programs that
promote opportunities for disadvantaged groups
