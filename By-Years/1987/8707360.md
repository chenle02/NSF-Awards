The goal of this Research Planning Grant is to perform preliminary studies
directed towards identification of the colchicine binding site on tubulin. The
specific objectives are to 1) synthesize several novel affinity and
photolabeling derivative of colchicine in which the labile groups are positioned
at points on the molecule predicted to be within or very close to the interior
of the colchicine binding site on tublin, 2) assess the affinity of these
ligands for the colchicine site on tubulin through appropriate competition
binding experiments and 3) determine whether covalent bond formation between the
derivative and tubulin results after photolysis of its ligand-tubulin complex.
