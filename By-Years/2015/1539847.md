1539847 &lt;br/&gt;Carlson, Ross P. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support will help
ensure the success of the meeting by partially defraying conference costs for
select US academic scientists and engineers with an emphasis on underrepresented
groups and graduate students. In the absence of NSF support, many US academic
scientists and graduate students would not be able to attend and to benefit from
interactions with the international community of metabolic analysis/engineering
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of US
investigators and graduate students in the Metabolic Pathway Analysis meeting to
be held in Braga, Portugal from June 8-12, 2015. The meeting has a primary focus
on the structural (topological) analysis of metabolic networks, and in
particular techniques allied to linear algebra, linear programming and computer
modelling. This focus may be applied at many levels of abstraction, from
individual reaction mechanisms, through pathways, organelles, whole organisms
and, most recently, mixed populations. Covered topics will include Metabolic
pathway analysis, Metabolic flux analysis, Elementary mode analysis, Metabolic
modelling, Metabolic engineering, Genome scale modelling.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award from the Biotechnology and Biochemical
Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-sponsored by the Synthetic and
Systems Biology Program of the Molecular and Cell Biology Division.
