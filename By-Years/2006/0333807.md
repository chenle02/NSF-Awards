This project is a second-generation analysis of the ICEMELT and HOTSPOT data
sets that will focus on four areas where additional work could lead to a
fundamental new understanding of plume dynamics and plume-ridge interactions at
Iceland. This work will (1) determine seismic velocity structure in the crust
and uppermost mantle, (2) constrain upper mantle flow from mantle anisotropy,
(3) improve mantle velocity structures by application of advanced methods, and
(4) integrate seismic and geodynamic models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
