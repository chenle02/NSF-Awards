The Glossary of Meteorology has been a major reference tool in the atmospheric
and related sciences since its publication in 1959. Given the growth of
terminology over the past three decades, the Glossary is overdue for a major
update. Under this award, the update will be accomplished by making extensive
use of a large network of volunteer scientists who will serve as subject
specialists for the writing and reviewing of definitions of terms for the
Glossary. A small permanent staff, headed by a chief editor, will oversee and
direct this enormous administrative effort as well as provide guidance and
editorial support to ensure the technical consistency of the resulting updated
volume. Plans include release of the Glossary in an electronic format as well as
in print. Joining NSF in the support of this project are NOAA, DOE, DOD, and
EPA.
