9422338 Mehregany A rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system will
be purchased for MEMS Processing. RTCVD provides higher deposition rates for
polysilicon, silicon dioxide and silicon nitride in comparison with low pressure
chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). As a result this proposal requests $50,000 in
equipment funds to construct a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVC)
system for MEMS processing. RTCVD provides higher deposition rates for
polysilicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride in comparison with low
pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). As a result, single-wafer processing
and deposition of thicker films become two important practical features of
RTCVD. Both of these features are valuable for MEMS processing. The former
enables rapid prototyping of ideas and the latter provides for enhanced device
design flexibility. Additionally, the low thermal budget associated with RTCVD
enables development of integrated MEMS processes in which micromachining is
carried out on wafers with electronics, fabricated prior to or mixed in with the
micromachining steps. ***
