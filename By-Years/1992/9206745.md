Desorption of atoms from surfaces is being investigated with ultrafast
spectroscopic techniques and surface microscopy. The work should lead to real-
time visualization of desorption phenomena down to time scales of 10-13 sec in
selected systems. The atomic force microscope is employed to image surfaces of
ionic insulators eroded by desorption of substrate atoms. The work seeks to
correlate atomically resolved surface defects on compound semiconductors, such
as gallium phosphide, with special desorption sites identified in sub-gap laser-
induced sputtering. Two-photon ultrafast spectroscopy is used to obtain dynamic
data on surface defect states in insulators. Desorption from insulator material
surfaces induced by electronic excitation is an important concern in application
areas such as component survivability in earth orbit, intense pulsed ion sources
for accelerators, sputter erosion and deposition of films, laser ablation, and
laser cleaning.
