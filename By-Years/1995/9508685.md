9508685 Meng This research involves the evolutionary relationships of rodents,
lagomorphs and certain extinct taxa (Glires) both to one another and to other
higher mammalian taxa. Data analyzed will include tooth enamel microstructure,
dental, cranial and postcranial characters from fossil and recent gliriform
mammals. Phylogenetic relationships will be reconstructed using computer
assisted cladistic methods. %%% The significance of the study is one of
providing testable hypotheses of higher level mammalian phylogeny as well as
those of the origins and evolution of Glires, many of which are currently under
rigorous debate. In addition, important new fossil material from Mongolia and
China will be prepared and studied by direct observation and by scanning
electron microscopy. ***
