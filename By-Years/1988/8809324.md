This research investigates the use of parallel computation systems (systems of
many computing elements operating simultaneously) for knowledge representation,
reasoning, and problem solving in large knowledge based systems. Experimental
studies of computer performance are coupled with theoretical analysis of the
algorithms involved. The importance of this research is that it significantly
advances the usefulness of parallel computing power for real knowledge based
applications. This award is being funded as one of the 1988 Research Initiation
Awards for outstanding new investigators in the Computer and Information Science
and Engineering (CISE) Directorate.
