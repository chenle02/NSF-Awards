The principal investigators will continue their study of the homotopy of
instanton moduli spaces. They will use the relationship between instantons and
holomorphic bundles to continue work related to their recent solution of the
Atiyah- Jones conjecture. The principal investigators will also study families
of compact, non-homogeneous Einstein manifolds of positive scalar curvature.
This award will support research in the general area of differential geometry
and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship
between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space.
Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties
of a space by piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of
mathematics in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules,
liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
