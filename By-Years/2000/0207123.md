Dr. Epstein is presently a professor in the Mathematics department at the
University of Pennsylvania. He proposes to spend a year visiting the magnetic
resonance research group in the Radiology Department of the Hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Felix Wehrli has agreed to be his host.
While there he will study topics related to magnetic resonance imaging and gain
hands on experience with imaging apparatus. His study will be directed toward
determining the practical feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging using an
inhomogeneous background field and non-linear gradient fields. The initial part
of this problem involves the analysis of certain special solutions of Maxwell's
equations. The next step is to study the practical invertibility of a class of
integral transforms which are perturbations of the standard Fourier transform.
Hopefully this will lead up to designs for magnets whose fields, though
inhomogeneous, can still be used for magnetic resonance imaging. The ultimate
goal is to build a working prototype. If inhomogeneous field imaging should
prove feasible it could reduce the cost of the imaging apparatus and increase
the flexibility and applicability of this technology. This IGMS project is
jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
