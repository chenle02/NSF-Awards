Shoreline Community College will upgrade its Clean Energy Technology curriculum
and add long-term project-based learning experiences that develop higher levels
of software and engineering skills. By developing a curriculum that addresses
industry-identified needs and contains job-specific experiences, the revitalized
program will help students develop a skillset that prepares them for high-skill
technology jobs in the field of clean energy. Currently, there is no national
title for a clean energy technologist. However, Shoreline's industry advisory
board has identified a need for such a position and this project will develop
skill standards that align with industry needs. The ultimate results of this
project will be expediting Shoreline graduates' placement into energy management
jobs, and contributing new materials to the ATE
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goals are: 1) to identify and
define skill standards for a Clean Energy Technologist curriculum using Job Task
Analysis, Job Market Survey, focus groups, gap analysis, and Developing a
Curriculum (DACUM); 2) to develop authentic field experiences that simulate
authentic job-related activities through project-based laboratory experiences;
and 3) to increase regional awareness and interest in clean energy technology by
engaging with high school STEM teachers. Project evaluation will provide an
outside, independent perspective on the effectiveness of the project. Project
activities, measurements, instruments, and outcomes will be shared with other
departments and schools through presentations and professional development
activities, and through the ATE community.
