Working in a Disabled Citizens Computer Center, which will be part of the
National Education Special Alliance established by Apple Computer, a team will
develop and test modified educational software for use by visually-handicapped
individuals. Under the direction of experienced staff loaned by the American
Printing House for the Blind (APH), existing educational software from the
Minnesota Educational Computing Center will be modified to give speech/auditory
output. Much of the work of conversion will be done by students in computer
classes from the Louisville Central High School Computer Technology Career
Magnet Program; the educational opportunity provided for these students is an
important element of the program. Teachers will be trained to use the materials
and will test its utility in practice. Dissemination of finished materials and
recommended methods of use will be through the Apple sponsored network and APH.
Cost sharing by the partners will total 31% of the NSF funding.
