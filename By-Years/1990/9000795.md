The geologic histories of the Taconic Fold/Trust Belt, the Cambro-Ordovician
Platform, the Adirondack massif of eastern New York and western Vermont, and the
Main coastal volcanic province are reasonably well-understood. In fact, this
area has served as a foundation for the development of ideas relating plate
tectonic processes to the growth of mountain belts (e.g. Rogers, 1968; Zen,
1971; Bird and Dewey, 1971). While the general geologic history and major
processes are known, there remain many second- order problems which require
resolution. This proposal presents a number of geological research projects
which are both tractable to undergraduate juniors and seniors and are of
significance in refining our understanding of the region. We will also offer
students the opportunity to work on problems related to aqueous geochemistry,
clay mineralogy, paleontology and geomorphology. All proposed summer projects
will be supervised by faculty at Colgate University, with additional fall-
semester follow-up independent course work available at cooperating
institutions.
