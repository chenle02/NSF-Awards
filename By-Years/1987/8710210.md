The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the extent to which patterns
of muscle function in animals can be modified. Key general questions addressed
by this research include the following. (1) To what extent do patterns of muscle
function change during development, and what causes the changes that are found
to occur? (2) To what extent do patterns of muscle function differ among both
closely related and distantly related species of animals? (3) How dependent are
patterns of muscle function on the environment that animals are found in? These
questions will be studied using quantitative techniques to measure muscle
function and statistically test for differences among species, among
developmental stages, and among experimental treatments. The skull musculature
in salamanders and turtles is used as an experimental system to investigate
these questions. These organisms were chosen because they allow comparisons of
muscle function in different environments and muscle function can be studied
throughout development. This research will contribute to our understanding of he
biomechanics of muscle work in vertebrates the physiology of complex movement
sequences and the evolution of feeding behavior in lower vertebrates.
