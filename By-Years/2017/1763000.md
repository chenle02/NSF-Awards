This award will contribute to the Nation's prosperity and welfare by
capitalizing on the increased availability and accessibility of data to improve
operational decision making. Operational decisions are ubiquitous in all aspects
of the commercial economy, and even incremental improvements in operations can
have major impacts in the competitiveness of such sectors as transportation,
logistics, healthcare delivery, supply chain management. Similarly, public
sector service operations involve decision making to wisely invest limited
public resources. The ongoing data revolution has created great opportunities
for leveraging large scale data to improve operational decision making. This
award will support research in new techniques to make effective use of these
data in the management of operations. This project provides a broadly applicable
framework for addressing operational decisions and will result in improved
performance and efficiency in practice. The project will involve outreach
engagements with diverse organizations, including a nonprofit foster care
agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current operational decision-making often involve
two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. These tasks are usually
addressed sequentially: key parameters are first predicted using modern
statistical machine learning tools, and then planning decisions are made using
these predictions within a complex optimization model. This project advances a
new, broadly applicable framework, called Smart "Predict, then Optimize" (SPO),
that effectively addresses the prediction and optimization challenges in tandem.
In this new framework, operational performance is measured by the true objective
value of the solutions generated from the predicted parameters. This project
investigates the statistical and computational properties of novel loss
functions in the SPO framework, including convex surrogates as well as non-
convex formulations. The project will also develop new algorithms for training
machine learning models, such as linear models, logistic models, and decision
trees, using the new loss functions, and will extend the SPO framework to handle
regularization, robustness, different data primitives, and dynamic data
collection with exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
