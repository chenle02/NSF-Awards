Professor Mu-Tao Wang proposes to apply the method of geometric analysis to
study several problems in general relativity (GR) and geometric flows. He will
further investigate properties of quasilocal mass and energy-momentum which he
recently discovered with Shing-Tung Yau. Immediate goals include solving the
optimal isometric embedding equation, understanding monotone and sub-additive
properties of the quasilocal mass, and anchoring the definition of quasilocal
angular momentum. Professor Wang plans to continue his research on the mean
curvature flow of Lagrangian submanifolds. Immediate goals include proving the
global existence and convergence of the flow in two cases (1) graphs of
symplectomorphisms of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds (2) exact Lagrangian
submanifolds of cotangent bundles, and applying these results to Lagrangian
isotopy problems.

Due to the non-local feature of gravitational energy, the ADM or Bondi mass
only finds its expression at infinity where gravitation is weak. However, most
observable physical models are finitely extended regions and measurement of
mass/energy on such a region is essential in many fundamental issues in GR.
Professor Wang's newly discovered quasi-local energy evaluates the total energy
contained in any bounded region of the universe even if the effect of
gravitation is very strong. The proposed research will further our understanding
of gravitational energy in large scale and of problems related to black holes.
Professor Wang purposes to study the ``mean curvature flow" of surfaces. This
flow is like the heat equation which dissipates curvature distributions and
deforms a surface into an equilibrium state. He plans to apply this flow to
connect a general surface to ones with optimal shape. This procedure will help
us understand the geometry and topology of such surfaces. It is also important
in applied areas such as computer graphics and image processing.
