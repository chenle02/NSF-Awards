Individual doctoral training programs in social psychology cannot span the broad
range of concepts, content areas, and methodological skills that define the
field. Even the very best graduate students tend to have significant gaps in
what they know and what type of research they are prepared to do. To address the
training needs of contemporary students of social psychology, the Society for
Personality and Social Psychology has initiated a new Summer Institute in Social
Psychology. The summer institutes provide graduate students and early-career
professionals with two weeks of intensive instruction and supervision from
senior social psychologists, and important opportunities for professional
development and networking. The biennial summer institutes are staffed by
leading researchers and modeled after the successful summer programs organized
by the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology. The institutes
are coordinated by an advisory committee appointed and overseen by the Society
for Personality and Social Psychology. This grant provides support for the first
three summer institutes during the summers of 2003, 2005, and 2007.&lt;br/&gt;
