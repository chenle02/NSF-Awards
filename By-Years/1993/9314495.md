ATM-9314495 Barnett Univ. of Cal San Diego Title: Study of Global Climate
Dynamics and Interdecadal Variability This is a two-pronged proposal aimed at i)
explaining the dynamics and thermodynamics responsible for the maintenance and
seasonal and interannual movement of the Indo-Pacific warm pool, and ii) the
space-time scales of interdecadal climate change and the physics responsible for
this variability. The research will use a wide range of numerical models, from
simple to the most complex coupled GCMs, and extensive sets of observed data.
Rigorous statistical techniques will be used on the model/observed data sets to
elucidate the physics responsible for the simulated/observed climate
variability. This research is important because it serves as a foundation for
examining the predictability of climate on a variety of time scales.
