This grant is for an Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. The program will run for 8 weeks during the summer and
the students will actively engage in mathematical research. The students will be
guided by four faculty members whose research interests cover graph theory,
matroid theory, and game theory. These are all areas of discrete mathematics and
the projects all have an applied flavor. Each student will be involved in
reading mathematical literature, identifying interesting problems, synthesizing
existing knowledge in creative ways to solve problems, communicating work
completed in both oral and written forms, and collaborating with other students
on different aspects of similar problems. There will be extensive formal and
informal faculty interaction with students. Several mechanisms are planned to
facilitate each student's continued research into the following academic year.
An aim of this program is that the participants will be better prepared and
motivated to choose a career in research mathematics.
