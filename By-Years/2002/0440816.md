The PI proposes to convene a community-wide workshop on water as a complex
environmental system entitled: Water: Challenges at the Intersection of Human
and Natural Systems. They hope to stimulate community interest and focus the
direction of future research which the Foundation is currently not addressing in
its funding portfolio. Some examples of high priority topics include: river
systems as a continuum; processes at interfaces; intensively managed or
engineered systems; large-scale processes; biological mediation and processing;
functions in aqueous solution; decision-making and processing information,
uncertainty; cyber-infrastructure; modeling for dynamical complex systems; and
innovative technologies for human utilization. The aim would be to produce
recommendations that could then be used to articulate the community's vision for
the next generation of research which might be reviewed by the AC-ERE in its
advisory process.
