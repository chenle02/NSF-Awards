This project plans to further develop a comprehensive platform to compute
Collective Social Intelligence from social media data. It currently uses Twitter
as a starting point, and brings in news, multimedia, Wikipedia and Linked Open
Data as complementary data and background knowledge for analysis. Its detailed
analysis encompasses spatio-temporal-thematic (where, when, what), people-
content-networking (who and how), and emotion-sentiment-intent (perceptions &
impact). While social media capabilities are currently predominately used as a
means of delivering messages, this technology is designed to gain insights and
potentially predict trends using data gathered from social media.

Social media analysis will have broad implications on gaining insights on a wide
variety of human activities, ranging from business to science and engineering.
This project plans to support transitioning research on advanced social media
analysis techniques and early state technology into their real world products
and services to potentially help improve the quality of decision-makers and
their products.
