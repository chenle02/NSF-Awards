Wichita State University TITLE: I-SEE Paradigm for Multi-Disciplinary Learning
and Collaboration

Abstract

The ultimate goal of this implementation project is to develop a plan to produce
the multi-disciplinary engineering-team graduate. This will be a person, who
exhibits all the attributes required by the Accreditation Board for Engineering
and Technology (ABET), along with a new attribute, being collaborative-
engineering and team skill savvy. The implementation project will facilitate
transformation of the curriculum from a set of separate unconnected programs and
courses to one in which they are connected via a common unifying theme on
design. This transformation involves more than including the design in the
courses but also the integration of multiple perspectives into the learning
process. In the planning project, the planning team will devise methods for
assisting faculty and students with this transformation. At the completion of
the planning project, the methods and scaffolding will be documented ready for
implementation and dissemination.

This process will be facilitated in ways that incorporate the best teaching
practices validated through current educational research and current research
about learning and cognition.
