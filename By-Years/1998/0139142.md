This award provides funding to Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) for the
support of a renewal five-year, REU Site entitled "Undergraduate Research:
Hybrid Synthesis of Advanced 3D Structures," under the direction of Dr. Subha K.
Kumpaty. This ten-week summer program will involve nine students annually in
research in areas in hybrid synthesis and fabrication working closely with
undergraduate and graduate students in MSOE's exciting Centers of Excellence. A
broad mix of students, typically 50% women and 25-30% underrepresented
minorities, from other institutions programs will be recruited for the program.
