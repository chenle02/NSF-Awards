The main objective of the proposed work is to gain an understanding of the
mechanisms involved in heat transfer to boundary layers with local, periodic
unsteadiness caused by vortex shedding. In particular, the study will attempt to
separate the effects of the unsteadiness from those of the background
turbulence, for a flow around an obstacle projecting through the boundary layer.
The main experimental technique to be used will be simultaneous measurements of
velocities and temperatures within the flow field using a turbulent heat flux
probe. Reynolds heat flux and Reynolds stress, mean and time resolved Stanton
number measurements will be obtained.
