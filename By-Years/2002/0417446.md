Patient-Specific Mathematical Models of the Heart for Simulation-Based Medical
Planning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas J. R. Hughes, Principal
Investigator&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
will endeavor to create the first patient-specific, computational models of the
human heart. The models will constitute the first step in the process of
"predictive medicine," in which interventions are planned, analyzed and
optimized, based on predicted outcomes analogous to the design process of modern
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will require the synthesis of state-of-the-art methodologies and
development of new procedures in medical imaging data acquisition, solid
modeling, mesh generation, valve modeling, and simulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of
the research is to provide cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons with vastly
improved technologies to treat cardiovascular disease, resulting in lower
morbidity and mortality, reduced re-operative rates, and lessened post-operative
recovery time.&lt;br/&gt;
