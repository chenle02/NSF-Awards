The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is an imaging system with complete flexibility in focus and zoom while
keeping the sample and all optical lenses stationary. The system will alter
magnification without mechanical motion, allowing inspection of samples during
manufacturing processes with 100x faster focus and zoom. The attachment will
easily integrate with benchtop microscopes for failure analysis, quality
assurance in manufacturing, electrophysiology, and cryogenic applications; these
solutions can be used in the food, petroleum, and pharmaceutical industries,
among others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase II project will
develop fast, small- and large-diameter MEMS mirrors and demonstrate them in a
zoom and focus system made for microscopy. Gross electronic focus control
capability has only recently become available, enabling the development of new
standard optical design practices to best utilize varifocus elements and
characterize imaging performance, since traditional optical analyses assume
fixed focal length lenses or mirrors. The proposed technology has potential
applications in cameras, wide-field, confocal and two-photon microscopes,
optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic imaging systems. In this project, a
series of MEMS mirrors in combination with standard optics capable of rapid 2x
zoom with additional focusing abilities will be developed, enabling a typical
20x optical microscopy to rapidly zoom to 40x. The technical objectives are: 1)
improve fabrication and packaging processes on MEMS mirrors; 2) automate
characterization of their focusing range and dynamic behavior; 3) design a small
form factor, large bandwidth, high-voltage amplifier; and 4) characterize the
imaging performance of complete optical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
