The proposed research will use an electrochemical technique to synthesize
composition modulated semiconductor alloys. The effort is directed toward
optimal conditions for the deposition of device quality CuInSe2 films and
discrete layered superlattices from the Cu-In-Se system. This research will
investigate the feasibility of micromodulated electrodeposition to produce
homogenous and heterogenous epitaxial films. The proposed work will involve
voltametric screening of electrolytes, electrosynthesis, and characterization of
the superlattices.
