This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will evaluate a
rice cell culture system for the production of recombinant gelatin (rGelatin)
designed for improved capsule performance.

The commercial application of this project will be on capsule manufacturers
serving the pharmaceutical industry. Plant systems used to create rGelatin will
offer a lower cost production system compared to other recombinant platforms.
Such a recombinant product will be safer than animal-derived gelatin and more
acceptable to many consumers. Further, the proposed technology will have the
potential to produce customized rGelatin for specific applications.
