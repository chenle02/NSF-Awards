Many software applications consist of many components that must compute in
parallel and independently of each other and yet must coordinate their
activities to achieve the overarching goal. Developers refer to this scenario as
concurrent programming, and they consider the creation of concurrent software as
one of the most difficult problems around. The investigator and his team are
studying a novel solution to this problem. Their approach is to think of
concurrent software systems as a collection of conversing actors. Like in real
conversations, these actors exchange words and refer back to the context of
ideas that a conversation has established so far. The investigator's key insight
is to create a special purpose notation for programming these two aspects of
conversations explicitly. Preliminary investigations show that this notation
greatly facilitates programming concurrent systems and thinking about their
coordination efforts. The project will directly impact the evolution of future
programming languages and indirectly affect the lives of working programmers.

Technically, the project injects two entirely new ideas into the so-called actor
model of computation. The first is an explicitly managed space of shared
assertions. Using this space, actors can establish a common state, modify it in
a controlled manner, and get informed when changes happen. When an actor
crashes, its portion of the shared state is automatically withdrawn, making it
possible to easily cope with failures and thus making the system resilient. The
second idea is a language for programming actor interactions, including message
sending and state sharing. While this new language restricts how actors interact
and what they interact about, it will enable language designers to provide type
systems and model checkers that statically enforce adherence to protocols and
verify that the concurrent software system will achieve its specified goals.
