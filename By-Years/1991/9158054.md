Magnetic suspension techniques are quite promising for the control of precision
motion, since they eliminate the high surface finish requirements of traditional
mechanical bearings, and allow the direct control of stage dynamics. The goal of
this project is to investigate magnetic suspension techniques for precision
motion control at the nanometer level. To achieve such performance requires
advances in sensors, mechanical design, and the design and control of
electromagnetic actuators. Initial experimental effort will focus on the design
and construction of a prototype linear bearing and motor system which is
designed to achieve one nanometer resolution with a travel of 50 millimeters.
Envisioned application areas for the developed technology are precision stages
for photolithography, scanned probe microscopy, and other precision
manufacturing tasks.
