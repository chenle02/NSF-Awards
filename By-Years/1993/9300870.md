The primary goal of Professor Smith's project is to obtain from satellite data
estimates of the distribution of vertical heating over the southwest portion of
the monsoon region in East Asia for a three year period. The project involves
the development of new retrieval algorithms for Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
(SSM/I) data. Estimates of precipitating rain and ice are produced from which
latent heating profiles are deduced. These estimates, combined with satellite-
derived radiative cooling estimates, will then be used to analyze the meridional
circulation and atmospheric energy budgets in the region. In addition, Professor
Smith will examine the heat sources and sinks over the Tibetan and Mongolian
Plateaus. Dr. Smith is one of a very few university scientists working on the
critically area. Research of this type is essential if we are to realize the
potential for remotely sensed information from satellites.
