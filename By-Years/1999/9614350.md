9614350 Shearer This research is to continue analyses of global seismic data
sets to resolve details of deep Earth structure. These studies include the use
of broadband discontinuity reflections to examine details of the topography,
brightness, strength and sharpness of the transition zone velocity
discontinuities, stacking of short-period data to image PKP and PKKP precursors
and constrain small-scale mantle heterogeneity and core-mantle boundary
topography, experiments in global event detection and location, and development
of unified models of 3D mantle structure which include discontinuity topography.
