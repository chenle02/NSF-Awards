This symposium is a premiere forum for research involving the interaction of
computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. It brings together
leading researchers from these diverse communities to facilitate significant
collaboration and cross-fertilization of research ideas to advance the state of
the art in computing. The purpose of this outreach activity is to support travel
for students and faculty who might otherwise not attend ASPLOS. The primary goal
is to increase participation of underrepresented minorities (including women)
and faculty members from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions by actively seeking out
and giving priority to these persons when awarding travel grants.
