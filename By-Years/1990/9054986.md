The Herff College of Engineering at Memphis State University will initiate a
four-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Engineering, Mathematics and
Physics for 16 students entering grade 9. A ten-week pre-summer session will
introduce concepts in algebra, geometry and trigonometry which will be
reinforced with laboratory exercises involving surveying methods, electrical
circuits, and queuing problems. During the four-week summer session students
will examine simple hydraulic and modelling problems and develop a scale model
of a proposed construction project. During the nine-week post-summer session
career opportunities will be explored.
