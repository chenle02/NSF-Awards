This supplementary award is to support the mathematical research of Professor
Selim Tuncel on the project of the principal investigator, Professor Lind. The
subject is a branch of ergodic theory called symbolic dynamics. A symbolic
dynamical system is a collection of two-way infinite strings of symbols from a
finite alphabet satisfying a formation rule that specifies which symbols are
allowed to follow which as one moves along the string. Two such systems are
equivalent if there is a well- behaved bijection between them that respects the
operation of shifting. A central theme in this area is the classification of
symbolic dynamical systems. Professor Tuncel will study invariants for these and
related systems, including the beta function for Markov chains and an algebraic
invariant resulting from dimension modules and an additional element of
structure called the scaffold. Cellular automata and block codes between
Bernoulli shifts are additional research topics. The mathematical structures
studied in this project have found considerable use as models for communication
and data systems.
