The project goal is to upgrade the quality of the undergraduate physiology
laboratory by purchasing four 4-channel datagraph recorders which have the
capacity to measure many of the important physiological parameters that are
emphasized in the physiology courses. Previously only some of these phenomena
were included in laboratory exercises due to equipment limitations. The scope of
the laboratory portion of the physiology courses (which have served
approximately 340 women students in the past five years) is being greatly
enhanced. The data graphs are being used, for example, to demonstrate blood
pressure regulation, cardiac alterations in response to varying stimuli, and
variations observable on the electrocardiogram when the subject is at rest or
exercising. Previously there was no true exercise component to the lab
experiments, not even in the areas of cardiovascular or respiratory physiology.
The addition of these instruments to the laboratory permits the development of
two important new exercises. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award
with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
