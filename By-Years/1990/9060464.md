This proposed research concerns a new category of educational tools to which we
have given the generic name "Classroom Communication Systems." Classroom
Communication Systems are computer based communication tools for teachers and
students in the classroom, and in many respects are fundamentally unpretentious
in their aspirations. Nevertheless in early testing in large first year college
Physics and Engineering classes prototype systems have shown that they are
capable of producing remarkable results. Students report that they understand
the subject better, enjoy class more, and work harder. The Professor who has
pioneered the pedagogy for using the systems reports that his large class seems
much smaller, and that the atmosphere in the class is substantially improved.
The ultimate objective of the proposed research program is to determine whether
Classroom Communication Systems are capable of producing something close to a
small group Socratic environment even in a large classroom. The work focuses on
scientific, engineering and mathematics instruction at a range of educational
levels. The specific objectives for Phase I include generalizing the prototype
question structure, selecting and/or modifying an appropriate pedagogical
framework for use with such systems, conducting limited tests based on this
work, in college level Physics Classes.
