This award supports participant travel for the Workshop on Modern Perspectives
in Applied Mathematics, held at the Courant Institute of the Mathematical
Sciences, 18-22 May 2009. The conference brings together leading experts in
stochastic and multi-scale modeling to discuss the extent to which recent
advances have enabled further progress in the field and possible lines of attack
for open problems.

Specific themes discussed at the conference include: (1) Advances in stochastic
partial differential equations, fluids, mean-field games, combustion, and
partial differential equations in random media. (2) Advances in stochastic
modeling techniques for the elimination of irrelevant degrees of freedom in
large dynamical systems and the derivation of effective systems for suitable
coarse-grained variables. (3) Advances in approaches for quantifying information
flow in complex systems, such as Bayesian hierarchical modeling and reduced-
order filtering strategies of Kalman type.

The program features keynote addresses, presentations by young researchers, and
an evening poster session. The three-day meeting provides graduate students and
young researchers with opportunities to present their work, to learn about
recent progress and open problems, and to meet other workers in the rapidly-
developing field.
