9360671 Gordon This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the
general area of inorganic chemistry and in the subfield of Metalorganic Chemical
Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). The objective of the Phase I research is the design,
synthesis, and decomposition studies of organolead precursors to lead titanate,
lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanum titanate (PLZT). These
materials are ferroelectric ceramics and find uses in radiation-hard memories,
electrooptic spatial light modulators, piezoelectric actuators and infrared
detectors. Currently used precursors are either too volatile and too toxic, e.g.
tetraethyllead or not volatile enough for MOCVD applications. Two new classes of
lead alkoxides will be prepared; (1) lead alkoxides with spatially demanding
ligands to prevent aggregation, an (2) cyclopentadienyllead alkoxides, believed
to be more stable than alkyllead precursors. Following purification and
characterization of the lead precursors, they will be decomposed along with
appropriate titanium and/or zirconium alkoxides to produce lead titanate or PZT
films. %%% Chemical vapor deposition of lead-based ferroelectric films is
desirable for a variety of electronic devices. Synthesis of safer, optimized
lead precursors will have an immediate effect on the market for these materials.
