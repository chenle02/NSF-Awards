Institute on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics, the latest in a
series of successful biennial institutes that date back to 1980. The purpose of
the institute is to provide instruction on advanced technology in particle-
physics experiments to a select group of young physicists at the level of recent
Ph.D.'s or advanced Ph.D. students. The award covers their travel and incidental
expenses in part. ***
