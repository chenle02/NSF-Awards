This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports
work by Professor Gary A. Lorigan in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio to probe the structure of
membrane peptides using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.
Membrane peptides are difficult to study because they are very hydrophobic.
Thus, the peptides are incorporated into a lipid bilayer membrane. The objective
of the proposed research is to develop state-of-the-art EPR spectroscopic
techniques to probe the structural properties of integral membrane peptides.
These techniques will be widely applicable to all peptide and protein systems.
The pulsed EPR technique of ESEEM spectroscopy will be used to measure short-
range distances (less than 8 Angstroms) between a spin label and deuterium
nuclei on integral membrane peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that
the ESEEM technique will become a valuable biophysical tool for measuring
distances on chemical and biological systems. EPR spectroscopy is approximately
a thousand fold more sensitive than NMR spectroscopy. This new biophysical
technique can move the field forward by providing an efficient and easy way to
distinguish between alpha-helical, 3-10-helical and beta-sheet structural
segments. The potential future benefits of this basic research are to develop
new techniques to obtain structural information on membrane proteins. This
methodology is useful for all peptides and proteins, associated with energy
shortages, electron transport, photosynthesis, and greenhouse gases. Through
this research program undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from
diverse backgrounds are trained in advanced techniques in biophysical chemistry,
helping to strengthen the US STEM workforce.
