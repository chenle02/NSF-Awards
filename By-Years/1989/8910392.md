ABSTRACT The aim of the project is to write the first Etymological Lexicon of
the Khmer (Cambodian) language. It will be a linguistically oriented work making
use of the latest advances in historical linguistic studies of the Mon-Khmer
language family. The Lexicon will present all Khmer words for which cognates can
be found elsewhere in the Mon-Khmer family, to list these cognates and
distinguish them from borrowings, and to indicate the linguistic arguments which
support these claims. Each entry will contain: the meaning of the Khmer word,
with culturally and historically relevant comments; a reconstruc- tion of the
Proto-Khmeric form; the form found in Angkorian inscriptions; the Khmer script
form; the pronunciation; several Khmer dialect forms; a list of Mon-Khmer
cognates classed by branch; a list of borrowings from Khmer, especially into the
unrelated Thai and Cham languages, but also into related lang- uages; and notes
discussing the relevant historical questions. One purpose of the Lexicon is to
place the language of theAngkor civilization, and its profound influence on
mainland Southeast Asia, in the proper historical perspective, as a medieval
transition between prehistoric Mon-Khmer times and the modern Cambodian period.
