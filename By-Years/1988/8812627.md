Description: This project supports experimental and theoretical work on atomic
scattering by Dr. James Bayfield of the Department of Physics and Astronomy,
University of Pittsburgh, and Dr. S.C. Roy of the Department of Physics, Bose
Institute, Calcutta, India. A new body of theory explaining atomic scattering
has recently developed because of the availability of results from new sensitive
detectors. There is now need to test these theoretical concepts by
experimentation. The results of these experiments will be of practical use in
the application of radioisotopes for imaging. The collaborative nature of the
work is well integrated with most of the experimental work carried out in India
by Dr. Roy and the theoretical work conducted in the U.S. by Dr. Bayfield.
Scope: This project meshes the strengths of an Indian and U.S. scientist to
address a problem of fundamental scientific importance that has immediate
practical application. The project nicely meets the objectives of the U.S.-India
Cooperative Program by supporting good science and encouraging scientific
collaboration between U.S. and Indian investigators.
