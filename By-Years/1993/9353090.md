9353090 Fisher The Mathematicians and Education Reform Forum (MER) proposes to
institutionalize a program developed over the past 5 years. The mission of MER
"...is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of mathematicians...in K-14
mathematics education, and to promote the professional recognition of
educational work within the mathematics community". The dissemination effort for
3 years focusses on: (1) workshops to facilitate change in the college
preparation of mathematics teachers; (2) establishing links between MER and 7
professional mathematics organizations for the purpose of bringing about change
among the individual members of those organizations; (3) establishing and e-mail
newsletter and network; (4) holding a video teleconference; (5) publishing a
newsletter for 5,500 mathematicians; and (6) integrating the functions of MER
with the American Mathematical Society (AMS). The effort is guided by a core
group of four leaders and a steering committee of key national figures. ***
