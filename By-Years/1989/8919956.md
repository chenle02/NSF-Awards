Long-term sediment trap deployment provide an opportunity to examine the
fidelity of deep-sea sediments as recorders of near-surface oceanic processes.
Such studies are important because a fundamental assumption of paleoceanographic
research is that the micropaleontologic and sediment chemistry record can be
used to examine changes in sea surface conditions over long geologic time
scales. The present recommended award will support a multitracer study of the
relation of "imput" and "preservation" in marine sediments. The use of stable
isotope, geochemical, and micropaleontologic criteria should allow an accurate
assessment surface water input. The field phase of the project will deploy an
array of sediment traps in the California Current system which has strong
seasonal gradients in net productivity and surface oceanography. Analyses on the
sediment trap material and surface sediments will be used to develop a set of
independent proxies for net productivity. Components most likely to provide this
information include: biogenous, calcareous, and siliceous microfossils; barite
and bio-limiting trace elements such as copper and zinc; and organic matter and
certain of its nitrogenous compounds including iodine, bromine, and phosphorous.
Such analyses should correlated to net biologic productivity.
