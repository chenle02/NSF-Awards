The normal program of early embryonic development is initiated when an oocyte
is fertilized by a sperm. The mechanism by which sperm activate oocytes and the
role of sperm components in this process and in later stages of embryogenesis
are not understood. This project takes a combined genetic and molecular approach
to studying this problem, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model
system. The PI has already identified a gene that encodes a sperm-supplied
product that is required for initiation of the correct program of early
embryonic development in C. elegans. Mutations in this gene, called spe-11,
result in paternal-effect embryonic lethality: wild-type oocytes, when
fertilized by sperm from mutant worms, undergo very abnormal early development
and die. This is not due to the presence of a "poisonous product" in mutant
sperm but to reduced levels or absence of wild-type product. Thus, wild-type
spe-11 product participates, either directly or indirectly, in initiating the
normal program of early development in C. elegans. This project has two major
aims: 1) To clone and molecularly characterize the spe-11 gene, and localize the
spe-11 gene product in sperm and newly fertilized embryos. 2) To carry out
screens for additional paternal-effect embryonic-lethal mutations, which will
identify other genes that encode sperm-supplied factors required for normal
embryo development. This effort will complement the wealth of information on
oocyte factors and will begin to define the sperm's contributions to early
embryogenesis.
