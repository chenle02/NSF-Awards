With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Gellman of the
University of Wisconsin is investigating the noncovalent bonding factors in
molecular associations. The focus of the research is to determine the
contributions that factors such as hydrophobic interactions, pi stacking and
dipole-dipole attraction make on molecular recognition and folding. Model
compounds are being prepared to test each factor and NMR spectroscopy is the
analysis technique. Molecular systems in biology and materials associate to form
functional assemblies that have beneficial properties such as strength, chemical
reaction catalysis and general biological activity. This investigation is
designed to characterize some of the individual factors responsible for the
formation of these functional assemblies.
