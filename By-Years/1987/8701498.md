Operator theory is a central discipline in Modern Analysis. Its origins lie in
the study of mathematical physics and partial equations in the early twentieth
century. At that time, it was seen that numerous physical problems in the theory
of equilibria, vibration, quantum theory, etc. could be studied productively via
the integral equations that model the phenomena. In the ensuing years, the
subject of operator theory has grown to a central position in such
investigations, and in core mathematics as well. Also central to Modern Analysis
is the related discipline of operator algebras in which one studies collections
of operators simultaneously. As the mathematical construct which best transfers
the concepts of probability, measure theory, topology, and geometry to
noncommutative contexts, operator algebras relate to a rich and important array
of applications, from within mathematics itself to physics and microbiology. The
research of Professor Paulsen bridges both operator theory and operator
algebras. A careful analysis of the internal structure theory of operator
algebras and the maps between them is an increasingly important subject, and
Professor Paulsen is an expert in such matters. In prior research, Professor
Paulsen obtained important results concerning completely bounded maps between
C*-algebras. His recent book on this subject is expected to open new areas of
research for both single operator theorists as well as operator algebraists. In
his current program, Professor Paulsen will study joint K-spectral sets,
subnormal models, and Hilbert modules over function algebras. The former study
should lead to insights into tensor products of nonself-adjoint operator
algebras. The second area explores aspects of dilation theory, and the latter
project relates to several topics in operator theory.
