This project develops a signal processing laboratory equipped with the necessary
hardware and software to analyze speech and music signals and conduct other
signal processing experiments. Using the PC based Tektronix TMS320, Signal
Processing Microcomputer, students design digital filters, compare the
performance of different design methods, and implement digital filter designs in
machine language code. The students also program the TMS320 for other digital
signal processing applications, such as Fast Fourier Transforms, real time
spectral analysis and speech and music analysis and synthesis. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
