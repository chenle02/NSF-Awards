Honeybees from Europe, Africa and South America presently inhabit regions of
North America, and are displaying varying abilities to hybridize. The various
behavioral traits of these populations are important to the bee-keeping
industry, and to pest management. Dr. Smith proposes a two-year study of
hybridization between African and other honeybees in the New World. The study
would utilize morphometrics and mitochondrial DNA analysis, and would result in
a better understanding of the current state of these races and of the degree to
which they have hybridized. The proposed work has implications for evolutionary
studies of hybridization, for bee ecology and behavior, and for the bee- keeping
industry. The project is timely because the status of the hybridization process
can change so rapidly. The plan for combining mitochondrial DNA research with
morphometric analysis will provide a new standard for work in this area.
