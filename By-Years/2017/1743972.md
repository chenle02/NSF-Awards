Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project supports research at the
University of Pittsburgh aimed at the discovery of a new class of quantum states
and means to control them. This work helps bring about fault-tolerant
topological quantum computing which is designed around braiding. Braiding is the
physical exchange of positions of yet to be demonstrated non-Abelian anyon
quasiparticles. These are particles that alter their quantum states upon
exchnage, making them distinct from already known bosons and fermions. The most
basic predicted non-Abelian anyon is a Majorana quasiparticle which is a quantum
superpoisition of electron and its antiparticle. This project aims to perform
the braiding experiment in a network of semiconductor nanowires connected to
superconductors, a device in which evidence of Majorana quasiparticles has been
obtained previously. The braiding experiment can be used to verify the non-
Abelian anyon nature of Majorana quasiparticles and pave the way to topological
quantum bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project
explores the physical exchange, or braiding, of Majorana bound states generated
at high magnetic fields in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires epitaxially
coupled to aluminum superconductors. The outcome of this work will help
establish a new class of fundamental excitations, the non-Abelian anyons, and
demonstrate a new type of a quantum bit that takes advantage of topological
protection of quantum information. Magnetic flux-based approach to manipulating
as well as detecting Majorana bound states is used in this research. The project
includes training a postdoctoral researcher in advanced nanofabrication and low
temperature measurements, as well as in the fundamental physics of non-Abelian
anyons.
