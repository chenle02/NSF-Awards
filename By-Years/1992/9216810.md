This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in experimental
physical chemistry involving Edward R. Grant of Purdue University and Helene
Lefebvre-Brion and Christian Jungen of the University of Paris-Sud. The
objective of this research is to integrate experiments with interpretive
theoretical and computational efforts in laser spectroscopy. The Purdue research
group will concentrate on experiments for producing rotational state data on
radiationless decay processes in highly excited polyatomic molecules related to
autoionization. The Paris group has developed the theory which describes the
relevant molecular photoionization processes underlying these experiments.
Preliminary results of this collaboration have stimulated theoretical activity
on the coupling limit of electronic and rotational angular momentum. And initial
theoretical results have suggest prototypes for study of cation-electronic
scattering dynamics in polyatomic molecules. Dr. Grant brings to this
collaboration his expertise as a spectroscopist and dynamicist. This is
complemented by the theoretical expertise of the French investigators in modern
molecular spectroscopy, in particular, the Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory
which offers a universal framework for understanding intramolecular dynamics.
