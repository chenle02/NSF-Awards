Cowen will study the structure of bounded linear operators on the Hardy Hilbert
space, the Bergman Hilbert space, and related spaces of analytic functions on
the unit disk, approaching problems on concretely presented operators in order
to gain insight into more general problems. He will work on unifying results
concerning composition operators on Bergman and Hardy spaces into a theory of
composition operators on spaces of analytic functions emphasizing similarities
between spaces and minimizing reliance on special features of particular spaces.
Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite
dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to
finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and
thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory is
to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
