This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Harvey Hensley of
Northwestern University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Takao
Mizusaki at Kyoto University, Japan. The team will apply Hensley's ultrasonic
methods to study nuclear ordered solid helium-3. Solid helium-3 has been of
intense interest since the discovery in 1974 that at temperatures below 1
millikelvin the nuclei in solid Helium-3 undergo a transition from a
paramagnetic state to a nuclear magnetically ordered state. To date, primarily
thermodynamic measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have
been utilized to study the nature of this transition. Mizusaki's expertise in
preparing single crystals of solid helium-3 and in studying them in their
ordered state using NMR experiments complements the acoustic methods Hensley has
developed to study superfluid helium-3. Utilizing the sophisticated cryogenic
apparatus at Kyoto University, the team will extend Hensley's acoustic methods
from superfluid to solid helium-3 and try to determine the structure of the low
field phase of nuclear magnetically ordered solid helium-3.
