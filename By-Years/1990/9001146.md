The National Supercomputer Facility at Cornell University will select 20
undergraduate students from around the country to learn about supercomputers and
to learn how they can be used to solve important scientific problems. These
students and their institutional advisers will be brought to Cornell during the
summer of 1990 to learn about supercomputer technologies and to define a problem
requiring computationally intense solutions. The students will complete their
projects for academic credit after returning to their home institutions. This
program provides a unique learning opportunity for students from small colleges
as well as for women and minority students who will be especially recruited.
