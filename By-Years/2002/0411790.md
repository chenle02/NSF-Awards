In this collaborative award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Cecil Dybowski of the University of
Delaware and Prof. Peter Beckmann of Bryn Mawr College will conduct research
with their student colleagues on solid-state NMR relaxometry of heavy-metal
salts. The goal of the research is to determine the mechanism for the recently-
observed NMR relaxation of heavy-metal, spin 1/2 metal nuclei. The ultimate goal
of the research is to connect the measured relaxation times for heavy metal
nuclei with the physical properties of the host material. The results of this
basic research may result in applications to materials
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the possible broader scientific impacts
of the research, the PIs are active in the training of the next generation of
women scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
