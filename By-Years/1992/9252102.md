The teaching of mechanics of human motion is being enhanced through the use of a
video/computer motion analysis system. The equipment used for the project is the
complete Peak Performance Two-Dimensional System consisting of a core, computer
subsystem, video subsystem, and automatic point tracking module. With this
equipment, it is possible to produce graphic and digital illustrations of the
mechanical concepts taught in undergraduate courses in anatomy and kinesiology
and biomechanics. This system permits introduction of laboratory experimentation
in these courses. In addition, the ease and affordability of working with
videotape provide opportunities for student projects.
