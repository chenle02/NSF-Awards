The objective of this project is to develop some robust and high accuracy
numerical algorithms and related mathematical theory for Hamiltonian systems.
The research efforts will be devoted to constructing "essentially" (accuracy is
in a range of the computer round-off error) volume conserving (symplectic) and
energy conserving algorithms. Some recent mathematical theory in spectral
methods, finite element superconvergence, as well as discontinuous Galerkin
methods will be employed in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenomena in
different scientific disciplines such as classical mechanics, molecular
dynamics, hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, plasma physics, relativity, and
astronomy, etc. can be described by Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The success
of the project will impact science and engineering practices. This research will
widen the body of knowledge in the scientific community on both mathematical
theory and practical algorithmic design. The project contains solid multi- and
interdisciplinary components and has wide application in scientific computing.
