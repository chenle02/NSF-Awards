This award supports the 23rd National EPSCoR Conference ?Education, Innovation,
and Entrepreneurship: EPSCoR as a Vehicle for Delivering on National Priorities?
in Nashville, Tennessee, November 2013. This conference will showcase basic-
research contributions of the 28 states, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands;
while also highlighting opportunities for EPSCoR jurisdictions to become a
vehicle for the public?s benefit through job creation, entrepreneurship,
external engagement, and innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference seeks
to identify opportunities and barriers for EPSCoR programs to support basic
research and development, education, innovation, and entrepreneurship to deliver
on national priorities. The themes coalesce around research into a collective
approach for creating and sustaining an informed and knowledgeable populace
capable of identifying and characterizing societal problems (Know), developing
the infrastructure of resources and collaboration necessary to solve these
problems (Create), and providing a framework for the effective translation of
these solutions into deployment (Implement). The conference will explore how
extensive EPSCoR knowledge and research infrastructure can be better leveraged
to accelerate knowledge discovery, and how research infrastructure and its data
streams can better contribute to the national research community. A series of
workshops are planned to create action plans for community college workforce
development and entrepreneurship as well as implementation of research-based
innovation in commercial and related application.
