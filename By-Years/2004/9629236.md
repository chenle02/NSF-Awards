9629236 Hastings This project will use models to understand the dynamics of
hybrid zones, locations where two species interbreed. The models improve on
previous ones by including more realistic descriptions of movement (for example,
the distribution of seeds around a plant) and of which individuals are likely to
survive (including survival that depends on the frequency of other individuals).
The methods include computer simulations and recent mathematical advances in
understanding complex equations. The models will be used to estimate the amounts
of selection and dispersal in natural hybrid zones. Hybrid zones are important
because they are natural laboratories where the processes of natural selection
are easier to study, since the interbreeding among different types produces
novel types. Understanding natural selection in this way has societal importance
for many issues, ranging from the preservation of biodiversity to plant and
animal breeding.
