9623716 Bozler This project is an investigation of three different materials at
ultralow temperatures while developing advanced dc SQUID amplifiers to support
this work. The first study is of the magnetic properties of superfluid 3He,
focusing on the discrepancy between SQUID and NMR measurements of the static
susceptibility. The second study is of thin films of 3He in magnetic fields
sufficiently small that a wo-dimensional nuclear ferromagnetic transition can be
manifested. In these magnetic fields, conventional NMR techniques are unusable.
Finally, electrical conduction in reduced dimensionality systems will be
studied, including the physics of disorder in artificial two-dimensional
networks of effectively one-dimensional wires. %%% This project is a study of
materials at ultralow temperatures combined with, and supported by, the
development of ultralow temperature experimental techniques, including advanced
low-noise amplifiers. At temperatures near 1 mK (0.001 degrees above Absolute
Zero) the rare isotope of helium (helium-3) changes to a superfluid whose
magnetic properties are not yet well understood. These magnetic properties will
be studied in this project. Thin films of liquid helium-3 will also be studied
because they have proved to be an excellent model for magnetism in two
dimensions. Artificial one- and two-dimensional metallic systems will be
manufactured and studied to better understand the role of disorder in natural
physical systems. ***
