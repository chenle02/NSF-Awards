9400272 Graf The Stony Brook REU Physics program will continue. The program will
bring 13 undergraduate students (all but one or two from other colleges and
universities) to Stony Brook each summer for participation in forefront physics
research in the laboratories of Stony Brook faculty members. Approximately six
Stony Brook undergraduate students, funded from other sources, will also take
part. The aim of the program is to foster interest in, and appreciation of,
scientific research in physics, through doing research in a collegial setting,
site visits to research laboratories weekly lectures on current problems in
physics and presentation of results in a formal symposium at the conclusion of
the program. The Physics program is part of a larger REU effort at Stony Brook,
encompassing nine other departments and supporting a total of over 70 REU
students each summer. Recruiting efforts concentrate on colleges in which
research opportunities are limited, and particular efforts are made to attract
women and students from under-representated minorities. ***
