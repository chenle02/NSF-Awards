This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Professor James P. Collman of the Department of Chemistry
of Stanford University on `Synthetic Studies in Homogeneous Catalysis and
Organometallic Chemistry` to synthesize and study metalloporphyrin complexes.
The work will focus on: 1) Molecular electrochemical catalysts for the multi-
electron reduction of dioxygen, 2) Equilibrium and kinetic studies of dioxygen
and carbon monoxide binding to iron porphyrins, and 3) The synthesis of multiply
bonded metal-metal porphyrin dimers. This research explores chemical models of
oxygen-binding energy producing sites in biological cells. The model compounds
produced will enhance our understanding of biological oxygen reduction, which
may lead to useful electrochemical devices to generate energy by efficiently
passing electrons to oxygen in the air. Oxygen-binding complexes may also have
practical applications in separating oxygen from air.
