This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new method of measuring how strongly a thin film anchors to its substrate. To
date no method exists that can truly measure thin film adhesion. The Acoustic
Coaxing Induced Microcaviation (ACIM) deBonder uses controlled microcavitation
to directly reveal a thin film's adhesion strength by subjecting it to
controlled erosion. ACIM is a means of constructively controlling acoustic
microcavitation. By directing ACIM's high intensity energy implosions at
specific film sites one can quantitatively determine adhesion strength.

The potential commercial benefits will be applicable to any type of film or
coating that can erode in a controlled manner by cavitation. This technique is a
nondestructive method that only uses small areas of films. No special sample
preparation is needed and the method is capable of in situ inspection.
Microelectronic manufacturing and the semiconductor industries will benefit from
this technology.
