This project uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to measure active
deformation along the rift margins of the Red Sea. The project is being
undertaken in cooperation with partner institutions in Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
Eritrea, and Sudan. The ultimate objective of this research is to understand
better the dynamics of continental rifting The approach includes both
continuously recording GPS stations installed along the rift and survey GPS
observations to determine variations in deformation style along and normal to
the rift system. The GPS results are providing new constraints on the mechanics
of continental rifting thereby adding to our understanding of the basic forces
driving continental deformation and the rheological character of the continental
lithosphere. In addition, this project is helping to transfer GPS technology to
the host-country partners and is providing quantitative information on plate
motions and rates of strain accumulation that are directly useful for evaluating
and mitigating earthquake hazards.
