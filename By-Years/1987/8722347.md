The Association of Systematic Collections will hold a workshop on Living and
Culture Collections on May 13, 1988 at the Field Museum of Natural History in
Chicago, Illinois. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss the problems of
assembling, maintaining and using living collections and other non- traditional
research collections. Zoos, botanical gardens, culture collections and other
living and frozen collections, including collections of clinical specimens and
seed banks, will be represented. The workshop will identify research needs
leading to formation of living collections, the types of collections that exist,
approaches to funding (including user fees), and problems relating to long-term
maintenance. It will also seek a mechanism to locate the existing collections
and evaluate their quality, accessibility and importance for research. The
workshop will consist of a series of roundtable sessions. Working papers will be
distributed prior to the meeting. Follow-up will include formation of a living
collections committee that will develop strategies possibly leading to
accreditation of living and culture collections. This award provides partial
funding to allow some of the key participants to attend and to defray some of
the administrative costs of preparing the working papers and reports.//
