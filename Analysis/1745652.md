This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "7th
Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry" that will be held on January 22-26, 2018 at
the Universidad de Valladolid, in Valladolid, Spain. The conference focuses on
recent developments in Analysis and Geometry, especially in the fields of
Riemann surfaces and Teichmuller theory. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award
gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers
not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
