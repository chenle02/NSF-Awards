Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antitrust agencies in the United States reviewed
over two thousand prospective mergers and acquisitions per year in recent years.
Their task is to trade off harms from market power with potential synergies that
may be passed on to consumers—and to convince a court to either block mergers
that they predict will cause significant consumer harm or to order that the
merging parties adopt remedies. These projects will study two aspects of
antitrust enforcement in the US. First, the project will document the realized
price and quantity effects of mergers that have been approved, studying a near-
universe of sufficiently large deals in a number of industries. This
quantification will help inform the effects of current policy and may point to
avenues for future adjustments. Second, the project will study the efficacy of
one of the standard tools for predicted price effects of prospective mergers:
the merger simulation. There will be systematic assessment of the predictive
power of mergers simulations and characterize the reasons why predictions differ
from realized observations. The results of the project will have important
implications for antitrust policy, and will provide tools for conducting merger
evaluations in the US for a variety of industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will first estimate the price and quantity effect of mergers—on both
merging parties and non-merging parties—using data before and after the
completion date of the merger and a variety of controls. The project will
correlate these effects, both across mergers and within-mergers across markets,
with measures of concentration, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and
the naïve change of the HHI. There will be a documentation of the time path of
the change in prices. Second, the project will estimate a structural model of
demand for each of the mergers in the dataset using only data before the merger
was consummated, choosing among a variety of demand specifications. The project
will then predict post-merger prices using these estimates, the implied costs,
and the assumption of static Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. Finally, there will be a
decomposition of the prediction error into that due to demand-side changes and
supply-side changes (such as synergies and conduct) by estimating parameters of
the structural model using post-merger data. This decomposition may provide
guidance for how to adjust merger simulations in
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
