This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of organic and macromolecular chemistry and in the subfield of organic
synthesis. This research focusses on the development of efficient, chemical ways
to introduce biotin into synthetic DNA fragments such that they can be
subsequently detected with the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase signaling
system. This nonradioactive DNA hybridization probe has several advantages over
the radioactive labeling techniques currently in use including much longer shelf
life, greater convenience and safety, high detectability, and the capability for
automated analyses. Such synthetic biotinylated oligonucleotides of mixed
sequences can be used directly as hybridization probes for the rapid
identification and isolation of specific genes. The sensitivity of the method
for the visual detection of the hybridized probes is sufficiently high that 0.5
femtomoles of plasmid DNA should be detectable. The chemical synthesis of
biotinylated DNA fragments will be carried out by the solid phase
phosphoramidite method. The development of these biochemical probes should have
significant impact on biomedical research and could find broad applications in
the diagnosis of genetically determined conditions such as viral diseases and
cancers. Whereas this Phase I activity focusses on oligonucleotides labeled with
biotin, it should be possible to subsequently examine other types of
nonradioactive labeling systems (e.g., fluorescent probes, electron spin
resonance probes, photoaffinity labels) with potential applications in
biochemical research.
