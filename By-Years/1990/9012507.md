This award provides partial support for a study to identify and analyse
obstacles to international cooperation in controlling growth in emissions of
carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the gases contributing to increased warming of the
earth's surface. The research will also explore possible means of overcoming
these obstacles. The study has five parts: (1) assembling basic information and
providing a broad perspective on the prevailing and prospective CO2 problem, (2)
reviewing actual or prospective international agreements for insights applicable
to the formation of an international CO2 accord, (3) identifying different
perspectives, by reviewing relevant policy plans and pronouncements of
governments and private decision makers and by assessing actual behavior with
respect to greenhouse warming in different regions of the world, (4) reviewing
the comparative cost of achieving specified reductions in emissions and
developing an approximate rank-ordering of reduction costs in different regions,
and (5) exploring and analysing a wide range of equity problems associated with
assumptions and choices about how to control these emissions. Research findings
will be published in a peer-reviewed volume; shorter papers will be distributed
to scholars and general audiences; meetings and briefings will involve both
public officials and private participants in discussion the implications of the
findings. This research has an important and timely focus; its results will be
useful and accessible to a wide audience. The qualifications and track record of
the investigators are excellent; institutional support is very good; the
research plan is sensible. Support is highly recommended.
