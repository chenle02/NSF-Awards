Abstract ATM-9423020 Wright, Herbert E. University off Minnesota Title: Late-
Glacial Climate Transition in the Near East This research project will focus on
the nature and timing of late- glacial climatic transitions in the Near East,
primarily by stable- isotope studies of lacustrine carbonates. Our current
understanding of climate change in the region is based on pollen studies
conducted before adequate models of insolation-driven climatic changes became
available. Hence, the proposed investigation is specifically aimed at
reevaluating past climate changes in the Near East in terms of changes in
insolation as well as the shift in global atmospheric circulation patterns
accompanying the retreat of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Stable-isotope
stratigraphy of late-glacial to Holocene abrupt changes in moisture-balance will
be developed from cores with carbonate-rich sediments from four lakes in little
known parts of the Near East. The objective is to test the coherency of rapid
change along a climatic transect.
