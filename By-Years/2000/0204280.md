Many computation problems, including program analysis and model checking
problems in particular, are most clearly and easily specified using realtional
rules. Yet, developing and implementing efficient algorithms for these problems
is a nontrivial, recurring task. This project proposes to develop a unified
method for transformaing rule-based specifications and transformations to
provide both time and space guarantees for the derived algorithms. We will focus
in particular on rule-based specifications for program analysis and model
checking problems and develop fully automatic methods for the transforamtions
and the time and space analysis in this domain.
