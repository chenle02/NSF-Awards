The St. Louis Urban Systemic Initiative (SLUSI) promotes a large scale
comprehensive strategy to transform current thought and educational practice to
bring all of the District's students to educational excellence in mathematics,
science and technology. The Initiative will accomplish this task by focusing on
Professional Development, Curriculum/Instruction and Assessment, Student Support
Systems and Structural, Organizational Process Reform. It is anticipated that
reform in these four areas will result in improved student achievement. Key
stakeholders from the St. Louis Collaborative, the Mayor's office and the St.
Louis community will forge relationships in support of mathematics, science and
technology reform within St. Louis Schools and the School District of University
City. Consistent with the National Science Foundation's directives and
recommendations for urban systemic reform, the SLUSI has at its core a vision
that seeks to: (1) improve the scientific and mathematical literacy of all St.
Louis students; (2) provide the mathematics and science fundamentals which will
permit all students to participate fully in a technological society; and (3)
enable a significantly greater number of these students to pursue careers in
mathematics, science engineering and technology. The Initiative builds upon
existing community involvement, exemplary Comprehensive Regional Centers for
Minorities (CRCM) activities, and a leadership structure that has secured the
endorsements of key political leaders of the City of St. Louis and University
City. The vision of the SLUSI is to improve the achievement of all students by
providing high quality mathematics and science instruction through state-of-the-
art pedagogical and instructional strategies supported by organizational
reforms.
