The main portion of this research project addresses fundamental questions about
the nature of space and time. It is part of a broad effort shared by many
researchers who are building the structures we need to understand more about
both the beginning of our universe and what happens at the center of black
holes. Some researchers believe that these answers will lead to many others, and
eventually to a complete theory of physics that explains the detailed structure
of our universe. A number of specific technical questions will be investigated,
relating to various approaches. Some of these develop mathematical tools for the
so-called `loop approach' to quantum gravity. Others relate to the possibility
that our universe may have more than the three space and one time dimensions
that we see. For example, this idea is part of the approach known as `string
theory.' Finally, some investigations use the laws of physics to place
constraints on the way that space and time can curve and warp.
