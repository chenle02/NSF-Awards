9310154 Bourne The macromolecular crystallography community has recently adopted
a standard set of data definitions as extension to that subset already derived
for small molecule crystallography and referred to as the Crystallographic
Information File (CIF). Macromolecular CIF definitions will facilitate the
highly desireable features of simpler information exchange and a rich controlled
vocabulary for use world-wide by scientists in an expanding discipline. Speedy
adoption of CIF requires flexible, interoperable, and portable software tools.
The investigators will build a class library and a set of tools based on the
object-oriented software technology to browse, edit, display, query, verify and
format CIF files, called CIFters. In addition, CIFters will be callable from
existing programs in common use in macromolecular crystallography facilitating
access to CIF files, further promoting the use of CIF. The long term goal of
this project is to develop extensible software tools which are widely available
to the structural biology community. In addition, this award support an end-user
workshop to begin the effort to design the appropriate CIFters. ***
