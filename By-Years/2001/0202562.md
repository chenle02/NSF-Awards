The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Sandra J.
Shefelbine to work with Dr. Lutz Claes at the University of Ulm's Institute of
Orthopaedic Research and Biomechanics, in Germany. The purpose of this project
is to combine Quantitative computer tomography (QCT) and Finite element analysis
of a fracture callus in a rat femur in order to predict bone stiffness during
fracture healing. This will be done by: the development of a model of fracture
healing in the rat femur; imaging the healing fracture using micro computer
tomography (CT); creating a finite element model of the healing fracture to
predict bone strength and; validating the finite element predictions with
mechanical testing of the bones in bending and torsion. The combination of QCT
and finite element modeling in determining the bone strength in fracture healing
will be a powerful technique for determining detailed, quantitative information
during the healing process.

The Institute is a well-known lab for experimental biomechanics. Dr. Claes' lab
focuses on the effects of mechanics on fracture healing and has a wide range of
experimental facilities.
