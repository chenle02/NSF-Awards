The goal of this project is to understand the science of dynamic collaborative
load manipulation using dynamically stable mobile robots (ballbots). The
research conducted under this NSF grant is enhancing the ability of multiple
ballbots to cooperatively perform dynamic manipulation and transportation of
heavy loads through spatially constrained, unstructured environments, while
providing critical safety through redundancy. This project will enable
automation of strenuous load transportation/manipulation tasks, having the
potential to reduce accidents and repetitive stress
injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research aims are (a) dynamically
feasible motion plans that transition hybrid dynamical modes, (b) feedback
control for hybrid dynamic manipulation. The transformative nature of this
research stems from its ability to generate theoretical advances in feedback
control and dynamically feasible motion planning on multiple levels.
