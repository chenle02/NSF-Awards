Differences between men's and women's social and political attitudes were widely
discussed in the press during the 1996 presidential election campaign because of
the so-called gender gap in presidential candidate preference. As many
journalists maintained, these differences in presidential preference likely
reflect more general attitudinal differences between the sexes. For example,
women tend to be more favorable toward welfare and other `compassion` issues,
whereas men tend to be more supportive of the use of force in a wide range of
situations. To understand these and other attitudinal sex differences, this
research will examine the structure of these attitudes. Specifically, men's and
women's attitudes should be differently elaborated, with more extensive beliefs
underlying those attitudes that are typical of one's sex. Also, the attitudes
typical of people of each sex should be linked to broader ideologies and values
that also tend to differ between women and men. This research will examine these
ideologies and values as causes of the attitudinal gender gap and also consider
other potential causes including personality differences between the sexes and
the advantages that policies are thought to produce for oneself and one's gender
group. These causal factors should reflect in turn the differing
responsibilities of women and men in family and occupational roles. Finally,
research will examine how people perceive the attitudinal gender gap and whether
their beliefs about it are accurate. In its focus on attitudes, this research
will investigate an aspect of gender that has been little explored by
psychologists. The findings should help policy makers understand why women and
men often differ in their policy preferences and sometimes in their preferences
for candidates for political office.
