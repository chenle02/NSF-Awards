This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of laser spectroscopy. This research involves the use of lasers to
achieve four wave mixing for performing site selective spectroscopy in complex
mixtures. It is further proposed to eliminate inhomogeneous broadening in
materials with disorder, to provide selectivity through the vibrational modes of
an analyte and to work with samples that are nonfluorescent. The overall focus
of this research is on the use of vibrational resonances as a site selective
laser technique. These methods will primarily use infrared excitation followed
by high order nonlinear mixing. In addition, the PI proposes to develop
infrared-optical double resonance with fluorescence detection as a technique
with the selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy and the sensitivity of
fluorescence spectroscopy. This research will use multiple lasers to achieve
selective analysis of complex mixtures through the use of the vibrational modes
of an analyte. In additional to added selectivity, these techniques may also
approach the sensitivity of fluorescence measurements.
