This research is a continuation of the use of long-period body wave data to
resolve aspherical elastic and anelastic structure in the mantle. New data from
the Global Digital Network will be used to update absolute and differential
body-wave travel times as well as add new differential body-wave types.
Attenuation parameters for the differential phases will be used to constrain 3-D
attenuation structure. In the inversion for earth structure with this data,
constraints will be applied from free-oscillation and stacking results generated
in other studies. The 3-D structure of the mantle has broad implications on
convection in the mantle and core; convection is the primary driving force for
plate tectonics and distortion on the surface of the earth.
