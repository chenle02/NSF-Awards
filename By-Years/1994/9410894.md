9410894 Nigbor According to 1991 Uniform Building Code certain new buildings are
required to be installed with accelerographs. The project is to collect, quality
control, and document the acceleration time history data recorded on such code
accelerographs during the January 17, 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The project is
also to be equally funded by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation
Program of the California Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of
Conservation. A report will be prepared with copies of raw data, tabulation of
peak accelerations, recording station information and summaries of structural
information for its use by engineering and scientific communities. ***
