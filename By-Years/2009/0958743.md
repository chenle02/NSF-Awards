This project compares two cases of ethno-nationalist contention (patterns of
action and reaction between authorities, challengers, and their opponents): the
early stages of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the first Palestinian
Intifada. The investigators identify: (1) distinct effects upon contention of
different types of media outlets; (2) types of coverage that promote escalation
or de-escalation of political violence; (3) contextual factors influencing
coverage, and (4) ways that interpretive disputes may contribute to conflict.
The investigators link qualitative data on event coverage by multiple media
sources with quantitative data on levels, forms, agents, and targets of
contention.

BROADER IMPACTS: This study advances the fields of peace and conflict, social
movements, and political communication. Theoretically, it develops a framework
that specifies the relationship between media coverage and contention.
Methodologically, it assesses hypotheses in an innovative way that is nuanced
(investigating possible contrasting roles played by different types of media
outlets), comparative (examining coverage across two political contexts),
longitudinal (accounting for different stages of contention), and interactive
(inclusive of multiple actors). By analyzing the distinct effects of different
types of media coverage across political contexts, the results will assist
policy makers, journalists, and activists in recognizing when and how their
framing of political events impacts the dynamics of contention.
