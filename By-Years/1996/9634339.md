IBN: 9634339 PI: Dayan Animals such as rats that manipulate space in
sophisticated ways have the capacity to acquire substantial information about
the layout and contents of their environments, based on a large variety of cues
from different modalities. They also plan their actions to optimise the use of
these environments, based on their changing goals. These tasks are far beyond
current robot technology. The neural basis underlying these abilities of rats is
starting to be understood. The hippocampus of a rat, a structure whose anatomy
and physiology have long been studied, is known to contain cells that report
reliably on its location in a familiar environment. Simultaneous recordings from
multiple cells in the hippocampus are starting to show how these maps are formed
during experience. We will combine three key approaches used in brain science -
animal behavior, neural recording of brain activity in the hippocampus, and
computer modeling to understand the adaptive optimising control strategies that
rats use to build models of their environments and to construct optimal plans.
Navigation is a key problem for autonomous agents. The result of this work will
be models of brain function which exploit the capacities of the biological
structures involved in learning, memory and control in spatial tasks. These
models will be capable of integrating poly-sensory information and implementing
optimising control. Similar approaches based on theories of animal behavior are
already finding wide application in a variety of difficult combinatorial
problems, such as scheduling. The reinforcement learning methods we will adopt
to understand natural navigation should have direct engineering application in
the development of intelligent robotic systems.
