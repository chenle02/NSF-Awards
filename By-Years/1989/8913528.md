Unlike well studied bacteria such as Eschericia coli, the membrane potential of
Spirochaeta aurantia is involved in chemotaxis. Furthermore the flagellar
filaments of the spirochete periplasmic flagella are relatively complex when
compared with the exoflagella of other bacteria. The goal of the proposed
research is to understand the molecular basis of the mechanisms of motility and
chemotaxis unique to spirochetes. Genes required for motility will be cloned and
analyzed. A considerable effort toward developing a gene transfer system for
this organisms will be mounted. The immediate use of such a system will be in
studies of spirochete motility and chemotaxis. Techniques for studying ionic
channels in the membranes of S. aurantia will be developed with an ultimate goal
of identifying chemoeffector-regulated channels. Spirochetes are motile bacteria
that have periplasmic flagella rather than exoflagella. Cells exhibit smooth
swimming, reversals of cell orientation and flexing. At least some spirochetes
also can "crawl" on solid surfaces. The peculiar mechanism of spirochete
motility is important to the success of these organisms in the viscous
environments in which they trive. The proposed research will employ Spirochaeta
aurantia as a model in studies of motility and chemotaxis of spirochetes and in
the development of techniques generally useful for studies of spirochetes. The
results of this research should provide new information concerning the
relationship of the unique spirochete motility system to their behavior.
