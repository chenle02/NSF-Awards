Computational Multiresolution Mechanics of Solids and Structures&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In the not too distant future, an integrated multiscale analysis
system is desirable for the design of a reliable engineering structure to
sustain harsh environmental conditions within a predetermined lifetime. A
multiresolution mechanics theory that may overcome the limitations of
conventional approaches will be developed for design of higher strength,
toughness, extended fatigue life and lower weight materials. The key features of
the proposed framework are two-fold: macroscale properties and performance could
be predicted directly in terms of the key microstructure design parameters; and
a mathematical link between microstructure materials design and product design
and manufacture will be provided. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Societal Benefits: In
materials engineering, rather than randomly discovering materials and exploiting
their properties, a comprehensive understanding of microstructure-property
relationship is desirable. The proposed multiresolution theory could advance a
range of advanced composite materials, including multilayer materials and
nanofiber-matrix composites. By designing material microstructure intelligently,
new materials such as super-lightweight, ultra-strength, low-wear materials for
energy related, industrial, and medical applications alike could be designed and
optimized. Wonderful opportunities of educating graduate and undergraduate
students and the public about materials design and manufacturing could be
created. It is hoped that the undergraduate students would be interested in
research and they are encouraged to continue for postgraduate studies. In
addition, it is expected that this emerging methodology will be effectively
transfer to industry and government laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;
