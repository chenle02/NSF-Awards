This proposal will support undergraduate students to pursue research during a
convective field project in the summer of 1993 in the Bismarck/North Dakota
area. A field program called the North Dakota Tracer Experiment is planned for
the period 21 June - 30 July 1993. The focus of the project is the study of the
transport, dispersion, ice nucleation, and precipitation growth processes in
actively growing convective clouds. The primary scientific goal is to increase
understanding about ice initiation in natural and seeded clouds, and its
relation to the subsequent development of precipitation (including hail).
