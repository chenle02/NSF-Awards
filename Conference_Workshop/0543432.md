Workshop on Mathematical Hydrodynamics at the Steklov Institute

This is a proposal for support for US-based researchers to attend the Workshop
on Mathe- matical Hydrodynamics at the Steklov Institute that is being planned
for the week of June 12 - 17, 2006.

Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The subject matter of the workshop
is mathematical aspects of the theory of hydrodynamics, which includes the study
of Euler's equations and the Navier - Stokes equations of fluid dynamics, as
well as the equations for the dynamics of waves on free surfaces. In the past
several years, there has been progress on a number of the most basic and
difficult questions in this field. These advances further the mathematical
understanding of the fundamental, nonlinear, partial differential equations that
describe these systems and also shed light on the basic physical processes they
model.

Broader impact of the proposed activity: The purpose of this meeting is to
present the state of the art to the diverse international community of
researchers who have an interest in these topics, and to discuss the
perspectives for the next advances in the field. This should aid in the
dissemination of the current state of the knowledge in this area and also
highlight avenues ripe for further progress. Furthermore, the funds from this
grant will allow both junior and underfunded US researchers to participate in
the event who might not otherwise have the opportunity to do so.
