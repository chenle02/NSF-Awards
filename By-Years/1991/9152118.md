This project is upgrading and modernizing an undergraduate laboratory in optics
at the University of Arkansas. The revised undergraduate laboratory in optics
includes concepts of classical and modern optics. It uses a novel approach to
the teaching of optics in that it allows students to explore experimentally
almost all the concepts that they learn in lecture, and it emphasizes both
qualitative and quantitative understanding of concepts. The upgraded laboratory
incorporates modern instruments and modern developments in optics.NSF grant
funds are being matched with funds from non- federal sources.
