8901213 Cappell This project includes research problems in a variety of areas of
geometrical topology. These include singular spaces and their characteristic
classes, transformation groups and H-spaces, some questions in low-dimensional
topology and nonlinear similarity. Among the specific problems are questions
related to the role of K-homology characteristic classes on singular spaces and
methods of computing them; characteristic classes on singular algebraic
varieties and methods of computing them; Alexander polynomials of nonisolated
singularities; replacement of fixed points of group actions; de Rham's problem
on similarity of matrices. These topics concern the possible reduction to a
certain amount of computation of questions about knottedness, connectedness, and
so forth. The ultimate subject matter of topology is the latter, but systematic
treatment requires the introduction of algebraic concepts such as groups and
rings and of techniques for computing with them.
