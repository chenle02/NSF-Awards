Funds are requested to upgrade a General Electric GN-500 NMR instrument with
additional probes, a broad-band decoupling unit (for heteronuclear multiple
quantum experiments), a high resolution decoupler (for spin-lock experiments),
and the hardware to improve instrument performance and facilitates data
processing. Some of the items for which funds are requested have been on loan to
UMBC since the instrument was installed in early 1988, permitting initiation of
several of the research programs described. This upgrade will permit
continuation of structural studies of zinc finger--nucleic acid complexes and
the intact HIV-1 protein p7; the structures and conformations of complex
carbohydrates from blood group glycoproteins and bacteria capsules; the
stereochemistry and conformation of novel allene dipeptide isosteres; the
internal equilibrium of substrate and product in the active site of yeast
glyoxalase, the intermediates in chemical and enzymatic isomerization of
4-androstene-3,17-dione, and structures of isomeric glucuronide and glutathione
conjugates of retinoates, thyroxine and vasopressin.
