Parasitic diseases are of great concern for livestock, wildlife, and human
health. Many parasites are transmitted between hosts when a blood-feeding tick
or fly takes a meal; these arthropods are often called "vectors". With global
climate change, vector-transmitted parasites are predicted to increase. There
are many species of malaria parasites that infect reptiles, birds, and mammals
very similarly. This project aims to study a model pigeon-fly-malaria system to
understand the role of host defenses against a vector of malaria parasites. Host
defenses against vectors may act directly by preventing vector feeding or by
killing vectors, or indirectly through the immune system (similarly to the way
vaccines work). Pigeons have at least two potential host defenses, one
behavioral (preening) and one immunological (antibody response against the
vector). The effect of each isolated defense against the fly, and whether the
host defenses interact synergistically will be tested. The impact of these
defenses on the transmission of malaria by the flies will also be tested. This
work may further development of anti-vector vaccines if the immune system
presents itself as an effective defense against vectors and the parasites they
carry.&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of this research include training a graduate
student in the fields of vector ecology and disease dynamics. Undergraduate and
high school students will benefit from training, presenting their work, and some
will be authors on publications of this work. Thus far six undergraduates (2
female, 2 international) and one high school student have been mentored and
trained in techniques related to this work, with further student involvement
anticipated. New control strategies against vectors are particularly exciting
because vectors often transmit multiple parasite species; thus protecting hosts
from one vector could protect against multiple parasitic diseases.
