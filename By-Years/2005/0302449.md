0302449&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative
project between Dr. Albert Wang, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Professor
Feng Zhenghe, Tsinghua University, proposing to develop miniature inductors for
RF System-on-Chip using innovative techniques. The research has potential
application to wireless communication technologies and can significantly impact
on the semiconductor IC industry. The project provides opportunities to train
U.S. Stdents. The project is jointly supported by the National Science
Foundation and the National Science Foundation of China. &lt;br/&gt;
