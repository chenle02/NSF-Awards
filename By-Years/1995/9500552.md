9500552 Hsia A high speed video motion analysis system will be purchased in
order to monitor non-linear crack tip fields in ferroelectric materials in order
to better understand the failure mechanisms. This equipment will be used in a
novel experiment for measuring the crack velocity at the transition temperature.
The dislocation structure at the crack tip will also be studies at the
transition temperature. ***
