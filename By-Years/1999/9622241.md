9622241 Lambros This Research Equipment Grant will be used by the Department of
Mechanical Engineering at the University of Delaware to purchase a high speed
infra red radiation detector system to measure the temperature increase during
dynamic deformation of polymer matrix composites, ceramics and ceramic
composites. It is planned to measure the temperature fields generated during
dynamic deformation and fracture of these advanced materials. The results of a
complete study of the coupling between damage and thermal effects in these
materials is needed for the formulation of physically meaningful and accurate
thermomechanical damage models for advanced materials and composites. This is an
important aspect of material behavior which deserves careful study, especially
in advanced materials. This equipment will be used in several current research
projects and will also be available for use by other faculty at the University.
