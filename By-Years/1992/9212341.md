Matching funds are provided to support purchase of an adhesion tester. The
equipment will be used in a study of the properties of the adhesion of CVD
silicon dioxide films to polyimide composites. The films are being developed for
elevated oxidation protection. The adhesion results will be compared with
process parameters and substrate microstructure.
