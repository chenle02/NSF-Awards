Dr. Rothschild is working with Dr. Carl Mitcham, director of the Philosophy and
Technology Studies Center at the Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, New York. She
will gain knowledge and expertise in order to apply the philosophy of technology
to the philosophical and ethical issues raised in her current research on
"Engineering Birth: From the 'Perfect Child' to the 'Perfect Race.'" This
research explores the relationship between the belief in human perfectability
and the new reproductive technologies, tracing the belief historically to its
emergence as the "perfect child," made possible by the new technologies.
Focusing on the ways ideology and technology interact to transform each other in
the area of human reproduction, the book considers how our concepts of human
perfection and our very ideas of what makes us human are being challenged and
changed by new technological possibilities. This turning-point in the human
nature-technology relationship must be set in a larger framework of the history
and philosophy of technology. During the fellowship tenure at the Philosophy and
Technology Studies Center at the Polytechnic University, Dr. Rothschild will be
able to provide this needed larger framework.
