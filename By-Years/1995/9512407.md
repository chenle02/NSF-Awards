The investigator proposes an interdisciplinary (i.e., aeronomy, atmospheric
chemistry, environmental engineering, etc.) research/teaching laboratory to be
developed at the University of Michigan for long-term, experimental studies of
global change. This laboratory has two major goals: (1) to provide a long-term
data base of comprehensive surface, lower atmosphere, and upper atmosphere
parameters measured from a single location, providing a unique "cross sectional"
and interdisciplinary record of the changing environment, and (2) to provide a
teaching laboratory for both graduate and undergraduate levels, enabling
important hands-on experiences in global change research.***
