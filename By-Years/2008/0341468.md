The project is developing educational modules to teach the following
mathematical procedures; simultaneous linear equations; regression; integration;
and ordinary differential equations. The modules are providing faculty and
students customization based on engineering major (Chemical, Civil, Computer,
General, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical) and computational system
(Maple, Mathcad, Mathematica, and Matlab).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each
instructional module enhances instructor preparation and development, and
student educational experience by a) reviewing pre-requisite mathematical
background information, b) demonstrating the need for and use of numerical
solutions through real-life examples, c) combining text and interactive self-
directed simulations to illustrate algorithms, examples, advantages, pitfalls,
errors and convergence of numerical techniques, d) relating historical
information to numerical methods, and e) providing self-assessment tools and
problem sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-sustaining dissemination avenues of
project materials include the Numerical Methods website at USF, website hubs of
major course management providers, digital libraries, and application centers of
computational systems. Results are shared at major engineering education
conferences and published in engineering education journals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the modules on student learning, student
satisfaction, and instruction acceptance at three diverse institutions will be
evaluated using formative and summative evaluation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
