Richards - Florida International University, a minority institution which has
grown dramatically over the past five years, is the recipient of facilities
funds to renovate approximately 27,000 square feet of Biology research space.
The existing Owa Ehan (OE) building, which houses all departmental activity,
requires repair and renovation to correct age-related building and machine
deterioration, an unsafe and inappropriately designed fume hood exhaust system,
and an inadequate fire sprinkler system. Reconfiguration of laboratory space
will also occur in order to maximize the efficiency of space design. The Biology
department specializes in five research areas: Tropical Plant Biology,
Vertebrate Biology, Marine Biology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and
Microbiology. More than one hundred faculty and graduate student researchers,
including a high number of minorities and women, will be positively impacted by
this renovation activity which is expected to take three years to complete. The
project will be important to continued growth in extramurally-funded research,
the graduate program which has grown from 35 to 69 Master's students in five
years, and to the development of FIU's doctoral program which graduated its
first Ph.D. in 1993.
