Numerous images on the internet call for efficient and effective image search
algorithms to help users to find images that contain the object of interest. The
current state-of-the-art image-search methods usually represent an object of
interest as a set of features and localize the object by searching for a
rectangular window that covers the desirable features. Without considering
spatial relations among the features, these methods usually suffer from a low
discriminative power and a high false positive rate. Instead, this EAGER project
formulates object localization as a global feature grouping problem, where
detected features are grouped according to some general spatial relations, such
as group convexity, the separation of boundary and internal features, and
feature affinities. The optimal feature grouping is achieved by using new graph
models and approaches. Within this formulation, the search window is a tighter
bounding polygon rather than a rectangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By considering
spatial relations and tighter bounding polygons, the feature-grouping approach
developed in this project is expected to produce a significant improvement over
existing image-search methods, which can be verified by testing on a standard
data set. The source code developed in this project is planned to be made
publicly accessible upon completion of this project. This research is focused on
object localization, which can also benefit many other computer-vision
applications, such as scene matching and reconstruction, object detection and
recognition, content-based video retrieval, and video surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;
