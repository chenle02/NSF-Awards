This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
improvements n the readout electronics for cryogenic radiation and particle
detectors which are being developed for diverse applications in astrophysics,
particle detection, medical imaging, and materials science. Many of these
devices use a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) for reading
out the signal from the detector. The extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs to small
changes in current, voltage or magnetic flux are essential for reaching the
detection and resolution limits of the new detectors. Although currently
available SQUID systems have characteristics which make them ideal for use with
these new detectors, existing SQUID systems are often ineffectual or of limited
usefulness in exploiting the full potential of these detectors. Limitations of
bandwidth and slew rate make high count rate detection and pulse shape
determination difficult or impossible. The sensitivity of the sensors to
radiation and thermal fluctuations make them difficult to use in accelerator or
space applications. Recent work on high-speed SQUID electronics and improved
sensors has shown that performance can be greatly improved not only in frequency
response but also in slew rate, stability, reliability and noise level. This
will be a significant advance for cryogenic radiation and particle detector
readout; as well as improve operation in the earth orbit environment,
significantly advancing space-based metrology. The improvements will also aid in
enabling SQUID technology to emerge out of the laboratory for other industrial,
military, and field use applications.
