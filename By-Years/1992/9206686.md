This project is focused on the regulatory cascade that culminates in the
activation of ion transport in the giant internodal cell of Chara corallina.
Upon illumination, ion transport activity in these cells rapidly becomes
spatially segregated into alternating bands of what appears to be proton influx
and efflux. Experiments are aimed at discerning the potential role of protein
dephosphorylation in the activation of the transport system and in the rapid
spatial segregation of ion movement activities. %%% The movement of ions across
the plasma membrane of plant cells is under strict regulatory control and is
responsive to a variety of extracellular signals. The giant internodal cell from
Chara corallina provides a unique model system for the study of these regulatory
cascades because ion movement is triggered by light and appears to be coupled
directly to photosynthetic activity. The intermediary steps in signal
transduction are not well understood and are part of the focus for this project.
The transduction of these signals can provide important clues to mechanisms by
which plant cells regulate transport at the plasma membrane.
