Through this award the group at Carleton College will continue its work on
finding, describing and characterizing the noise in the LIGO detectors. We will
help those searching for gravitational wave signals by identifying problematic
noise sources that inevitably find their way into the experiment. We will also
continue our statistical work whereby we will extract the astrophysical
information from the gravitational wave signal.

This work has important scientific benefits, and many broader aspects. Noise
characterization is a necessary task for any experiment, and this is a job that
the Carleton undergraduates are able to accomplish. Once LIGO detects
gravitational waves its next task will be to become an astronomical observatory;
our statistical work will help to derive the important astrophysical information
from the signals. Finally, our work serves as a means to create the next
generation of scientists in the United States. Carleton College is a leader in
producing scientists; this project gives real scientific opportunity and
responsibility to young scientists, and serves as a tremendous incentive for
pursuing a career in science.
