The goal of this research project is to understand how a group of enzymes,
namely lysine deacetylases, control biological processes in cells. This project
will also provide experimental approaches that can be applied to related avenues
of research, with subsequent impact on understanding of fundamental biology and
medicine. The activities in this project will be performed primarily by
undergraduate students and recent graduates from underrepresented groups in
scientific fields. Students and recent graduate technicians will gain meaningful
research skills and training relevant for progression into graduate programs and
the scientific workforce.

Lysine deacetylases (KDACs or HDACs) are a family of closely related enzymes
that regulate post-translational acetylation of proteins through removal of
acetyl groups from lysine residues. The overall goal of this research is to
understand how four KDACs regulate cellular activity, by (1) identifying the
molecular interactions of KDACs that determine substrate selectivity, and (2)
identifying the specific KDAC responsible for deacetylation of particular
acetylated lysine residues in non-histone proteins. A combination of in vitro
activity assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and a cell-based approach
involving genetically encoded but catalytically inactive KDACs will lead to
identification of cellular substrates and a detailed understanding of the
particular molecular interactions driving activity between a specific KDAC and
the acetylated protein. Overall, the project will result in a physical map of
the surface of each KDAC that determines selectivity, as well as definitive
substrate identification leading to a conceptual map of the cellular processes
controlled by the KDACs via their substrates.

This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics cluster in the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) and the Established Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
