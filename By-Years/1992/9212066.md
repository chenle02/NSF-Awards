This project will investigate the view of genetic algorithms (GAs) in
reinforcement learning problems. In particular, the research deals with using
GAs to specify connectionist or neural network (NN) systems for such problems.
An analogy between the principle GA-based machine learning paradigm, learning
classifier systems (LCSs), and neural learning paradigms suggests the proposed
avenue of research. Using the analogy, extensive experience with genetics-based
machine learning in LCSs can be directly transferred to a larger body of
connectionist learning architectures. The proposal outlines a range of such
architectures, and experiments designed to evaluate performance of these
architectures under various reinforcement learning conditions. The proposed
research differs from typical NN/GA studies, in that most studies consider a
population of NNs with a GA applied to tuning connection weights. This proposal
suggests an LCS-inspired approach, where the GA determines connections within a
single NN, by forming new hidden units. The GA's population-oriented search
process is well suited to this task. The proposed work has two goals: to refine
understanding of evolutionary- connectionist systems, and to suggest methods for
integrating such systems into workable reinforcement learning controllers.
