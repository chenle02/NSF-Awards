This effort is to continue the development, testing, and application of the
isopycnic coordinate model for ocean circulation studies. A series of studies
will include the incorporation of mixed-layer dynamics into the model, the
continuation of comparisons with other models of the wind driven circulation in
the Atlantic, and the testing and development of the coupled wind driven and
thermohaline driven mixed layer isopycnal coordinate model. These models will be
applied to better understand and interpret the data acquired in the North
Atlantic in particular, but additionally for the data acquired from the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) in the next few years. This is the only
isopycnic coordinate model being developed, and will also be used to
intercompare results with more common finite difference, fixed coordinate
models.
