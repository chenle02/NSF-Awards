This award is to develop a state-of-the-art video acquisition, display, and
processing laboratory to support a wide variety of research projects in video
and image coding, image and multidimensional signal processing, and computer
vision and image understanding. The equipment will include a component digital
video recorder and a high speed computer workstation. The next decade will
almost certainly witness a rapid expansion of video and image related products
and services that require compressed image and video data for transmission over
band limited channels, or storage on band limited storage devices. The bandwidth
of broadcast video is very large therefore research on video compression and
computer vision requires high speed digital acquisition and storage devices and
fast computers to process, display, and analyze the digitized video signal.
Hence, Washington State University will establish a research laboratory with
video acquisition, display and processing equipment that will support ongoing
research efforts in video and image coding, computer vision, and image
processing.
