A chamber for sample preparation and transfer is being added to an existing
photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will be used to study catalysts
consisting of thin films on oxide substrates. Thin metal films on various oxides
will be used to examine changes in the electronic levels of the metal following
adsorption and to determine reasons for differences in the properties of metal
catalysts on different supports. Thin oxide films on other oxides will be
examined to determine the nature of intermediates formed on mixed-oxide, acid
catalysts. These systems are simplified models of classes of catalysts widely
used in both production chemicals and refining of petroleum. Better
understanding of the energetics involved in their behavior is an important step
toward designing new catalysts.
