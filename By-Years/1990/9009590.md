This research is concerned with the representation theory of artin algebras.
The principal investigator will study idempotent ideals and other
generalizations of quasihereditary algebras and their usefulness in the
reduction of problems to algebras with fewer simple modules. She will also study
contravariantly finite subcategories of finitely generated modules over artin
algebras with regard to the finitestic global dimension conjecture and existence
of almost split sequences. This research is in the general area of ring theory.
A ring is an algebraic structure having both an addition and a multiplication
defined on it. These objects arise naturally and are important in many areas of
mathematics and physics.
