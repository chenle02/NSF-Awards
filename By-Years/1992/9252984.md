The every day Mathematis: 4-6 Project is to create a complete mathematics
curriculum for grades 4, 5, and 6. It assumes that entering fourth graders have
had a rich and varied mathematical experiene in grades K-3. The materials build
on the Everyday Mathematics K-3 curriculum. The Everyday Mathematics Curriculum
emphasizes explorations of data and mathematical modeling in common life
situations and in the natural and social sciences, arts and language.
Mathematics' structures and algorithmic procedures are attended to as important
issues in effective mathematical modeling. Pedagogic approaches emphasize small
group and partner cooperative work.
