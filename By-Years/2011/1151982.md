Water sustainability is a grand challenge problem that can only be addressed as
a collaborative effort of a community of research communities who study water
from many different perspectives. To date, progress on grand challenge-scale
water research has been hindered by a lack of interoperability among data and
computing resources that in-turn stems from a lack of coordination and rigor in
software development practices across the water science community. This project
formalizes and expands planning efforts initiated by a fall 2010 workshop on
software challenges of the NSF's Environmental Observatory Networks (NSF Award
#1049273) to develop a Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) centered
on water science and environmental observation. The plan will guide formation of
a Water Science Software Institute (WSSI) that addresses the community's
interoperability problem by using Open Source principles to enable innovative
and sustainable scientific software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves
two main activities: 1) determining the scope and the cyberinfrastructure
requirements of the water science the WSSI addresses, and 2) developing a plan
to apply the Open Source community model to this community of scientific
research communities. To guide planning activities, two driving use cases are
investigated: evaluating watershed best management practices, and understanding
nitrogen dynamics and the impact of ecological patch structure. The use cases
provide a source of cyberinfrastructure requirements and targets against which
to evaluate the plan as it develops. The planning process mitigates the risks
inherent in standing up this new kind of software institute, and it is a first
step toward demonstrating how a software institute will transform water science.
