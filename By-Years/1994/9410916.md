This Career Advancement Award for Women in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program will enable Colleen Partigianoni of Ithaca
College to conduct pilot studies on multielectron activation of metal compounds
with Dr. Thomas J. Meyer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
research will involve the synthesis of novel bimetallic complexes of osmium(II)
or ruthenium(II) and copper(II) or cobalt(II). Transient absorption spectroscopy
will be used to investigate the kinetics of the photoinduced charge-separated
species. By altering the ligand environment, the properties of the excited state
species will be controlled. The goal of the work is to photochemically generate
cobalt(I) centers which can serve as effective sources of two electrons. The
results are relevant to solar energy conversion. Also, this research experience
will enable Partigianoni to establish a new area for undergraduate research at
Ithaca College.
