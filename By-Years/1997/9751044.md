With a goal of producing innovative mathematics teachers, this project is
exposing pre-service teachers to a variety of pedagogical methods in a
technology rich environment. Visualization, experimentation, and real
applications are being used to foster the understanding of mathematics. To
achieve this goal, the department has begun several initiatives, including the
integration of graphing calculators and computer software into the courses.
Twenty-five PowerMacs, software packages, and a laser printer are being
purchased to equip one classroom and an adjoining laboratory. This project is
being piloted through four courses: calculus III, mathematical modeling, linear
algebra, and geometry. The first three courses are taken by all majors in K-12
teaching options, and geometry is taken by all future secondary mathematics
teachers.
