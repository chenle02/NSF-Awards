Abstract DBI 9750003 Wes Burrows This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "DNA Sequence variation of the Y chromosome
in Great Apes: molecular evolution and natural selection of the male specific
chromosome." This research plan focuses on the Y chromosome of the primates most
closely related to humans: chimpanzee, gorillas, and orangutans. The molecular
evolution of the "male" chromosome has become important and controversial in
population and phylogenetic analyses of primates. Sequencing and PCR
amplification of variable repeats of DNA are being used to assess the variation
of the Y chromosome between and within the great ape species. Evidence is being
sought for natural selection on the Y chromosome in this group of animals.
