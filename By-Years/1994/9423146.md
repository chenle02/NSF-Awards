9423146 DOUGLAS Large-scale geographic changes have occurred in western North
America as a result of geologic upheaval and climate. These have spatially
isolated western fishes to produce patterns of geographic variation within and
between lineages. Congruence between pattern and process will be tested by using
as a model organism a morphologically variable, widespread, western minnow
(Rhinichthys osculus). Forty-five populations (50 individuals each) will be
sampled from 10 different river systems (which form five different basins, each
with known geological histories). Four other species will be used as comparisons
for analyses. Seven individuals per population will be evaluated for genetic
diversity by evaluating the DNA of their respective cellular mitochondria. Data
will be evaluated using (a) traditional population genetic and geographic
variation techniques, and (b) newer techniques which evaluate ancestor-
descendant relationships among populations. Results from this study will provide
a generalized model of geographic affinity between populations of a widely
distributed fish species in western North America. This model can then be
evaluated for congruence with other widespread (but less easily sampled) species
of western fishes.
