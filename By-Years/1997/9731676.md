Investigators make detailed numerical simulations of highly turbulent convection
in resolving the yield interactions of rotation and convection play in
differential rotation in solar-like stars. Such simulations with very high
spatial resolution, enabled by the GAFD Turbulence team on new computational
codes and procedures, emphasize on different aspects of the physics approximated
in a dynamical system as complex as the solar convection zone. The Colorado team
employs an anelastic spherical harmonic code, designed to deal with complex
flows at high resolution in spherical shells. The Minnesota team uses a fully
compressible Piecewise-Parabolic Method code, where an entire rotating star with
a convective envelope is placed in the middle of a very fin uniform Cartesian
grid. Both allow magnetic field effects to be included, as well, to
prospectively study magnetic dynamo processes taking place deep in the
convection zone, and effects visible near the stellar surface.
