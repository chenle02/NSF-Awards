9706255 Louie There is a large debate over the possibility of generating
regionally extensive, large-magnitude extensional faults at moderate to shallow
depths. Indeed, most shallow faults can be shown from a variety of methods to be
steeply dipping. This study has identified the Dixie Valley fault system as
having a high potential to be active and shallow, and the data to be collected
should be able to discriminate between competing hypotheses. If the fault can be
shown to be active and of low dip, it will have a significant impact on the
models of both active and ancient deformation in extensional regimes.
