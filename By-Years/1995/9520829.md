9520829 Schowalter This research aims, using epitaxial insulators from the
Group II fluorides, for applications of fundamental materials science research
in future generations of electronic and opto-electronic devices. Recognizing the
many advantages of Si substrates and the fact that Si-based devices will
continue to dominate the market, this project explores heteroepitaxial growth by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on Si substrates for use in monolithic integrated
devices which require single-crystal layers of different materials. Prior work
on epitaxial CaF2 on Si will be extended to MgF2 and CdF2 which both (unlike
CaF2) have smaller lattice parameters than Si. Appropriate combinations of these
two fluorides with CaF2 will allow close lattice matching with Si. The growth of
epitaxial GaN on Si is targeted as a particular goal of the development of
substrate engineering techniques using fluoride buffer layers. In addition, the
possibility of developing opto-electronic devices directly in the epitaxial
fluorides by doping the fluoride with rare earth metals and then measuring their
optical properties will be explored. Electron transport through the single
crystal materials will be studied for possibilities of charge-injection photonic
devices. Charge transport will also be examined in very thin epitaxial fluoride
layers for application in barrier devices such as Schottky barrier detectors and
ballistic electron detectors. These charge transport measurements will be
significantly aided by development of ballistic electron emission microscopy
(BEEM) techniques both inside and outside the MBE system. %%% This program will
be a comprehensive investigation of an important class of materials whose
electronic properties may result in the integration of new functional
heterojunction electronic and optoelectronic materials and devices on silicon
substrates. Because of the pervasiveness of silicon integrated circuit
technology and its enormous economic importance, the technological impact of the
p roposed program is potentially very large. An important feature of the program
is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant
area of materials research. ***
