Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a rapidly emerging, open source technology
which decouples the network control functions from the data itself. This allows
network functions to be programmed by network operators, application owners and
system administrators. Instituting a dynamic network policy that constantly
changes represents a strategic shift in the management of networks, which
currently are static in nature. However, the flexibility in configuration has
security repercussions in that SDN has no inherent security mechanisms built
into its design. Permissions for configuration of the network ? both one?s own
and others - as well as coordination and visibility between networks are still
open technical questions. SDN has recently been adopted by a handful of major
enterprise providers for limited use within their data centers, where robust
security is less of an issue since the traffic stays within one network.
However, as the Research and Education community and industry both look to adopt
large scale SDN on their network backbones, the lack of a security framework for
interdomain SDN use is a glaring vulnerability. This project defines the
security architecture for large scale SDN networks and lays out a security
coordination protocol for the largest use case for SDN, Wide Area Networking.
