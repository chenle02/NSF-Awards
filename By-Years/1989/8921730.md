The ornithological collections of the University of Washington's Burke Museum,
the University of Puget Sound's Slater Museum, and Washington State University's
Conner Museum complement each other to form collectively the authoritative
representation of birds of the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Sievert Rohwer, Curator of
Birds at the Burke Museum, is constructing a computer database consisting of
records amassed from these three organizations. The information resource will
provide researchers in the region and around the world with unprecedented access
to these valuable research collections. Natural history collections such as
these are invaluable resources for the study of ecology, evolution,
biogeography, and an array of comparative research areas. The improvement and
continued maintenance of these collections is essential for this and future
generations of researchers.
