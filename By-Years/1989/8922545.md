This project involves experimental research in the Departments of Computer
Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Virginia. End-to-end
experimental systems research incorporates a sequence of implementation choices
where a researcher may closely control whatever aspects are critical. At one end
is the capability to create custom circuits. Further along the spectrum is the
capability to integrate off-the-shelf, and perhaps custom, components to create
a board system. Still further along is the capability to program small stand-
alone software modules. They may execute on a custom board system or on a
general computing engine. At the other end is the capability to experiment with
both general systems and applications. This type of experimental systems
research and the development of an environment within which it can thrive are
important to progress in computer science. The range of subjects to be
investigated via this thematic approach runs from VLSI design automation and
validation through computer architecture, real-time software, parallel systems,
and applications.
