This award to Case Western Reserve University's Department of Geological
Sciences is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science
Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will
provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire electromagnetic induction
equipment and various water sampling and analysis instruments. The University is
committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The equipment
will be used in undergraduate courses designed to provide laboratory and field
experience in hydrogeology studies.
