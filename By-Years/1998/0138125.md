The Naval Support Force Antarctica (familiar name: Operation Deep Freeze) was
the major provider of station and field operations, logistics, and direct
science support for NSF-funded research in Antarctica from 1954 until 31 March
1998, when the Department of Defense transferred military support of the U.S.
Antarctic Program to the U.S. Air Force.

Throughout its 44 years of existence, the Naval Support Force Antarctica
produced and published annual end-of-season reports that contain authoritative
narratives and statistics regarding its activities. The reports were published
on paper; electronic copies do not exist.

A collaboration of the Naval Research Laboratory Library, the Naval History
Office, and NSF's Office of Polar Programs assembled a full set of paper copies
of the reports. The Document Automation & Production Service, Defense Logistics
Agency, will digitize them and make CD-ROM copies. NSF will distribute the CD-
ROMs as needed, and the files will be available to the public.
