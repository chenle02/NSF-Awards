The READY, SET, TRANSFER (RST) project is a collaboration of three independently
accredited colleges where the strengths of each college are leveraged to create
Science and Mathematics Academies on each campus. The Academies serve students
who are majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
The Academy recruits and supports students who are just beginning their
scientific academic careers and have tested into developmental mathematics. RST
works to retain students throughout their transition into college-level courses
by providing faculty mentors, developmental math and science integrated courses,
peer mentors, study skills courses, and Academy workshops and
events.&lt;br/&gt;As students progress through their core courses in mathematics
or science disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;Academy interventions help students persist
and achieve academic excellence in their STEM major classes. Strategies include
the continuation of faculty mentoring, providing opportunities for students to
serve as peer mentors, performance based rewards, research based experiences
integrated throughout introductory science and mathematics sequences, and an
introduction to research course.
