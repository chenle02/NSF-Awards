9312263 Grabbe Numerical development and analysis of instabilities and transport
in active regions of the Earth's magnetotail will be carried out. A set of
parallel processing codes will model the transport driven by instabilities
associated with ion beams and currents, as well as strong drifts caused by steep
gradients and strong electrostatic fields around the plasma sheet - lobe
transition, under a range of magnetotail conditions. A linear code and a
transport code will include kinetic parts to evaluate growth and transport
driven by ion beam instabilities and electron currents, and a fluid part for
growth and transport driven by gradients and electrostatic fields present near
the plasma sheet boundary layer. The plasma dispersion function used for the
kinetic part of the code will be generalized to a modified plasma dispersion
function in which the model distribution functions for beams, currents, and
background plasma can be tailored for realistic input conditions. When the codes
are developed they will be used for predicting transport processes under a
variety of plasma conditions for models of regions near the plasma sheet
boundary layer in the Earth's magnetotail. ***
