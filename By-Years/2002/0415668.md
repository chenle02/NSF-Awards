This project will 1) provide a latitudinal and longitudinal inventory of
Beringian mammals and associated parasites; 2) develop a database to assess
inter-hemispheric diversity; 3) provide material to address the conservation and
evolution of mammals and their associated parasites (e.g., material for
epidemiologists), and 4) build a spatial and temporal foundation for biotic
investigations in the Arctic. This information will stimulate interpretation of
past (and prediction of future) impacts of climate change on this component of
biotic diversity. Informed decisions regarding human impact and the effect of
climate change at high latitudes on these species require a detailed
understanding of the Beringian fauna. Molecular genetic and morphologic analyses
will complement this biotic inventory and provide a powerful means to
investigate the sequence, age, and location of major climatic events.
Preliminary analyses already have helped to identify the western and eastern
borders of Beringia as areas that should be most productive in this inventory of
high latitude diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the
continued development of productive international collaborations with Russians,
Finns, and Canadians. Russian scientists have seen their institutions
disintegrate due to marginal economic conditions. This project will
substantially impact education and training with US students gaining scientific
and cultural experience in these international collaborations. Museum
collections are fundamentally educational resources where some of our most
innovative thinkers received their first introduction to the sciences.
Accessible museum collections are among the finest resources available to
environmental scientists and educators that are tackling tough questions facing
society.&lt;br/&gt;
