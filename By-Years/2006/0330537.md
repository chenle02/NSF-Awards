Many peptides and proteins spontaneously self-associate into large aggregates of
cross beta-sheet structure and fibrillar morphology, which may be toxic to a
wide number of cell types, due simply to their morphology and not to their
specific sequence. Thus, elucidation of the factors that control peptide self-
association into fibrillar aggregates is needed to understand mechanisms of
disease, to develop therapeutic strategies for these diseases, and to design
efficient processes for protein manufacture and formulation. The objectives of
this research are: (1) to develop a detailed mathematical model of the kinetics
of assembly of fibril-forming peptides and proteins, (2) to design and
synthesize fibril-forming peptides in which morphology is controlled by
judicious balancing of backbone hydrogen-bonding and side chain-side chain
interactions, and (3) to develop rules to predict whether pairs of interacting
peptides will have greater or lesser aggregation propensity than each peptide in
isolation. Three model systems will be used in pursuing these objectives: (1)
Insulin and insulin analogs, (2) Apomyoglobin truncation mutants, and (3)
Polyglutamine and other expanded-domain peptides. Kinetics of assembly are
monitored using several complementary experimental techniques: static and
dynamic light scattering,
