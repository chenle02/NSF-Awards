This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
prototype meniscal implant using bacterial cellulose and a novel biofabrication
process, dielectrophoretic microweaving. Nanocellulose networks produced by the
bacteria Acetobacter xylinum are biomaterials with unique hydrogel-like
properties and biocompatibility that is ideal for cartilage tissue replacement.
For applications such as meniscus there is however need to direct the nanofibril
orientation. A new biofabrication process has been invented at Virginia Tech in
which the precise control of bacterial motion in an electric field is used to
control morphology of the nanocellulose network. In this project a microweaver,
a device to manufacture customizable meniscus implants based on images from
patients will be developed. This will be a major breakthrough in biomaterials
for orthopedics applications.

The broader impact of this project is technology for inexpensive but high
performance, biocompatible materials for health care. Over 15 million people
worldwide suffer from knee-joint failure each year. More than 225,000 people
annually undergo arthroscopic meniscal repair at an average cost of $25,000
each. There are no satisfactory products on the market today and there is an
urgent need for a new biomaterial that mimics properties of natural meniscus. By
developing a meniscal implant that can substitute for the injured native
meniscus, it may be possible to diminish the prevalence of osteoarthritis and
its related economic costs. BC Genesis LLC is a biomedical start-up company
working with technology for developing implants and tissue scaffolds by using
bacteria to grow cellulose biomaterial.
