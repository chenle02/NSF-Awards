ABSTRACT OPP-9523519 McGovern/Amorosi/Ogilvie This proposal is for support of
an interdisciplinary, international research group studying human/environmental
interactions over the past 2000 years in the North Atlantic region. The North
Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) has developed a network of researchers
from over 40 organizations and ten nations. Operating under the theoretical
orientation of historical ecology, NABO workers are integrating historical,
archaeological and ethnographic data with recent paleoenvironmental data derived
from ice-cores, pollen analysis, bones, insects and other sources. The
overarching goal is to develop an integrated analytical approach to complex
problems of climate impact on humans, human impacts on the environment, and the
environmental effects of humans' interactions with each other. Systematic
working meetings are needed to advance US and international human dimensions of
global change research.
