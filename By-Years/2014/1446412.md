Modern Graphics-Processor Units (GPUs) are capable of performance that, just a
few years ago, would have been classified as supercomputer-level. With the trend
of integrating GPU cores into heterogeneous multicore processors, GPUs are
becoming an important source of future performance growth in mainstream
processors. Unfortunately, GPUs are notoriously hard to program. The standard
languages for programming GPUs expose low-level architectural details, such as
an explicit memory hierarchy, which the programmer must exploit to maximize
performance. Furthermore, GPU hardware evolves rapidly, with successive
generations of hardware having different performance characteristics, which
means that application code must be constantly revised to achieve optimal
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the power of GPUs, accelerators, and
heterogeneous architectures more widely applicable, programming models need to
lift the level of abstraction away from the details of the hardware threading
and memory models. This EAGER project identifies common abstractions and
implementation techniques that can provide a foundation for supporting irregular
computations on accelerator and heterogeneous architectures. A key focus of the
project is the design of a core calculus of heterogeneity that can model
programs that run on heterogeneous systems, such as CPU/GPU combinations, and
provide a foundation for future work in both the semantics and implementation of
parallel programming languages for GPUs. The results of the project broaden the
applicability of GPUs to a wider range of computational problems and, in turn,
will help make GPUs useful to a broader community of users by supporting higher-
level programming models for GPUs that are easier to use than existing
languages.
