9308205 Weichman This proposal concerns the understanding of phase transitions
where quantum mechanics is important. The work is mainly analytical in nature
based mainly upon renormalization group methods. The PI will consider two types
of system: 1) Phase transitions at T=0 driven entirely by quantum fluctuations.
Examples include superfluidity and superconductivity in disordered systems with
special emphasis on understanding properties of the recently proposed Bose and
vortex glass phase transitions. 2) Phase transitions at T&gt;0 driven by thermal
fluctuations but in which quantum fluctuations still play a significant role.
Examples include phase transitions in 2D dipolar ferromagnets; superfluidity of
4He in porous media and the superfluid-normal phase interface of 4He under
gravity. %%% This work concerns issues in our understanding of phase transitions
at very low temperatures where fluctuations of quantum degrees of freedom drive
the transition - rather than the usual, higher temperature cases where thermal
fluctuations are the important factors. The work will concentrate on systems of
current experimental interest such as thin film superconductors and helium
superfluidity in porous media and under gravity. This type of work on phase
transitions is state-of-the-art in low temperature condensed matter theory. ***
