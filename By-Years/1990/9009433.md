This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award will support a
program planning workshop in the area of natural products chemistry. The purpose
of the workshop, organized by Professor Bruce Jarvis of the University of
Maryland and Professor Otto Gottlieb of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, is
to stimulate cooperative research between U.S. and Brazilian chemists. As such,
the workshop will address the following topics: diagnostic of on-going research
efforts in both the U.S. and Brazil in the area of natural products chemistry;
identifi- cation of areas of common interests and likely future collabo- rators;
and organization of joint planning activities for cooperation in the short,
medium, and long term.
