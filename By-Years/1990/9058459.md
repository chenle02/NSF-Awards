This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr. Peter T.
Lansbury, who is being designated a Presidential Young Investigator which will
provide him support for his research for five years. He will use the funds to
study problems of enzyme mechanism, biosynthesis and protein structure. The
research will center around developing understanding of the details of the
molecular interactions which govern peptide folding. This involves the
development of novel solid-phase fragment coupling methodolgy to produce large
quantities of the target protein. This will then permit conformational studies
and the synthesis of specifically labeled protein to simplify analysis by
Fourier-transform spectroscopy and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. These techniques will be applied to study polysaccharide protein
interactions.
