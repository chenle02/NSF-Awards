BioTraces Inc. (BT Inc.) has developed an ultrasensitive quantitation system
which can be used with a large family of isotopes. This system supports label
multiplexing; many co- resident isotopes in the family can be quantitated
simultaneously, allowing either the pooling of labeled samples of the pooling of
distinctly labeled probe reagents for multiple targets. The proposed research
will add two dimensional (2D) spatial resolution to the capabilities of the
systems, in support of nucleic acid quantitation and fractionation, including
sequencing. Because of the extensive multiplexing capabilities and superior
sensitivity, the proposed technique will greatly increase sample throughput in
fractionation/quantitation tasks.
