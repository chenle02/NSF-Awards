The New Mexico Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities (NM-CRCM), is a
statewide program for implementing a K-12 continum of enhanced science and math
programs in the schools. The NM-CRCM flagship programs, the Mathematics
Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) project, and the Community Academy for
Science and Mathematics (CASM), are proven programs that directly address the
NSF's CRCM goals and objectives. In addition, these programs include specific
operational structures that maximize their potential to be sustained in the
schools beyond NM-CRCM support. New Mexico has a number of other effective
programs in science and math enhancement that direct collaborators in the NM-
CRCM. These programs enrich and are integrated with the NM-CRCM science and math
continuum. All collaborations include a true sharing of resources, trained
personnel, and funding that ensures mutual benefit and integration. All NM-CRCM
collaborators have agreed to the NM-CRCM goals that are identified below. During
its prototype year, NM-CRCM has developed a statewide database of science and
math progerams, K-16, that is available to students, teachers, and
administrators throughout New Mexico. This databse now exists in hardcopy and
will be disseminated through partnership with a New Mexico industry. The
database will eventually be placed on various computer bulletin boards so that
schools or individuals with a modem may access the information. The NM-CRCM will
maintain the database, updating the hardcopy annually, and the database on a
continual basis. The project intends to bring its programs to at least 80% of
the rural school districts representing 35,000 Native American and 40,000
Hispano ore-college students.
