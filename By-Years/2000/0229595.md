The Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) will develop "LifeTrek," a 6000-sq. ft.
permanent exhibition and related educational extensions. LifeTrek will be an
integrated learning environment comprised of a series of immersive indoor
habitats where children will investigate natural phenomena and processes.
Designed for urban children ages 4-11 and their families and teachers, LifeTrek
will provide a range of open-ended and challenging opportunities to practice
science skills, and facilitate greater awareness of and respect for the natural
world. Reflecting the ecological framework in which New York City resides, a
northern estuary system, the exhibition will feature twelve object-rich
habitats: stream's edge, flowing stream, freshwater pond, salt marsh, tidal
pool, shore, dune, cliff, cave, meadow, fallen log and living tree.
