9414298 Ohuchi In this proposal we outline a research program to investigate the
growth and characterization of new GaAs based structures. the motivation of this
program originated from our on-going research effort to develop novel processing
routes for growing heterostructures without regard to their lattice matching
requirement. In this effort, we have developed a growth method called van der
Waals epitaxy (VDWE). VDWE is the epitaxial growth of crystallographically two-
dimensional (2D) layered materials, of which layers are held together by van der
Waals forces, and contain no unsatisfied covalent bonds at the surface. We have
demonstrated in the past that these van der Waals materials can be grown
epitaxially on a wide range of three-dimensional (3D) materials including GaAs,
A12O3 and CaF2. If GaAs Layers could then be grown on top of this van der Waals
surface, it would be possible to effectively decouple the interface between the
two 3D materials with dissimilar lattice constants and thereby accommodate the
lattice mismatch. Due to the weak van der Waals forces across the interface, it
is also possible to remove (or lift-off) the epitaxial layers for both
characterizing broad area thin films and further processing of decoupled
heterostructure devices. ***
