Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Language Towers as Desigh Frameworks&lt;br/&gt;Olin Shivers,
Panagiotis Manolios (Georgia Tech) 0438871; &lt;br/&gt;Matthew Flatt (University
of Utah) 0438847&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good notations enable good design: they
channel designer effort away from infeasible designs, highlight novel aspects of
a specific design, supress inessential detail, and enable both human and
automated reasoning about the artifact being described. Unfortunately, a
tremendous amount of labor is required at the meta-design level to implement the
tool suites supporting design in a new, extended, or domains-specific notation.
This labor overhead means it is not practical for most designers and engineers
to incorporate notation design, or meta-design, into their design
methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores developing the meta-
tools to allow the development of specialized notations, allowing designers to
better express and reason about their artifacts. The focus of the research is on
enabling design-time reasoning---what the programming-language community refers
to as "static semantics"---of the designed artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
resulting framework allows the construction of "language towers," that is,
notations defined at varying levels of abstraction, linked by procedurally-
encoded static semantics (analyses) and dynamic semantics (translations) between
the levels of the tower. While the work has its origin in the research
underlying the Scheme macro system, it is intended to be applied to language
frameworks that have much greater static-semantic
content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
