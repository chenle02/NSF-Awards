This research extends understanding of particle erosion-corrosion processes to
metal alloy systems based on nickel, cobalt and iron. A wide variety of erosive
conditions of particle loading, velocity, angle of incidence, and temperature
are employed in the experiments in controlled gaseous environments. Mechanisms
of deformation and heat evolution at the specimen surface are analyzed. Of
particular interest is the possible development of concentration gradients near
the alloy surface, internal oxidation, and extensive transient oxidation, all of
which can contribute strongly to the failure of the alloys to form protective
oxide layers. %%% Erosion-corrosion processes are responsible for serious
material degradation in a wide range of industrial processes, including gas
turbines and coal gasifiers. This research should aid in the design of alloys
that resist this type of degradation.
