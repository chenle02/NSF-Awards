The objectives of this research is to develop a deterministic machining process
capable of producing aspherical glass components with a surface damage layer in
the 2-5 characteristic indentation dimensions range. Such components could then
be finished, using traditional polish techniques, in substantial shorter time
than is currently possible, greatly enhancing the producibility of larger
aspherical glass optics. Another important task of the research plan is to study
the surfaces produced in glass grinding, with the aim of characterizing the
surface damage and subsurface damage resulting from the precision grinding
process. This involves post-grinding examination of the glass surface (or
replicas of the surface) using stylus profilometry, optical microscopy, and
scanning electron microscope.
