A workshop on `Light-Cone Quantum Chromodynamics` will be held Feb. 24 - March
7, 1997 in Les Houches, France. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory which
describes the strong force which binds atomic nuclei together and is responsible
for the behavior of many elementary particles. The light-cone method is a
promising approach to dealing with the complexities of QCD, so that the
predictions of this theory may be extracted. The workshop will bring together
leading practitioners of the light-cone approach for an important exchange of
ideas.
