9221619 LIN This is a three year cooperative study proposed by Dr. Chii-Dong
Lin, Kansas State University, and Dr. Shih-I Chu, University of Kansas and
Professor Tsin-Fu Jiang, National Chiao Tung University, and Professor Sy-Sang
Liaw, National Chung-Hsing University. The project is supported under the AIT
(U.S.)-CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This proposal plans to
conduct studies of atomic and molecular dynamics under excited states and in
strong fields. Both Dr. Lin and Dr. Chu are leading theorists in atomic and
molecular physics. Dr. Lin plans to conduct experiments on doubly excited states
within the non-relativistic framework. Dr. Chu proposes to study atoms and
molecular dynamics in intense fields. These two studies are loosely connected,
but each has strong scientific merit. The project provides an opportunity for
U.S. researchers to expand their available resources and equipment in Taiwan for
conducting this study, while they learn the critical numerical method from their
Taiwan collaborating group. ***
