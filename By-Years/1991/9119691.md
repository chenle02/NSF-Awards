Research in theoretical physics will include efforts to test and to extend the
current understanding of the "Standard Model" of subatomic interactions, and
efforts to search for a unified theory of all the forces, including gravity. The
Standard Model analyses will concentrate on studies of elementary particles
containing heavy quarks, high precision analyses of the effects of the
electromagnetic forces, and calculations of the scattering of elementary
particles. The unification studies will focus on string theories of all the
forces and theories in less than four space-time dimensions. Work will also be
done in astrophysics. This broad program of research will contribute to our
understanding of the elementary particles, the basic forces, and astrophysical
systems.
