This project is aimed at a first-principles understanding of the influence of
paramagnetic ion systems on the relaxation times of protons of water molecules
and therefore on the contrast-noise ratio for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The magnetic moment distributions between the paramagnetic ion and its ligands
will be studied using both ab initio and approximate theoretical techniques, and
the effects of these distributions on the contact and dipolar hyperfine
interactions will be assessed. Systems to be studied include transition-metal
and rare-earth ions, and such ions linked to protein molecules. These studies
are expected to contribute to a more detailed understanding and interpretation
of the biomedically important MRI technique. The images produced by MRI can be
sharpened (i.e., heighten the contrast and reduce the noise) by chemical
compounds containing certain metal atoms, but these may also have toxic side
effects. This project is aimed at a fundamental understanding of how these
compounds work to sharpen the image; appropriate non-toxic substances for
administration to patients can then be devised.
