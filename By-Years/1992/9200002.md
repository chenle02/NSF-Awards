These mathematical investigations concern physical behavior of materials and
media which is caused by or related to a microscopic structure. The questions to
be considered include problems in which the physics is well described by
averaging, such as estimating the overall elastic and electrical properties of
composite materials or describing the asymptotic behavior of aerosols; and
problems in which averaging does not enter, such as calculating the optical
properties of diffraction gratings. Interestingly, these problems are not only
related by their small-scale structure but also by the fact that similar methods
and ideas can be applied to their study. These questions are of theoretical
importance in science, and vital in some engineering and industrial
applications. The Principal Investigator has recently introduced new methods
based on function theory to deal with high-contrast composites and diffraction
gratings, and some mathematical constructions related to a new kind of aerosol
which arose recently in the photographic industry. Many improvements and further
applications of these methods suggest themselves. The present goal is to extend
and improve these methods so that they can be used in more complicated design
and prediction applications than those permitted by the techniques currently
available.
