This project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin at Madison, will
provided a three year program to train teams of high school and middle school
teachers and counselors about career issues in science, engineering and
technology, In the first year 12 teams will meet to learn about scientific and
technical careers, develop communication and leadership skills and prepare
materials for in- service activities. In the second year 18 additional teams
will join the project to participate in revision of the materials and to prepare
for dissemination activities. In the third year the final drafts of the
materials will be developed and the information about careers in science and
technology will be dissemitated throughout the state. The NSF grant is being
matched by finds from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the
institutions in the collaboration by an amount equivalent to 21% of the grant.
