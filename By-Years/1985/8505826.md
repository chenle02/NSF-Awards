A minicomputer will be acquired to replace and update the present control system
of the TRIGA reactor. The computer-based-controlled system will be designed to
be licensable under U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements, and will
also serve as a reactor management and data processing system for this research
reactor by controlling or monitoring sample irradiation times, neutron and gamma
fluxes, and data reduction for most of the R&amp;D efforts related to the TRIGA
reactor. The computer-control system would improve data quality, accelerate
research investigations, and expand the research base and funding generated by
the reactor.
