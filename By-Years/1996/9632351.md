9632351 Spada Under an SGER award a study will be made of the possible role of
electron transfer from frictionally produced electrical charges on the
degradation of high-performance lubricants of the perfluoroalkyl ether (PFPE)
class of lubricants. Electrochemical studies will be carried out under oxygen-
free and low-oxygen atmospheres to assess the electrochemical activity of these
relatively stable molecules. The study could be a first step in determining the
significance of tribochemical events in lubricant breakdown in general. March
