9616246 Ducharme The purpose of this work is to explore the ferroelectric state,
switching dynamics, and an unusual conductance switching phenomenon in ultrathin
Langmuir-Blodget (LB) polymer films with thicknesses ranging from one to 100 or
more monolayers. These films have potential application to nonvolatile computer
memory (or data caching or data storage), uncooled infrared imaging devices,
nonlinear capacitors, pyroelectric sensors, or acoustic transducers, among other
possibilities. The proposed research has four interrelated components: 1)
Investigation of Ferroelectric State properties such as the phase transition
temperature, spontaneous polarization, Curie constant, and dielectric
hysteresis. 2) Study of Low-Dimensional Ferroelectricity will be in films as
thin as one monolayer. 3) Study of a novel conductance Switching phenomenon that
intimately connected to bulk polarization switching. 4) Evaluation of Potential
Applications uniquely suited to the LB ferroelectric polymers. Measurement
techniques will include switching charge and current, pyroelectric responqe,
conductance, and dielectric response as functions of temperature, electric
field, and thickness. The results will provide unprecedented understanding of
the ferroelectric state in polymers and in reduced-dimensionality systems and
will reveal the salient features of the conductance switching phenomenon. The
results will also provide a critical foundation for potential application of
these inexpensive but versatile electronic materials to computer and transducer
technologies. ***
