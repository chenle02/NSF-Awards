In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, we propose to develop an all
solid-state laser system capable of generating light pulses of unprecedented
short duration. The technique of non-linear mode- locking can be used to
generate femtosecond-duration pulses from a titanium-doped sapphire laser. The
major limitation on the minimum pulse width obtainable from this laser is
optical dispersion inside the laser cavity; i.e. different wavelengths of light
take a varying time to complete a round-trip through the cavity of the laser.
Since an ultrashort laser pulse must have a wide spectral width, a short pulse
will not stay short if there is substantial dispersion in the laser cavity. By
doing detailed calculations of dispersion, we have discovered a number of
methods for minimizing it in this laser. We have already produced pulses of 25
femtoseconds duration-- a record for ultrafast lasers. We plan to expand upon
this work to further advance the state-of-the-art in ultrafast laser technology.
By designing a new laser, we expect to be able to demonstrate a simple and
reliable source of 15-20 fs pulses. Our work promises to expand the utility of
lasers for studying ultrafast processes in electronic materials and in chemical
reactions.
