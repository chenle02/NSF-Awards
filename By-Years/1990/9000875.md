This award provides funds to Oklahoma State University to continue their REU
SITE. The program will include fourteen participant projects, four locally-
funded, all concerned with the understanding and improving of green plant
performance through enhancement of growth conditions. The methods of study will
involve a variety of approaches from the fields of plant physiology and
structure, plant pathology, agronomy, forestry, ecology and biochemistry. A
brief orientation will be concerned with philosophy of literature survey, report
writing and presentation of results. Each participant works with a research
advisor. Project planning and reading of background material occur before the
participants arrive. Group progress meetings are held throughout the program
focusing on problem areas and successes. Participants visit each other's labs,
discuss their projects and work with research assistants, graduate students, and
post-doctoral personnel as well as the advisor. Post program follow-up efforts
will include presentation of results to biology and science clubs in
participants' home schools, state collegiate academies of science and
publication in appropriate journals.
