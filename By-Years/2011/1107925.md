Funds are provided to achieve three major goals. &lt;br/&gt;1. To synthesize
data from the BEST-BSIERP coordinated programs in the Bering Sea and data from
other sources, collected during the same time period (2007-2010), via modeling
and data assimilation. Two joint data assimilation systems will be applied to
reconstruct the physical oceanographic fields of the eastern Bering ice-ocean
system. The first system will be configured to reconstruct the large-scale
circulation in the eastern Bering Sea and to accurately describe the large-scale
processes in the South Eastern Bering Sea Shelf. The second will be configured
for the eastern Bering Sea Shelf and will explicitly resolve eddy and tidal
dynamics, thus leading to a better understanding of the nonlinear interaction
processes between the deep basin and the shelf region of the eastern Bering Sea.
&lt;br/&gt;2. To analyze the reconstructed fields and identify processes
important for causing observed variability. &lt;br/&gt;3. To determine the
impact of assimilating data with different origins on the estimation of near-
surface transports of volume, momentum, heat, and material. This will be
accomplished through adjoint sensitivity analysis. Results will help optimize
Bering Sea mooring observations in future studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Bering Sea is the largest commercial and subsistence fishery of the United
States. Management of this fishery in the face of ongoing climate variability
requires an understanding of all the processes impacting the fishery. Amongst
these are the changing water temperature, which influences the growth rate of
fish, and the current field, which carries fish eggs and larvae from their
spawning regions to their nursery grounds. This project will contribute to an
understanding of how these fields change in response to other external forcing.
