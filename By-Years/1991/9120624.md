This proposal focuses on the development of nonlinear signal processing systems
and algorithms that can model or extract information about two types of
nonlinear and time-varying phenomena in speech production: modulations and
turbulence. A model is proposed for short-time speech resonances that combines
both amplitude and frequency modulation. Preliminary experimental findings are
consistent with this model. Fractal models for describing the geometric
fragmentation of the speech signals will be used to quantify the degree of
speech turbulence. A nonlinear filtering algorithm is proposed to measure the
short-time fractal dimension of speech signals.
