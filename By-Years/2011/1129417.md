Professor Bruce E. Koel of Lehigh University is supported by the Chemical
Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to prepare bimetallic germanium
and tin alloys on platinum surfaces, such as Sn/Pt(111) and Ge/Pt(111), and to
form oxide films on these alloys. A sophisticated suite of surface analytical
spectroscopy and microscopy techniques will be employed to characterize the
alloys with atomic scale resolution and provide information on their structure,
composition, and catalytic properties. Structure-property relationships of these
systems, required for their development as new catalytic materials, will be
established. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of metal-based heterogeneous
catalysts are bimetallic or multimetallic systems. The proposed research will
lead to a better understanding of how the structure and composition of
bimetallic Pt alloy surfaces, and oxide-alloy interfaces affect the chemistry
and catalysis of these materials. The results will inform the development of new
catalysts with higher selectivity and the rational design of nanoscale materials
with improved functionality. Graduate and undergraduate students and
postdoctoral associates involved in this research will receive excellent
training in chemical catalysis and surface chemistry.
