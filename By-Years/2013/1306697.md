Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology: Management for an uncertain world:
robust decision theory in face of regime shifts

This research will explore methods for more robust management of ecosystems when
the underlying dynamics are uncertain. This work seeks to bridge mathematical
and biological methods that have hitherto been developed largely in isolation,
such as optimal control (from decision-theoretic work) and early warning signals
(from resilience work) as well as machine learning approaches (from statistics
and computer science). To anchor this work in the biology of a real world
problem, examples and applications will come from the ecosystem dynamics and
economic concerns of marine fisheries. The three main objectives of this project
are: (1) Develop an approach to integrate early warning signals into a decision-
theory framework (2) explore how nonparametric Bayesian inference can account
for structural uncertainty in ecological dynamics, (3) explore how active
learning approaches in each of these areas could be developed to design adaptive
management policies that actively decrease uncertainty.

Effective decision-making in face of deep uncertainty is a fundamental challenge
across many disciplines. Methods that can improve the ability to select robust
actions under such circumstances may have far reaching value. Such real-world
applications will only emerge as they are percolated through and developed by a
larger community of researchers and managers. With this in mind, this project
also seeks to promote a more immediate impact to the scientific community, the
science education community, and the public at large through the use and
development of an online open laboratory notebook. The online notebook will
chronicle the daily advances in this research while also exploring mechanisms
and technology that can advance scientific infrastructure, collaboration and
dissemination of results. See http://carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.
