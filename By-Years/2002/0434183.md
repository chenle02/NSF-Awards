This is a U.S.-Russian workshop on the plate tectonic evolution of northeast
Russia.&lt;br/&gt;It will bring together key research scientists from Russia and
the U.S. with an interest in investigating the plate tectonic evolution of the
North Pacific and the Arctic, with focus on the regional geology and geophysics
of NE Russia. The co-organizers of the workshop are Dr. Elizabeth Miller from
Stanford University and Dr. Alexander Khanchuk from the Far East Geological
Institute in Vladivostok, Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this
workshop is to frame a long-term scientific plan and to outline potential
collaborative projects that utilize existing expertise, databases, laboratories
and institutional capabilities. NE Russia represents the biggest gap in
knowledge of the geologic and tectonic history of the Arctic and North Pacific
margins. Filling this knowledge gap is essential for improving understanding of
the U.S. portions of these margins as well. This workshop is also an exceptional
opportunity for junior U.S. scientists and students to meet and share knowledge
with experts on the vast and remote region of NE
Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop fulfills the program objectives of
bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
