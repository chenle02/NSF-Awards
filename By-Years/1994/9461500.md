This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to research ways to
make mathematics curriculum more accessible to students with physical
disabilities. Students with disabilities have been neglected in mathematics
education, primarily because teachers have lacked the technology to make the
curriculum accessible. Hundreds of thousands of these students could go on to
use math skills in careers of their choice. But they need math education, just
like all other students. This is a feasibility study on Multi-Math Adaptations.
These are math curriculum adaptations that work with multiple math curricula,
serve people with a multiplicity of disabilities, employ a multisensory
approach, and use the power of multimedia computing. These adaptations combine
computer power with hands-on manipulatives and worksheets. Multi-Math
Adaptations take advantage of award-winning computer hardware and software
designed specifically for people with disabilities. The Phase I effort will
involve 1st and 2nd graders, focusing on a prototype unit in Attributes and
Classification. The research team will study math curriculum used in grades 1-2
employed across the country and will design a set of prototype curriculum
adaptations for these curricula. The prototypes will be tested in schools. Data
will be gathered to determine whether Multi-Math Adaptations can be effective
for both the students and the teachers. If Phase I verifies feasibility, a Phase
II will expand to include other units of math study in grades K-5.
