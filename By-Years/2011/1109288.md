This project, renewing a previous award, will continue work on the problem of
how mass, energy, and elements heavier than helium ("metals") cycle in and out
of galaxies over the interval when half the stellar mass now present in galaxies
was forming. Under the prior award, the proposing team acquired spectra of
several hundred galaxies in the relevant range of redshifts. They will use these
data to extend the galaxy mass-metallicity relation to lower stellar masses, and
will investigate the effect of shock excitation on metallicity diagnostics using
both existing and new integral-field spectroscopic data. New observations will
be obtained using new instrumentation becoming available at the Keck Observatory
and on the Very Large Telescope, with an emphasis on detailed follow-up
spectroscopy. The team will make use of fluorescent line emission to try to
resolve discrepant galactic wind velocities obtained from absorption lines
partially filled by emission, and will improve their modeling of line profiles,
by adapting a theory developed for hot star winds and also by numerical ray
tracing through a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation. As a byproduct, the
team will improve knowledge of the scaling relations between outflow properties
and galaxy properties, and constrain the physical nature of the acceleration
mechanism. The project provides support for the third year of a Postdoctoral
Scholar appointment for a female scientist and funds the dissertation research
of a graduate student; and the Principal Investigator will continue her program
of community outreach activities. The team intends to make their line-fitting
code and the data from their survey for ultra-faint, emission-line galaxies
publically available.
