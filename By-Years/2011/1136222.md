Over the course of its five years, this Phase I project is providing 30
scholarships to junior and senior mathematics majors preparing to become grades
6-12 mathematics teachers. This proposal is a joint venture among a variety of
interested parties, including the Department of Computer and Mathematical
Sciences (CMS) at UHD, the Department of Urban Education (UE) at UHD, Aldine
Independent School District, Alief Independent School District, and the Houston
Community College Central Campus. Given the nature of the student population at
the university and the population in the geographic area the university serves,
the project is making strong efforts to recruit minority students.
