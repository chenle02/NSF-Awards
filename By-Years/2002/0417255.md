The long-term goal of this project is to understand how plant cells achieve
various shapes. Cell shape formation is important for the development and the
morphogenesis of plants, but the molecular mechanism underlying this fundamental
process is poorly understood. This project focuses on a network of regulatory
proteins in the control of interlocking jigsaw puzzle appearance of Arabidopsis
leaf epidermal cells. A central player in this network is a plant-specific
guanine nucleotide binding protein known as ROP. The formation of jigsaw puzzle
appearance requires the coordination of localized cellular outgrowth in the
lobe-forming region of the cell with localized constraint of outgrowth in the
other regions. ROP promotes lobing by activating the RIC4 protein to assemble
the actin cytoskeleton required for localized cell outgrowth, as well as by
inactivating the RIC1 protein that organizes the microtubule cytoskeleton for
constraining cellular outgrowth. The RIC1 pathway feedback represses ROP
activation to assure the formation of indentations. In this proposed work,
genetic, molecular, cell biological, and proteomic approaches will be used to
elucidate the mechanism by which ROP activity is regulated as well as the
mechanism underpinning the RIC1 regulation of microtubules. This research aim is
expected to provide new insights into the mechanism for cell shape formation in
plants and to identify new genes that control cell morphogenesis and plant
development. These genes may prove to be useful for genetically manipulating
plant forms that are beneficial to agricultural and horticultural practices.
This project will also integrate research with training of undergraduate and
graduate students and participation of underrepresented undergraduate students
through outreach programs such as Minority Student Summer Research Internships
and REU Programs.
