9610389 Rosenthal This project addresses a number of issues in systems theory
and coding theory. The main objectives of the proposal are: 1. A unified
algebraic theory for general matrix extension problems which, in special
situations, covers results of the pole placement and interpolation literature on
one side and results on matrix extensions on the other side. 2. An extension of
the Hermann-Martin correspondence well known for one dimensional systems to the
situation of multidimensional systems. 3. An optimal control theory for linear
systems over finite fields which will result in methods for constructing
convolutional codes with large free distance, low complexity and simple decoding
schemes. Convolutional codes are used in the data transmission over phone lines,
in the area of wireless communication and in the transmission of pictures from
deep space. Feedback controllers are implemented in many different devices such
as aircraft, robots and chemical processes to mention a few. From a mathematical
point of view linear feedback controllers and convolutional encoders are
governed by similar set of equations. It is the goal of the proposed research to
develop a mathematical theory which will lead to improved design techniques for
feedback controllers of various type as well as more efficient convolutional
encoders and decoders.
