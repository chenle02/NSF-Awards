It is often necessary to characterize the low-frequency mechanical behavior of
physiological systems. For example, the impedance describing pressure/flow
characteristics is a common means of quantitating the overall mechanical
behavior of the pulmonary system. The proposed work is a basic theoretical
investigation into the best techniques to derive the most reliable information
from the least number of experiments. A realistic mathematical "forward" model
will be used to evaluate signal analysis and system identification techniques
using rigorous statistical techniques. The research should lead to better
technology for physiological systems identification, and it may lead to improved
diagnostic procedures.
