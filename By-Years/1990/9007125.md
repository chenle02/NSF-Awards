The P.I.'s intend to explore the mechanisms of interaction among terrestrial
plants and their herbivores, including both direct interactions (e.g. herbivores
consume plants) and indirect interactions (e.g. herbivores may affect the
outcome of plant competition by increasing soil nutrient concentration).
previous studies of old field grasses and herbs and their major herbivores,
grasshoppers, at their study site in central Minnesota indicate that (1) plants
are limited by and compete for soil nitrogen, (2) grasshopper reduce plant
abundance and affect plant species composition, and (3) grasshoppers are limited
by and compete for plant food. Based on these studies, the investigators propose
three experiments to show how these interactions link together: (1) garden
experiments in which the effects of different plants on soil nitrogen, plants on
other plants, grasshoppers on plants, grasshoppers on nitrogen, and grasshoppers
on other grasshoppers will be measured separately and in combination on plots
where soil nutrients, plant species composition, and grasshopper densities will
be controlled, (2) field experiments in which densities of six grasshopper
species will be manipulated to look at these same potential effects in a natural
community, and (3) laboratory feeding experiments in which grasshoppers will be
fed different plant species and their preference and physiological responses
measured. These experiments will measure the mechanisms and strength of direct
and indirect plant - herbivore interactions under controlled conditions,
determine the role of herbivore diet selection in these interactions, and
determine the importance of these interactions in a real community containing
the same plant and grasshopper species. This study may be the first to address
all three goals in a single, relatively simple, system. The results will provide
a foundation for predicting the outcome of these interactions and consequently,
the structure of plant and herbivore communities. //
