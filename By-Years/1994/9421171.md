9421171 Zahler The sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) is a protein located in the
membrane of cells that helps to control the size (volume) of the cells, and
their salt and water content. In addition, the ability of nerve and heart cells
to generate the electrical energy necessary for muscular contraction depends on
this enzyme. The sodium pump is especially important in the heart, where its
activities are crucial for regulating the strength of contraction. The sodium
pump is also the target of action of digitalis, a commonly used cardiac
medication. Because of the pivotal role of this enzyme system, many scientists
have studied its function. New techniques, however, have revealed that the
sodium pump is much more complex than was believed a few years ago. These
techniques have been used to show that there are at least three different forms
of the sodium pump, produced at different times in different parts of the heart.
It has been shown that the cardiac conduction system, which controls the rhythm
of the heartbeat, concentrates a particular type of sodium pump. Also, the
number of these pumps appear to vary during pathologic changes such as cardiac
enlargement (seen in hypertension) or heart failure. The pumps and their
response to stress are important because they help regulate the strength of
cardiac contraction, and transmission of electrical signals within the heart.
This project will analyze the roles of the different forms of the sodium pump by
using genetic engineering to create mice that have an abnormal distribution of
pump types in their hearts, and evaluating the effect of these changes on the
sodium pumping characteristics of cells from these hearts. Different types of
cultured human cells will also be genetically engineered in a similar manner.
Not only does the heart produce several different forms of the sodium pump, but
the pump types found in hearts from newborn animals are different from the types
of pumps in hearts from older animals. The second goal of the project is to
better understand the genetic mechanism that controls the switching of pump
types in the heart. This work may lead to a better understanding of the effects
and toxicity of digitalis-like drugs on the heart. ***
