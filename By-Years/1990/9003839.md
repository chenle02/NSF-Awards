The existence of the rapid, Younger Dryas climate event in the southern
hemisphere is still a matter of great debate. If this event had detectable
effects in the southern hemisphere, then variations in climate caused by
internal oscillations may be important for altering climate on a global scale.
This proposal requests support to reconstruct the high frequency changes in
climate observed in the southern hemisphere during the last glacial-interglacial
transition, the time of the Younger Dryas event. The paleoclimate records will
be based on pollen assemblage variations and D/H ratios in peat sections. D/H
ratios are a function of temperature and moisture availability. The PIs wish to
calibrate the D/H variations for this region and then use the calibration to
quantify the variations in the past. Thus the D/H ratios will supplement the
pollen data and help to identify what climate parameters changed during the
deglaciation. This research is important because we do not yet know the history
of climate in the southern hemisphere. It is necessary to understand the extent
of climate change in this hemisphere before we fully understand the mechanisms
of abrupt climate change.
