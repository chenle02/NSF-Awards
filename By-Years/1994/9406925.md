Project Summary Tao/ATM-9406925 The objective of this research is to develop a
fully nonlinear, nonhydrostatic, compressible high resolution model and to
investigate the nonlinear propagation and dissipation of gravity waves in the
middle atmosphere. First studies will be on nonlinear wave-wave interactions in
a two dimensional model to understand if the nonlinearity plays any role in the
dissipation of gravity waves. Then, a three-dimensional model will be used to
understand the importance of the nonlinearity and to investigate the possible
gravity wave sources in the lower atmosphere. The results from this research may
have important implications on the parameterization of gravity waves in large
scale atmospheric general circulation models which are used in studies of
climate changes.
