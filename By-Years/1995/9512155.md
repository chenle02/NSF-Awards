ABSTRACT Proposal: 9512155 PI: Cole, R. Institution: University of New Orleans
This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of New Orleans acquire triple
quadrapole Mass Spectrometer which will be used in research. The research
activity to be supported includes: 1. direct mixture analysis of bacterial
toxins, and lipid portions 2. structural analysis problems involving novel
glycosphingolipids 3. energy-resolved tandem mass spectrometry experiments 4.
thermodynamic properties of organometallic compounds 5. amino acid sequence of
light harvesting proteins 6. collisionally-activated reactions 7. reactivity of
Zintl phase materials Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the
technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid
molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization is combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
