The Robert Noyce Scholarship program is attracting science and mathematics
secondary teachers into the Cornell Teacher Education (CTE) program to provide
highly qualified for high needs rural schools. The objectives of the program are
to: (1) recruit qualified STEM students dedicated to teaching in high needs
districts; (2) educate them to become exemplary teachers; (3) support and retain
these teachers in teaching in high needs districts; and (4) use program
evaluation to research teacher recruitment, retention and development.

CTE students complete a rigorous undergraduate major in a science, mathematics,
or engineering field, then complete a Masters of Arts in Teaching degree and
earn New York certification. The project is expanding existing successful
recruitment networks to find qualified STEM students or professionals interested
in teaching in high needs schools. Cornell's location and the presence of the
Rural Schools Association of New York State at Cornell allows the CTE Noyce
program to focus on placing teachers in high needs rural schools. Noyce teachers
are developing learning groups to collaborate on solving the problems they face
in their teaching. The learning groups build on the established CTE cohort
structure and are supported by asynchronous web-based communication systems and
summer work with Cornell faculty.

Noyce scholars participate in evaluation research as they are fulfilling their
teaching commitments. Evaluation data is contributing to the knowledge of how to
support teacher learning and development and is being used to determine best
practices for recruiting qualified STEM students and career changers; helping
pre-service teachers perform well in rural schools; supporting new teachers in
high needs districts/schools; and determining which students perform most
successfully in high needs districts/schools.
