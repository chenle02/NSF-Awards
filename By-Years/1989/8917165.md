This project measures perturbations to subionospheric very low frequency (VLF)
radio signals caused by the precipitation of energetic magnetospheric electrons.
The trapped electrons are scattered into the atmospheric loss cone by whistler
waves produced by atmospheric lightning discharges. The sudden heating and
ionization of the lower ionosphere causes changes in the amplitude and phase of
the VLF signal. The measurement supported by this grant are made at Palmer
Station, Antarctica, and they complement similar measurement made at three
northern hemisphere sites by the same investigators, but supported by another
NSF program. By observing several VLF transmitters from several sites it is
possible to "image" the ionospheric disturbances.
