This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
development of novel solid state facilitated transport membranes for the
separation of carbon dioxide/hydrogen and carbon dioxide/methane mixtures.
Current best technologies are amine absorption or pressure-swing-adsorption both
expensive, energy intensive processes. The key objective of this project is to
deliver a new type of facilitated transport membrane in the form of a solid
polymer electrolyte. To provide high gas fluxes, the membranes will be formed as
thin-film composites. Preliminary studies indicate that solid polymer
electrolyte composite membranes can show significantly improved performance over
conventional facilitated transport and polymeric
membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separation of carbon dioxide from natural gas
and from hydrogen-containing refinery off-gases in refineries present a
significant opportunity for membrane-based-gas separation. About 17% of U.S.
natural gas requires processing to remove carbon dioxide. In refineries,
hydrogen is typically produced by steam reforming of natural gas or light
hydrocarbons and must be separated from carbon dioxide, which is produced as a
by-product. Membrane separation offers many advantages over amine absorption or
pressure-swing adsorption in these two applications. However more selective and
robust membranes are needed to achieve these economics over conventional
separation technology and this is reason for developing solid polymer
electrolyte composite membranes.&lt;br/&gt;
