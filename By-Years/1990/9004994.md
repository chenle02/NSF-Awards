The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the relationship
between the debris avalanche of Raung Volcano, Java, to explosive volcanism. The
debris avalanche, with its run out length of 60 kilometers is one of the largest
in Indonesia and perhaps in the world. It is well exposed and readily
accessible. The deposit is interstratified with deposits of magmatic eruptions,
some of which are probably deposits of lateral blasts similar to Mount St.
Helens blast of May 18, 1980. The central question to be pursued is whether or
not the debris avalanche caused an associated magmatic eruption, or a magmatic
eruption caused the debris avalanche. This issue is poorly known scientifically
and is important for solving more general problems about the development of
pyroclastic surges and flows. It is also critical in assessing eruption hazards
and development of evacuation and contingency plans in areas of large
stratovolcanoes with steeply sloping sides.
