Data-intensive applications such as web information retrieval and scientific
data-driven applications consume significant computational and I/O resources.
With the ubiquity of computer networks and advances in server clustering
technologies, it has become a reachable goal to make large-scale datasets and
related services available to many concurrent users in real-time. System support
for online applications must achieve high performance in the presence of
concurrent execution and runtime workload fluctuation. Extending such support
for data intensive applications presents significant challenges, including those
concerning highly concurrent I/O at the host level and multi-dimensional
resource allocation (e.g., CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O) on distributed
platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to
develop system-level support to achieve high throughput and efficient resource
utilization for data intensive online applications. Large-scale online
applications often contain multiple application components and data partitions,
hosted on server and storage clusters. The resource utilization efficiencies at
both the host-level and the cluster-level are important for achieving high
system throughput. There are two parallel research thrusts in this project. At
the host level, the project will investigate operating system support
(particularly I/O prefetching and memory management) for I/O-intensive
concurrent application execution. At the cluster level, the proposed research
will explore efficient resource allocation to application and data components on
heterogeneous distributed platforms using a profile-driven
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Techniques developed in this project will be
evaluated through experimentation with real applications, drawn from both the
scientific domain and web-based commercial applications. Developed software
artifacts and experimental datasets will be released for public use. In parallel
to research, this project will enhance the curriculum of relevant systems-area
courses at the PI's institution. This effort includes the development of a new
operating system instructional laboratory platform focusing on performance-
oriented system design and implementation. Additionally, a new graduate course
on scalable online systems and applications will be created, using results
produced in this research and by other related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
