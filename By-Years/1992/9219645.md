The Wyoming Province exposes one of the most isotopically evolved Archean
cratons. The Wyoming Province forms an early part of the north American
Precambrian shield, to which younger terranes were accreted. However, the origin
of the province is unclear, with some isotopic data suggesting that it was
derived from an older reservoir that must have been older than 4.0 Ga if it U/Pb
ratio was comparable to average crust. Determining the age and composition of
this older reservoir is crucial for understanding the processes that lead to the
transformation of this craton from an older, relatively high U/Pb system to a
low U/Pb system by the end of the Archean. The work involves a detailed geologic
and geochemical investigation, including SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology, of the
Middle to Early Archean crust in the Beartooth Mountains where the evolved
isotopic signature is best documented. Results will be important in constraining
the processes involved in Earth's early geochemical differentiation.
