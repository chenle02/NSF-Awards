The Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation supports the research program of Professor Mahdi Abu-Omar of the
University of California, Santa Barbara. This project is focused on the area of
sustainability or "Green Chemistry". The project seeks new ways to produce
industrially important chemicals and fuels. This work is relevant to the economy
of United States, the largest producer of chemical products globally. Chemical
producers seek renewable starting materials. They also seek to use abundant
resources when possible. Safety in a chemical process is a third consideration.
These goals motivate research on chemical reactions that are environmentally
friendly. Professor Abu-Omar's project uses cheap and abundant elements such as
manganese and iron along with plant-based groups to form the new catalysts that
in turn, speed up the desired reactions. Detailed analyses of the rates of these
chemical reactions give insights into how the catalyst works on an atomic level.
In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Abu-Omar is actively
engaged in an outreach program involving community college (CC) students, who
are largely from underrepresented groups, in laboratory research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the
Chemistry Division, Dr. Mahdi Abu-Omar of the University of California, Santa
Barbara (UCSB) is designing and synthesizing catalysts based on first row
transition metals, specifically manganese and iron. These catalysts are further
designed using lignin-based ligands (LBL). The synthesis of LBL is high
yielding, atom economical, and satisfies many of the Principles of Green
Chemistry. The design of LBL provides a motif that is highly suited for
coordination chemistry but yet resistant to oxidative degradation. Iron- and
manganese-LBL complexes are then employed to generate chlorine dioxide on-demand
from chlorite in aqueous solution under ambient temperature and at neutral pH. A
significant improvement in chlorine dioxide production is to avoid oxygen atom
transfer (OAT) from the catalyst to chlorite to make chlorate, which is a
persistent pollutant. Under investigation is the oxidation of phenanthrene and
phenols (aromatic compounds) by in situ generated chlorine dioxide. In a unique
approach, two catalytic cycles are coupled in tandem to achieve oxidations with
dioxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
