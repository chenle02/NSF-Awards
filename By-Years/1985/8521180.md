This supplement is for a continuation of the Cornell radar observations at the
Arecibo Observatory, including completion of work on the Radar Signal
Comparator, which has suffered a number of unforseen delays. This device is an
important aide to improvement of the quality of data obtainable with the radar,
and will be used on their current research and by many other Arecibo users. The
Cornell group sustains one of the leading research efforts in radar studies of
the ionosphere. Their studies of large scale plasma motions, plasma turbulence
and plasma instabilities has implications ranging from radio communications to
fusion reactor technology.
