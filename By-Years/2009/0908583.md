This Inter-American Materials Collaboration involving New Jersey Institute of
Technology (NJIT) and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) will
develop new backbone chemistries for very high performance fibers, films and
plastics incorporating renewable resource monomers derived from common
agricultural crops. It is expected that these materials will have the density of
common plastics yet exhibit the strength and stiffness usually associated with
metals. The basic building block of the proposed research is isosorbide, a
glucose derived chemical (glucose is a common product of either starch or
cellulose fermentation) which can be incorporated into the backbone of
polyesters and other common polymers. These materials are expected to be
renewable, load bearing, lightweight, environmentally friendly and energy
efficient.

This project explores the science behind achieving very high mechanical and
thermal performance in polymeric materials. The relationship between ordered
polymer liquids (liquid crystal polymers) and high performance polymeric
products is well established. This project will lead to new understanding of the
relationship between polymer backbone chemistry, liquid crystal phase creation
and liquid crystalline polymer performance. Specifically: this project focuses
on: The identification of new, controlled stereochemistry mesogenic and
disrupting monomers from renewable resources Increased definition of how
backbone chemistry defines LC phase structure, chain interactions and
entanglements, rheology and solid state mechanical properties Amplification of
how processing and annealing interacts with backbone chemistry to define LCP
performance

The program builds a strong and sustainable program between UNAM and NJIT,
providing a forum for scientific cooperation between the US and Mexico over a
broad range of physical science and engineering area. This research provides an
avenue for exchange of personnel ranging from senior faculty to high school
students
