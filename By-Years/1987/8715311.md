Joshua Leslie will continue his research in the theory of infinite dimensional
Lie groups. This is an area of growing importance because of its physical
applications. The major objective is to investigate the extent to which the well
known finite dimensional theory can be adapted to this more difficult setting.
Leslie will use his recently established techniques to try to associate Lie
groups to certain completions of Kac-Moody Lie algebras. This is a difficult
problem but his functional analytic methods have already proved to be successful
when applied to numerous significant classes of examples.
