The macroscopic properties of surfactant-oil water emulsion, polymer solutions
and gels, biological membranes and other structured fluids depend intimately on
their often unique microstructure. Freeze-fracture replication transmission
electron microscopy (FFRTEM) provides the most detailed and direct view of the
three-dimensional spatial organization in any liquid system. For example, FFRTEM
provides otherwise- unavailable information on the network structure aqueous
polymer gels, making it possible to relate changes in network structure to
chemical and mechanical treatments. This project will examine phase changes and
critical fluctuations in aqueous polyacrylamide gels; such fluctuations have
never before been visualized. The rod-coil transition of conducting polymers and
the gel formation that results from this transition will also be examined with
FFRTEM. A second area of interest is surfactant microstructure in solution.
FFRTEM has provided the only view of micelles in concentrated surfactant-water
mixtures and is the best probe for visualizing biological and synthetic
bilayers.
