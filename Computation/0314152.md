Krylov subspace methods are widely used for the iterative solution of large
sparse linear systems that arise in scientific and engineering applications. The
standard Krylov subspace methods have been developed based on either the single
starting Lanczos procedure (SSLP) or Arnoldi procedure. Since the multiple
starting Lanczos procedure (MSLP) was invented, the superior robustness of MSLP
to SSLP has been demonstrated through a variety of applications. Block Krylov
subspace methods for solving linear systems with multiple right-hand sides have
been derived from MSLP. However, there has been rare study of deriving Krylov
subspace methods from MSLP for systems with a single right-hand side. Of course,
multiple right-hand sides includes the single right-hand side as its special
case. The PI, however, expects that finer methods can be obtained when we focus
on the single right-hand side case. Tony Chan and the PI recently made the first
attempt in this direction and methods named ML(n)BiCG and ML(n)BiCGSTAB,
respectively, were developed. This project continues this trend and aims at (i)
generalizing the existing standard methods from SSLP to MSLP; (ii) reducing the
storage requirement of ML(n)BiCGSTAB; (iii) improving the robustness of
ML(n)BiCG. This is the next step toward attainment of the PI's long-term goal of
developing parallel Krylov subspace methods. The feasibility of the proposed
aims have been demonstrated by the PI's preliminary studies of ML(n)BiCGSTAB and
of a transpose-free MSLP algorithm. The approaches employed to attain the aims
are based on certain ways of adapting the derivation of BiCG from SSLP and the
derivation of the BiCGSTAB(n) from BiCG.

The results will be tested extensively with industrial databases, for example,
the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection. If successful, the research
proposed will be significant because it will dramatically improve the robustness
of the existing methods and, as a result, significantly drive down the time and
cost in computation. It also allows for the development of more robust parallel
Krylov subspace methods, for example, by rescheduling the operations into
parallelism. The research will also provide ideal topics for class learning and
thesis research. Moreover, the PI once participated in research in Chemical and
Petroleum Engineering, University of Wyoming, on removing nitrogen oxides from
combustion exhaust streams. The resulting methods of the project will promote
the collaboration in future because more robust algorithms will then be
available to use in solving the PDE models arising from the collaborative study.
