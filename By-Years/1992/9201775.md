This award continues support for an effort to develop a meteorological
dropwindsonde for deployment from unmanned aircraft. During Phase I, a unique,
potentially very reliable rotary sonde configuration was developed and tested
with releases from unmanned aircraft. During Phase II, the principal
investigator and his colleagues will develop the integrating electronics for
systems in the sonde and produce 50 prototype sondes. These sondes will be able
to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and winds, and will employ the
Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system to determine location. A first-
generation airborne data acquisition system, which includes high-precision
instruments for initializing the sonde instruments (e.g., a Lyman alpha
hygrometer to measure water vapor), will be assembled and tested as well. The
system will have applications in the areas of hurricane tracking, studies of the
tropical water vapor budgets, and meteorological observations in remote areas
where rawinsonde coverage is not presently available. Although designed for
unmanned aircraft, the system can easily be adapted to almost any manned
aircraft. The system could represent a very significant advancement for
meteorological observing, both for research and operational purposes.
