The projects in this proposal address classical questions in geometric analysis
related to the existence, structure, and compactness of solutions to particular
variational problems. In a previous work with N. Kapouleas, the PI developed a
gluing construction to produce new examples of embedded constant mean curvature
surfaces with finite topology in Euclidean three space. The PI expects that
appropriate modifications to the linear problem will allow her to extend their
techniques to produce infinitely many new embedded, constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces. As a second project, the PI will consider compactness theory for
extrinsic biharmonic maps. For sequences of harmonic maps, energy quantization
and regularity theory play a key role in establishing the compactness result.
The PI intends to show, using comparable results for the biharmonic setting,
that the limiting biharmonic map and the maps arising from dilations at
concentration points are connected in the image manifold without necks. Finally,
the PI will attempt to combine and extend her study of the structure of
complete, embedded minimal surfaces with finite topology and the structure of
annular minimal surfaces with boundary to understand the structure of complete
minimal surfaces with infinite topology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solutions to
variational problems are critical points for an energy functional and as such
are deeply connected with physical phenomenon. As a particular example, minimal
surfaces are critical points for area and on sufficiently small scales are area
minimizers, with soap films occurring as natural models. The objects and
questions considered in this project can be studied through the lens of partial
differential equations, analysis, calculus of variations, and submanifold
geometry and are of interest to pure and applied mathematicians as well as many
physicists.
