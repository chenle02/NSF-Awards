An observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would have profound
implications for fundamental nuclear and particle physics. It would confirm that
neutrino mass is truly a non-standard model phenomenon, open a window on grand
unification physics, and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass
spectrum. Conversely, if neutrinoless double beta decay can be shown not to
occur in nature, lepton-number conservation would be promoted from an accidental
symmetry to an exact symmetry, sterile neutrinos would be proven to exist, and
we would rule out a wide variety of new physics models.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory) collaboration has
completed the construction and underground installation of the world's largest
double beta decay experiment, the EXO-200 detector. This experiment is the first
to be mounted at the 100 kg scale, and it represents one of our best
opportunities to observe neutrinoless double beta decay in the quasi-degenerate
mass region in the next two to three years. This award will provide support to
continue the University of Maryland's involvement in EXO-200.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This support has additional broader impacts outside the
field of neutrino physics, primarily by training young researchers in the
methods of experimental science, and by demonstrating experimental techniques
and technologies which have applications in other areas of pure and applied
science.
