The High Energy Physics group at California State University, Fresno, requests
support for an RUI (Research at an Undergraduate Institution) in frontier
collider physics research. CSF is a non-PhD granting institution and a major
focus of the program is undergraduate involvement in all levels of experimental
HEP. The research program is focused on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron with analysis activities in the area of top physics (t-tbar production
cross section and studies of t-tbar events in the dimuon channel), and hardware
activities in the upgrade of the Silicon Microtracker Sybsystem (electronics
testing for the new Layer 0 detector).&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate their activitiesm
the CSF group has: installed an electronics laboratory on their campus for the
development and production testing of solid state detectpr readpit electronics
used by D0; installed computing facilities for data analysis and HEP software
development; and has involved students at the graduate and undergraduate levels
in the operation of the D0 experiment.&lt;br/&gt;This request will provide
support for continued undergraduate student participation on the experiment.
