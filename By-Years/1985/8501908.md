This conference, to be held May 15-17, 1985, on the campus of the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will feature invited papers on all aspects of
VLSI and contributed papers in design automation, circuits, architecture, and
theory. This conference, which is the seventh in a series of conferences, seeks
to emphasize work on the effects of VLSI on the design of algorithms and on the
design of complete, integrated systems. Attendance will be by invitation only,
and participation is expected from all the leading universities, industrial
firms, and governmental agencies associated with VLSI research. A printed
Proceedings will be distributed at the conference, and the formal proceedings
published. These conferences serve an important role in transferring new
research ideas from universities into industry. It also serves to feed back
industrial and other practical constraints to the university participants, and
thereby help assure that university research is consistent with the long-term
needs of industry.
