This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to design and
test a tailored composite sacrificial anode for galvanic cathodic protection
systems for reinforced and prestressed concrete. This anode system can be
tailored for each application to provide the desired performance characteristics
by changing the composition and form of the finished composite. The composite
sacrificial anode will contain all of the necessary components in a single unit,
minimizing the need for special installation procedures. Galvanic cathodic
protection systems have not been extensively developed for corrosion control of
reinforced concrete due to voltage and current limitations of single-component
solid metal ribbon or plate anodes. Interest has been renewed due to the need
for cost-effective rehabilitation of the nation's deteriorating infrastructure.
Galvanic cathodic protection is also being considered for prestressed concrete
structures to avoid risk of hydrogen embrittlement caused by overprotection of
the steel by electrically driven systems. The focus of the proposed program will
be on development and testing of composite sacrificial anodes in wet alkaline
sand and 3 m concrete slabs for galvanic protection of reinforcing steel and
prestressing wires. The effects of fabrication methods, anode composition,
physical characteristics and form, and concrete chemistry on galvanic
performance will be evaluated.
