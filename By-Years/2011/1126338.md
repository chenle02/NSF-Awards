This award will support the purchase of a high resolution time-of-flight gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer for a variety of applications in atmospheric
sciences, oceanography, and biomedical sciences. The instrumentation will be
capable of investigating complex mixtures of trace organic compounds present in
the environment or relevant to other research. The instrument will provide
improved methods of separation of compounds and characterization of complex
mixtures, as well as increased sensitivity to trace concentrations. It will
enhance research at the Miami Coral Gables and Medical campuses, and at Nova
Southeastern University, as well as provide training opportunities for graduate
and undergraduate students as part of course offerings.
