9311776 Cassandras This proposal is in response to the Engineering Faculty
Internship Initiative. The objective of the proposed project is to provide the
opportunity for the Principal Investigator and two graduate students to closely
work with the OTIS Elevator Company, in order to develop and test several
dynamic dispatching schemes for elevator systems. These are novel schemes based
on research carried out by the PI and his students in the broader context of
Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS). In particular, the solution to some
dispatching control problems is of a form which ultimately depends on a set of
discrete "threshold" parameters. Some of the proposed schemes are based on
"learning" the optimal values of these parameters, based on readily observed
data from an elevator system and by applying techniques recently developed for
the on-line control of stochastic DEDS. Thus, this is an opportunity to put some
theory developed for DEDS control and performance optimization to the test, as
well as to gain a better understanding of a class of DEDS and related problems
of design, analysis, control, and performance optimization. In accordance with
the guidelines of this Initiative, the OTIS Elevator Company has already made a
commitment of $30,000 (non-federal funds) to support this effort and has
assigned a co-investigator for the project. ***
