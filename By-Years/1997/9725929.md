9725929 Torikachvili This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research
collaboration between Drs. Milton Torikachvili and Alex Lacerda of San Diego
State University to work with Drs. Renato de Figueiredo Jardim and Sergio Gama
at the University of Sao Paulo and the University of Campinas, respectively, on
electronic and magnetic properties of novel materials. Specifically, they will
study transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of strongly correlated
electron systems (SCES), and transition metal oxides displaying large
magnetoresistive effects. The studies will be done in low magnetic fields, as
well as in extreme conditions of high magnetic fields and low temperatures on
high quality specimens, with the goal of advancing the understanding of these
materials and to test current models. This collaboration will combine the
resources, facilities and expertise of San Diego State University, the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Los Alamos, the University of Sao Paulo and
the University of Campinas. The two Brazilian universities support one of the
largest efforts in condensed matter research in Latin America. At Los Alamos,
the PIs will be given access to the 60 tesla quasicontinuous magnet, which is
the world's strongest controlled power magnet and the first one of its kind in
the US. The US PIs bring their extensive experience in performing measurements
of electronic and magnetic properties at extreme conditions. Professor Gama is
experienced in the study of phase relations in magnetic materials. Dr. Jardim
will be training new students throughout this project. ***
