9450386 The proposed research would support investigations with respect to
surface structure and dynamics of transition metal surfaces as well as larger
fullerenes and their variants. The proposal seeks to enhance the inter-
disciplinary interactions between the molecular dynamics group and the wavelet
based methods for signal and image processing group that are part of the Center
for Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems. The proposed work would have an
impact on the training of minority undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate
students in physics and chemistry.
