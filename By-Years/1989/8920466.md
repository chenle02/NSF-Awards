This award will provide support to a group from New York University, who are
working on the completion of the DO detector at the Fermilab Tevatron antiproton
proton collider. This will be a major new facility for the study of high energy
phenomena. The detector is optimized for the detection of jets of particles,
charged leptons and neutrinos, which are the basic products of protons -
antiprotons interactions at high energies. This will be a valuable complement to
the CDF experiment, which is already taking data at the collider at Fermilab at
an energy of 2 TeV, the highest available accelerator energy in the world today.
