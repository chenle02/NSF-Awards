This project will concentrate on the role of reaction- diffusion equations in
mathematical ecology. Population dynamics for communities in heterogeneous
environments will be considered. It is expected that substantial progress will
be made by employing mathematical tools such as the concepts of persistence and
permanence in dynamical systems. The notion of skew-product flow will be applied
to study species and community models which involve temporal and spatial
heterogeneity. It is also planned to investigate the relation between reaction-
diffusion models and the theory of island biogeography.
