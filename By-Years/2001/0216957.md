Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate the ability
of a vertebrate to use gradients in the inclination or 'dip angle' of the
earth's magnetic field (defined as the angle between the magnetic field lines
and gravity) to determine geographic ("map") position. Previous studies of
homing orientation have shown that magnetic inclination may be used to derive
one coordinate of a navigational map. To provide a more rigorous test of
magnetic inclination's role in providing map information, the effects of small
changes in magnetic inclination on homing orientation will be used to estimate
characteristics of the local gradient of magnetic inclination within an animal's
home range, e.g., the "home value" of inclination and the alignment of the
gradient. These behaviorally derived estimates will then be compared with actual
measured values obtained by mapping the spatial gradients of magnetic
inclination around the sites where animals were collected. A comparison of the
response of animals collected at sites along the north-south and east-west axes
relative to our testing site will also be used to help distinguish "map" and
"non-map" effects resulting from changes in magnetic inclination, and to
determine whether a true bicoordinate map is being used to determine geographic
position. The proposed experiments will contribute to a better understanding of
the magnetic field's role in the map component of homing. These experiments will
also help to determine the lower limits of the sensitivity of biological systems
to variation in the geomagnetic field and, at a more general level, to determine
the precision with which the vertebrate nervous system can measure the absolute
values of physical stimuli.&lt;br/&gt;
