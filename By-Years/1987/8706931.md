The "heterogenization" refers to the representation of the solution to a
heterogeneous problem of elastostatics in terms of the solution to the
corresponding homogeneous problem. Solutions of homogeneous problems are already
known in many cases, while solutions of problems for bodies composed of two (or
more) different materials are generally difficult to obtain. The approach to be
followed in this study is based on the method of images due to Kelvin, never
exploited in elastostatics, and should lead to algebraic formulas linking
quantities of interest in the homogeneous problem to the corresponding
quantities of the heterogeneous problem. The formulas should remain the same for
any type of loading produced by any type of singularities, such as concentrated
forces, moments, and dislocations. Both two-dimensional (plane and antiplane
deformation) and three-dimensional states of stress should be tractable by this
method.
