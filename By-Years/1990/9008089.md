An International Conference on the Nerve Growth Cone is planned for the
Santiago Ramon y Cajal Neurobiology Institute in Madrid, SPAIN from October
15-19, 1990. The goal of the Conference is to bring together top researchers on
nerve growth cones to synthesize current knowledge, develop new concepts of
growth cone function, and crystalize strategies for future experimentation. This
meeting is especially timely, because techniques and tools now coming available
from chemistry, molecular biology, physiology, optics and computerized imaging
technology are allowing significant gains in elucidation of how growth cones
mediate the intricate construction of nervous systems. A meeting of scientists
who use these diverse methods will generate new insights and collaborations. The
conference will cover the following topics: internal chemistry and physiology of
growth cone activity, external control of growth cone behavior, growth cone
activity in developing organisms as neural circuits are constructed, and growth
cone activity in adult organisms and after neural circuits are damaged. Thus,
this meeting will help explain how the brain grows, adapts, learns, and perhaps
can be repaired. Twenty nine speakers have already agreed to speak at the
meeting and also write a chapter for a published monograph. In addition, poster
exhibits will be presented. Neurobiological interest in growth cone activity has
grown tremendously, and this first meeting devoted solely to growth cones will
receive wide notice and will enhance research in the area for several years.
