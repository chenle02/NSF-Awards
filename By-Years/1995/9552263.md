The field of environmental engineering is faced with the remediation of soil and
groundwater that have been contaminated with toxic organic compounds.
Remediation methods would prioritize techniques that destroy the compounds
instead of merely shifting them to another medium. Bioremediation, the
degradation of such compounds by micro-organisms, is a method that is being
chosen for soil and groundwater remediation with increasing frequency.
Bioremediation is an interdisciplinary field, requiring individuals who have
received training in both microbial physiology and ecology, as well as in
engineering. This project is directed at preparing students to be able to design
engineered systems that provide micro-organisms with engineered conditions that
are conducive to the biodegradation of toxic organic compounds. The emphasis in
the class on Bioremediation Engineering is on the analysis of microbial kinetics
and application of laboratory kinetic studies to full- scale design.
Biodegradation rates in aerobic environments are measured with a respirometer
because of simplicity of operation and automatic data collection capability of
the respirometer. Biodegradation rates in anaerobic environments are also
investigated. A microscope is employed to demonstrate microbial morphology. The
impact of the project is the training of a large number of individuals with a
bachelor of science in Environmental Engineering in bioremediation techniques.
