Schulte-Pelkham&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0310372&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
research is to derive new constraints for the depth distribution of seismic
anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of
deformation in the mantle, and the ability to separate signals from different
depths, such as from the lithosphere versus the asthenosphere, allows new
insights into the distribution of deformation with depth, and therefore into the
nature of plate-mantle coupling and the driving forces of plate tectonics. There
are several techniques to detect seismic anisotropy, such as measurements of
shear wave splitting, P wave polarization anomalies, and Pn azimuthal velocity
variations. These phases have different depth sensitivities for anisotropy, so
that the combination of all measurements provides new constraints on vertically
varying anisotropy. In addition, shear wave splitting and P wave polarization
anomalies have shown to be frequency dependent in vertically varying anisotropic
media, but a quantification of this effect that can be applied to observations
has yet to be developed. The first part of this project is to quantify the
differences in depth sensitivity between different body wave methods and the
frequency dependent behavior, through numerical forward modeling and
measurements on synthetic data. The second part is the application of the
resulting benchmarks to data from the Global Seismic Network. In terms of
broader impacts, these results will provide new tools and insights relevant to
plate-mantle interaction to seismologists, geodynamicists, and the wider
community. The resulting analysis guidelines may be especially useful for
datasets anticipated from the EarthScope program. Linking seismic anisotropy
more quantitatively to geodynamics will foster interdisciplinary research.
