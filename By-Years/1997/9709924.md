In ongoing research concerning implicit social cognition we have developed the
view that important components of the cognitive processes that underlie social
actions are (a) ordinarily hidden from the actor's awareness or ability to
control and, as a consequence, (b) beyond the possibility of effective
investigation using methods that are limited to self-report measures. Our
research has successfully employed several indirect measures to reveal the
operation of implicit stereotypes. The first goal of this project is to extend
these investigations of implicit social cognition to the domains of the social-
cognitive constructs of implicit attitudes and implicit self-esteem. Existing
measures of unconscious social cognition (most prominently semantic priming
measures) have some notable limitations. Although these measures have been used
effectively at laboratories in which they were developed, they (a) have not
readily been exported to other laboratories and (b) have not yielded large
enough effect sizes to succeed as individual difference measures. Our previous
NSF-funded research has yielded a new procedure (the Implicit Association Test,
IAT) that has been shown to provide a reliable, efficient, and sensitive measure
of individual differences in implicit social cognition. The second goal of the
current project is to document the basic properties of the IAT method and to
develop its use as a core technique for investigating implicit social cognition.
The research will yield three types of desirable products: (a) new measures that
should be broadly useful in psychological investigations of social behavior, (b)
new theoretical insights into the involvement of unconscious cognition in social
behavior, and (c)applications in important settings, such as workplace and
school, in which unrecognized (i.e., implicit) stereotypes and prejudices
interfere with desirable or productive behavior.
