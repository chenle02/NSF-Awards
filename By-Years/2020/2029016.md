Statistical methods have had great successes for exploring data, making
predictions, and solving problems in a wide range of problems. But in the world
of big data, methods need to be scalable, so as to handle larger problems while
modeling the real-world problems of messy and nonrepresentative data. The
projectâ€™s novelties are developments in software and hardware facilitating full-
stack integration of Bayesian inference to allow complex and realistic models to
be fit to large datasets. The project's impacts are in many areas of pure and
applied science, including fields as diverse as epidemiology, genetics, and
political science, which are challenging because they are dense in parameters
rather than in data. Examples include models for disease progression and drug
development, decision making under uncertainty, and trends in public
opinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is exploring probabilistic
programming, including hardware, high-performance computing, programming
languages and compilers, and algorithms. The ultimate goal is to develop the
tools necessary for an efficient, and scalable Bayesian workflow, building on
the existing success of the open-source probabilistic programming language Stan.
The team of researchers on this project are working on explorations of
algorithms (model validation for approximate inference), programming languages
and compilers (automating of approximate algorithms and advanced performance
profiling), systems (probabilistic programming for streaming data), high-
performance computing (parallel processing and GPUs), and hardware (exploring
domain-specific hardware for Bayesian computation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
