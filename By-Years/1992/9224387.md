This international, group travel grant supports six American Undergraduate
engineering students who will complete a coordinated program of academic and
industrial research in Germany. The nominal model consists of a three month
period during the summer of 1993. The first two months of the program will
consist of research at a German University. Normally, the research will be of an
experimental nature. The third month will be devoted to engineering research and
development activities in a company in Germany. The German company is expected
to pay for living costs associated with the work experience during the third
month. It is anticipated that these relatively short experiences will encourage
students to become involved in longer term commitments related to US/German
engineering collaborative exchanges, possibly work for an American Subsidiary in
German. The technical focus of all the undergraduate research projects will be:
Problems in Separations, Interfacial, and Transport Phenomena. Applicants will
be sought throughout the U.S. Applications must describe the cooperation and
support of an American faculty member and a German faculty member, as well as
the participating industry. The highest priority for travel awards are given to
Chemical and Mechanical Engineering undergraduate students with the strongest
combination of a detailed program plan, academic excellence, German language
skills, and past experience in industry or international relations.
