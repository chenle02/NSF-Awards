ABSTRACT

Proposal #: 0329837 Title: SENSORS: RiverNet - Distributed Sensor Nets for
Environmental Monitoring PI: Sanderson, Arthur RPI

The RiverNet project addresses the development of distributed sensor networks
for monitoring of environmental variables and will demonstrate this capability
through observations of the Hudson River and Estuary. The project approach is
based on the systematic development of a scalable sensor network architecture
and multisensor fusion algorithms that support the detection and interpretation
of environmentally important events and variables. Simulation tools will be
utilized in development, and experiments using fixed and mobile underwater
platforms will be employed. The impact of this research will be the exploration
and application of distributed sensor networks for environmental monitoring,
biological observation, and critical infrastructure management throughout the
world. The monitoring of distributed environmental systems also specifically
supports the challenge of cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. The
educational program will include extensive outreach and opportunities for direct
web-based access to river observations and models available for introductory,
advanced, and public educational programs.
