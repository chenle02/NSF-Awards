This research will investigate how the largest Hungarian firms have altered
their ownership structures during the rapid economic change between 1989 and
2000. Monthly data are available for approximately 1800 firms on changes in the
leading owners, top management, product lines, capital sources, and operating
locations. The ownership data define network ties among the firms. Network
analytic methods will be used to study changes in a firm's position in the
network structure and in the network structure itself. Sequence analysis will be
used to study how firms adjust the types of ownership structure (e.g., single
owner, partial bank ownership) in response to political and market
uncertainties.
