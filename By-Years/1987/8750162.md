Under this project, a Huber powder goniostat and countertube attachment, and a
Rigaku D/max IIIVB X-ray generator with vertical goniometer mount will be
purchased. This instrumentation will serve the broad purpose of teaching
geology, physics, and chemistry undergraduate students the fundamentals of
photon counting and signal processing, interfacing of instruments to computers,
and X-ray crystallographic techniques. It is our perception that undergraduate
programs in geology, physics, and chemistry in general suffer from inadequacy in
the teaching of instrument interfacing, computer simulation, and structure
determination. All of these aspects of experimentation are important to the
education of undergraduate geologists, physicists, and chemists so they can
pursue graduate studies or obtain meaningful employment. The requested equipment
will be used in mineralogy, petrology, soils, glacial geology, environmental
geology, physical chemistry, chemical instrumentation laboratories and in
selected independent studies and senior thesis research projects in geology,
physics, and chemistry.
