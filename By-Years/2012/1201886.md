The aim of the first part of the project is to redevelop Kirchberg WEP and QWEP
theory over a coefficient algebra. The staring point is a detailed analysis of
the scalar theory and a suitable adaption of the operator-valued version using
tensor norms. The second part of the project concerns improved martingale
inequalities for continuous time filtrations which has applications to semigroup
theory and is related to problems in compressed sensing.

One of the aims of this proposal is to combine cutting edge research in
mathematics with experimental research in Quantum Information Theory. Although
still in a developing phase Quantum Information Theory can become an important
tool in providing secure keys for communication. Some aspects of this proposal
are concerned with the theoretical background calculating the security rates and
quantum advantages. As long as testing quantum computers is difficult, the
theoretical approach has to take the lead in exploring possibilities and
constraints. This work is highly interdisciplinary (experimental physics and
computer science) and has the potential to make contribution to more secure
information through the use of quantum mechanical tools. In this information
based society this can become relevant.
