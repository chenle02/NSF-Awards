The initial location of tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean
indicates that the region just downstream of the mountain ridge in central
Mexico is a favored location for tropical cyclogenesis. A preliminary analysis
suggests that flow interaction with the mountains of Mexico and Central America
may be responsible for the generation of many of the initial disturbances which
ultimately lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific.
The co-principal investigators will study the role of lee cyclogenesis in
tropical cyclone development by employing a series of theoretical and numerical
models of increasing complexity. They also will attempt to corroborate the
results of their numerical simulations by analyzing data for cyclone events in
the region. They hope to be able to identify upstream atmospheric flow
configurations which are conducive to lee cyclogenesis which ultimately could
lead to improved tropical cyclone forecasts in this region.
