Knowledge of the absolute stress on faults is as essential to understanding
earthquakes as it has proven elusive to measure. The goal of this project is to
estimate absolute stress by measuring the response to a stress perturbation
caused by fault surface geometry. Geologic features surrounding faults record
this stress perturbation in outcrop and include intense cracking in the host
rock (damage zones), striations on fault surfaces, and melted rock. Recently,
significant progress in generalizing the interrelationships among total fault
displacement, surface roughness and damage. In this project surface geometry and
fault features are directly linked through detailed observations of along-strike
variations. These variations provide measures of how much the surface
irregularities perturbed the stress field around the fault. More specifically,
the researchers will: (1) measure tensile fracture patterns surrounding rough
and smooth faults or sections of faults and use this measurement to calculate
the near-field off-fault stress field; (2) measure the deflection of striations
away from bumps on fault surfaces and use this measurement to calculate the
background stress relative to the perturbing stress; and (3) measure the along-
strike variation in pseudotachylyte in relation to fault geometry and use this
measurement to calculate a bound on friction.

Understanding the stress on faults is critical for understanding earthquakes at
the level necessary to calculate risk from a physics-based model. This project
is designed to fill in this knowledge gap by focusing on the evidence recorded
in geological faults. This combined modeling and fieldwork strategy promises
results that can be transferable to other fields of earthquake physics.
