Minimal surfaces are shapes which are in an equilibrium position. They are
physical objects which serve to model black holes, soap films, or polymers in
material sciences. Minimal surfaces are studied from a purely mathematical point
of view and play a central role in geometry. The overall goal of this project is
to study how rigid or flexible they are in a given space. The analogous problem
for geodesics has had a tremendous impact not only in mathematics but also in
applied fields of science. Broader impacts of this project include work with
students and postdoctoral researchers.

These projects will deepen the relation between min-max methods and the
existence theory of metrics with maximal families of minimal surfaces.
Continuing efforts will study of the area-growth of minimal surfaces in
negatively curved spaces. More precisely, we plan to study to which extent the
volume spectrum of a Riemannian metric characterizes the metric and to relate
the area-growth of minimal surfaces with classical quantities such as versions
of entropy in dynamical systems.
