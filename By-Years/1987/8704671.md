Neutron scattering, transport and magnetization measurements will be used to
investigate the basic nature of spin ordering and to characterize the magnetic
transitions in amorphous rare earth transition metal alloys. New approaches
include fabrication and study of amorphous multilayers and a search for possible
fracton behavior. The studies provide valuable training of students in neutron
diffraction techniques and have potential application for magneto-optic
recording materials.
