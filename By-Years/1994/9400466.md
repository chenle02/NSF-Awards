9400466 Zelmanov This award supports research on several problems concerning
finite p-groups, pro-p groups, and infinite dimensional Lie algebras. All these
problems are related to algebras satisfying a polynomial identity, to Lie
algebras with Engel's condition and to coordinatization theorems. This research
is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise
from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group is the
rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie groups and
Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of spherical motion.
