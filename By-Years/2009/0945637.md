This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
three-phase dielectric nanocomposite films for embedded capacitor. The proposed
three-phase nanocomposite dielectric materials may demonstrate high dielectric
constant, low loss, low leakage current, and high breakdown voltage while
maintaining the adhesion, processability, and flexibility of polymers, which may
enable embedded capacitors for printed circuit board applications.

The broader societal/commercial impact of this project will be the potentials to
meet the projected trends in electronic device miniaturization and produce
better dielectric materials for the next generation capacitors. Currently, the
majority of the printed circuit board surface is occupied by passive components,
with most of these being capacitors. If the capacitors can be embedded in the
board itself, the size of the device can be reduced significantly with
additional benefits in performance, functionality, and cost. In addition, this
project may also provide a new dielectric material with high dielectric constant
and low leakage current to meet the requests of high energy density capacitors.
