Factors responsible for determining selectivity in the reactions of small
hydrocarbons over supported metal catalysis are investigated. A variety of
techniques are used to probe the interactions of hydrocarbons with the catalyst
surface, including microcalorimetry, temperature-programmed reaction
spectrometry, isotopic tracer studies, infrared and laser Raman spectroscopies,
Moessbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic resonance,
electron microscopy, and reaction kinetics. The activation of small hydrocarbons
is one of the main areas of active research in catalysis. It has application to
liquid fuels productions and many chemical processes. A knowledge of the factors
influencing selectivity is necessary to permit design of process control
strategies.
