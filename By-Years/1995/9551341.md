The university is developing an undergraduate cell biology course that promises
to be a relevant and exciting course to encourage students to continue their
studies and pursue careers in the biological sciences and to provide them with
the skills to do so. Through this project, the university is developing advanced
microscopy laboratories that utilize many of the best and most exciting
techniques in cell biology, research. Recent advances in microscopy have
provided researchers with new views of cell biology, and a wide variety of
fluorescent probes are now available to study cellular structure and function in
living or fixed cells. These techniques and instrumentation are brought into the
undergraduate teaching labs in a sophomore core course in cell biology.
Laboratory exercises using fluorescence microscopes equipped with contrast
enhancing optics and an imaging processing system are being developed; the
students use this equipment in experiments to examine the current models and
theories in cell biology. For unlimited viewing, the microscopes have a color
video projection system to allow students to project their cell preparations to
the rest of the class for examination and discussion. With the video projection
and recording system, interactive and collaborative learning is encouraged.
Individual and small group work, peer teaching, and experimental projects, all
of which are very effective teaching techniques, are all provided. Students
perform experiments of their own design and present their results orally and in
written reports.
