This workshop will be the ninth in a series of international conferences on
bacteriophage biology. In earlier years, the meetings focused on temperate
bacteriophages and were devoted to bacteriophage lambda. The 1993 workshop will
focus on transcription, replication, DNA rearrangements and macromolecular
structure. Genetic engineering continues to rely upon bacteriophage technology
for gene manipulation, DNA sequencing, structural analysis, gene expression and
screening. %%% This meeting deals with fundamental problems in molecular biology
involving bacteriophage and their bacterial hosts. Progress in understanding
these processes at the molecular level has contributed greatly to the
accelerating advances in recombinant DNA research. New techniques developed in
bacteriophage biology rapidly find their way into the mainstream of recombinant
DNA research and into industrial applications. Without an ongoing community
actively involved in basic research in phage biology, it is likely that many of
these innovations would not have come about.
