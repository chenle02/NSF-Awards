9451664 Miller The curriculum in the Anatomy and Physiology (A&amp;P) laboratory
will be improved by the introduction of computers into the laboratory. We have
had considerable success in revising our curriculum to encourage student-driven
inquiry, which will be enhanced by this equipment. The target audience for this
project consists of A&amp;P students, 90 percent of whom are women preparing for
careers in the health fields. Most of these students are academically under-
prepared, lack self-confidence, and are intimidated by science. Computer
applications will be extremely useful in helping students to overcome such
obstacles. The hardware and software to be purchased under this grant will
enable students to engage in hands-on experimentation, analyze data more
effectively, work collaboratively, and use a multi-media form of the human body
to deepen their understanding of human anatomy. This project will demonstrate
that the careful and systematic incorporation of new technologies into the
laboratory can have significant positive impact in raising the level of
scientific understanding and achievement on the part of often-disadvantaged
community college students.
