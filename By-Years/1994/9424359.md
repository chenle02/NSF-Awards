This award supports the continuing research of Jason Rush at the University of
Washington. In prior work, Rush introduced a family of metrics, the use of which
has led to improvement of the Minkowski-Hlawka lower bounds on lattice packing
density for various families of bodies in Euclidean n-space. In this project, he
will continue the study of properties of these metrics and their application to
problems of constructing dense lattice packings for additional types of
geometric bodies, to multiple packing and covering, and to the construction of
error-correcting codes. This research is in the field of the geometry of
numbers. The geometry of numbers is a blending of number theory - the study of
properties of the whole numbers - and the geometry of variously shaped bodies in
Euclidean n-space. An example of a fundamental problem in this field is the
determination of what configuration of spheres in Euclidean n-space will contain
the maximum possible volume. Such sphere packings are closely related to
efficient error-correcting codes, such as those used to store data on compact
discs, and also have applications to problems in information transmission which
occur for example in the construction of modems.
