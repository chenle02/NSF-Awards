9414812 Prospero The Objectives of AEROCE are centered around two themes: the
oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and the impact of aerosols on climate. In
order to attain these objectives or goals, it is necessary to carry out long-
term and shorter-term intensive measurements of numerous chemical and physical
properties of the atmosphere. This means that measurements must be made both in
a continuous daily (or even more frequent) fashion as well as periodically in an
intensive mode in important regions of the North Atlantic. Such a comprehensive
data base is essential to attaining these goals and to the creation and
validation of models that can describe atmospheric processes. The rationales for
the specific measurements that will be made with samples collected in the AEROCE
network are presented in the individual scientific proposals. The specific
objectives of the AEROCE Network Operations Group (NOG) are to : 1. Establish
and maintain atmospheric sampling stations at selected locations in the North
Atlantic region, 2. Operate these atmospheric sampling stations so as to provide
high quality atmospheric samples and assist in the operation of analytical
instrumentation in support of AEROCE research programs and secondarily, for
guest investigators, and 3. Collect and utilize meteorological data and
condensation particle concentration data on a continuous basis in collaboration
with and in support of other AEROCE investigators.
