The investigator and colleagues will organize the meeting of New Researchers in
Statistics and Probability. This involves the organizing of an application
process, selecting conference attendees from the applicant pool, arranging
senior speakers and panelists, coordinating talks and poster sessions, creating
and hosting the conference website, and a number of other administrative tasks
(e.g. advertising the conference through professional bulletins and statistical
journals, arranging the conference center, accommodation and food at the time of
the conference, etc.).

The primary purpose of the New Researchers' Conference (NRC) is to provide a
much needed venue for interaction among new researchers in Statistics and
Probability (i.e. recipients of doctoral degrees within the last five years) at
an important developmental stage in their careers. At present, researchers
develop contacts with others in their field either through their own
institutions or at meetings of professional societies. Junior researchers often
have limited contact with senior colleagues, even at their own institutions.
Meetings of professional societies are rather large and junior researchers often
find them overwhelming. In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be
restricted in size, with a target of 70-80 participants. Sessions will be
followed by discussions and breaks to facilitate interactions. The NRC provides
a unique opportunity for junior researchers to exchange ideas and initiate
contacts amongst themselves as well as provide them an enhanced opportunity to
interact with the invited senior researchers, through invited lectures and panel
discussions on funding opportunities, journal publications, teaching and
research. The relationships established in this informal collegiate setting
among junior researchers often are ones that may last for the rest of their
professional careers.
