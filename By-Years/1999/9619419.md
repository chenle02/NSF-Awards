This institute is operated under the auspices of the Department of Mathematical
Sciences and the Center for Nonlinear Analysis at Carnegie Mellon University.
The institute is a seven-week summer program for undergraduate students.
Minority and female students are targeted for recruitment into the institute.
The primary goal of the institute is to prepare students for and interest them
in pursuing graduate work in applied mathematics. Secondary goals are to
acquaint students with modern application areas of mathematics and to give them
some understanding of the work involved in studying in these areas at the
graduate level. The institute has operated successfully since 1992 under this
format.
