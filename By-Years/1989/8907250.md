A scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is being acquired. This will be use in
conjunction with existing equipment for low-energy electron diffraction, Auger
electron spectroscopy, reflection infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-
programmed reaction. It will be used to examine restructured surfaces to
identify active sites for catalytic reactions. Specific systems to be studied
include tungsten surfaces that have undergone restructuring due to oxygen or
sulfur adlayers, which have high activity for thiophene adsorption; adsorbate-
induced restructuring of adlayers, such as nickel(100) in the presence of carbon
monoxide; and the structures of surface polymers, such as those formed from
thiophene, aniline, or lutidine.
