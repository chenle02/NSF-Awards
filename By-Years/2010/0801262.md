ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Haiman, Mark Proposal Number: DMS - 0801262 Institution:
University of California-Berkeley Title: Combinatorics of Special Functions in
Geometry and Representation Theory

A major result of Professor Haiman's earlier work was the discovery, starting in
2004, of combinatorial formulas in the theory of Macdonald polynomials,
something that had been sought ever since Macdonald introduced his polynomials
in 1988 (this aspect of Haiman's research was carried out in collaboration with
Jim Haglund and Nick Loehr). The formulas connect Macdonald polynomials with
other special q-symmetric functions recently studied by combinatorialists,
namely the LLT polynomials of Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon, and the k-Schur
functions of Lapointe, Lascoux and Morse. From the point of view of Lie theory,
all these developments are connected with general linear groups and therefore
with the root systems of type A. The guiding themes of the proposed research
will be to unify these recent combinatorial discoveries, to connect them with
underlying algebraic, geometric and representation theoretic phenomena, and to
extend them to Lie groups and root systems of other types.

In a broader optic, combinatorics is the part of mathematics that deals with the
passage from the abstract to the concrete. Thus Lie theory in the abstract is
the theory of continuous symmetries. However, by one of the great theorems in
mathematics, concrete combinatorial data--the root systems--govern the structure
of the most important Lie groups. While the link between Lie groups and root
systems is classical, there are also other, more subtle, combinatorial
structures associated with Lie theory, which mathematicians are still striving
to understand. One way to seek such understanding is to begin by exploring the
combinatorial side, which by nature lends itself to explicit computation and the
search for patterns, and afterwards to try to explain the observed combinatorial
phenomena by reference to more abstract underlying concepts from group theory,
geometry and representation theory. This is the mode of understanding which
Haiman seeks to pursue in the proposed research.
