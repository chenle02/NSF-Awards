Problems in two areas of probability are considered. The first is concerned with
uniqueness for the solutions of stochastic differential equations arising from
the areas of stochastic partial differential equations, measure-valued branching
diffusions with branching and spatial interactions, equations that depend on the
past, and equations corresponding to degenerate elliptic operators. These are
typically infinite-dimensional systems of equations, often with coefficients
that degenerate at a boundary. The second area of research concerns Harnack
inequalities and heat kernel estimates. An attempt will be made to characterize
the Harnack inequality in both continuous models and ones with jumps. In
addition regularity of solutions to equations associated with non-local
operators in bounded regions will be investigated.

In recent years researchers in mathematical physics, economics, and mathematical
finance have realized that to adequately model real-world phenomena, the
possibility of jumps must be allowed. For example, an unexpected discovery or
unexpected regional conflict might cause a sudden jump up or down in stock
prices. However, some of the very basic questions about models that incorporate
jumps are as yet unanswered. One of the areas to be investigated is the
regularity of such models. A typical question is: if the initial data is
perturbed slightly, is it true that the behavior of the model at future times
will also be only slightly perturbed? There are similar unanswered questions for
certain models that originate in mathematical biology. In these cases the
difficulty is not the presence of jumps, but the presence of huge numbers of
individuals and the possible interactions between individuals.
