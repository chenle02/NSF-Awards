9553038 Doumanidis This Presidential Faculty Fellow award is for Dr.
Doumanidis's excellence in education and research innovations in rapid
prototyping technology. His plan for research innovation and discovery focuses
on new thermal rapid prototyping processes. Doumanidis will use optical and
thermal feedback for distributed parameter control of scanned heat and mass
transfer processes to build geometry and regulate the material structure of
parts produced by rapid prototyping. Complementing this innovative research plan
is a balanced educational plan to motivate first year university students and
orient in-service teachers towards technology, with prototyping, home robotics,
and a manufacturing automation seminar the means to reach these objectives. The
coherent plan of research and education in the PFF nomination continues an a
very productive record of accomplishment and leadership as a scholar and
educator. The high probability of new discovery in the fertile research area of
rapid prototyping, plus Dr. Doumanidis's education plan to aid the teachers of
future generations of students of technology, will have an impact on developing
human resources and increasing competitiveness in today's technological society.
