This is a grant for student (undergrad, grad) and postdoc support for travel and
attendance at the Sackler Colloquium May 2-3 2019 at the Beckman Center in
Irvine CA. The title is: "The Brain Produces Mind by Modeling". Speakers include
a large variety of world leaders in computational and behavioral modeling of the
brain-mind connection. The colloquium will bring together various threads and
approaches in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychological science by
focusing on computational modeling that attempts to bridge the gaps between
these fields. It aims to present a coherent view of the brain as a model
builder, using the model to maximize survival and utility in a complex
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
