A two-day symposium on the status of research concerning the invariance of
physical systems with respect to T (time) and CP (charge-parity) reversal will
be held at the University of Michigan on October 25 and 26, 1991. The meeting
will bring together theorists and experimentalists from atomic physics, high
energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics, to discuss current progress
and future prospects for observing T-violation. The conference proceedings will
be published and are expected to constitute a definitive statement on the status
of this field.
