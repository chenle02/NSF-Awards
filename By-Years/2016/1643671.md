The Department of Technology and Society in the Stony Brook University (SBU)
College of Engineering and Applied Sciences will establish an S-STEM project,
titled "Academic and Social STEM Excellence for Transfer Students". The project
will provide scholarship support for students who have completed an Associate's
degree and who enroll in a STEM major at SBU. The project will incorporate a two
week mathematics immersion program and will also make available a network of
advising, career, and academic support structures. Data will be collected to
identify specific academic transition issues and the use of base-line data will
allow us to determine the effectiveness of the interventions that have been
designed for this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates
scholarship support, subject-specific academic support, engagement in research
and career preparation (through faculty mentoring and internships), as well as
program assessment and assessment of the impact of the program on students'
academic performance, persistence in S-STEM disciplines, and attitudes. The
results of the project will add to the literature of helping community college
student achieve successful transitions to four year institutions. The proposed
S-STEM project will be a model for addressing the Nation's needs for producing
more STEM educated students and further enhance the economic competitiveness of
the United States and the Metropolitan New York Regions. The model illustrates
an effective way of engaging students in STEM disciplines and careers and could
be adapted to other institutional contexts so as to expand access to and
excellence in STEM disciplines.
