Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to supplement
funding from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for supporting the travel of
doctoral students at US universities to a two-day conference entitled ?Nano-Bio:
the Next Transformative Convergence?. The conference will bring together eminent
researchers from all over the world to (i) discuss the convergence of
nanotechnology and biotechnology (Nano-Bio), (ii) review what has been achieved
in these fields, (iii) charter future research directions in these technologies
with special emphasis on cellular engineering, and (iv) establish collaborations
among researchers all over the world. This gathering of students, eminent
researchers, and teachers will provide an intellectually stimulating atmosphere
to young talented persons hungry for acquiring knowledge and senior researchers
willing to sow seeds for future research in these areas. Deliverables from this
workshop will include a report summarizing discussions held during the two
days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-Bio not only covers many of the formerly
specialized sciences and engineering ? e.g., physics, chemistry, biology,
neuroscience ? but it also portends incredibly promising new innovations through
the fusion of these earlier disparate fields. Examples of what Nano-Bio can
accomplish include bio-synthetic materials and machines; targeted drug delivery
of novel, engineering-designed molecules to efficiently treat cancerous tumors;
and smart sensors that can constantly monitor human body?s status. Forums to
bring international researchers from different disciplines together offer
tremendous value to help forge new collaborations and promote understanding
among disparate fields. The conference?s potential broader impact is to bridge
these gaps toward enhancing scientific and technical exchanges at national and
international levels.&lt;br/&gt;
