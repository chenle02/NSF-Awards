*** Lehmann 9711674 This project will increase understanding of post-Soviet
Russian society among U.S. social scientists who are not Russian area
specialists by making available on the World Wide Web several sets of survey
data. The recent, powerful transformations in Eastern Europe offer social
science an unprecedented opportunity for comparative and dynamic studies. Yet
such opportunities have been limited to those with the language skills and
contacts to gather primary data in those societies. By putting several valuable
data sets online, the PI will make such specialized data accessible to a wider
range of social scientists. Among the data sets to be placed on line are
election studies in 1993, 1995, and 1996 (2 rounds), plus surveys of the values
of young adults and of high school students. ***
