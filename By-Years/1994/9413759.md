ABSTRACT It is our intention to establish a cytophotometry facility in the St.
Olaf Biology Department for both research and training purposes. Such a facility
requires a microscope equipped with a light source and filters that allow for
absorbency measurements at two wavelengths, a microscope image processor, and a
photometer. A cytophotometer will allow us perform accurate, quantitative
measurements of nuclear DNA content. This capability will greatly expand upon
our research efforts to analyze nuclear and chromosomal behavior during both
normal and aberrant conjugation in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahvmena
thermophila. Specifically, we will be better able to characterize the nuclear
behavior of conjugation mutants that affect both meiotic and mitotic divisions,
as well as the differentiation of newly formed polyploid macronuclei.
