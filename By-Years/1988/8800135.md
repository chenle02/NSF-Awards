In this project the principal investigators will analyze data obtained on two
hydrographic cruises in the northern Indian Ocean during December, 1986 -
January, 1987, and July - August, 1988. The hydrographic data cover the height
of both the northeast and southwest monsoons, and contain nearly 120 CTD
profiles on each cruise (including tracer samples) and shipboard acoustic
doppler current profiles. Forty ARGOS surface current drifters launched on the
first cruise in the Arabian Sea and in late fall, 1985 in the Bay of Bengal will
also be included. Principal goals are to analyze the surface velocity field
along the cruise tracks, and water mass modification during the monsoons using
temperature-salinity and other tracer techniques.
