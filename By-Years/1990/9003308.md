This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of spectroscopy of liquid solid interfaces. Professor Marc Porter
of Iowa State University will use monomolecular films at solid surfaces to
develop structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships relevent to
surface chemical reactions. The use of electrochemically active functional
groups specifically synthesized at the liquid-solid interface will allow the
study of surface pH gradients. Optical spectroscopic methods will be used to
probe the self assembled thiophenyl linkages at platinum and gold electrode
surfaces. Surface infrared, spectroelectrochemistry and surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy will be used to study the reactivity and transformation of
functional groups at the monolayer interface. Probe molecules will be used to
determine Hammett linear free energy relationships. Spatially oriented arrays of
pendant reactive functional groups (carboxylic acids, amines, esters and
quinones) will be constructed and the effects of packing density, orientation
and composition on reactivity will be explored. Electrochemical parameters will
also be explored as a means to control reactivity and structure.
