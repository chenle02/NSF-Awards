This project is providing support for travel and registration for U.S.
participants in a key global venue for research and training in the learning
sciences via the Doctoral Consortium and Early Career Workshops at the
International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) 2012 conference in
Sydney, Australia. Earlier versions of these workshops have had an important
impact on the careers and research of pre- and post-PhD scholars in the learning
sciences from diverse domains such as computer science, information science,
education, psychology, and cognitive science. The intellectual merit of this
project rests in its selection of top-quality pre- and post-doctoral candidates
whose research in the learning sciences holds promise to advance the overall
theme of the conference, "The Future of Learning." In particular participants
are reflecting on principled understandings of learning to date and considering
new and/or iterated theoretical and empirical directions for the field. In
addition, attendees are seeking to make advances in the scientific understanding
of learning that can inform policy and formal and informal educational
experiences of students. This goal is particularly vital given the ongoing and
dramatic transformations of society affected by a variety of digital media and
communications technologies, fast paced societal changes, and the scale of
significant global challenges. Participation in these workshops is an important
capacity-building effort that leverages the expertise of the entire
international Learning Sciences community and the outcomes of previous
workshops. The broader impacts of this project include multiplying opportunities
to develop international collaborations in the field Learning Sciences, and
supporting the career development of some of the best and brightest researchers
in multiple disciplines who work in this area.
