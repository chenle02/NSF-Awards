*** 9761124 Mozhi This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop an environmentally compliant pulsed plasma spray technique for solid
polymer coatings. The pulsed approach opens the opportunity to 1) deposit
functionally gradient polymer coatings, 2) alternatively preheat the substrate
and deposit coatings, 3) provide finer control and uniform temperature
distribution for all powders, and 4) provide finer control of the substrate
temperature. The overall research objective is to experimentally demonstrate
this technique. During Phase 1, the firm will: 1) Utilize a 1-D code to
determine optimum parameters for fabrication of a sprayer; 2) Experimentally
demonstrate deposition of polyurethane on Al and analyze the coating; 3) Design
an engineering prototype plasma polymer sprayer; 4) Identify specific coating
applications that make best use of the high performance capability of proposed
plasma sprayer. The anticipated Phase I result is successful deposition of solid
polymer coatings with superior properties. Polymer coatings will find
applications in the commercial aircraft industry, the auto industry for
corrosion protection of cars and trucks, and in general to the commercial
coating industry. Applications for polymer coatings abound in many industries
for corrosion protection, electrical insulation, and wear resistance, ***
