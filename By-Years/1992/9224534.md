This grant is for the partial support of an international (IUTAM) symposium on
computational mechanics of materials to be held during June 15-18, 1993 at Brown
University, Providence Rhode Island, U.S.A. The symposium will allow the
presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the area of computational
mechanics of materials to the most outstanding and active workers in that
emerging field from academe, government laboratories and industry. This field
differs in scope from other branches of computational mechanics by placing a
heavy emphasis on micromechanics and material characterization and design. It
also utilizes methodologies not employed in other segments of computational
mechanics.
