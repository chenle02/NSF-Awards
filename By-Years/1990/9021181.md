This award provides support for a post-doctoral fellow to be involved in the
construction and initial operations of a two element infrared/optical
interferometer. This instrument is being constructed by a consortium consisting
of the University of Wyoming, University of Massachusetts, Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, Harvard, MIT Lincoln Laboratories, and Kitt Peak
National Observatory. The instrument will be an important test bed for new
technologies connected with interferometry and will be used in a variety of
scientific programs ranging from stellar angular diameters to investigations of
the sizes of the nuclei of galaxies.
