The PI, Susan McCarthy, a published author, and her co-PI Terri Nelson, an
artist?both of whom are critically acclaimed in their fields--propose to observe
the behavior and habitat of a little-known Antarctic bird, the Snowy Sheathbill,
to produce a children?s book on this species, its role in the Antarctic
ecosystem and the larger issue of the value that is assigned by human beings to
?charismatic? as opposed to ?non-charismatic? animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
