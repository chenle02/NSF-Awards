Over the past few years, the investigator and his colleagues have developed
numerical techniques with esoteric and even speculative features. The common
theme in these techniques is the use of mathematical machinery and algorithms
from one area in a seemingly different arena. In particular, the investigators
have used methods from statistical physics and geometry to attack seemingly
unrelated problems in computational physics. The problems under investigation in
this proposal are both technologically interesting and among the most difficult
in computing. The work encompasses: (1) applications of statistical mechanics to
fluid mechanics and turbulence theory; (2) the analysis of stochastic systems
with filamentary subsystems, in particular polymers and quantum vortices; (3)
the exploitation of variable temperature and annealing techniques to untangle
and recognize knots and possibly fold proteins; (4) the analysis of kinking in
moving filaments and singularities in moving surfaces by interface algorithms
based on hyperbolic conservation law theory and differential geometry; and (5)
coupling these moving interface algorithms with mean curvature flow analysis to
design algorithms for grid generation. Through this work, a considerable body of
state-of-the-art, powerful mathematical and numerical techniques will be
transformed into practical tools of importance in manufacturing, energy
processes, and material science. Sophisticated advancing interface algorithms
will be used to compute detailed processes in the manufacture of microelectronic
components in computer chips. Research on statistical mechanics and fluid
turbulence will be used as part of computer simulations of fluid mixing in
combustion processes. Finally, surface advancement techniques for grid
generation are aimed at automating a key component of computational fluid
mechanics simulations present in modeling and designing flows past aircraft, in
engines, and in hydrodynamic devices.
