This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).

The Queens Experiences in Discrete Mathematics (QED) REU site, hosted at York
College at the City University of New York in Jamaica, Queens, provides a
student-centered and collaborative environment for nine undergraduates to
conduct research in discrete mathematics over the course of the academic year.
Recruitment efforts for this REU site target public and private universities in
Queens and the greater New York City area, and emphasize outreach to
underrepresented groups, including women, students of color, and students with
disabilities. The program aims to increase retention and graduation rates and to
diversify the population of graduate school applicants and researchers in the
mathematical sciences.

Participants in the QED REU will conduct research in the area of discrete
mathematics, more specifically, on topics such as partition theory, algebraic
combinatorics, semiring theory, automata theory, and formal language theory. The
main goals are for participants to produce results of interest and relevance in
their chosen subfield and to learn how to communicate the results of their
research both orally and in writing. The REU site will also provide students
with an introduction to mathematical programming as well as support and guidance
regarding applications to graduate school.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
