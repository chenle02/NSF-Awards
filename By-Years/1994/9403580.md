The primary objectives concern the development and analysis of algorithms for
linear programming within a complexity theory motivated by functional analysis
rather than the traditional motivated by algebra and combinatorics. Special
attention is given to issues concerning computer round-off error and inexact
data, issues such as how one might use the prior knowledge one has regarding the
structure of the problem to be solved in order to efficiently solve the problem
using less computational precision than would be needed otherwise. The use of
iterative methods for solving the equations that arise when applying methods is
investigated, as is the possibility that the algorithms are (nearly) optimal;
optimality is investigated via approximation theory. Perturbation theory for
linear programming is being developed. Certain notions which have proven useful
in the context of linear programming are being investigated in a more general
context multi-variate polynomials. It is intended that all of the investigations
will be carried out with as much generality as is possible; for example, the
cones defining non-negativity will not be required to be polyhedral.
