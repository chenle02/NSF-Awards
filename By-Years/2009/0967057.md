The STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP) was initiated in FY2002 with the goal
of increasing the number of students graduating with undergraduate degrees in
STEM areas. The purpose of this project is to enhance the impact of STEP through
activities in three primary areas: 1) conducting site visits to projects that
may be in need of additional feedback or support, 2) developing an informational
document suitable for distribution to external audiences regarding achievements
in STEP, and 3) conducting three regional workshops per year aimed at faculty
who might be interested in submitting a proposal to the program. Intellectual
Merit The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in development of a
community of scholars engaged in STEP projects. Through the professional
development workshops being conducted by this project, faculty and
administrators across the country are learning about best practices in student
recruitment and retention and will be able to apply these best practices on
their home campuses. PIs who have participated in a site visit are able to make
adjustments and improvements to their project to enhance the impact of their
work. Broader Impacts STEP is essentially a program focused on broader impacts.
Active STEP projects are focused on broadening the participation of
undergraduate students in STEM fields, so improvements to individual projects
have an overall positive impact in this area. The informational document being
developed through this project serves to disseminate achievements from active
STEP projects, to facilitate greater understanding of best practices in
recruitment and retention of STEM students among STEM faculty, and to educate
the broader scientific community about the challenges and successes in
recruiting and retaining undergraduate students in STEM disciplines.
