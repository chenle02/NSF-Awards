The proposed workshop will provide a forum that promotes the interaction of
researchers in the areas of wavelets and splines. While the study of spline
functions is a well established subject of investigation, which has become an
interdisciplinary research area during the past three or four decades, the
subject of wavelets was born only about twenty years ago. However, the only
known compactly supported functions with analytical formulation that generate a
multiresolution approximation are the cardinal B-splines. Furthermore, the
B-spline refinement symbols play the central role in the construction of
Daubechies' wavelets, by assuring the convergence of certain infinite products
that constitute the Fourier transform of the Daubechies scaling functions and
the order of smoothness of these functions, as building blocks of the MRA's.
This close relationship between splines and wavelets is the root of the need for
the interaction between these two interdisciplinary areas of mathematical
research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference on the interaction between
wavelets and splines will bring together the leading experts of these two fields
to exchange ideas, assess the state-of-the-art, and define the trends of future
research problems that benefit both interdisciplinary areas. What is more
important is that such a conference will be greatly beneficial to the young
reserchers and the under-previleged groups, who would have very limited
opportunities, if any at all, to interact with the leading experts of both
subjects under the same roof. This proposed concerence will take place in the
University of Georgia from 16-19, 2005.
