After an eight year emphasis on the development of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) to
support the advancement of research, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is
among the national leaders with large network pathways and Science DMZ
resources. The need for leadership and technical support to extend these CI
resources to the greater community is the next challenge. Consequently, UNH is
building a CI Engineer as a permanent human resource to assist in the shift of
responsibility from research individuals to the CI community services that
extend the CI benefits campus-wide. The CI Engineer is a focused key technical
leader to champion the UNH CI Plan and encourage the integration of CI resources
with UNH researchers, academics and administrators. With a growing need to
expand CI resources for collaboration on multi-party projects, the CI Engineer
is defining the vision, model, and approach through the UNH CI Plan. Researchers
see the CI Engineer as a technical resource that can be annexed to their own
research team rather than have to duplicate the CI resources and personnel that
exist institutionally. Beyond the technical expertise, the CI Engineer
participates in statewide, regional and national CI organizations, including the
New England Research and Education Network (NEREN), the Northern Crossroads
(NoX) and Internet2. The CI Engineer maintains the pulse of the CI activity on
the UNH campus, reporting to the community on the efforts achieved annually and
reflecting back to the community the opportunities for future investment that
will benefit all.
