The project will develop culturally-relevant laboratory experiments for the
middle school level which are tailored to the needs and interests of Pacific
Northwest Tribes. Selected middle school teachers of Native Americans would be
trained in the implementation of these materials in the classroom bringing 20
teachers to the University of Washington campus for each of two summers. A
follow-up program of in-service workshops will also be held during the academic
year. In addition the teachers will be in contact with each other and with the
University of Washington faculty via an electronic network. The laboratory
materials will focus upon areas of tribal concerns such as fisheries/forestry,
soil analysis, museum conservation, and rediscovery of artistic techniques. The
project will utilize the tribal leaders and others who are experts in the
traditions of the Native American tribes to make sure that the materials
developed will be appropriate for their culture.
