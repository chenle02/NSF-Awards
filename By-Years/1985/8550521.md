This project will deliver in-service training to 30 middle school teachers in or
near Erie, Pennsylvania. The participants will be introduced to modern
ecological techniques and will also be instructed in the applications of
microcomputers. The program will consist of four phases. Phase I will be a two-
week, full-time workshop during the summer. Phase II will consist of nine
Saturday workshops during the first semester, and Phase III will consist of
seven Saturday workshops during the second semester. During these workshops, the
participants will develop Environmental Computer Units to be incorporated into
their courses. Phase IV will be a four-week workshop for individual project
presentations. There will be extensive field trip activity during the first
three phases of the project. Both Lake Erie and Presque Isle State Park are
accessible for field studies and will be employed as study sites.
