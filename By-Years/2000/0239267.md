Abstract: For reasons not entirely understood, combustion chambers that favor
high efficiencies and low emissions often exhibit combustion instabilities.
These instabilities arise due to a regenerative coupling between chamber
acoustics and thermal fluctuations. Some instabilities appear as limit cycle
oscillations in the flow variables of basic propulsion and power generation
systems. Examples include rocket motors, ramjet engines, gas turbines,
afterburners, and large industrial combustors. The research phase of this
project aims at developing a comprehensive stability algorithm that can be used
as a diagnostic tool in the developmental stages of large combustors. The newly
developed algorithm will be based on the latest technological advances that
suggest incorporating the effects of acoustical, thermal and vortical waves from
the ground up.

The new representation of chamber acoustics will permit estimating the growth or
decay of the system energy with most rotational flow effects accounted for. In
the process, a generalized mean-flow description that mimics realistic chamber
conditions will be employed. This representation is expected to enhance the
accuracy of both linear and nonlinear stability equations used in the
literature. The anticipated improvements in acoustic energy gains are also hoped
to explain experimental findings that elude the present stability assessment
methodology. As a windfall, it is projected that the origins of several
injection-driven instabilities observed in solid, liquid and hybrid rocket
motors will be illuminated.

The educational phase of this career development plan describes a sequence of
activities to be undertaken during the funding period. These include incentives
for undergraduate curriculum development, initiatives for promoting research
opportunities for both graduates and undergraduates, initiatives for encouraging
interdisciplinary interactions, course enhancement methodologies, and
recruitment of underrepresented groups.
