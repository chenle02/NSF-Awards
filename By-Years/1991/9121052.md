Computer simulation is used to gain a fundamental understanding of the physics
of plasmas, to explore phenomena which are difficult or impossible to
investigate in other ways and to study other potentially useful plasma behavior.
Numerical techniques are developed to aid the study of these plasma processes
and the results of the simulations applied to understanding real experimental
configurations.
