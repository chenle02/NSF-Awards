This project addresses the need to extend reform from first- year calculus
through the second year and into upper-division mathematics. It uses computers
in the classroom to assist students' visualization, develop their insight, and
enhance their confidence in Multivariable Calculus, Real and Complex Analysis,
and Differential Equations. Experiences are shared through publications and
presentations at meetings. Materials developed are disseminated through an
anonymous ftp site.
