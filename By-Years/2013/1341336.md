The objective of this Workshop proposal, supported by the Energy, Power and
Adaptive Systems program in ECCS is to increase the participation of faculty
across the nation in three workshops planned to disseminate educational material
and approaches developed at the University of Minnesota through two ONR Grants
"Center for Reforming Undergraduate Education in Electric Energy Systems" and 2)
"Center for Developing and Disseminating a Graduate/Undergraduate Curriculum in
Electric Energy Systems to Universities and Practicing Engineers." This effort
was aided by a previous NSF grant "ONR/NSF-Sponsored Workshops on Reforming
Graduate/Undergraduate Curriculum in Electric Energy Systems". Through these
grants, eight faculty workshops were held and three more are planned to promote
curriculum reform in undergraduate education in Electric Energy Systems.
