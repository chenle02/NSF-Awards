Access to STEM careers relies heavily on student success in their foundational
mathematics courses. Little is understood about the mathematical problem solving
capacity students must develop in order to leverage mathematical knowledge from
prior courses in learning mathematics central to their field of study. The
Mathematical Problem Solving Item (MPSI) Development Project will create a pool
of validated problems and associated assessment items that indicate a student's
mathematical problem solving (MPS) in five key areas identified in the research
literature: (a) sense-making/ orienting, (b) representing/ connecting, (c)
challenge/ difficulty, (d) reviewing, and (e) defending/ justifying. To this
end, the project will: (1) develop and refine items that indicate levels of MPS
in the five areas stated above with students in college algebra and calculus. To
this end, the project will pilot and refine items with approximately 1600
college algebra students and 1400 calculus student; (2) validate items by
convening a panel of experts in MPS; and (3) use a pre- and post-assessment
design to examine the extent to which the MPSI items capture the elements of
MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to labor- and time-intensive measures of
students' MPS capacity that involve task-based interviews and review of student
work using detailed scoring rubrics, the MPSI item design will provide items
that use a Likert-type scale and can be machine scored. The project will
investigate the extent to which the items capture the impact of curricula in
college algebra and calculus on MPS as well as the extent to which success in
these mathematics courses can be inferred from student MPS profiles derived from
performance on MPSI project items. The MPSI project will provide an important
and efficient tool that separates skills, procedural knowledge, and conceptual
knowledge gained in a course from the MPS levels needed to leverage this
mathematical knowledge in future courses and to persist in STEM fields.
