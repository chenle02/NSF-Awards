NSF's chemistry (CHE), biological sciences (DBI), atmospheric chemistry program
(GEO/ATM) and EdEn venture fund jointly co-fund the New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site for the
summers of 2005-2007. The program director is Michael Pullin who is assisted by
Barbara Austin. The site will bring 10 undergraduate students to New Mexico Tech
for an eight-week summer research experience that focuses on cross-disciplinary
studies of environmentally related topics. The REU program will include five
collaborative research projects, with each conducted by an interdisciplinary
team of New Mexico Tech faculty, graduate students, and REU undergraduates (2
per project). The REU site will bring together faculty and students from
chemistry, biology, earth sciences, and physics. New Mexico Tech's REU program
will specifically target students from Hispanic and Native American ethnic
backgrounds. Recruiting efforts will mainly focus on regional institutions in
the southwest that do not have Ph.D.-level research programs.
