This project studies how, and to what extent, property relations in contemporary
rural China have been and are being restructured through the examination of land
litigation, an arena in which the ownership of agricultural property has been
redefined, negotiated, and contested among interest groups including the
socialist state, the village collective, and individual households. This
research combines an analysis of power mechanism with consideration of the
cultural dimensions of property and law in China. Fieldwork will be conducted in
Huangnihe, a rural township in southwestern China. The social histories of local
land cases will be traced through participant observation and discourse
analysis. This project will be conducted at a time in China when rural
households and collectives are enjoying the widest latitude in land management
since the 1950s. By exploring land ownership from the specific perspective of
legal disputes, this project will add new dimensions to the current research on
China's rapidly changing property relations in the post-Mao era. Moreover, this
project will be the first anthropological study of local legal functioning the
mainland China and it will be conducted at a time when nationwide concern with
legal reform in most pronounced. Unlike most of the recent work on China's law,
which overwhelmingly focuses on the urban area, this research will focus on the
rural area where almost 80% of China's population lives.
