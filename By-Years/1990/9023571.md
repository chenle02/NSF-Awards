This proposal is for career advancement under the Research Opportunities for
Women program of the National Science Foundation. The principal investigator
intends to enhance her career in research by collaborating with investigators at
the University of California, Berkeley in the study of the interfaces in
aggregate/cement and steel/cement systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on
the relationship between interface morphology and the corrosion initiation of
steel in concrete. Specimens of concrete with embedded steel rebars will be
subjected to controlled environment, such as sodium salt solution, for various
periods of time. During the test the open-circuit potential, which has been
shown to be a good indicator of corrosion initiation, will be monitored.
Periodically, the tests will be interrupted and the hydration phases and pore
distribution at the interface will be analyzed using back-scattering electron
imaging coupled with an image analyzer. The effects of admixtures will be
studied by preparing concrete specimens with 10 weight percent replacement of
cement by silica fume. The research is intended to contribute to the knowledge
and understanding of concrete microstructural properties and their impact on the
corrosion process of steel in concrete.
