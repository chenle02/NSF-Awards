The fifth annual Northeast Probability Seminar will be held at the City
University of New York on November 15-16, 2007. This conference series attracts
approximately 80 researchers and graduate students each year, and provides a
valuable forum for young researchers to interact with specialists. The emphases
for the 2007 seminar will be: Brownian motion, local times, Markov chains and
processes, random structures and algorithms, particle systems, and stochastic
analysis. The conference organizers have a strong commitment to providing
financial support for young researchers and members of underrepresented groups
who do not have other sources of support for attending this seminar.
