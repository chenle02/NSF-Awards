The principal investigators will study the effects of cation order/disorder
relationships on phase equilibria in iron-magnesium amphiboles using single-
crystal and Mossbauer techniques. The ultimate aim of the work is to make
amphiboles, and the reactions in which they take part, valuable geothermometers
and geobarometers.
