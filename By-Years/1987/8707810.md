In this project the PI will study polysilicon, deposited with a plasma-enhanced-
chemical-vapor-deposition (PECVD) system, as a contact to the emitter and as the
emitter of bipolar transistors. The research proposed in this project will
concentrate efforts on alternative methods of polysilicon deposition. An
existing PECVD reactor will be modified to allow for full control of all the
deposition parameters. This will be followed by a study of the morphological
properties, the conductivity, resistivity and doping characteristics of PECVD
deposited polysilicon layers, leading into the investigation of the use of these
layers in actual devices.
