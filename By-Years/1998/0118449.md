Melville&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0118449&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind gustiness produces
small waves that modulate the surface shear implying a transition from laminar
to turbulent flow in the near surface layer and causing disruption of the
surface skin layer. The PIs propose to confirm the presence of small scale
Langmuir circulations under typical wind conditions, to determine the space and
time scales associated with the surface turbulence, to examine the impact on the
associated surface renewal, and to compare the experimental results with
numerical and theoretical model predictions. Deployment of their laser-based PIV
system in a lake will occur in year one (and possibly a FLIP deployment). A FLIP
deployment will occur in year two with emphasis on understanding the heat flux
budget in the ocean surface layers. Year three will include analysis, study of
ancillary processes such as the role of surfactants, modeling, a second FLIP
experiment with a focus on the relationships of renewal and turbulence-laminar
flow transition to gustiness and its associated scales. Year four will be
devoted to analysis and writing.&lt;br/&gt;
