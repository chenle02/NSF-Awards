9406063 Beavan This award provides one-half the funding necessary to acquire new
generation receivers for use with the Global Positioning System (GPS). The
receivers will be acquired by Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory and will be used primarily by its geophysicists in geodetic field
campaigns. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for this equipment acquisition. Research applications for the new
generation GPS receivers will include measurement of strain fields across major
fault systems, sea level monitoring and seismogenic strain measurements along
the Alaska Peninsula, and precise positioning associated with airborne
geophysical observations (gravity and magnetic field) in Antarctica. ***
