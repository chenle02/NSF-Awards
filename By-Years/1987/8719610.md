The adult mammalian cochlea contains at least two morphological types of spiral
ganglion neurons. Type-I spiral ganglion cells contact inner hair cells via
thick radial fibers while type-II spiral ganglion cells contact outer hair cells
via thinner outer spiral fibers. However, in newborn cochlea spiral ganglion
cells appear as a homogeneous population, and some spiral ganglion cells appear
to contact both inner and outer hair cells. This research on guinea pigs and
hamsters will focus on the spiral ganglion cell innervation of outer hair cells
at a single- cell level. The overall objective of this research is to gain
additional insights into the role of type-II neurons in hearing by extensively
studying their anatomical development. Such a systematic study will help to
further resolve how adult innervation patterns arise.
