Abstract

Proposal Title: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study of Transport of
Molecular Mixtures in Zeolite Membranes Proposal Number: CTS-0413027 Principal
Investigator: David Sholl Institution: Carnegie Mellon University

This research will focus on using atomically-detailed simulations of diffusion
in zeolites in close connection with experimental studies to advance the
understanding of macroscopic diffusion in nanoporous materials. Three closely
linked topics will be examined: single-component diffusion of n-alkanes in
silicalite, mixture diffusion of n-alkanes in silicalite, and effects of pore
size and shape on mixture diffusion. Extensive atomistic simulations will be
combined with membrane permeation experiments and neutron scattering experiments
to self-consistently describe self and transport diffusion of n-alkanes in
silicalite. Atomistic simulations will be combined with membrane permeation and
neutron scattering experiments to assess the diffusion of multiple binary
mixtures in silicalite. An extensive set of atomistic simulations will be
performed to examine binary diffusion in a set of silica zeolites chosen to
systematically vary pore size and connectivities. Similar simulations will be
performed for carbon nanotubes, which are known to have very smooth pore walls,
to probe the influence of pore wall corrugation. These simulations will greatly
expand the variety of binary adsorbed mixtures for which data are available and
provide stringent tests for the predictive models of mixture diffusion. In terms
of the broader impacts, the proposed research will engage graduate students in
an environment where they will develop strong communication skills and where
close collaboration between theoretical and experimental participants is
required. This work may lead to industrial applications in zeolite-based
membrane separations.
