9315628 Tauxe The PI will investigate several promising approaches to
normalization of magnetic paleointensity records in sediments. She will test the
methods using two time slices (0 and 10 ka) in recent box cores taken over a
large area of the Ontong-Java Plateau; two box cores will be selected for
continuous sampling in order to compare the two time series with the full range
of normalization parameters available. She will then construct two parallel time
series of relative paleointensity data from the Ontong-Java Plateau spanning the
last three to four million years. Finally she will analyze a set of samples
collected from the Oligocene Contessa Quarry section in Umbria, Italy, in order
to construct a second record spanning Chron C12R to compare with one recently
obtained from DSDP Leg 73's Site 522 from the South Atlantic. ****
