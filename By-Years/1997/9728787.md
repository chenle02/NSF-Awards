9728787 Yamazak There is considerable indirect evidence that the Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of genes a highly variable string of about 50
genes intimately involved in immune recognition also acts to provision
individuals with a unique odor (an odortype) analogous to a fingerprint. The
objectives of this project are threefold: I) to obtain direct evidence for this
investigating odortypes of inbred mice that have targeted gene disruptions (
knockouts ) of one or both of two classes of MHC genes; ii) to investigate the
functional role of odortypes in the context of mother- infant interactions;ii)
to determine whether the odortypes of the fetus, which is expressed in the
secretions and excretions of the pregnant animal, alters the way other animals
interact with her. Broadly, the goals of this work are to increase our
understanding of how and to what end MHC genes, best known for functioning in
immune self-nonself recognition (the genes that must closely match successful
organ or tissue transplants), code for individuality of odor. This understanding
will through light on how diversity of this gene complex is maintained in
nature, how individuals, be they mice or people, recognize each other as
individuals and even, on a more practical level, on how dogs are able to track
individuals humans. Thus, this project ranges from molecular biology to
population biology to forensics.
