Non-Technical Description: This grant from DMR-CMP provides partial support to
the 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on
the Chemistry and Physics of Graphitic Carbon Materials. The conference will
have a strong presence of theoretical and experimental condense matter
physicists, with leading physicists playing various roles. More importantly, the
GRC, with an informal workshop environment, aims to bring together researchers
in multiple disciplines and to encourage cross-fertilization between the
attending physicists and chemists, biologists or engineers. In addition, the
conference will strongly emphasize participation of women and minority
attendants at all levels, including as organizers of the conference, invited
speakers, discussion leaders, and senior and junior
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This grant aims to
provide partial support to the 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) on the Chemistry and Physics of Graphitic Carbon
Materials. The GRC aims to bring together and promote interactions among
researchers in multiple disciplines with shared interest in graphitic carbon
materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphite, activated
carbon, etc. The conference will have a strong presence of theoretical and
experimental condense matter physicists. The diverse topics to be discussed in
the GRC are highly relevant to the mission of the Division of Materials Research
of the NSF. Accomplishing these goals will undoubtedly lead to many exciting
discoveries on chemistry and physics of materials, and result in new enabling
materials and technologies.
