Through a combination of science content instruction, science education
modeling, peer interactions, and student instruction, the Puget Sound Basin
Teacher Institute will help elementary and middle school teachers improve their
subject matter understanding, teaching strategies, and their self-confidence in
teaching science. An expansion of the successful 1989 summer institute, the
program will utilize the shore side facilities of the Poulsbo Marine Science
Center, the University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratory and Western
Washington University Shannon Point Field Station and the ship based program of
"Sound Experience" to provide an intellectually stimulating learning
environment. Intense coursework will be provided by knowledgeable scientists and
exemplary science educators. The three follow-up weekends during the school year
will provide the participants with additional support and instruction. Teachers
will be selected on the basis of their desire and commitment to teaching
science, their science training, and on their current teaching assignments. They
will learn how to improve their students' knowledge and achievement. Equally
important, they will learn how to work with and motivate other teachers. This
type of institute provides an excellent example of the benefits of using a
unique and highly motivating environment such as Puget Sound to help teachers
understand science content and become motivated to use the instructional support
provided to bring that understanding to their students. The cost sharing for the
program will be twenty-six percent of he NSF portion.
