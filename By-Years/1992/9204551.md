This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a cryogenic
magnetometer and to construct a magnetically shielded room in which to operate
it. The magnetometer will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology
and Geophysics at the University of Utah. The University of Utah is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for this project. The equipment will be
used primarily in the research projects of the Principal Investigator, which are
aimed at explaining the origins and meaning of rock magnetism. The high-
sensitivity magnetometer will make it possible to measure magnetic moments of
individual mineral particles in magnetized rocks and to study the development of
magnetic remanence in rocks under conditions that mimic natural settings.
