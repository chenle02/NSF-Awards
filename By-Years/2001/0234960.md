The exponential rise in sequence data from diverse organisms continues to
enhance the power of comparative approaches to understanding protein function.
The group has previously developed alignment-based tools to facilitate this
analysis, by brining into play position-based strategies for predicting
deleterious mutations and variants in organisms as diverse as bacteria and
humans. This project aims to apply a position-based approach to identifying
deleterious lesions in reverse genetics project and in the analysis of natural
variants. A general reverse genetics strategy has been developed that uses
chemical mutagenesis and screening for point mutations,, and applied to
establishing a resource for the Arabidopsis community. The proposed tools should
enhance functional genomics approaches in both academia and industry. Knowledge
gained from function genomics is valuable for its own sake, but also has the
potentials of contributing to broader environmental welfare.
