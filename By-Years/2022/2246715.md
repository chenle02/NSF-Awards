Large complex systems exhibiting a huge number of equilibria and rugged
landscapes are important in the mathematical modeling of multiple scientific
areas. This project will study certain spin glass models. These models
originated in the experimental physics of certain alloys, such as an alloy of
gold with a small percentage of iron, possessing unusual magnetic behaviors.
This project aims to investigate questions about asymptotic structures and phase
transitions of spin glass models that are motivated by emerging topics in high-
dimensional optimization, statistical inference, and neural networks. The
investigator will mentor and collaborate with graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows on this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this work
focuses on certain mean-field spin glass models and their diluted variants. The
problems include understanding the Gibbs-type variational formulation for the
free energy associated with the spiked Gaussian matrix models and concave
Hamiltonians. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the Gaussian operator norm
and the limiting free energy in the diluted setting of the Sherrington-
Kirkpatrick model and perceptron models will be studied. This research is
expected to be beneficial to the many scientific and applied subjects that can
be modeled by high complexity randomized combinatorial optimization
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
