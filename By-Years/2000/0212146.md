0212146&lt;br/&gt;Page&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is provided for the 2002
biannual Gordon Research Conference on Ttibology. The conference will be held
August 4-9 at Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Islans. Session topics
are focused on a general physics theme of "paths of least resistance". Topics
include friction, lubrication and wear mechanisms, as well as the role of
surface science and advanced modelling. The Gordon Conference format will assure
that cutting edge research is discussed extensively in an informal atmosphere.
NSF support will be used primarily to support the attendance of graduate
students and junior researchers. The outcomes of the conference will be advances
in basic science and follow-on impact on industrial applications in this
important area as results transfer to industry.&lt;br/&gt;
