This study will expand and refine a molecular method for identification of
ectomycorrhizal fungi. The method is based on amplification of DNA with the
polymerase chain reaction coupled with oligonucleotide hybridization assays of
the resulting productd. The sensitivity of the method enables fungal symbionts
from individual mycorrhizal rootlets to be identified to a variety of taxonomic
levels (e.g., order to strain) and tree hosts to be identified simultaneously.
This method will be used to examine several ecologically significant host-
symbiont interactions; mycorrhizal parasitism, fungal symbiont sharing and host
specificity and competitive interactions among selected species. These studies
will provide the necessary foundation for later testing of theories of fungal
succession and mycorrhizal community structure, phenomena that are highly
significant in virtually all terrestrial habitats.
