This project aims study certain hyperbolic-parabolic type partial differential
equations that arise form mathematical physics. To be considered are: the
asymptotic behavior of viscous flows toward general Riemann solutions which
consist of both compressive and expansive waves; metastability of contact
discontinuities for compressible Navier-Stokes equations and in MHD;
L_1-nonlinear stability of viscous shock profiles for systems of viscous
conservation laws; the effects of small dissipation on the interactions of
elementary waves; theory of viscous shock waves for nonstrictly hyperbolic
systems (this is of particular significance due to the appearance of so-called
transitional waves such as overcompressive and crossing shocks; it seems that
the admissibility of such waves should involve nonlinear stability analysis);
nonlinear stability of planar viscous shocks for systems of conservation law in
several space dimensions; and the theory of viscous boundary layer for
compressible fluids, in particular, the interaction of shock layer and boundary
layers, and the continuous dependence on initial data of weak entropy solutions
for systems of conservation laws. Many interesting phenomena arising in physics
and other branches of natural sciences can be modeled by nonlinear partial
differential equations of hyperbolic-parabolic type. Important examples include
the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for compressible inviscid and viscous
fluids, the equations of electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically
conducting compressible viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity, nonlinear
Boltzmann type equations in kinetic theory, and equations for combustion,
multiphase flows, and fluids with chemical reactions.
