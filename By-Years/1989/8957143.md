This program emphasizes application of the principles of statistical
thermodynamics to understanding and predicting phase behavior and phase
equilibria in colloidal systems. Systems of interest include multicomponent
surfactant mixtures, micellization and surfactant phase equilibria, protein
partitioning in aqueous two-phase polymer systems, and phase separation of lens
protein solutions in relations to cataract disease. The field of phase behavior
and phase equilibria in complex and supermolecular fluids is of central
importance to a broad spectrum of industrial, technological, and biomedical
areas including detergency, wetting, paint and cosmetic technology, enhanced oil
recovery, biopolymer separations, cholesterol metabolism, and cataract disease.
This rapidly developing field provides a new and exciting arena for the
synthesis of concepts and computational methods from a diversity of scientific
disciplines including physics, chemistry, engineering, and biomedicine.
