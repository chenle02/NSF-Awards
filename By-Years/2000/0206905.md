Boudreau&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0206905&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Igneous intrusions such as
the Bushveld Complex of South Africa and the Stillwater Complex of Montana host
much of the world's reserves of economically valuable elements such as chromium
and the platinum-group elements. Although subject to numerous studies, there is
still surprisingly little agreement on how they crystallized and differentiated.
A significant part of the proposed study involves extending a numerical model
that links an equilibrium crystallization routine (based on the MELTS algorithm
of Ghiorso and coworkers) with one-dimensional heat and mass transport equations
that include compaction equations of McKenzie. Examples of areas the work would
be extended include the addition of spinels to the program and investigation of
the formation of economically important chromite-rich layers that occur in
layered intrusions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;On a parallel track, we will look at
details of mineral-mineral trace element partitioning to test if concentrations
of temperature-dependent trace elements are affected by compaction-driven
recrystallization. Specifically, laser ablation-ICP-MS and electron microprobe
mineral mapping and bulk mineral analysis will test if mineral-mineral
partitioning is correlated textural and/or modal
variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we wish to test if one can infer
concealed intrusion geometry from crystal size distribution (CSD) data. This
will be tested by comparing existing data with new Lower and Critical zone
samples to be collected where the Lower is both unusually thick over footwall
embayments (i.e., the "Burgersfort Bugle") and where the Lower and Critical zone
onlap the floor rocks in the eastern Bushveld. If successful, this will further
demonstrate that texture is locally evolved and not necessarily a function of
minerals transported from elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
