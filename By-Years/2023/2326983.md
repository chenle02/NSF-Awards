Nontechnical description: The in-person conference, and an online working group,
will explore the question of reproducibility in condensed matter physics
experiments. Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that studies
phenomena in collective behavior of atoms and other particles, for example in
solids. This area is of recognized fundamental scientific and broad importance,
that furthers the understanding of new states of matter, precipitates the
discovery of new materials, invention of electronic devices and sensors. The
program is composed of a diverse set of speakers, with focus on inclusion and
equity. A particular emphasis is made on reaching out to potential participants
from historically black colleges and universities, as well as minority serving
institutions. Societies of Physics Students are engaged in recruitment for the
workshop, and research groups are encouraged to send undergraduate, graduate
students and postdocs to the conference.

Technical description: The condensed matter physics community does not currently
follow established protocols for verifying the reproducibility of published
work. The conference offers this highly productive and impactful community an
opportunity to discuss how reproducibility can be defined, standardized, carried
out, assessed, and promoted. The focus is on studying the examples of
reproduction attempts, on how to identify irreproducible research, how to
promote and support reproduction efforts, where to publish such works and how to
give credit to researchers that carry them out. The effort has an international
reach reflecting the collaborative nature of many of the efforts in the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
