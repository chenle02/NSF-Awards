This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Purdue University will develop tools for use by mechanical engineering
students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to infuse sustainability
considerations into product design. The study employs an innovative research
design by bringing state of the art techniques in model building and
visualization into design tools that are exceptionally robust but also easy to
use by undergraduate students. The results will be disseminated through
professional networks and Purdue's Global Hub. The goal is to better prepare
students for the practice of engineering through developing tools to enhance
understanding of environmental sustainability. These techniques are expected to
increase students' interest in engineering and will enhance the number who
complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.
