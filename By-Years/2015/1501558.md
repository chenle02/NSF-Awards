This research project deals with representation theory, the branch of
mathematics concerned with studying linear symmetries. Symmetries often form
algebraic structures, such as associative algebras. The algebras studied in this
project all have a geometric nature and originate from quantum physics. The goal
is to understand representations of a given algebra, meaning ways the algebra
can be represented as linear symmetries of something else. The basic building
blocks here are irreducible representations, and a large part of this project
deals with describing possible irreducible representations and computing
important invariants, such as their dimensions. A second important question to
be addressed in this project is understanding how more complicated
representations may be built from irreducible representations.

The project is devoted to the study of the representation theory W-algebras,
rational Cherednik algebras, and quantized quiver varieties. For W-algebras, the
investigator plans to classify the finite dimensional irreducible
representations. For rational Cherednik algebras, the investigator plans to
compute the number of simple objects in associated category O with given
support. For quantized quiver varieties, the investigator plans to compute the
characters of finite dimensional irreducible representations, study the
structure of the corresponding category O, and produce derived equivalences as
Ringel dualities for standardly stratified structures. This includes computing
the dimensions of supports of irreducible modules.
