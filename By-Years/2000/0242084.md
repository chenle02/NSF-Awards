This is a project to conduct geophysical surveys and acquire sediment cores from
the fjords and continental shelf of southeastern Alaska. The data collected will
be used to examine climatic variability in this region over the Holocene and
Late Glacial interval. In particular, the study will determine if terrestrial
climate changes in this region are linked to changes in regional ocean
conditions and if decadal-scale climate changes, analogous to those in the
historical record (referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation"), are
recorded in rapidly accumulating fjord sediments. If localities are discovered
that yield important paleoclimatic records, these localities will be targeted in
a drilling proposal for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.
