Over the past decades probability theory has had tremendous success in
elucidating scaling limits and large-scale phenomena. However, systems that have
no apparent scaling limit are abundant in both the physical and life sciences,
and there is practical need to better understand such systems. This research
project aims to advance understanding of such systems by studying models
augmented with additional symmetries that share the local behavior of the
classical disordered systems under study. Graduate students and postdoctoral
associates will receive training through involvement in the research. The topics
under study in this project divide into three subareas: (1) stationary diffusion
limited aggregation (DLA) and Hastings-Levitov models, (2) DLA in a wedge, and
(3) chemical distance in random interlacements. These models are of interest for
statistical mechanics and mathematical physics. They share the features of being
generated by diffusion or the harmonic measure, and of attempting to grasp the
nature of a physical phenomenon that is not amenable more classical models in
the field, such as DLA or Bernoulli percolation. The methods to be employed
borrow ideas and tools from various mathematical disciplines, including complex
analysis, harmonic analysis, differential equations, and ergodic theory.
