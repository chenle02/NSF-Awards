The use of a computer as a laboratory instrument is fast becoming a standard
within the undergraduate physics laboratory. It is important, however, that the
computer not be used to merely mechanize data gathering and analysis, virtually
replacing the student in the lab and leaving him as a passive agent. This
project will develop innovative ways to use the computer to allow the student to
have a deeper intellectual experience in the lab. Using commercially available
computer interfaces, the students will be instructed in the use of the computer
hardware and software. They will then be encouraged to devise variations of
standard undergraduate physics labs using the computer to acquire the data and
then to analyze the data. The computers will be interfaced with airtracks and
photo- reflective sensors, as well as existing transducers and sensors. The
grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from
non-Federal sources.
