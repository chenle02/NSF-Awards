This award supports a one year project with Dr. J. Christensen of Bigelow
Laboratory for Ocean Sciences that will attempt to make respiration rate
measurements of selected benthic infauna. The measurement of benthic respiration
rates is critical to our understanding of the consumption of organic carbon in
shelf and near shore waters. However, biological rates are some of the most
difficult environmental measurements to make, and the investigators will apply a
sensitive biochemical assay for respiration, the measurement of electron
transport system (ETS) activity. The ETS measurements will be calibrated with
laboratory oxygen consumption measurements and respiration under a range of
environmental conditions will be investigated. The field study will be done in
the near shore waters of southern Maine.
