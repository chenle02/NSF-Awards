This research is focused on the development of new efficient parallel and
sequential algorithms for computational geometry problems. Problems arising from
applications of computational geometry to robotics, computer vision, computer
graphics, and geometric modeling will be investigated. Efficient parallel
algorithms for constructing 3-dimensional convex hulls will be sought. An
investigation of parallel autonomous robot motion planning in the presence of
obstacles will be initiated. Efficient parallel hidden surface elimination
algorithms will be developed. Algorithms will be developed for the automation of
the determination of the global shape of a simple geometric object.
