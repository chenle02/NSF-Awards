LINSKY The objective of this award is to support all components of the review
process of the Terrestrial Ecology and Global Change Program. This is a special
interagency competition involving NSF, DOE, NASA, and USDA. The work to support
all aspects of the review is needed as this special competition is in addition
to the normal programs normally run in the Division of Environmental Biology.
The announcement generated 150 proposals, and the interagency review and
decision making requires communication and coordination between representatives
of the four primary agencies and additional agencies interested in global change
research. Friday Services Systems is experienced in supporting such review
efforts, and their cost-estimate for the work was deemed cost-effective and
responsive to the statement of work provide by NSF. Their services will help
insure a careful, thorough, and effective evaluation of the submitted proposals.
