The Institute seeks to improve mathematics, science and engineering programs at
community colleges nationwide by more fully involving key community college
disciplinary leaders in national educational and scientific activities. It is
creating a broader awareness among faculty at community colleges of the scope
and mission of the National Science Foundation, the two-year college divisions
of their respective academic disciplinary societies, and the American
Association of Community and Junior Colleges. The participating interns are
learning of technological advances and of grant policies and procedures and are
disseminating this knowledge to others in their community. The experiences of
the interns include: extensive participation "on site" at NSF in agency
activities related to strengthening education; participation in
seminars/workshops; interviews, discussions and other activities with the AACJC
and the respective academic discipline associations. Each intern is
participating fully in internal NSF activities and is assigned to one of the EHR
divisions.
