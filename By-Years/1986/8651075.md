The Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Portland will acquire
a Hewlett-Packard Semiconductor Parameter Analysis System and an associated
Tektronix Programmable Instrumentation System. With this data acquisition system
students will be able to characterize integrated circuits and extract and verify
circuit parameters. To facilitate the computations the system will be connected
with a VAX 11/750 computer in the Computer Aided Engineering laboratory. SUXES
and SPICE software, both available on the VAX 11/750 computer, will be used in
conjunction with this equipment. The equipment will first be used with
commercially available IC's. In the near future special chips for this purpose
will be developed. The instrumentation is part of a general effort to upgrade
and automate the instrumentation in the Electrical Engineering laboratories, and
is also a part of a planned development of a strong laboratory curriculum in
microelectronics in the Electrical Engineering Department.
