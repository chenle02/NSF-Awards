This project implements a second computer laboratory to include the latest
imaging and multimedia related hardware. It will be used with traditional and
non-traditional Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry and Computer Science courses. The
new laboratory space will meet the following objectives to: 1. improve the
instructional quality in all of our courses, 2. develop and implement new
multidisciplinary service courses aimed primarily at improving the "quantitative
science experience" for non-science students; 3. modernize existing courses and
develop innovative courses within the newly acquired computer science and data
processing/programming and systems curricula; 4. include object oriented
programming with languages such as Java, imaging, applications, digital video
and multimedia development tools; 5. expand our "computer based laboratory
utilization to include multidisciplinary training in physical science, computer
literacy, imaging and multimedia applications for outside practicing
professionals such as photographers, fine and graphic artists; 6. assist with
the training of new elementary education teachers and in-service elementary and
secondary educators by technology courseware and the offering of workshops in
conjunction with the local teacher learning centers. *
