CMS-0100063&lt;br/&gt;EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES ON COMPACTION WITH
APPLICATION ON&lt;br/&gt;PHARMACEUTICAL POWDERS&lt;br/&gt;Antonios Zavaliangos
and Iosif Csaba Sinka&lt;br/&gt;GOALI - NSF/CMS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast
to the scientific advances in drug design, tablet processing has&lt;br/&gt;been
dominated by empiricism, and it presents a bottleneck for transition
to&lt;br/&gt;market of new discoveries. In this basic research project,
Drexel&lt;br/&gt;University and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. aim to develop a science
basis for the&lt;br/&gt;compaction of pharmaceutical powders that leads to solid
dosages. Specific&lt;br/&gt;objectives of this study are to: (i) establish
experimental procedures for&lt;br/&gt;characterization of pharmaceutical powders
under conditions characteristic&lt;br/&gt;of industrial operations. (ii)
determine experimentally the origin of rate&lt;br/&gt;effects and their
influence on the mechanical properties of tablets, (iii)&lt;br/&gt;formulate
constitutive models that portray accurately the behavior of
powder&lt;br/&gt;mixtures during compaction, (iv) develop design guidelines that
will allow&lt;br/&gt;rational decision making in pharmaceutical powder
formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
