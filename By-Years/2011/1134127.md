Intellectual Merit. This biomedical engineering project aims to create new
cadherin molecules whose function can be reversibly switched with light
(LiCads). Cadherins comprise one of the major cell-cell adhesion protein
families and mediate intercellular contacts in metazoans by forming multimers in
cellular junctions. Switchable LiCads would enable improved ways to study cell
adhesion and its interplay with cell signaling and tissue development. Light
control would also provide a new mechanism to manipulate adhesion in biomedical
engineering applications. To achieve these objectives, it is proposed to create
LiCads via engineering pairs of cysteine residues at computationally designed
locations in the cadherin molecule, bridge these cysteines with an azobenzene-
based, photoisomerizable chromophore, and switch cadherin function by triggering
cadherin conformational changes through photoisomerization of the chromophore.
The intellectual merit lies in the integration of life science and engineering
principles for innovation in two areas: (i) a light-based approach to modulate
cell-cell adhesion with improved spatial and temporal resolution (a novel
application of existing azobenzene-based technologies), and (ii) an engineering
methodology to design a new light-controlled protein conformational switch. The
product from successful completion of this research, validated LiCads, would
represent a considerable advance in the design of structure by engineering and
characterizing a protein switch useful to probe complex cellular functions.

Broader Impact. There is great need for novel tools to characterize and control
key biological processes in real time with high spatial resolution. This project
aims to engineer and validate such a tool, LiCads, to control cell-cell
interactions. Because of the importance of cadherin-mediated interactions in
cell biology, tissue morphogenesis, tissue remodeling during development, wound
healing and tumor invasiveness in cancer, LiCads can be expected to have
considerable impact on many problems in basic and disease biology. Controlling
cell assembly in three dimensions is also a key requirement of complex cellular
engineering applications. Therefore, LiCads should be useful to both biologists
and biological engineers. Students at the graduate, undergraduate and high
school levels will participate in this research, building on a track record in
mentoring students, and on existing partnerships with the UCSF Undergraduate
Summer Research Program and the San Francisco Unified School District; these
programs emphasize participation of groups underrepresented in science and
engineering. Research under this grant will be integrated with education
designed to foster collaboration between students from the life and
physical/engineering sciences.
