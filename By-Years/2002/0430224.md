The goal of this project is to design, implement and prototype a general
platform for survivable and secure data storage systems. The platform will
provide a set of computation efficient MDS encoders and decoders for general
(n,k) schemes, as well as a suite of basic file operations. This project will
also explore a few applications of such a platform for storage-based intrusion
detection, prevention and restoration. Such a platform can be incorporated,
modified, adapted and extended in future research and development of data
storage systems and data distribution networks. The proposed research will
provide a practical key building block to networked storage systems that form
the basis of national cyber security. This project is a system practice
extension from various theoretical results and tools we have accumulated from
related projects. The broader impact of this research includes multiple aspects:
we will disseminate tools and systems developed in this project to related
research communities for wide adoption and adaptation; we will actively
incorporate research results into various educational activities; and this
project will both make use and provide theory, tools and testbed to the PI's
other related NSF-sponsored projects.
