Funds to acquire equipment are awarded to enhance the present implementation of
the UNIDATA Program at the University of Nevada- Reno (UNR). The Desert Research
Institute (DRI) directs a program in Atmospheric Physics at UNR. Graduate and
undergraduate teaching activities take place both at UNR and the DRI Stead
Science Center. While the majority of the instruction takes place on the UNR
campus, the use of computing facilities and real-time meteorological data has
been limited to the Stead Location which is located 10 km from the main campus.
This equipment award will provide the capability to capture, archival and access
meteorological data to the Atmospheric Data Facility on the DRI Stead campus and
distribute these data via ethernet to a weather laboratory on the main campus.
