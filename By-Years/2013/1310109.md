This action funds Marie DesHarnais of the University of Minnesota to conduct a
research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the National
University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Modeling of Fire
Induced Progressive Collapse for Reinforced Concrete Buildings." The host
scientist is Dr. Sze Dai Pang.

A new computational model of reinforced concrete structures is being developed
to assess the effect of fire on structural integrity, or safety. The coupled
thermo-mechanical model can capture heat transfer, changes in material
properties, and mechanical deformations from loads. This project includes a
series of tests to characterize the behavior of concrete at various
temperatures, an essential part of the model development. With the numerical
model calibrated from the physical tests, probabilistic simulations are carried
out to quantify the risk of building collapse due to a specific fire scenario.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the principal investigator will participate
in two annual high-school summer programs held at the University of Minnesota,
which specifically target minority and female students; "Exploring Careers in
Engineering and Physical Science" and the "high-tech girl society." The
principal investigator will use this opportunity to stimulate or affirm the
students' interests in structural engineering and attract more female and
minority students to the Civil Engineering undergraduate program.
