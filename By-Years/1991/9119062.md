A major question in plant biology concerns the role of light in regulation of
chloroplast gene expression and the mechanisms for positive and negative control
of chloroplast genes are incompletely understood. The unicellular rhodophyte,
Cyanidium caldarium, has a number of properties which make it a good system for
investigating photoregulated chloroplast genes. The light harvesting antenna in
this organism is comprised of phycobilisomes, which are macromolecular
assemblies containing allophycocyanin, phycocyanin and several linker
polypeptides. Cells grown in the dark contain a small etioplast which develops
into a large chloroplast in the light. This is accompanied by 50 fold increases
in the levels of mRNAs for apc, cpc, and other chloroplast genes, such as psaA,
psbA and rbcL. Turnover rates of chloroplast photogenes will be determined in
dark and light to determine whether accumulation of transcripts in light results
from increased transcription activity, changes in mRNA stability, or both. In
addition, heme promotes accumulation of transcripts for certain chloroplast
photogenes in the dark and mechanisms underlying this process will be
investigated (Aim 1). Experiments will be performed to determine whether genes
for linker polypeptides are photoregulated and whether levels of transcripts of
these genes are modulated by heme (Aim 2). Genes for allophycocyanin and
phycocyanin will be cloned and sequenced in order to identify possible light-
and heme-responsive regulatory elements (Aim 3). A homologous in vitro
transcription system will be developed to investigate factors involved in
regulation of chloroplast photogenes.
