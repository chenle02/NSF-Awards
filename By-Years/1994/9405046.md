9405046 Reeder The research supported by this award will examine the mechanism
by which surface structure influences trace element incorporation into minerals
during growth, with particular emphasis on the resulting intracrystalline
distribution. Minerals to be considered include apatite, calcite, and topaz.
Techniques to be utilized in the study are synchrotron x-ray fluorescence
microanalysis, x-ray and neutron structure refinements, and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy. The results of the research program will find application in
geochemical studies involving partitioning behavior and also in materials
science and industrial crystallization projects where surface and growth
mechanisms are important.
