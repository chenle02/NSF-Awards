This award will support the 1988 Cajal Club Symposium to be held April 24, 1988
in Cincinnati, Ohio at the Convention Center. This symposium will explore some
of the mechanisms which have been demonstrated during normal development (in
vivo and in vitro) such as neurotrophic mechanisms, extracellular matrix
mechanisms, glial guidance of developing axonal pathways, and development of
motor behavior. Through formal presentations and discussions, the participants
will critically explore these potential mechanisms and the interactions among
them for reorganization of the damaged CNS. The research interests of the
participants are diverse, and should lead to a lively exchange of ideas.
