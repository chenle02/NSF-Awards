0931344&lt;br/&gt;Samuelson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of
this research is to evolve an economically viable coal and biomass fed energy
plant concept that integrates advanced subsystem technologies which are under
development in a synergistic manner to generate electricity while capturing a
significant portion of the CO2 and coproducing H2 for future fuel cell hybrid
vehicle applications. For the design element of the research, a typical plant
sire will be conceptualized by taking into account access to coal and biomass
feedstock resources, proximity to CO2 sequestration sites and transportation of
the coproduct H2. For the purposes of the design study, major subsystems in the
context of 2020 deployment will be selected, with development of models for
predicting performance. A variety of concepts will be evaluated utilizing system
simulation models, and by developing exergy analysis and rough order of
magnitude economic analysis leading to a final system design selection. Through
a broad array of outreach activities hosted by the principal investigator,
including an international colloquium, annual short course events, and industry
member meetings, results of the research will be widely disseminated.
Additionally, an outreach program will involve local elementary and high school
teachers.
