Newman&lt;br/&gt;0109086&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his
colleagues study the&lt;br/&gt;structure and function of real-world networked
systems,&lt;br/&gt;particularly but not exclusively social networks. An
empirical&lt;br/&gt;component is concerned with the discovery and analysis of
the&lt;br/&gt;structure of networks, including networks of
collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between scientists, networks of company directors,
networks of&lt;br/&gt;personal preferences, and networks of citations between
academic&lt;br/&gt;publications. Studied quantities include local observables
such&lt;br/&gt;as transitivity and degree distribution, and nonlocal ones
such&lt;br/&gt;as centrality and community structure. The investigator
develops&lt;br/&gt;models to aid in the understanding of the effects of
network&lt;br/&gt;structure. Of particular interest are random graph models
of&lt;br/&gt;networks, percolation models of network resilience, and models
of&lt;br/&gt;epidemics taking place on social networks. The
investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops new algorithms for extracting and visualizing
network&lt;br/&gt;structure, particularly the existence of communities in
networks&lt;br/&gt;and structural properties related to network resilience, such
as&lt;br/&gt;path counts and centrality measures.&lt;br/&gt; A knowledge of the
structure of networks of acquaintance is&lt;br/&gt;crucial to the understanding
of how information, such as news,&lt;br/&gt;rumors, consumer trends, etc.,
spreads through society.&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, networks of physical contact
between people govern the&lt;br/&gt;way in which diseases spread. A proper
understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;nature and progress of epidemics is impossible
without good&lt;br/&gt;network models. In this project the investigator
determines what&lt;br/&gt;the structure of the networks in question is, and also
models the&lt;br/&gt;effect of that structure on, among other things, the spread
of&lt;br/&gt;information and disease. As well as enhancing
basic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these problems, the project points to ways
in&lt;br/&gt;which network structure or dynamics can be changed in order
to&lt;br/&gt;either improve network transmission (in the case of
information)&lt;br/&gt;or slow it down (in the case of epidemics). For
disease&lt;br/&gt;transmission, for instance, it may be able to suggest
effective&lt;br/&gt;targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow
disease&lt;br/&gt;spread. The new data resources and analysis techniques
developed&lt;br/&gt;can be used to study other problems in which network-
structured&lt;br/&gt;processes arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
