This two-year project brings together three components: (a) summer workshops,
(b) an equipment library and (c) mobile units during the academic year.
Beginning in the summer of 1990 and continuing in 1991, eight day
laboratory/demontration workshop courses for physics and physical science
teachers will be held at the University of New Orleans. These will be
complemented by a one credit hour in-service course during the fall and spring.
In addition the ongoing activities of the Metro Orleans Physics Teacher
Organization will serve as a mutual support group. These workshops will provide
these opportunities for 28 teacher each year. During the school year two physics
resource teachers trained by the American Association of Physics Teachers in the
PTRA program will provide in-classroom support to teachers of physics and
physical science in an area within a thirty-five mile radius of New Orleans. The
resource teachers will operate from mobile van units containing necessary
materials and equipment for their scheduled visits. These mobile units will in
turn be stocked from an equipment library holding materials appropriate for
courses in physics and physical science at the secondary level. Material not
needed for the mobile units will be available for borrowing by science teachers
in the area. The project brings together federal, state and local resources to
promote hands-on science teaching in an urban area with substantial minority
components among the science teachers and in the student population. Local
support requires the cooperative efforts of business, several public and private
school systems and the University of New Orleans. Cost sharing in an amount of
$237,437 equals 111% of the NSF award.
