Current combustors rely on the spread of a flame front or shock across the
mixture of fuel and oxidizer (deflagration or detonation). This process requires
a small but finite period of time, during which conditions often deviate from
optimum. Replacing this approach by the simultaneous release of radicals in the
whole volume at an optimal time is a desirable but challenging goal. This
project examines the practicality of using electron beams to trigger ignition
across a large volume. It will be tested also in the break-up of chlorine
compounds, since they are chemically very similar to hydrocarbon fuels. The
success of the method would ensure the availability of a very useful
technological base for the design of efficient non- polluting engines and
incinerators. Long term concerns about energy conservation and environment
control make the development of this method highly important.
