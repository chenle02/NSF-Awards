During normal animal development cells communicate with each other using
signaling molecules. This ensures the correct body pattern is made and key
features such as limbs are properly formed. In this project, the fruit fly will
be used as a model system to study limb growth. The research will utilize
important resources that have been developed in the nationally funded genome
projects and will involve molecular biology and genetics. It is expected that a
comprehensive view of how a limb is established from the earliest stages will
emerge. The genes used in limb development in fruit flies are conserved with
other animals, including humans, so that general principals will be learned. To
increase public understanding of science, an exhibit showcasing the research
project will be presented at a major science museum in Ohio (COSI).
