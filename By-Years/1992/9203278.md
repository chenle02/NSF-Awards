This project will investigate the phenomenon of "bleaching" in a widespread
genus of reef dwelling benthic foraminifera from the Florida Keys region with
the purpose of examining its potential as a useful environmental indicator of
the "bleaching" problem in general. Recent widespread episodes of "bleaching" of
coral reef organisms has raised concern about the environmental quality of coral
reef ecosystems and the potentially deteriorating health of these systems.
Foraminifera are small and easily collected organisms and their collection
results in minimal environmental impact to the reefs. The goals of the research
are: 1. to describe the process of bleaching and recovery in both laboratory and
field bleached individuals; 2. to examine if high temperature and ultra- violet
radiation , as well as fluorescent light can induce bleaching; 3. to determine
to what degree the foraminifera can bleach and still recover; 4. to determine if
bleaching inhibits the laying down of the forams calcified shell; 5. to develop
techniques to rapidly assay for bleaching.
