This investigation has the objective of improving the accuracy of constitutive
models for the hot working of metals. Currently, the simulation of complex
forming processes, such as extrusion, forging and superplastic forming, has been
modeled using finite element methods and constitutive equations. However, there
is a lack of proper data upon which to base these equations. The rate dependent
flow of metals will be systematically investigated by means of detailed
constant- structure experiments on high-purity, polycrystalline aluminum. The
unique data so generated should lead to more appropriate flow equations that
incorporate internal variables in their formulation.
