This is a collaborative project involving Drury University, Central Missouri
State University, and Lamar University Beaumont. Despite efforts of the Calculus
Reform movement, in some institutions, the success rate of students in calculus
remains low. Problem-based learning has proven to be an effective pedagogical
technique which addresses a diversity of learning styles, but there are no
published materials for teaching the calculus sequence using it.

This project is completing the writing of texts for teaching Calculus I, II, and
III using a problem-based learning approach, the modified Moore method, and
incorporating an appropriate usage of technology. McGraw-Hill has published
Calculus I, A Discovery Workbook, written by two of the investigators, and
expresses interest in publishing Calculus II and III as well. Activities include
assessment of the effectiveness of this method and dissemination of the results
in faculty development workshops. The investigators and the advisory board
members are innovativors in the use of problem-based teaching and learning and
are active in discussing this method in the broader mathematical community and
in disseminating materials for use in problem-based courses.
