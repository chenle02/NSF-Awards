*** 9724351 Saulnier This award provides funding to establish a research
infrastructure that will enable faculty and students at a liberal arts college
to undertake a multifaceted project consisting of three categories of scattering
experiments interwoven with computational simulation. These include development
of a low-coherence heterodyning technique to image structures imbedded in a
highly scattering medium, a new time-resolved photon and phonon correlation
spectroscopic technique, and pulse transmission time-of- flight measurements to
be employed as part of the first two experiments. Results of the efforts are
potentially of practical use in the development of a medical diagnostic and in
geological remote sensing. This action is partly supported by the NSF Major
Research Instrumentation Program and partly by the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities. ***
