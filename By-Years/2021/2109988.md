A real-world challenge in data science is to develop interactive methods for
quickly analyzing new and novel data sets that are potentially of massive scale.
This award will design and implement fundamental algorithms for high performance
computing solutions that enable the interactive large-scale data analysis of
massive data sets. Based on the widely-used data types and structures of
strings, sets, matrices and graphs, this methodology will produce efficient and
scalable software for three classes of fundamental algorithms that will
drastically improve the performance on a wide range of real-world queries or
directly realize frequent queries. These innovations will allow the broad
community to move massive-scale data exploration from time-consuming batch
processing to interactive analyses that give a data analyst the ability to
comprehensively, deeply and efficiently explore the insights and science in real
world data sets. By enabling the increasing number of developers to easily
manipulate large data sets, this will greatly enlarge the data science community
and find much broader use in new communities. Materials from this project will
be included in graduate and undergraduate course curriculum. Especially, women,
high school students and other underrepresented groups in STEM areas will be
encouraged to participate in this research activity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on these three important data structures for data analytics: 1)
suffix array construction, 2) 'treap' construction and 3) distributed memory
join algorithms, useful for analyzing large scale strings, implementing random
search in large string data sets, and generating new relations, respectively.
These fundamental algorithms serve as the cornerstone to support interactive
data science at scale. Based on the theoretical achievements and systematic
algorithm design, a novel symbiotic optimization methodology that can combine
the theoretical analysis, data structure features, and typical data distribution
features together as a whole will be developed to significantly improve the
practical performance of the proposed algorithms. To evaluate and show the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, these algorithms will be implemented
in and contribute to an open source NumPy-like software framework that aims to
provide productive data discovery tools on massive, dozens-of-terabytes data
sets by bringing together the productivity of Python with world-class high
performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
