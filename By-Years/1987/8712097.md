Agenda politics have to do with the emergence and shaping of issues decided by a
polity. Agenda politics are especially problematic if issues are redistributive,
i.e. threaten to redistribute existing status, power, or rewards. They are
problematic because, some observers argue, access to agendas is biased against
them. In almost any view, an agenda is a kind of gate: except in the smallest
and simplest systems, not all issues can be decided all at once; some selection
and ordering will occur. In the case of redistributive issues, both the
structure of the process and the behavior of agenda gatekeepers may operate to
select and order in ways that delay or prevent such issues being decided.
Especially controversial is the effect of legitimacy in increasing or decreasing
this bias. In this research, five experiments will be carried out to test ten
hypotheses that bear on the bias of, and constraints on, use of the agenda
power. The variables with which the research is concerned include: the gains to
the gatekeeper from the existing distribution of status, power, and rewards; the
threat to the gatekeeper of retaliation for use of the agenda power; and various
aspects of the legitimacy of the use of the agenda power and of the existing
distribution of status, power, and rewards.
