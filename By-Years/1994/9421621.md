This research explores the scaling-down of direct-drive actuator technology
previously developed by the PI. The prior efforts involved theoretical
electrodynamics models of generalized EM actuators based on screw theory, and
led to the development of miniature, high-torque spherical camera-pointing
motors. The goal of the current project is to adapt the theory and magnetic
technology to several robotic actuator applications at millimeter and
submillimeter scales, This involves a combination of simulations and theoretical
investigations of scaling properties and dynamics, development of a series of
experimental devices to serve as testbeds for the ideas, and exploration of
several medical and telerobotic applications of such miniaturization through
research collaborations and corporate partnerships. The research results will be
disseminated through multimedia, including publication in mathematical hypertext
and access to experimental robots through the World-Wide Web. The plan is to
publish the designs and details of experimental prototypes so that researchers
are be able to access our files and produce exact copies of the devices.
