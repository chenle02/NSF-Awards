There are significant advantages in the development of flexible laser materials
based on organic and biological materials, which could have wide-ranging
applications including those in wearable sensors. This project applies a
fundamental approach to advantage of the inherit polarization properties of
cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to create new lasing materials. The challenges
investigators address are the toxicity, water solubility and stability of
organic materials. To address these barriers, they will explore the properties
of a diverse classes of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI provides good
evidence that CNC films have left-handed circular dichroism that can be enhanced
and modified by inclusion of polymers, which can further increase the strength
and flexibility of the films. To produce lasing materials, the PIs plan to
incorporate quantum dots (QDs) into the films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
