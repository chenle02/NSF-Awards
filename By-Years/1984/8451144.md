The research focuses on two areas, the first dealing with combined free-forced
convection from a rotating horizontal cylinder. The study is experimental and is
carried out by using air as the working fluid and an existing wind tunnel to
simulate the forced convection flow. The cylinder is heated electrically and the
constant heat flux condition is maintained on the cylinder boundary. The results
document thoroughly the effect of the Reynolds number, the Rayleigh number, and
the angular velocity of the cylinder on the temperature and flow fields. The
second area of research concerns convective instability in superposed porous and
fluid layers triggered by the combined action of temperature and concentration
gradients in the vertical directions. In the theoretical investigation, the
critical parameters of the system which yield convective motions are determined,
as well as the nature of these motions. The theoretical findings are tested
against experimental measurements.
