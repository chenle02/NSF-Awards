The research project addresses the formation of free surface standing wave
patterns that arise when a container of fluid is vibrated vertically. This well-
studied hydrodynamic problem represents a model system for studying pattern
formation via symmetry-breaking parametric instability. Understanding the
dynamical mechanism for the experimentally observed "superlattice patterns" is a
primary focus for much of the research. These two-dimensional wave patterns are
characterized as being spatially- periodic, with structure on two disparate
length scales. The analysis will be based on methods of equivariant bifurcation
theory. The role of normal form symmetries, and spatial/temporal resonance in
the pattern selection process will be elucidated by the analysis. Aspects of the
research project will contribute to our understanding of the effects of weak
external symmetry breaking on equivariant bifurcation problems. It will also
develop applications of some recent mathematical results on bifurcation of
periodic solutions with spatio-temporal symmetries. Finally, possible symmetry-
based methods for controlling spatio-temporal patterns will be investigated.

The research project is aimed at a basic mathematical understanding of a variety
of experimental observations of exotic wave patterns on the surface of a
vibrated liquid. The results are expected to carry over to other pattern-forming
systems of technological interest, such as magnetic fluids and nonlinear optical
systems. The research will contribute to our basic understanding of the effects
of vibration on nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom; vibration that
may be detrimental because it causes instability or useful because it suppresses
instability. The research will also address control of the nonlinear pattern-
formation process in certain hydrodynamic, nonlinear optical and chemical
reaction-diffusion systems. The training of graduate students in applied
mathematics is an integral part of the research project.
