This project aims to study systems with dipoles, e.g., atoms or molecules with
directional nonlinear electric interactions. One goal is to utilize these
nonlinear interactions to import them in a true manner between matter (e.g.,
atoms) and light (photons), and thus to make very low-intensity light nonlinear,
to apply, for example to switches or "photonic quantum information." In
addition, "superradiance" in dipole matter that allow laser-like phenomena will
be studied in very general setups that allow a multitude of systems, ranging
from atoms to spins in semiconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four areas of
education and outreach will be promoted during this project. (i) Many of the
topics attract particular interest from students, and will involve them inside
and outside the classroom. (ii) Seminars are regularly organized around the
topics. (iii) As a woman, the PI is particularly well placed to attract, and has
a history of attracting, specifically female students, and helping them to
succeed. (iv) Outreach in undergraduate institutions and through departmental
programs for even younger students. These activities will complement efforts to
build an active AMO community at the University of Connecticut.
