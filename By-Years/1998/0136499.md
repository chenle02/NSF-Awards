Summary: This proposal request support to complete a multiproxy paleoclimate
record from Cariaco Basin ODP Site 1002 to the base of the sediment section at
about 550,000 years. The study will include stable isotope and foraminiferal
census data at sample resolution of about 300 years for the entire record.
Critical intervals will be sampled at finer resolution to evaluate subcentury-
scale features. The study will be coordinated with measurements of a number of
other proxies by informal collaborators as well as a modeling effort. The
overall objective is to provide an integrated data set suitable for testing the
hypothesis that changes in tropical hydrology are a potential driver of global
climate change on millennial to Milankovich time-scales.&lt;br/&gt;
