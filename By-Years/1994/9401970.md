9401970 Krishnaswamy This project is to supply funding for the development of a
new photoelastic type shearing interferometer that is considered to be
especially useful in bimaterial systems. Interfacial cracks that develop in
bimaterial systems are inherently of the mixed-mode type which itself is
somewhat ambiguous since it involves an arbitrary length scale. The proposed
device is a combination of polariscope and a shearing interferometer which will
be used to obtain all around maps of the crack tip fields for a wide range of
material mismatch. ***
