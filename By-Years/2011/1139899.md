Decomposing leaves are an important source of energy and nutrients in many
streams. Factors that control the rate of leaf decomposition in streams may vary
between tropical and temperate regions. For example, recent studies suggest that
bacteria and fungi may be more important to leaf breakdown in tropical streams,
while aquatic insects may be more important in temperate streams. The impacts of
aquatic insects on leaf decay will be assessed in headwater streams in Puerto
Rico and in North Carolina. Microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) will be
characterized on decaying leaf material from each site, and the chemical
composition of litter will be measured as it decays. This study is part of a
larger effort to address fundamental differences in stream ecosystem processes
between temperate and tropical regions. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the
project will include advancement of the research career of an underrepresented
minority scientist, enhancement of collaborations between the Principal
Investigator and established researchers at two long term research sites, and
mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students by the Principal Investigator.
