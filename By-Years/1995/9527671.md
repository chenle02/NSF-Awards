Abstract - Ramachandran - 9527671 Trickle bed and packed bed catalytic reactors
are widely used in petroleum processing and in bulk chemical manufacturing
processes. Commercial applications include hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization
and fine chemicals manufacturing. In such systems the interactions of
hydrodynamics, mass transfer and kinetics are complex and the design of the
reactor is initiated through numerical simulation. Such simulations are useful
in optimization studies and may provide guidance in reactor selection which is
then followed by experimental testing of the most promising cases only. The
objective of this work is to develop new numerical techniques based on the
boundary integral and the dual reciprocity methods to solve such
physical/chemical problems on the particle scale and to incorporate these into
an overall reactor simulation model. The techniques that will be further
developed include the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the Dual Reciprocity
Boundary Element Method (DRM). The BEM can be used to solve partial differential
equations and its advantage is the necessity to only discretize the surface of
the object. It has been used for the study of linear diffusion reaction problems
for single reactions and networks of linear reactions. This technique permits
easy modeling when non-regular shaped catalyst particles such as trilobes,
quadrulobes, wagon wheels, etc. are used. DRM has been used in solving
2-dimensional non-linear diffusion reaction problems with partial wetting
effects. The emphasis in this work is on: (I) developing reliable a posteriori
error indicators, (ii) standardizing the basis functions for the approximation
of non-linear rate terms, (iii) developing 3-dimensional algorithms to simulate
realistic catalyst shapes, and (iv) developing efficient methods for large scale
computing of complex reaction networks.
