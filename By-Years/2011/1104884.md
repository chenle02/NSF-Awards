****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupling between electrons in
''strongly correlated materials'' is associated with many scientifically
important and technologically useful phenomena, including superconductivity,
ordered charge and spin density phases and quantum magnetism. This project will
pursue spectroscopic studies of (1) recently discovered and technologically
important superconductors from the iron-pnictide family which demonstrate high
transition temperature and high critical fields, (2) other unconventional
superconductors with competing ground states, and (3) prototypical low-
dimensional quantum spin systems relevant for studying emerging quantum
mechanical phenomena in strongly correlated materials. This project will also
provide broad training to postdoc and undergraduate students in low-temperature
high resolution magneto-optical spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****NON-
TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many newly discovered materials,
there is a particularly strong interaction between the electron charges as well
as between the magnetic moments leading to new collective behaviors such as
superconductivity or various macroscopically long ranged ordered phases of
charge and spin distributions. Understanding the unconventional behavior of
these materials with strong interactions presents a great intellectual challenge
and is critical to developing new technologies. This project will investigate
the basic mechanisms responsible for unconventional properties of these strongly
interacting materials by scattering light (i.e., "photons") from the materials
while tuning the materials' properties through their novel phases by changing
temperature and external magnetic fields. The goals of this project are to
better understand the conditions responsible for the emerging properties of
these materials: (i) explain the origin of superconductivity and other
unconventional microscopically ordered phases, (ii) to elucidate how matter
behaves under novel environmental conditions, and (iii) to develop new materials
with enhanced functional properties. Equally important for the success of the
project will be a dedicated effort to recruit talented undergraduate and
graduate students into the research group, including students belonging to
groups currently underrepresented in science. This project will also provide
diverse interactions with leading international scientists and broad training to
postdocs and students, and will be used as part of an outreach program to
interest K-12 students in the sciences via tours of the advanced laser optical
laboratory.
