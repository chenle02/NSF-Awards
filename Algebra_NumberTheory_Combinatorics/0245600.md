Abstract

Title: Asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups

The PIs propose to study asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups. The
topics include a torsion free non-amenable finitely presented group without free
non-abelian subgroups, a finitely presented infinite torsion group, Dehn
functions of groups including Dehn functions of residually finite and Metabelian
groups, isoperimetric functions of aspherical manifolds, residually finite
hyperbolic groups, structure properties of hyperbolic groups (is every torsion-
free hyperbolic group free-by-finite exponent?), n-dimensional diagram groups.

Algorithmic properties of groups have been a subject of intensive study since
the beginning of the 20th century (Dehn and Tietze). Novikov, Boone and Higman
showed deep connections between logic (especially the theory of recursive
functions) and group theory. A more recent work by Gromov and others showed a
connection between algorithmic and asymptotic properties (especially
isoperimetric and growth functions) of groups and the related topological
objects. The PIs found even more intimate connections between complexity of
algorithms and asymptotic properties of groups. In particular, they have
characterized groups whose word problem is in NP in terms of Dehn functions and
Higman embeddings, found an NP-complete group, etc.. The PIs propose to further
study these connections, and their applications to some outstanding Burnside-
type problems. In particular, they propose to use Higman embeddings to construct
finitely presented torsion groups and in the study of Dehn functions of
metabelian groups. Another direction of their research deals with connections
between geometry and structure of groups. In particular, they propose to study
the class of finite dimensional diagram groups, for dimension greater than two
which, they believe, include a large class of groups acting ``nicely" on cubical
complexes. Structural properties of hyperbolic groups will also be under
investigation.
