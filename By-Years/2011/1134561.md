1134561&lt;br/&gt;Wagner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authors propose to develop
several new capabilities of the novel Doppler Encoded Excitation Pattern (DEEP)
microscopy technique that they have recently demonstrated for wide-field
Biophotonics imaging applications. DEEP microscopy employs traveling-wave
structured illumination and a sensitive high-speed single-element detector
(instead of an imaging detector array) to sequentially probe the complex spatial
frequencies (Fourier coefficients) of the sample using either fluoresced or
scattered light. Tomographic algorithms are utilized to synthesize either an
extended depth of field (DOF) 2D or, alternatively, with additional Fourier
components a full 3D image. The authors have previously demonstrated that by
sequentially illuminating a fluorescent sample with traveling frequency-swept
sinusoidal intensity fringe patterns of diverse orientations, the DEEP technique
can be used to synthesize a 2D image of a ¡­ mm3 volume that resolves
diffraction limited wavelength-scale features, all in focus simultaneously,
thereby providing a 1000-fold increase in DOF over a conventional microscope.
Three new directions enhancing DEEP microscopy for wide-field biophotonic
imaging applications will be pursued: high-speed 3D tomographic imaging
multiplexed patterns created with crossed acoustooptic Bragg cells; using
illumination coherence gating to extend the depth of high-resolution
fluorescence imaging in strongly scattering biological tissue by utilizing
broadband light; and super-resolution DEEP imaging microscopy exploiting
fluorescence saturation. Each of these research directions will demonstrate a
novel wide-field imaging modality for studying biological processes faster,
deeper, and smaller than possible with existing techniques.
