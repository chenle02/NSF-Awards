At a time when our civil infrastructure systems are in dire need of renewal,
efforts are being made to improve maintenance procedures and condition
assessment practice. This Career development plan addresses current issues
related to infrastructure renewal. The research work is integrated into a
research and education program which revolves around topics related
infrastructure renewal engineering. As part of the research program,
performance-based prediction models for bridge deterioration will be developed.
The prediction models will track component and system parameters (such as
component capacity and system load rating) as a function of time and will be
based on the mixed quantitative and qualitative information obtained in the
field. By using case histories developed for individual bridges and isolating
parameters which relate specific causes to bridge deterioration it will be
possible to generalize the models to a set of parameters which consider bridge
type, use, and environmental conditions. The prediction model will consider
changes in structural performance due to deterioration and damage.
