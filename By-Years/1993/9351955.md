The project will modify the general chemistry course toward a foundation based
upon atomic and molecular structure on which to develop chemical concepts taught
in this course and courses that follow. Students will learn to predict chemical
behavior based on an inspection of structure with a view to identifying
electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, and with an emphasis on critical thinking,
rather than memorization. A variable- temperature, high field, proton-carbon NMR
will provide a part of the instrumental basis for this approach. Using this
instrument, students will appreciate how the structure of matter determines its
reactivity and how structure can change with time and/or temperature (kinetics
and equilibrium). The instrument will be used in general chemistry, organic
chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental methods, and
student research.
