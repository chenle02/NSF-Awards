The work described in this proposal will result in the development of a
comprehensive robust control theory and design methodology for power conversion
systems. This will be the first time that robust control techniques will be
applied techniques will be applied to feedback design of power conversion
systems with the resulting benefits of more reliable, less costly converter
designs. The work is broadly divided into the two related areas of analysis and
synthesis of power conversion feedback systems. For analysis we will identify
and implement algorithms for the computation of u, the structured singular
value. This will then allow the assessment of robust stability and robust
performance; that is, determination will be made whether stability and
performance criteria are satisfied despite variations or uncertainties in
operating conditions/parameters away from the nominal. Furthermore, the work
will result in the development of robust controller design methodologies for
power conversion systems. These methodologies will be given both single output
converters and for multi-output and multiple interconnected converter systems.
