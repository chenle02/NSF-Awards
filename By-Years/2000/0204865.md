Creating a universal, free to read, digital library containing over one million
scanned books&lt;br/&gt;with optical character recognition to support full text
searching is the goal of this million book&lt;br/&gt;project. Such a resource
furthers the democratization of knowledge by making this large
digital&lt;br/&gt;library available to scholars, students, and citizens around
the world. The availability of online&lt;br/&gt;search allows users to locate
relevant information quickly and reliably thus enhancing
student&lt;br/&gt;success in their research endeavors. This 24x7x365 resource
would also provide an excellent&lt;br/&gt;test bed for further research in
database creation, OCR technique, machine metadata creation,&lt;br/&gt;and
textual language processing research such as machine translation, summarization,
intelligent&lt;br/&gt;indexing, and information
mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation resources
would be amplified at a rate of almost twenty to one because the
countries&lt;br/&gt;of India and China will be providing the labor to digitize
these materials. In addition, members of&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. Digital Library
Federation would ship materials to be scanned and returned.
Private&lt;br/&gt;grant funding is being sought to cover shipping expenses.
