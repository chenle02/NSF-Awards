This study addresses the predictability of pile behavior installed by vibration
process, using ground penetration response and static performance of piles.
Interest in this problem is motivated by the fact that the use of vibratory
drivers can significantly increase the rate at which piles can be installed in
certain soils relative to impact hammers, with less damage to piles, but that
use in restricted by the unavailability of a utilitarian predictive model. The
proposed project will extend an ongoing experimental study to focus on a
systematic evaluation of the fundamental mechanism of the installation of piles
by vibration and to code that information in a computer program, written for the
microcomputer. The computer program will predict the behavior and static
capacity of vibrator- installed piles in sands and allow practitioners to study
the effects of the variables of the problem on driving. With increased
confidence in the predictability of pile performance offered by this study, it
is envisaged more piles at substantial savings will be driven by vibration where
subsurface conditions are appropriate.
