Nykamp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Higher-level functions, such as visual object
recognition or&lt;br/&gt;memory, emerge from interactions within the brain's
neural&lt;br/&gt;networks. The ability to determine the patterns of
connections&lt;br/&gt;among neurons would facilitate discovering how such
computations&lt;br/&gt;are performed. Because many connectivity patterns
could&lt;br/&gt;theoretically produce neural output with only subtle
differences,&lt;br/&gt;characterizing even basic circuitry elements within the
brain&lt;br/&gt;remains a formidable challenge. The goal of this project is
to&lt;br/&gt;develop and analyze mathematical models of neuronal networks
in&lt;br/&gt;order to design tools that can distinguish among
network&lt;br/&gt;configurations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated a
new&lt;br/&gt;approach that shows promise of leading to tools to
infer&lt;br/&gt;connectivity patterns in spiking neuronal networks. The key
idea&lt;br/&gt;motivating this approach is to exploit models of neural
response&lt;br/&gt;to an experimentally controlled stimulus in order to
analyze&lt;br/&gt;neuron output. The explicit structure imposed by
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models helps overcome a major difficulty in estimating
network&lt;br/&gt;connectivity from experiments: the fact that only a small
subset&lt;br/&gt;of neurons can be measured simultaneously. Hence, the
central&lt;br/&gt;challenge addressed by this project is accounting for the
effects&lt;br/&gt;of unmeasured neurons. Mathematical models lead to predictions
of&lt;br/&gt;the effects of connections from unmeasured neurons. The aim
of&lt;br/&gt;the work is to use these predictions to factor out the effects
of&lt;br/&gt;unmeasured neurons and better estimate the connectivity among
the&lt;br/&gt;measured neurons. The resulting tools help
neuroscientists&lt;br/&gt;understand local circuits that underlie neural
processing and&lt;br/&gt;function within the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
goal of this work is to develop mathematical tools
that&lt;br/&gt;neuroscientists can use to determine how neurons in the brain
are&lt;br/&gt;connected to each other. Understanding how neurons are
connected&lt;br/&gt;is an important first step toward discovering how
neurons&lt;br/&gt;communicate with each other to process information.
Such&lt;br/&gt;knowledge could help scientists better understand the effects
of&lt;br/&gt;the degradation of such connections, such as in
neurodegenerative&lt;br/&gt;diseases, and devise strategies to mitigate or
reverse these&lt;br/&gt;effects.&lt;br/&gt;
