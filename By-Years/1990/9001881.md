The principal investigator will complete the study of two- generator subgroups
of PSL(2,R). The investigation will result in a complete and unified account of
the geometric and algebraic approaches to this classification problem, as well
as a complete description of the relationship between this algebra and geometry.
The investigator will also study an extension of these methods to the complex
numbers and to several real variables. The work to be completed by the principal
investigator has as one of its ramifications the complete understanding of
tilings of the plane by tiles invariant under some sort of discrete group
action. These have been of interest to mathematicians for more than a century
and their study was recently revived by W. Thurston. Connections between this
investigation and the topology of three dimensional hypersurfaces as well as to
dynamical systems, abound.
