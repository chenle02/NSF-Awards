This U.S.-Italy award will support Professors Clifford Truesdell, Reza Malek-
Madani, and John Pierce of Johns Hopkins University to collaborate with Italian
mathematicians under the leadership of Prof. Gianfranco Capriz of the University
of Pisa. The investigators intend to work on the recent reorganization of the
mathematical foundations of continuum mechanics begun by Professor Truesdell. In
the process, they expect to solve associated problems in topology, functional
analysis, and geometric measure theory. Among the topics to be studied are
classes of solutions of Navier-Stokes equations, the formation and stability of
singularities in systems of quasilinear elliptic and parabolic differential
equations that govern the deformation of nonlinear viscous materials, the study
of equilibria for highly symmetric boundary value problems which arise in
nonlinear elasticity, and various aspects of the mathematical theory of
singularities that lend themselves to continuum mechanics and applied
mathematics. Researchers on both sides are leading experts on various aspects of
continuum mechanics and their collaboration is expected to lead to new
approaches in the field. This work is jointly supported by the Solid Mechanics
and U.S.-Italy Programs of NSF.
