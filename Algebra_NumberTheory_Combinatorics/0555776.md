ABSTRACT for the award DMS-0400386 of Stein

The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and Mazur's notion of visibility of
Shafarevich-Tate groups motivate the computational and theoretical goals of this
research project. The computational goals are to develop new algorithms, tables,
and software for studying modular forms and modular abelian varieties. The PI
hopes to create new computational tools, including a major new package for
computing with modular abelian varieties over number fields, and enhance the
modular forms database, which is used by many mathematicians who study modular
forms. The theoretical goals are to prove new theorems that relate Mordell-Weil
and Shafarevich-Tate groups of elliptic curves and abelian varieties. These
investigations into Mazur's notion of visibility, and how it links Mordell-Weil
and Shafarevich-Tate groups, may provide new insight into relationships between
different cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

Elliptic curves and modular forms play a central role in modern number theory
and arithmetic geometry. For example, Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem
by showing that the elliptic curve attached by Gerhard Frey to a counterexample
to Fermat's claim would be attached to a modular form, and that this modular
form cannot exist. Our understanding of the world of elliptic curves and modular
forms is extensive, but many questions remain unresolved. The first goal of this
project is to provide theoretical and computational tools to make modular forms
and objects attached to them very explicit, so that mathematicians can compute
with them, test their conjectures on them, and gain a better feeling for them.
The second goal is to use these tools and other ideas to gain a deeper
understanding of the conjecture of Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer about
the arithmetic of elliptic curves.
