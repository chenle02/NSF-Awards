9617783 Mark An Institute for Curriculum Selection and Implementation in K-12
Mathematics Education is established by the Education Development Center (EDC).
This institute helps districts shape their vision for a successful mathematics
education program by providing services and products - workshops, resource
guides and videos, and connections to other sources through the World Wide Web -
to help facilitate discussions and decision making among the various
stakeholders in the districts. Suitable materials are developed to facilitate
implementation, including a guide to selecting a curriculum and case studies
that examine abstract and complex issues regarding curriculum implementation in
the context of real situations. Workshops are offered for school districts at
EDC and at other sites around the country.
