The purpose of this project is to ensure continuation of UV observations at
Barrow and Summit over the period 1-August 2012 ? 31-July 2015. These data
include spectra of solar spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm,
biologically effective dose-rates, total ozone, surface albedo, cloud optical
depth, actinic flux, and photolysis rates for common reactions such as the
photolysis of O3 and NO2. All data are made available via ACADIS, WOUDC, and
NDACC. At Barrow, several key parameters affecting UV radiation such as snow
cover and sea ice extent are changing rapidly. Extension of the climate data
record (CDR) will provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of a changing
environment on UV radiation. Measurements at Summit are ideally suited to probe
the free troposphere and study the effects of long-range transport of pollutants
and aerosols on UV radiation. The key intellectual merit of the proposed project
centers on acquiring data that can be used to advance knowledge (1) of the
present and future solar radiation climate of the Arctic and (2) of the factors
that drive changes in the UV radiation. For example, by combining UV data with
other measurements and modeling, parameterizations can be developed to predict
future UV intensities and improve climate models (e.g., CCMs). Analysis of the
long UV data record from Barrow will also help answering the ?SEARCH Question?
whether the Arctic is moving to a new state. UV data are of importance for other
AON projects and augment their intellectual merit. The broader impacts of this
activity are to provide data to researchers in various disciplines, including
satellite ground truthing, and to educators for use in science courses and
curricula. The PIs intend to continue contributing to the NOAA Arctic Report
Card and integrating the data into non-major courses at the university.
