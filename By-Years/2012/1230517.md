The objective of this program is to develop actively mode-locked quantum cascade
lasers as a practical source of ultrashort pulses and frequency combs in the
mid-infrared range. The intellectual merit is to explore a novel and highly
promising approach to produce ultrashort pulses and frequency combs in the mid-
infrared range. There are currently no mode-locked semiconductor lasers
operating in this spectral region. The project will enable generation of stable,
powerful mode-locked pulses in a robust and compact setup. This work will also
lead to significant advancement in laser physics and nonlinear optics of
semiconductor nanostructures. A new operation regime and configuration of a
quantum cascade laser source will be demonstrated, studied and utilized.
Therefore, the proposed research is truly transformative and will greatly
advance the state-of-the art. The broader impacts are wide-ranging and
substantial. Mid-infrared mode-locked semiconductor lasers will be key elements
for many important applications ranging from mid-infrared remote sensing and
imaging to laser metrology, material processing, laser therapy and laser
surgery. Mode-locked quantum cascade lasers will provide a compact, robust
solution for the above applications. Educational and outreach plan is aimed at
enhancing the education and training opportunities in applied physics and
engineering. The proposed research includes both theoretical and experimental
components and is really interdisciplinary. This combination of disciplines
offers a unique educational environment for students. Knowledge and techniques
developed during research will be incorporated into courses and disseminated
through publications, technology transfer, and the research groups? websites.
Substantial outreach activity is planned.
