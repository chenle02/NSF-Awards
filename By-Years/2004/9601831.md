This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Riverside upgrade
the existing 500 MHz NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) human erythrocytes, disulfide bonds in
peptides and the interaction of peptides with heparin (2) structural studies of
vitamin D in vitamin D-protein complexes (3) determination of non-standard
nucleic acid structures (4) investigation of the roles played by low-barrier
hydrogen bonds in enzyme catalysis, and (5) structure-function relationships for
macromolecular structures of biological significance. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
