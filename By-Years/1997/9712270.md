9712270 Cockroft **** This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project
will investigate the feasibility of engineering high efficiency in phosphors
with strong near-infrared absorption that matches the requirements of the
proposer's display technology and of tuning the blue spectral @on properties by
the precise control of dopant concentrations. The development and validation of
a design model that predicts optimum dopant concentrations by solving the
dynamics of energy transfer is essential to the development of such a phosphor
for our application. In Phase I the proposers will establish and validate a
model and demonstrate an improvement in brightness and spectral properties of
the blue emission, relative to existing commercial materials, from a small
phosphor volume representative of our anticipated pixel architecture. The
proposer has developed a new electro-optic flat-panel display concept offering
significant advantages in brightness, scalability and screen flexibility over
existing flat panel display technology. Full consumer-market competitiveness of
this technology will require innovative advances in the generation of full color
emission using low cost lasers. This proposal describes a novel phosphor concept
to convert near-infrared radiation to blue emission. Potential uses of the new
spectrum for displays include industrial, business and military applications as
well as mass market electronic products like TVs, computers and video games. ***
