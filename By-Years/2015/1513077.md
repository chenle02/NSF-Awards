This project aims to create an innovative interactive visualization facility at
Wellesley College. The facility consists of combined large-scale horizontal and
vertical interactive surfaces, which support touch, pen, and tangible
interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plans for using the facility for research and
teaching activities include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on novel
interaction techniques for large-scale interactive surfaces, social media
analytics, visual programming, learning analytics for intelligent learning
interfaces, and visualization of biological, neuroscience, and chemistry
information. In particular, the facility will enable research on: 1) novel
interaction techniques for large-scale multi-surface environments; 2) new
interactive visualizations for various domains including journalism, genomics,
neuroscience, chemistry, and learning analytics; 3) understanding of how large-
scale multi-surface environments impact collaborative learning of complex
concepts; and 4) design guidelines and best-practices for large-scale multi-
surface interactive visualizations for collaborative exploration.
