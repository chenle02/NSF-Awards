9630449 Loewenberg Scholars have identified two types of voting, sincere and
tactical voting. Sincere voters vote for their most preferred party. Tactical
voters may not vote for their most preferred party to insure that their least
preferred party does not win the election. In proportional representation (PR)
systems, the proportion of seats a party wins in the national legislature is
determined by the proportion of votes the party receives. Given these rules,
scholars have assumed that voters in a PR system would always vote sincerely.
However, PR systems usually produce governments composed of a coalition of
parties. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project hypothesizes that voters in
PR systems my vote tactically to affect the composition of the governing
coalition. As part of the research design the student conducts a series of
voting experiments. Scholars have traditionally assumed that voters possessed
neither the computational ability nor the information to vote tactically in a PR
system. An experimental design provides an excellent environment to test such
specific assumptions. The results of the experiments will result in improved
theory and will generate better hypotheses. Understanding voting behavior in a
PR system is important since most established and many emerging democracies use
PR rules. ***
