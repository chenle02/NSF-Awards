The National Science Foundation (NSF) has named Dr Andrea Alù the 2015 recipient
of its Alan T. Waterman Award. This award is NSF's highest honor that annually
recognizes an outstanding researcher under the age of 35 and funds his or her
research in any field of science or engineering. This year's awardee will
receive a $1 million grant over a five-year period for further advanced study in
his field.&lt;br/&gt;Dr Alù is an engineering professor at the University of
Texas at Austin. His research focuses on man-made materials with properties not
found in nature (called metamaterials) and on the interaction of light with
matter at the nano scale (plasmonics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Alù and his team
achieved the bending of electromagnetic waves around objects, an effect named
"cloaking", which renders the object invisible. This was achieved with both a
plasmonic, as well as a mantle cloaking method. Such technologies enable the use
of sensors that can detect signals without being detected. This concept can also
be applied to acoustic, mechanical and matter waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
recently he has demonstrated non-reciprocal propagation of light or sound in
specific metamaterials and developed the concept of metamaterials that can
perform mathematical operations as light travels through them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Alù has received awards and recognition from a diverse
group of technical societies, including the Outstanding Young Engineer Award
from the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society in 2014; the Adolph Lomb
Medal from the Optical Society (OSA) in 2013; the inaugural Franco Strazzabosco
Award and the Medal of Representation of the President of the Republic of Italy
in 2013; the Young Scientist Prize in Optics from the International Union of
Pure and Applied Physics in 2013; the Early Career Investigator Award from The
International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE) in 2012; the Isaac Koga
Gold Medal from the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) in 2011 and a
CAREER award from the NSF in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Alù is a fellow of
IEEE and OSA, a full member of URSI and a senior member of SPIE. He serves on
the editorial boards of the research publications Physical Review B, Scientific
Reports and Advanced Optical Materials, and as an associate editor of five
journals, including Optics Express and the IEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation
Letters.
