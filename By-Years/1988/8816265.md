This award supports cooperative research in forest products research between T.
Kent Kirk of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Jose Vicuna of the
Catholic University in Santiago, Chile. They will undertake genetic and
biochemical studies of bacteria responsible for lignin biodegradation. Natural
bacterial strains will be sought that can metabolize low molecular weight
lignin-related substrates. Then the metabolic pathways involved in the
degradation of lignin model compounds will be identified and the enzymes which
catalyze the cleavage of intermonomeric linkages will be isolated and
characterized. Bacterial growth on lignin and their consumption of fungal
degradation products will be analyzed. Finally, a genetic library of lignolytic
strains will be constructed. This research will continue a successful
collaboration between Kirk, who has experience in lignin chemistry and Vicuna,
who has isolated several strains of lignin bacteria. Little work has been done
in South America on lignin degradation. Yet its different ecological habitats
may yield microbial strains unknown in the northern hemisphere. This work allows
the U.S. scientist to include bacterial studies in his work and will aid the
research component of the Chilean pulp and paper industry. Their different
complementary backgrounds and approaches are likely to lead to advances in pulp
bleaching, in modifying fiber properties, in converting lignin to useful
products and in waste treatment. In so doing the project fulfills the goals of
the Science in Developing Countries Program.
