Ophiolites represent obducted slabs of ocean crust, and as such offer the
possibility of insights into ocean crust formation. The Josephine ophiolite
represents one of the largest and most intact ophiolites in the world. This
project will investigate in detail recently discovered low angle faults that may
represent low angle detachment faults that were active during initial slow-
spreading mid-ocean ridge activity. The geometry and spreading structure
associated with such detachment faults can not be easily obtained from ocean
drilling, and can best be developed from ophiolite examples. Results will be
applicable to several important subjects including how lithosphere forms at slow
spreading centers.
