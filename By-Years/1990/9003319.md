This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Robert J.
McMahon at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The investigation will focus on
molecular rearrangements of reactive molecular species and will result in an
improved understanding of the fundamental processes by which chemical reactions
occur. The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. McMahon will involve a
systematic study of intramolecular hydrogen migration in electron deficient
organic intermediates and isolobal, organometallic analogs. Low-temperature
matrix isolation techniques will be employed to establish rearrangement pathways
and to characterize intermediate species by spectroscopic methods. Experiments
will be designed to probe the roles of spin-multiplicity, orientation, distance,
and thermodynamic driving force for the rearrangements.
