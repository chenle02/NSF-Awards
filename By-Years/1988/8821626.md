This activity arises from the common interest of six faculty members at the
Florida Institute of Technology in computers with advanced architectures which
enable vector and parallel processing, and in developing attendant mathematical
software to run on them. The target machines for this work are at the Argonne
National Laboratory and the Cornell Supercomputer Center. The areas in which
software development for parallel computers are proposed: (1) Scheduling
Problems for Multiprocessors (2) Ordinary Differential Equations, Boundary Value
and Eigenvalue Problems (3) Parallel Versions of Certain Linear Algebra
Algorithms (4) Monte Carlo Algorithms for Problems in Partial Differential
Equations (5) Multigrid Methods in Computational Fluid Dynamics. These research
activities are expected to stimulate undergraduates' interest in this popular
area of research and attact them into further graduate study.
