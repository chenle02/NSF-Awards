This research involves the development of improved methods for automatic
processing of text documents. The research focuses in particular on two specific
text-handling problems: lossless data compression and classification. Lossless
data compression is useful for reducing storage and transmission requirements
for large text documents. It is also an important step in sending text securely
via cryptography. Classification arises frequently in web search problems and
also in forensics, where the goal is to determine the authorship of an anonymous
document.

The approach is to draw new insights into these problems by using a novel
asymptotic regime in information theory, which more accurately models real text
sources than classical models do. Specfically, the investigators consider a
regime in which the size of the data set and the source alphabet are comparably
large. It can be shown that most classical information theory techniques fail in
this "rare-events" regime. Nonetheless, new techniques can be developed that are
tailored to this regime that yield new algorithms and insights.
