The use of short-pulse lasers has generated new techniques to fabricate
sophisticated microstructures and to synthesize advanced materials. These
techniques have made tremendous impacts on the microelectronics industry. To
improve the design and quality control of these techniques, a research plan is
proposed to gain understanding of energy deposition and transport during short-
pulse laser-material interactions and in microstructures. The work will develop
more appropriate macroscopic models for energy deposition and transport
processes by characterizing microscopic transport and interactions of energy
carriers (e.g. electrons and phonons). Experimental investigation of sub-
picosecond laser heating will also be carried out. The objective of the research
program is to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental heat transfer
mechanisms in different time scale regimes and to establish analytical framework
for modelling fast laser heat of complex microsctructures.
