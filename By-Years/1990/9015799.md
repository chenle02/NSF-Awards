This award supports cooperative research in field theory between Dr. Henrik
Aratyn of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. A. H. Zimerman of the
Sao Paulo State University (UNESP) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Important progress in
modern field theory is presently being achieved in the case of models possessing
huge amounts of symmetry. These models are important for understanding two-
dimensional effective gravity as well as related issues of off-critical string
theory and conformal field theories. New advances in understanding of such
models seems to require application of geometrical methods to investigate models
with infinite dimensional symmetry groups. The method is based on a fundamental
geometrical idea that the orbits associated to the symmetry groups constitute a
physically relevant phase space. In this framework the investigators will study
several models which possess the infinite dimensional gauge groups and analyze
the consequences of these huge degrees of symmetries in the quantum mechanical
setting. The main part of the work will be performed during mutual visits to the
University of Illinois at Chicago and to the Instituto de Fisica Teorica-UNESP,
Sao Paulo, Brazil.
