9310065 Scroggs The brain receives input about the environment from signals
coming in through the sensory systems. The brain also has mechanisms that
modulate those afferent input systems, and one example of such phenomena is the
suppression of pain signals during emergencies that activate the "fight or
flight" responses. Suppression of pain information may be achieved by nerve
cells in the brain releasing neurotransmitters such as serotonin and
norepinephrine to bathe cells down in the spinal cord where the nerves enter
that carry pain information. It is not understood how these substances may
selectively inhibit pain without also inhibiting other important sensory inputs
that use the same transmitter molecules. This work uses anatomical tracing
techniques to identify the source of input (skin, joints, muscles) and the
central targets in the spinal cord of single neurons, and electrophysiology and
pharmacology to determine how the important transmembrane channels in these
identified individual nerve cells are affected by these transmitters. Discovery
of how various types of sensory neurons have differential sensitivity to these
two neurotransmitters will advance our understanding of how the brain controls
its own input, and so will have an impact on all sensory neuroscience, in
addition to providing a basis for potential applications toward developing
medicines with selective effects on different sensory pathways. ***
