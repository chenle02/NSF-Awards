This project aims to provide the first global-scale constraints on temperature
and dynamics of the free- troposphere- which comprises altitudes ranging from
about 2 - 18 km. Specifically, the researcher will use new isotopic measurements
and 3 Dimensional (3D) global modeling to reconstruct and interpret high-
altitude atmospheric temperature and circulation changes during the last
deglaciation (18,000 to 8,000 years before present). This project will use an
emerging tracer from ice-core records to generate a paleo-temperature record
that will reveal the state of the troposphere and its interaction with the
stratosphere across the most recent major climate transition in Earth history.
Research goals include constraining the thermal evolution of the free
troposphere during a time period that includes several episodes of abrupt
climate change; testing modeled free-troposphere responses to orbital and
greenhouse-gas forcing; and testing stratosphere-to- troposphere exchange
dynamics across major climate transitions. This combined measurement-modeling
study will constrain the paleoclimate at altitude during the most recent major
episode of global change, when circulation patterns shifted under different
climatic boundary conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader
Impacts include developing a new temperature record of the free troposphere
during the last deglaciation. The application of a new isotopic tracer to
investigate the dynamics of stratosphere-troposphere exchange is potentially
transformative for paleoclimate research. Other broader impacts include
participation of the researchers in STEM outreach events as part of their
ongoing activities, including participation in the departmentâ€™s annual Earth Day
at Rice University with the Girl Scouts. The project will train one
undergraduate and two graduate students, and support two early career
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
