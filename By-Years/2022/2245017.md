Whether three-dimensional incompressible flows develop singularities in finite
time and whether (weak) solutions of Navier-Stokes equations are unique, are two
of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics. Any progress
towards resolving these problems would have significant implications for the
entire field. This project integrates theoretical proofs, numerical analysis,
and machine learning for understanding singularities in fluids. Our recent
investigations demonstrate that intersection between mathematical proofs and
deep learning offers an exciting avenue for understanding how singularity occurs
in fluids. Together, the five PIs encompass strengths in several areas such as
mathematical analysis, numerical simulation, or computer-assisted proofs. In
addition, the project will foster collaborations and increased interactions
between the researchers at several leading research universities in the US,
utilizing tools developed in one field to advance another, and promote learning
and training of students and postdoctoral researchers with a goal of broadening
the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups in the
mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will focus on three specific
projects: (1) non-uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier Stokes
equations in 3 dimensions, (2) formation of singularities for solutions of the
three-dimensional Euler equations, and (3) optimization of physics-informed
neural networks (PINN). Students, postdoctoral fellows, and visitors will be
actively involved in these collaborations. To promote these exchanges research
workshops will be organized once a year at the PIsâ€™ institutions. These meetings
will have two main objectives: a training objective, involving lectures to
disseminate current ideas and progress; and an annual meeting of the PIs to
review the progress and plan future steps. The PIs will also organize a summer
school at Princeton University, aimed at graduate students and advanced
undergraduate students. The summer school will have a scientific component,
including minicourses on the mathematics of fluids, and a mentorship component,
including a round table discussion regarding careers in mathematics and a women
in mathematics panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
