DNA primase catalyzes the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides that DNA
polymerase . (pol .) then elongates. Relatively little is known about how the
two enzymes function together. The primary goal of these studies is to
understand how primase and pol . function together to initiate synthesis of a
new DNA strand. Synthetic oligonucleotides of defined sequence will be used to
determine what features in DNA are important for primer synthesis at a given
site, and how varying the base composition affects the kinetic parameters.
Isotope trapping experiments will be used to examine DNA binding and the nature
of a rate limiting step during primer synthesis. The role of primase is to
synthesize RNA primers that pol . can then elongate. The structural features of
the primase synthesized primers that are important for recognition by pol . will
be determined. Primer length, the 5'-triphosphate, 3'-terminal nucleotide and
composition (RNA vs DNA) will be examined. Recognition will be examined both by
steady-state kinetic techniques and by trapping experiments. Pol .: primase
likely interacts with a large number of proteins in vivo. These studies will be
extended to examine how auxiliary proteins that have been implicated in DNA
replication affect the catalytic properties of pol .: primase.
