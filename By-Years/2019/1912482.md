A class of bacteria called methanotrophs can convert methane to other compounds.
Methane is the principle component of natural gas and a byproduct of oil
drilling. It is also a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The
removal of methane from the atmosphere has an important role to play in
maintaining our environment. Methanotrophs could also be modified to produce
valuable products. This project is designed to identify the best way to modify
methanotroph metabolism to produce fuels and products from methane. This project
will also engage undergraduates in research. In addition, hands-on activities to
enhance science literacy will be developed and delivered to a local elementary
school, preparing them for STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methanotrophs have great potential for both control of
methane emissions and methane valorization. Their metabolism is strongly
affected by a number of environmental parameters, especially the bioavailability
of copper and rare earth elements. These metals control the activity of key
enzymes involved in methane transformation. A fundamental, mechanistic
understanding how these metals affect methanotrophic physiology and gene
expression must be developed. In this project, a suite of molecular and modeling
techniques will be pursued to delineate how these metals control methanotrophic
metabolism, and then targeted genes will be knocked out/knocked in to enhance
the re-direction of carbon to desired end products, e.g., poly-hydroxyalkanoates
(for bioplastic production) and methanol (for biofuel production). Thus, the
overall goal of this project is to measure and model the
transcriptome/metabolome of methanotrophs to develop lucrative strategies for
methane capture and valorization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
