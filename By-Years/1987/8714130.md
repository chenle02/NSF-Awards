From the outset, Vaughn Jones' success, in 1981, of obtaining an index theory
for Type II1 subfactors was recognized as a significant advance in the theory of
operator algebras. What was not foreseen, however, is the remarkable impact that
this theory has had on other branches of mathematics, particularly on knot
theory. The operator algebraic setting for Jones' work has revolutionized knot
theory through the generalizations of the Alexander polynomial Jones and other
authors have obtained. More recently, numerous mathematicians have begun to
recognize Jones' index theory as a powerful tool in mathematical physics and
even in mathematical biology. This conference, with Professor Jones giving a
series of ten lectures, will record the advances that have been made to date,
indicate the connections that have developed among various branches of
mathematics as a direct result of index theory for subfactors, and explore the
fascinating applications being considered in various fields by numerous
mathematicians and scientists.
