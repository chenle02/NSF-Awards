MEMS designers would like more functionality on a chip, akin to the VLSI
technology comprising of hundreds of thousands of components on a chip, but they
are currently handicapped with the limited design tools for Bio-MEMS design. A
structured design methodology for Bio-MEMS can address many of the challenges
currently facing Bio-MEMS design. The objective of this research is to develop
analysis and design tools for device, reduced-order, and circuit modeling of
Bio-MEMS for structured design of Bio-MEMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives
of device modeling are to develop mathematical models to include all significant
microscopic effects in Bio-MEMS, develop fast and efficient scattered point and
mixed-regime techniques for mixed-domain analysis of bio-fluidic devices. The
objective of reduced-order modeling is to represent the device by a low-order
model that can capture the functional behavior. Low-order models based on a
weighted snap shot approach will be developed to capture multiple time scales
encountered in Bio-MEMS. By identifying several Bio-fluidic components, that
could form the basic building blocks for complex Bio-MEMS on a chip, and
developing reduced-order models for these building blocks, circuit models will
be developed to design large-scale biointegrated circuits on a chip.&lt;br/&gt;
