The University of South Carolina continues operating a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site provides chemical engineering
undergraduate students with experiences in areas related to materials research.
Eight undergraduates are recruited every year for a ten-week summer research
experience. Students conduct team research in one of four areas: inorganic
materials as catalysts and adsorbents, materials for power sources, materials
for biological and medical applications, and polymer composites. In addition to
research activities, students participate in group activities that include tours
of industrial sites, participant-led laboratory tours, workshops on graduate
studies and ethics in research, and a final research
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
