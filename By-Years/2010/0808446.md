Unrelated organisms inhabiting similar environments often exhibit strikingly
similar morphologies. Many members of the Order Cypriniformes (carp-like fishes)
exhibit similar morphological adaptations for benthic life in fast flowing
rivers (rheophilic). Due to their highly modified morphologies, evolutionary
relationships of some benthic rheophiles, and members of the Indoburmese genus
Psilorhynchus in particular, are unknown. This study will complete a
phylogenetic analysis for Cypriniformes based on morphological and molecular
data to discover evolutionary relationship of the enigmatic Psilorhynchus. The
resulting hypothesis will be used to investigate evolutionary origins of a
benthic rheophilic lifestyle within Cypriniformes and the origin of
Psilorhynchus in the context of the biogeographic history of the Indoburmese
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide graduate training for co-
PI Conway in molecular phylogenetic techniques and expose undergraduate students
to morphological techniques and phylogenetic methodology. This project will
foster a greater appreciation and understanding of morphological adaptations
associated with life in fast flowing water. Data generated in this study will be
deposited in online databases for public access.
