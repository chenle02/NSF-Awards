In this project the principal investigator will study problems in the theory of
analytic functions of several complex variables. In particular, he will look at
the following questions in regard to one-dimensional subvarieties having thin
ends: uniqueness, complex tangents, boundary accessibility and the relationship
of harmonic measure to linear measure. Further areas of study include function-
theoretic hulls of graphs in complex three-space, the boundary behavior of
analytic maps, and the finding of disks in certain polynomial hulls in two-
space. The theory of functions of several complex variables is a difficult
subject in which one's intuition derived from the theory of functions of a
single complex variable is often of little help and sometimes even misleading.
The principal investigator of this project approaches problems in several
complex variables from the point of view of what is called "geometric measure
theory". This theory will enable him to continue his important work in the
behavior of analytic functions near boundaries and in the convexity of spaces of
analytic functions.
