With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jaeger will develop and
evaluate strategies for stabilizing and destabilizing vesicle bilayer membranes.
The resultant strategies can be applied in chemical reagent storage and release.
Objectives of the proposed studies include: (i) synthesis and characterization
of new cleavable surfactants, (ii) characterization of derived vesicles, (iii)
determination of cleavage rates for surfactants in vesicle form, and (iv)
studies of vesicle entrapment and release. %%% Vesicles (liposomes) are
spherical or ellipsoidal single- and multicompartment closed bilayer structures
formed by dispersion in water of double-chain synthetic and naturally occurring
surfactants. The ability of vesicles to entrap hydrophilic and hydrophobic
compounds in their aqueous compartments and inhydrocarbon bilayers,
respectively, has led to intense interest in their use as devices for a number
of applications, including chemical reagent storage and release. Enhancements of
vesicular storage and release capabililties arise from bilayer membrane
stabilization and destabilization, respectively. In this project, methods for
chemically triggering the destruction of vesicles to release their contents will
be explored.
