Based on recent data collected on the continental shelf near Delaware Bay,
development of process models to understand the interaction between large
weakly-stratified estuaries and the adjacent shelf is proposed. Research will
focus on the mean structure of currents that result from coupling, the
variations caused by wind stress, variable buoyancy, and current instability,
and interaction between the mean and tidal currents.
