This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop sex pheromone-based techniques for monitoring, mass trapping, and mating
disruption of the soybean aphid. Since its first appearance in North America,
infestations of the newly invasive soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, have
continued to cause a significant soybean yield loss due to either direct feeding
damage or the vectoring of plant viruses by the aphid. In 2003, the total
acreage with soybean aphid infestation was estimated at over 8 million, with
yield loss ranging from 32% - 45% in the three biggest soybean growing states in
the U.S. (Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota). This project will investigate novel
suppression strategies to reduce populations of this pest, thereby reducing the
size of the subsequent populations feeding on soybeans.

The commercial application of this project will be to manage aphids in the
soybean crop. The research aims to increase knowledge of the chemical ecology of
aphids, as well as provide a new understanding of how to use these novel aphid
sex pheromone-based control strategies most effectively. This will help growers
in the U.S., the world's largest soybean exporting country, to improve crop
quality and yield at a minimal cost for soybean aphid management, thereby
increasing their competitiveness in the world market.
