Using the frequent crossings of the Drake Passage by the RV/AS Gould as USAP
supply ship to Palmer Station, UCSD researchers will continue the collection of
upper ocean XBTs (expendable Bathythermograph for depth, temperature) and XTCD
(expendable temperature, conductivity and depth profiler) salinity data in this
natural chokepoint for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). This will
continue to yield hydrographic observations on seasonal to interannual
timescales, and on spatial scales ranging from the current core to mesoscale
eddies. These high-resolution, multi-repeat transects and depth profiles (up to
12-16 crossings per year) are quality controlled, archived and made available to
the broader community in order to facilitate study of the modes of variability
of the ACC, the dominant surface ocean current on the planet.

The Drake Passage XBT/XCTD transect time series now extends back to 1996, and
continues to add to a number of key quantitative estimates of the long term
trends in Southern Ocean fronts, surface water mass properties, their response
to atmospheric forcing on climate relevant time scales, and their roles in
driving the meridional overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean.
