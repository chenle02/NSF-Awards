As part of its nuclear reactions in its core, the sun produces neutrinos.
Neutrinos are electrically neutral particles that interact only very rarely with
matter. Once produced, they pass through the sun and fly off into space. The
Principal Investigator (PI) of this proposal intends to measure the solar
neutrino flux on earth, making use of new fast counting equipment and of
chlorine, which becomes excited when absorbing neutrinos and thereby allows the
measurement of the rate of solar neutrino absorption. This is a classic neutrino
experiment that the PI has been conducting for about two decades in the
Homestake Gold Mine. The ultimate goal of this experiment is to understand the
current differences between the measured and theoretically predicted solar
neutrino flux.
