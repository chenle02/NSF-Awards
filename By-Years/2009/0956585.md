This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Thomas Thompson, a 274? general purpose Global research vessel operated by the
University of Washington as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The instrumentation proposed will
improve the quality and reliability of measurements and provide enhanced
operational capabilities to projects that are embarked upon the Thompson.
Specifically, the proposal is to obtain and install A) a Kongsberg EM 302 swath
multibeam echo sounder system ? an upgrade from their existing EM 300 system;
and B) a Bell BGM-3 gravimeter available through the WHOI-managed gravimeter
pool.

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
