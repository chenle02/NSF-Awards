HRD 03-27944 The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) uses an "end-to-end"
membership model, reaching from teenagers through senior corporate executives,
to implement mechanisms that work to increase the number of Black engineers.
NSBE encourages the development of mentoring relationships that help students to
excel academically, succeed professionally, and have positive impact on the
community through culturally responsible practices. The outcomes to date include
20% growth in the targeted population since 1999.
