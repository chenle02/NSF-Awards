The project will develop a two-year (24 month) program for college students who
have completed either the sophomore or junior year with a concentration in
science. An initial summer is designed to provide an introduction to the
foundations of education and schooling and will be followed by a 6-7 week
assignment in a camp or other non-school setting for adolescents. A capstone
two-semester integrated science course will be developed for the first year
which includes concepts in astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics.
The program will include a pro-seminar providing a format for the study of
middle school methodology, instructional materials, and curriculum. It will also
include field placement. Two special science materials courses, a
computer/technology course and continuous professional studies with field
components complete the program. Students will be paired with Mentor Teachers
for the entire final year. The project is co-directed by a science educator and
a research scientist. It is supported by a staff of middle school teachers on
leave, faculty from the university's science departments, and a distinguished
panel of advisors and consultants.
