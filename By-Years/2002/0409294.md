An Integrated Micromechanics Approach to Physics-based Modeling of Deformation
and Failure of Superelastic Materials

P. Papadopoulos and R.O. Ritchie

The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated experimental,
theoretical and computational description of the deformation, fracture and
cyclic fatigue behavior of polycrystalline superelastic/shape-memory alloys.

Intellectual Merit: The proposed work seeks to characterize the mechanical
behavior of a complex textured material that undergoes a series of solid-solid
phase transitions, which crucially affect its multiaxial stress-strain response
and its fatigue characteristics. The intellectual merit of the research stems
from the challenging questions that it addresses and from the integrated nature
(experiments, theory, computing) of the proposed methodologies.

Broader Impact: Superelastic alloys are experiencing an explosive growth in use,
mostly in biomedical devices, but also in a number of other civilian and
military applications. As an example, the cardiovascular stent industry in 2003
is estimated at 5 billion dollars per year in the US alone and superelastic Ni-
Ti alloys are fast becoming the principal material for these stents. At the same
time, there exist significant uncertainties regarding the mechanical response of
such alloys, especially under multiaxial loading and cyclic fatigue. The
proposed research intends to address these uncertainties, thus contributing to
the safer and more rational use of these materials in engineering practice.
