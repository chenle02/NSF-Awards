9529813 MacCready In this project, the PI will study the circulation ACROSS the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current, estimated to be about 1/3 as large as the
circulation OF the ACC. It is hypothesized to be due to wind forcing. This study
will investigate the sensitivity of the meridional circulation, both in strength
and depth distribution, to aspects of the forcing, specificially to differences
in wind stress, buoyancy flux, bottom topography, and source-water availability,
using an existing, eddy-resolving, shallow-water equation numerical model,
formulated as a series of isopycnal layers.
