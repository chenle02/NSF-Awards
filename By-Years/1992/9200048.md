This award provides funds to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology
to continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The
program consists of an intensive "hands-on" laboratory research experience
individualized for each student and performed under the guidance of working
scientists expert in many of the traditional and modern areas of biological
sciences. The program is designed to provide students with their first exposure
to the actual practice of scientific research in the hopes that the excitement,
challenge and creativity of the enterprise will convince them to consider basic
research in the sciences as a viable career choice. In the spring, each student
is matched with a basic research project initially proposed by a preceptor with
an active research program in the students stated area of interest. Upon
acceptance, each student is provided with a reading list of current publications
in the selected area to provide the background required for the proposed summer
research project. During the program students are 1) acquainted with current
issues in biological research; 2) provided with the opportunity to learn and
practice valuable scientific techniques and skills, many of which can be
utilized in future endeavors; 3) guided in shaping the specific research
questions to be asked in each project; 4) required to work independently toward
these research goals; 5) encouraged in cross disciplinary approaches to their
projects by providing opportunities for interaction with other students and the
whole of the research staff at the Foundation; and 6) provided an educational
setting which is maximally challenging and thus, fosters exploration of future
career choices in science. In addition to the required written report detailing
the progress made in their individual research projects, each student presents a
short oral report to the faculty and public summarizing of the results of their
efforts at a closing minisymposium and award ceremony.
