The goal of this project is to provide interior and apparel design and
merchandising undergraduate students, predominantly women, with a
technologically superior, science-based education. To accomplish this goal, the
Department of Design, Housing, and Merchandising (DHM) has redesigned the
curriculum. For the science-based curriculum, new laboratory facilities are
being used to teach science principles and to integrate textile testing of
interiors and apparel products with coursework in product design, prototype
production, and product testing and evaluation. A Computer Aided Product Testing
Laboratory (CAPT Lab) has been developed to teach science concepts and to apply
those concepts to major specific subject matter. Non-science-majors are
increasing their intellectual science base and applying science-based critical
thinking and problem solving to professional decision making. The project is
significant because of its innovative use of an intellectual science
underpinning and advanced technology to integrate product design with
undergraduate laboratory research to explain product performance and product
failure. Other universities have developed computer facilities or textile
testing classes, but have not designed a curriculum that integrates computer
design, prototype production, and product testing into the total educational
experience. Major instruments include computer systems, textile product testing
equipment, and industrial sewn product production equipment. Computer and
mathematical applications include the statistical analysis of test results. Test
results are linked to science-based explanations used to predict product
performance. Product testing applications include testing tensile strength, dye
stability, compression, resiliency, flammability, and soil resistance.
