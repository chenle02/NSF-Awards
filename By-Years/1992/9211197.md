Mammalian cells are subjected to a wide variety of shearing, stretching, and
deforming forces during their growth in large scale bioreactors, artificial
tissue structures, and in native tissue structures. Mechanical forces can deform
cellular structures, causing generation of intracellular messengers, alterations
to metabolism, and cell-cycle transition. The goal of this project is to
quantify the extent and regulation of cellular function by physical deformation
of membrane/cytoplasm structures.
