This proposal advocates the research and development of tools and
techniques&lt;br/&gt;to detect, diagnose, and correct network faults in local
broadcast domains,&lt;br/&gt;whether they are wired (Ethernet) or wireless
(802.11b). These tools will&lt;br/&gt;provide the troubleshooter with a useful
visual reference for these network&lt;br/&gt;domains and automate element-by-
element investigation of performance along a&lt;br/&gt;network path. In
addition, the wireless work will provide a standard&lt;br/&gt;authentication
platform for both IPv4 and IPv6 wireless clients.&lt;br/&gt;
