The investigator studies problems in enumerative combinatorics
&lt;br/&gt;related to permutations, symmetric functions, and lattice paths.
&lt;br/&gt;One of the investigator's approaches is to apply Richard
&lt;br/&gt;Stanley's theory of P-partitions and its generalizations to the
&lt;br/&gt;study of descent algebras of symmetric and related groups.
&lt;br/&gt;Several other problems related to the enumeration of permutations
&lt;br/&gt;by descents are also studied. The investigator also studies a
&lt;br/&gt;generalization of two-stack-sortable permutations leading to a
&lt;br/&gt;symmetric-function refinement of the formula of West (proved by
&lt;br/&gt;Zeilberger) for counting these permutations, and several problems
&lt;br/&gt;involving the enumeration of lattice
paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enumerative combinatorics involves counting
mathematical objects &lt;br/&gt;with given properties. It has applications to
computer science, &lt;br/&gt;physics, and chemistry, as well as to other areas
of mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;such as algebra, probability and statistics,
topology, analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and number theory. The investigator's long-range
goal is to &lt;br/&gt;develop, extend, and systematize the methods of
enumerative &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, and the problems studied will contribute
towards &lt;br/&gt;this goal.&lt;br/&gt;
