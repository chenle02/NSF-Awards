9505485 Keen The proposed conference is in the area of complex analysis. The
planned conference inaugurates a series of conferences, The Bers Colloquium, to
be held triannually, whose theme will be a topic in the Ahlfors-Bers
mathematical tradition. Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers have worked on value
distribution theory, Teichmuller space, complex dynamics, and other areas of
function theory; have had a significant impact on the modern development of one
variable complex function theory. Ahlfors and Bers can be regarded as founding
members of the modern theory of functions of one complex variable, and the
proposed conference is a celebration of their mathematical heritage.
