The ability to adapt behavioral response to environmental cues is critical for
survival and requires learning to associate a given cue with a given consequence
so that an appropriate response can be made. The extinction of Pavlovian fear
conditioning is a commonly used model of associative learning in which an animal
must learn that a neutral stimulus (tone) that was previously paired with an
aversive stimulus (footshock) no longer predicts the aversive stimulus. Rather
than erase fear memory, extinction is thought to form a new memory that signals
safety. Activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for the
recall of fear extinction memory. In this project investigators from two Puerto
Rican institutions will combine their expertise in slice recording and neural
systems of fear learning to examine the intrinsic cellular mechanisms that
mediate the extinction-induced enhancement of mPFC activity. The investigators
will use a multidisciplinary approach combining in vitro patch-clamp
electrophysiology, histology, in vivo single neuron recordings, behavioral
training, and in vitro and in vivo neuropharmacology.

The investigators expect to demonstrate that extinction training enhances the
intrinsic excitability of mPFC neurons, that metabotropic glutamate receptor
subtype 5 (mGluR5) controls the intrinsic excitability in mPFC neurons, and that
the stimulation of mGluR5 receptors in vivo augments the recall of extinction
memory. The results of this study will provide important groundwork for
understanding how extinction memory is encoded at the level of single neurons.

This project creates a unique opportunity for Puerto Rican graduate and
undergraduate students to learn a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach
to science. Students in both laboratories will be involved in the project and
will present their results at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meetings.
