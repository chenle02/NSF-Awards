Processes of erosion, entrainment, and deposition at the beds of glaciers
govern the supply of debris available for subglacial modification, and thus,
play an important role in the evolution of subglacially sculpted topography. In
addition, deformation of subglacial debris directly influences the dynamics of
many glaciers and ice sheets. Despite the strong motivation for studying the
physics of interactions between concentrated debris, ice, and glacier beds, no
laboratory experiments under well controlled, realistic conditions have been
conducted. We propose a series of experiments in which conditions at the bed of
a temperature glacier will be closely simulated. In some experiments, a rock bed
slid beneath a fixed block of temperate ice that contains dense arrays of rock
particles. Our goals will be to simulate glacial abrasion and debris
comminution, and to demonstrate the conditions under which basal melt-out and
entrainment of debris occur. Experiments to date indicate that these processes
are strongly affected by the tendency for ice to penetrate and flow through
debris by regelation. To better understand this process regelation of ice
through till will be idealized in other experiments by pushing ice through a
three-dimensional array of spheres. Results will be compared with predictions of
an existing regelation theory, which we will modify by including the important
effect of solutes on thermal gradients. In both series of experiments, all
pertinent glaciological variables will be monitored, including ice and bed
temperature, basal melt rate, and effective pressure. These experiments will
held fill a conspicuous void in the study of glacial geologic processes.
