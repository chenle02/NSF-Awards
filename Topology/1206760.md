One aim of the project is to complete the quasi-isometric classification of
3-manifold groups, on which the PI and Behrstock made very significant progress
over the last five years. Another is to use new methods to study singularities
of complex surfaces. In particular, the important role of bilipschitz geometry
in revealing fine invariants has become clear through work of the PI, Birbrair,
and Pichon. The PI will extend their recent bilipschitz classification of inner
metric of complex surface germs to the outer metric, and apply this to such
long-standing problems as the relationship between Lipschitz and Zariski
equisingularity and the conjectured dualities between intersection homology and
analytically based cohomology theories. A start will be also be made on
extending the approach also to higher dimensions and sets in o-minimal
structures. The PI will also continue studies related to the Casson invariant
conjecture, a concrete formulation of a looser question originally asked by Sir
Michael Atiyah, postulating links, motivated out of physics, between topological
invariants related to topological quantum field theories and analytical
invariants in algebraic geometry. At the other end of the spectrum, for
hyperbolic manifolds there are also postulated connections between geometric,
arithmetic, representation-theoretic and quantum based invariants of manifolds,
which the PI and his students have made progress on and on which the PI will
continue to work.

Quasi-isometric and bilipschitz geometry, which allows a limited amount of
deformation, provides a framework in which geometries which would otherwise
depend on choices become unique. This framework is useful both in the large,
e.g., for the geometric study of universal covers of compact manifolds, where it
connects geometry/topology with geometric group theory, and in the small, where
it is the natural framework for the study of the local geometry of algebraic
sets. In both situations three-dimensional manifolds play an important role.
Moreover, through invariants of manifolds one has interactions of low
dimensional topology with algebra, number theory, and theoretical physics. Using
these approaches the project addresses long-term open theoretical questions that
span different areas of mathematics. Links between disparate areas provide much
of the power of mathematics, and strengthening these links increases the power.
