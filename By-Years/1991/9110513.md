Conservation and management of species whose habitats are diminishing require
an understanding of endocrinological and behavioral factors that lead to
successful reproduction. Since 1983, Dr. Boersma has been studying such a
species in Argentina and has identified some 5,000 individuals. She has found
that when two individuals establish a long-term pair bond, their reproductive
success is significantly greater. Little is understood about how this increased
success is achieved. With the help of her graduate student, Mr. Fowler, and Dr.
Wingfield, a world renown field endocrinologist, hormone changes will be
determined across two full breeding seasons. They will examine the relationship
between age, pair-status, hormone profile, and how these factors interact to
influence reproductive success. Utilizing these behavioral and endocrinological
techniques will help to understand the mechanisms whereby established pairs of a
long-lived species produce a higher number of offspring. These data will not
only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of physiology but has the enormous
potential of directly influencing the management programs underlying
conservation and restoration of biological diversity.
