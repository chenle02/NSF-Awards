This project involves a program of research in the intersections of ergodic
theory and additive combinatorics. Most of the problems are within ergodic
theory and are related to the analysis of the long-term behavior of systems
whose dynamics are too complicated or too chaotic to be understood locally. The
research component of the project builds on the principal investigator's results
of the past few years in multiple recurrence and convergence and, in particular,
on the new unerstanding these results have provided on the role of certain
systems (nilsystems) in the analysis. This area of ergodic theory has strong
relations to problems in additive combinatorics and harmonic analysis. The
project will continue to explore these deep links, developing the applications
of ergodic theory to such areas.

The outreach portion of the project involves conference organization, mentoring,
advising, and development of new courses. The principal investigator has been
actively involved in education of researchers in fields with links to ergodic
theory and will continue to do so, primarily by organizing interdisciplinary
meetings. Ergodic theory is an area of mathematics in which probability and
dynamical systems meet. As such, it is relevant to the mathematical modeling of
many phenomena that arise in the physical sciences, engineering, and economics.
