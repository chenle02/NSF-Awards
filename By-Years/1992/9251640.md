The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a near infrared spectrophotometer for
use in a new senior level course in process analytical chemistry. Undergraduate
chemists and chemical engineers work together as a team to solve realistic
problems in a simulated process environment to understand the mechanisms by
which the chemical industry seeks to maximize efficiency and output while
minimizing production costs and waste. The students explore such topics as
sampling in the industrial environment, chemometrics and the design of flow
systems for online analyses.
