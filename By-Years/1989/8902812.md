The principal investigator will continue his study of spatial statistics. In
particular he will develop inferential techniques for problems that are
inherently spatial, but which also have a temporal component. It is this class
of hybrid problems that promises to be highly relevant to many diverse fields of
science. Three specific problems will be addressed: (1) spatial and temporal
linear prediction based on minimizing mean-square error, (2) dynamic space-time
modeling of marked point patterns, (3) tumor growth modeling based on random
sets. There are several substantive disciplines that could benefit from the
results of this study, e.g., ecology, hydrology, mining engineering, geography,
microbiology.
