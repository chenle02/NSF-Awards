Array (BIMA) is a millimeter-wave interferometer presently made up of 9 six-
meter diameter antennas; at least two other antennas will be added to the array
during the next 5 years. located at Berkeley's Hat Creek Radio Observatory, BIMA
was jointly capitalized and is jointly operated by the University of California
at Berkeley, the University of Illinois and the University of Maryland through a
combination of NSF and State funding. These awards are for identical proposals
submitted simultaneously by each institution, and support astronomical research,
technological development and student training carried out at the BIMA array.
Astronomical research at BIMA includes high resolution studies of solar system
objects, stellar envelopes, star-forming regions in the Galaxy, and molecular
clouds in external galaxies. Notable accomplishments during the past three years
at BIMA include expansion from 6 to 9 elements, and the extension of the array
baselines to provide angular resolutions better than 0.5 arcsecond. These
technical advancements permitted BIMA scientists to obtain the first resolved
image of a young circumstellar disk, and to discover a molecular bar at the core
of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, and to confirm the discovery of interstellar
acetic acid. Scientific plans under the new award will focus heavily on
exploiting the recently-achieved higher speed and resolution of the array. In
the technical domain, BIMA staff will concentrate attempting to use total power
fluctuations to remove the phase fluctuations caused by the atmosphere when
operating over long baselines.
