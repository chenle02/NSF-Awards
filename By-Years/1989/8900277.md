A group of about 23 organic chemists will be selected to receive travel
assistance to attend the XI. International Conference on Phosphorus Chemistry in
Tallinn, USSR which will be held July 3 to 8, 1989. The U.S. chemists will
present technical talks and have the opportunity to interact with specialists in
phosphorus chemistry from all over the world. The possibility of travel support
will be advertised and the applications will be reviewed by a panel of
scientists. Professional and geographic considerations will be considered in the
final selection of grantees. This travel grant is being funded by the Synthetic
Organic Chemistry Program.
