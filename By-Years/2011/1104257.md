Lansing Community College and its academic and industry partners propose to
create an integrated grades 9-16 academic-career pathways model to give students
the technical and workforce skills needed to become leaders in Michigan's
growing green building industry. The initiative provides a real life laboratory
for students to learn and be ready to enter building science-energy management
careers upon graduation. Through linked education-career pathways and the
creation of a capstone experience laboratory, this initiative advances knowledge
of critical technical and workplace skills for students and faculty. The project
will take a system approach towards building science by integrating building
science-energy management topics with STEM disciplines. It leverages several
resources, including already-developed curricula, standing industry advisory
committees, and existing problem- and case-based student projects as the basis
for the formal education-career model proposed by the project. The broader
impacts of this project include the creation of partnerships among the secondary
and post-secondary schools and the building science-energy management industry
that can serve as a national model, and the development and implementation of a
pathway framework replicable in the other part of the country. Recruitment of
minorities as well as the involvement of the National Association of Women in
Construction and Hard Hatted Women on the project is expected to broaden
participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.
