Zheng This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. The
research studies coordination mechanisms for a manipulator to work cooperatively
with a human operator's arm. By coordinating a robot manipulator with the
operator's arm, unstructured environments can be approached through the
intelligence of the human operator, while the load of the object can be shared
by the manipulator and the human operator. A three-step approach is taken to
study the arm-manipulator coordination problem relative to compliant motion,
reflexive motion, and motion learning. A compliant motion approach is applied to
the interaction of a robot with a human operator in order to make the robot move
in accordance with motion of the human operator. Reflexive motion is a new
mechanism to be developed in this research. The purpose is for the manipulator
to respond appropriately to the intention of the human operator when the
operator applies a cueing force to the manipulator via the object being
cooperatively handled. The result is that the manipulator will move actively and
the human operator will not need not to apply continuous cueing forces to the
manipulator. Another new mechanism being explored is motion learning. This
allows a manipulator to learn a trajectory that best coordinates with the human
operator during the compliant and reflexive motion stages. As a result, when the
same manipulation task is repeated, the manipulator can use the learned
trajectory, further reducing the load on the human arm. This research will lead
to a theoretical foundation for the development of human arm- manipulator
coordination technologies which could greatly extend the range of robotic
applications with benefit to manufacturing, service, and construction
industries.
