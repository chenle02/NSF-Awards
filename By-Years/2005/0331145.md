This project will explore and develop a new method, based on the mathematical
definitions of discrepancy and discrepancy sensitivity (DS), of quantifying
sample point contribution to sample uniformity in the entire input/output
domain, and the resulting strategies for the design of computer experiments
(DoCE). Essentially, DS quantifies the change in sample point uniformity due to
the addition of new simulation sample points. The project will aim to derive "DS
fields" to efficiently locate a new sample point, develop DS strategies to best
choose the next N simulation points, and investigate a number of open questions
integral to effective use of DS for DoCE. The expected results are innovative
algorithms for efficiently choosing sample points for response surface
exploration, propagation of uncertainty through complex systems, and design
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether for model validation, design
optimization or reliability analysis, it is difficult to efficiently choose
sample points for computer experiments in the presence of uncertainty. Even with
recent computational advances, simulation of complex uncertain systems taxes
today's most capable computers. Thus, methods are required to select which
simulations will provide the most useful information given a limited
computational budget. Such problems are widespread in science and engineering,
where physical testing is often impractical for financial, safety, policy or
other pragmatic reasons, and include high-priority applications in accident
investigation, protein modeling, projectile penetration, cosmological models,
and complex system reliability. Some approaches exist for choosing sample
points, but lack quantitative measures of "information" added by new sample
points, particularly in the output space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
