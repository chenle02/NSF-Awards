This proposal will investigate a new method for grinding the outside (OD) and
inside diameters (ID) of rolling contact bearing rings at a single clamping of
the bearing ring. Currently, two grinding machines are necessary; one for the
OD, and one for the ID. This proposal seeks a new method to hold the rings
without distorting them while leaving the OD and ID accessible to the grinding
wheels and thereby eliminating the machine set-up time, tooling cost, and
capital investment in one machine. The research work in this Phase 1 will
conduct bench testing of a prototype fixture. This phase will also develop a
computer round-up simulation program for the grinding round-up process,
incorporating the sources of out-of-roundness. Both of these research objectives
should lead to improved bearing accuracy and reduced manufacturing cost. If
successful, the basis for developing a ID/OD bearing grinder will be
established. Follow-on phases are planned which involve grinding bearing rings
held in a prototype fixture and determining the actual capabilities of the ID/OD
grinding concept, followed by commercial development of a ID/OD bearing grinder.
This research should lead to a new grinder that will produce higher quality
bearings at lower cost, which should be of significant benefit to rolling
contact bearing manufacturers as well as users of these bearings.
