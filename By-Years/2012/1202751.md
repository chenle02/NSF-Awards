The availability of landmass plays a key role in the diversification of
terrestrial lineages through evolutionary time. How geological dynamism affects
the inference of evolutionary history of a biogeographic theater is poorly
understood. To address how geological history affects a specific function of
phylogenetic informativeness that is required to infer evolutionary history, a
combination of (1) modeling effects of geology on simulated phylogenies; and (2)
empirical hypothesis testing with phylogenies drawn from a geologically dynamic
theater, Southeast Asia, is proposed. Progress on this question will inform
understanding of biotic distributions and elucidate methods by which informative
phylogenetic markers can be identified for individual biogeographic theaters.
The relationship between geological history and phylogenetic informativeness
occurs at the intersection of biology, geology, and mathematics. Addressing this
problem requires both biological expertise to understand the context (taxon
distribution and phylogenetic inference) and mathematical training in numerical
modes of analysis.

Broader impacts include development of education material suitable for both
undergraduates and school groups on phylogenetic reconstruction of evolutionary
history, which will incorporate a perspective on geological history informed by
the results of the proposed research. Modeling and biogeography teaching modules
developed for an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in the third year of the
program will be freely distributed through the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science at the City University of New York. The proposed modeling
software will be distributed for students and researchers alike through the
American Museum of Natural History to explore the effects of geological events
on simulated phylogenies.
