Hundreds of thousands of students have used online peer review applications to
review their classmates' work. While learning gains from peer review have been
documented repeatedly, current systems do not always produce accurate scores and
often give inadequate guidance to students about what constitutes a good review,
resulting in haphazard feedback. This research addresses these issues with a
common set of web services that can be used by any peer review system, as well
as new visualizations that identify students' strengths and weaknesses, and
gauge improvement over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project differs from
previous research that typically involves a single peer review system. It will
develop a set of web services that will be usable by any peer review system in
the same way that Google Maps is available to any website that wants to display
location data. This common implementation will allow the project team to gather
data from large numbers of students in a wide variety of contexts, thereby
giving us the statistical power to produce more convincing, highly generalizable
results&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peer review during the writing process is an
example of formative assessment, feedback that is received while the recipient
still has a chance to improve his/her work. Several studies have found that the
students who benefit most from formative assessment are those who typically
underperform as measured by exams and standardized tests. Formative assessment
tends to level the playing field for underrepresented minorities by allowing
these students to receive input from their peers when they are not stressed
about how their grade is being affected.
