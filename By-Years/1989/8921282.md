This award is in support of an one-year visit by Gregory Stone, National
Undersea Research Program (NURP), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, to the Japan Marine Science and
Technology Center (JAMSTEC) in Yokosuka, Japan. Mr. Stone will collaborate with
Dr. Hiroshi Hotta and others at JAMSTEC in defining critical research areas
requiring in situ experimentation or sampling at ocean depths in excess of 4,000
meters. The submersible system and types of instrumentation and tools that would
be needed to accomplish deep-sea science programs will be assessed. JAMSTEC is
the Japanese counterpart to NURP and, as an organization, has as its mission the
promotion of marine science research and the development of technologies to
facilitate that research. In 1989 JAMSTEC launced the SHINKAI 6500, one of the
deepest diving manned submergence research vessels in the world. NURP and
JAMSTEC have a history of collaboration. Mr. Stone's research stay in Japan
should help to focus and coordinate future collaboration between the marine
science communities of our two countries.
