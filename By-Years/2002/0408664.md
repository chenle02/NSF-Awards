The main objective of this research project is to embed pressure, temperature
and relative humidity sensors throughout a fuel cell stack to nurture deeper
understanding and the development of a more accurate model, with the ultimate
goal of achieving improved fuel cell performance, reliability and durability
through advanced controls. Specifically, we will (i) determine the optimal
locations for the embedded sensors; (ii) fabricate simple fuel cells and
integrate a set of embedded sensors; (iii) perform designed experiments; (iv)
interpret and utilize the sensor data to develop a phenomenological model that
captures the humidity, temperature and pressure behavior inside the cell; (v)
develop control and estimation algorithms for improved humidity control and
water management for improved fuel cell efficiency; and finally (iv) an active
humidifier will be used to confirm the effectiveness of the developed control
algorithm. As seen in many prior publications, when humidity of a fuel cell is
not actively managed, dehydration or flooding adversely influences the
performance of the stack. When the membrane water content is inadequate, the
cell becomes less efficient and produces more heat, thus creates a positive
feedback that can eventually lead to cell failure. Accurate model-based humidity
control is expected to stabilize cell voltage and significantly improve membrane
durability and long-term performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
