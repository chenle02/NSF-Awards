9321325 Manuelli This project consists of three topics all concerned with the
relationship between public policy and economic growth. The first focuses on the
effectiveness of collective choice mechanisms in implementing policies that
determine pollution in a growth context. At issue is whether or not the rising
income associated with the process of development will result in more stringent
environmental controls. In the process of analyzing this issue, the consequences
of the irreversibility of pollution effects and the impact on the
intergenerational distribution of welfare are analyzed. A related issue is the
effect of free trade both on the overall level of pollution, as well as its
allocation across countries. Specific interest is focused on understanding both
the short-run effect of a switch to free trade and the dynamic impact that the
development process has on "pollution trading" The second topic concerns the
effects of the design of systems to protect property rights such as patents,
copyrights, and trade secret laws on the incentives to innovate and the
consequences for the overall rate of development of the economy. The third topic
analyzes the effect of instability on the growth rate of the economy. Among the
issues to be investigated is the impact of volatile tax and spending policies on
the average level of growth through the effect on investment. ***
