9403788 Anderson The research concerns the study of the variational bicomplex
and its applications to differential equations and conservation laws in
mathematical physics using differential-geometric and topological techniques.
Particular attention will be paid to the Euler-Lagrange complex in the setting
of the modern theory of the calculus of variations. The methods are applicable
to analyzing the Einstein vacuum equations. They are also applicable to to many
systems of partial differential equations which arise in mathematical physics
and theoretical mechanics. ***
