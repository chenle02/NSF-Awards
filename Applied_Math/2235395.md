Many geophysical and astrophysical systems ? such as oceanic currents, large-
scale weather patterns and planetary atmospheres ? are described, to good
approximation, by two-dimensional fluid equations, since the vertical extent of
these systems is typically much smaller than the horizontal. Understanding the
long-term dynamics of two-dimensional fluids is thus fundamental to weather
prediction, climate science, and astrophysics. This project aims to advance our
understanding of two-dimensional fluids from the perspectives of both geometry
and dynamical systems, as well as to bridge the gap between these disciplines
through the training of junior researchers and the organizing of mini-courses
and conferences.

The focus of this work will be the study of the prototype of all such systems,
the forced two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and their
inviscid, unforced counterpart, the Euler equations. We will analyze the
physically relevant regimes of long time and weak dissipation/forcing, in
various orders of limits. A rather surprising and mysterious feature of this
system is that, in one regime (Euler), it captures the birth and permanence of
order in the form of large hurricane ? like whirls ? while in another regime
(Navier-Stokes) it describes a disorderly, seemingly random, turbulent soup of
eddies. That is, an ideal Euler fluid tends towards order over time through a
process of vortex mergers and mixing, whereas a Navier-Stokes fluid with very
slight viscosity and forcing tends towards disorder through a cascade of
instabilities in accord with longstanding conjectures of Kolmogorov. The project
aims to advance our understanding of these fundamental aspects of fluid motion
by studying the behavior of solutions both near and far from equilibrium through
the lens of partial differential equations, geometry, and dynamical systems.
Computer experiments will be used to inform rigorous mathematical analysis and
frame questions.
