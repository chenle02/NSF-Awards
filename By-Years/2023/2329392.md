This award supports the 2023 offering of the Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI),
to be held online July 10-August 18, 2023. SGI is a six-week program supporting
a cohort of undergraduates and early master's students in entering research in
geometry processing. In the first week of SGI, participants will attend hands-on
tutorials introducing the theory and practice of geometry processing; no
background or previous experience is necessary. During the remaining weeks,
participants will work in teams on research projects led by faculty and research
scientists in this discipline, while attending talks and other sessions led by
visiting researchers. SGI aims to broaden the pool of students applying for PhD
programs and employment related to geometry processing and applied mathematics
more broadly; it has a long track record of increasing the size and diversity of
the pool of new members of the community.

Geometry processing has a long history of breakthrough developments that have
guided design of 3D tools for computer vision, additive manufacturing,
scientific computing, and other disciplines. Algorithms for geometry processing
combine ideas from disciplines including differential geometry, topology,
physical simulation, statistics, and optimization. The tutorials and research in
SGI bring SGI Fellows and other participants up-to-date with state-of-the-art
ideas in this emerging discipline and introduce them to leaders in the field
with whom they collaborate on exploratory research projects.
