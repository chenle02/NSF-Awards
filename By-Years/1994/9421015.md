ABSTRACT CTS-9421015 Julia Kornfield The structure of polymeric materials under
the effect of hydrodynamical forces will be experimentally investigated, with
application to designing and processing materials with engineered macroscopic
properties. Two, model polymeric materials with intrinsically anisotropic
structures have been selected as model materials, block copolymers and side-
group liquid crystals. Molecular and microstructural flow-induced alignments
will be measured as a function of macroscopic stress and strain during floe, at
different length scales. A series of mechanical, optical and Nuclear magnetic
Resonance (NMR) techniques developed by the P.I. will be used to monitor the
structural evolution of polymer melts during continuous and oscillatory shear
motion. It is expected that the results of the research will guide the polymer
selection and the corresponding processing steps require to achieved a desired
microstructural alignment and macroscopic properties. The project combines
fundamental experiments and new ideas for industrially relevant polymeric
materials and devices. Innovative ideas are proposed concerning the use of flow
induced microstructures in polymers, and use of stress to switch the structure
and related properties of a polymer between two states. ***
