Fire has been historically rare in the Arctic tundra, but is projected to
increase in severity and frequency in a future warmer world. The rarity of fires
in this biome has made it challenging to measure, understand, and predict the
consequences of fire on important ecosystem services such as species diversity
and ecosystem carbon cycling. Furthermore, the impacts of fire last a long
time-- years to decades-- by altering critical biogeochemical cycles that are
important for long term ecosystem recovery. Since fire severity can dramatically
reduce soil nutrient availability, it is hypothesized that ecosystem recovery is
dependent on both burn severity and post-fire soil resources. This project
continues a ten-year project studying the effects of fire on terrestrial carbon
cycling in Alaskan tundra ecosystems. The research combines long-term ecological
observations, a nutrient addition experiment, and improvement of an ecosystem
model. Training and workforce relevant skills for both undergraduate students
and graduate students are being provided. A childrenâ€™s book will be published to
reach the general public, as well as a YouTube video. A large amount of data
about ecosystem processes is being contributed to public
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will acquire and synthesize a
multi-decadal record (2008-2026) of ecosystem function from the unprecedented
2007 Anaktuvuk River fire on the North Slope of Alaska. Eddy covariance fluxes
and biomass harvests will measure temporal changes in ecosystem carbon fluxes
and stocks across a burn severity gradient (Severe-, Moderate-, and Un-burned
tundra), while nutrient fertilization experiments at the Severe- and Un-burned
tundra sites will determine the role of nutrient availability on the rate of
ecosystem recovery. These records will inform a coupled biogeochemical model
(i.e. the Multiple Element Limitation [MEL] model) to improve predictions of the
long term impacts of fire on Arctic ecosystem carbon cycling. The development of
the MEL model will provide a powerful tool for scientists, land managers, and
policy makers to quantify the future impacts of fire in this rapidly-changing
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
