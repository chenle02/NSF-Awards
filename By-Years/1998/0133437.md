The research focuses on new approaches for exposing concurrency and improving
performance in modern&lt;br/&gt;superscalar microprocessors. These approaches
include semantic decomposition of instruction &lt;br/&gt;sets and bitslice
decomposition of data paths to expose elements of the processor's control and
data path &lt;br/&gt;to allow flexible, programmable control over at least a
subset of the microarchitectural features &lt;br/&gt;that are available.
Preliminary analysis shows that there are significant opportunities for reducing
ALU &lt;br/&gt;cycle time, power consumption, and the deleterious effects of
wire delay with little or no harmful &lt;br/&gt;effects on throughput measured
in instructions per cycle. Further, the research proposes pre-execution
&lt;br/&gt;using partial operand knowledge to resolve conditional branches,
identify references that miss the cache, and mitigate the effects of other
problematic instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the
proposed educational plan are to integrate advanced topics into the
&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin's computer architecture curriculum at the
graduate and undergraduate level; &lt;br/&gt;to continue to involve
undergraduate students in research to enhance their educational experience
&lt;br/&gt;via exposure to leading-edge research topics; to incorporate advanced
pedagogic techniques into the &lt;br/&gt;classroom environment in order to
accommodate all learning styles; and to exploit emerging web-based
&lt;br/&gt;technologies to streamline interactive and off-line communication
between instructor and students.&lt;br/&gt;
