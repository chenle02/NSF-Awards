Inadequate vertical clearance is listed as a leading cause of accidents
involving highway bridges in many States. In addition, state bridge engineers
list over-height loads as the leading cause of damages to pre-stressed concrete
bridges. As rampant and destructive as over-height vehicle collisions are, there
is no technology in use for monitoring vehicle collisions on our bridges. In
fact, very few states collect data on bridge hits. Very significant maintenance
budget savings can be achieved if over-height vehicle collisions can be
prevented with an effective monitoring system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
proposal, the team has developed the In-situ Triboluminescent Optical Fiber
(ITOF) sensor. This proposed technology is an integrated sensing and signal
transmission sensor system that can function as a triboluminescent optical nerve
analogous to the nerves in mammals. The ITOF system may be readily integrated
into large civil and aerospace structures to provide in-situ, distributed and
real time damage monitoring. The ITOF sensor combines the highly desirable
features of polymer optical fibers (POF) such as lightweight, smaller sizes,
immunity to electromagnetic interference and capacity for distributed sensing
with the triboluminescent (TL) property of ZnS:Mn. The ITOF sensor has an
integrated sensing (triboluminescence sensory receptor) and transmission
component (polymer optical fiber) that converts the energy from damage events
like impacts and crack propagation into optical signals that are indicative of
the magnitude of damage in composite structures.
