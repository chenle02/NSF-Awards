Developing new insights into the natural source, structure, chemistry and
catalytic properties of the substances associated with the energy fixing cycle
of plants is a key element in understanding and harnessing the biosynthesis of
organic compounds. This project proposes to carry out broad-based studies on the
chemistry, synthesis and biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophylls, and other
photosynthetic pigments. Several lines of investigation will be followed, these
involving 1) studies of the biosynthesis of certain chlorophylls from green
bacteria, using organic synthesis of radiochemically labeled precursors and
feeding to a cell homogenate; 2) studies of the biological origins of certain
unusual side-chains in these chlorophylls with respect to photosynthesis; 3)
syntheses and characterization of novel products (such as chlorins,
isobacteriochlorins, pyrrocorphins, hexahydroporphyrins, octahydroporphyrins)
obtained by controlled site-selective reduction or photoreduction of porphyrins;
4) studies aimed at the organic synthesis of chlorophyll-a and its important
divinyl analogue; 5) syntheses and characterization of the RCI- chlorophyll
proposed to be in photosynthetic reaction centers; 6) studies of the
biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll-a, using compounds synthesized in project
and spectroscopic characterization, of the products of chlorophyll breakdown in
senescent leaves and in fruit ripening; and finally, 8) studies of the
biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin, an algal photosynthetic pigment, using
syntheses of likely precursor molecules. All eight projects rely heavily upon
synthetic organic chemistry and spectroscopic identity of products using
physical techniques.
