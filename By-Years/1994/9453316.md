9453316 Willner Optical communications research shall be undertaken in which the
fundamental capabilities of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) will be
analyzed. This work will include 1) the definition of optimal systems guidelines
in systems employing Er-doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA's) and 2) the study of all-
optical wavelength shifing in a systems configuration. Educational issues to be
addressed during the period of support include the preparation of a text-book
discussing WDM Optical Communications Systems, and the development of a
scientific leadership course. ***
