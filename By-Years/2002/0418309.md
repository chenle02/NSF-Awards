With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Jeffrey Lidz will conduct three
years of developmental linguistic research on the syntax, semantics and use of
quantificational expressions (e.g., two birds, every horse) in English and
Kannada, a Dravidian language spoken by approximately 40 million people in
southern India. The project uses the grammar and acquisition of quantification
across diverse languages as a probe into the relative contributions of innate
knowledge and linguistic experience in language acquisition. Previous research
has shown that children systematically fail to detect both interpretations of
ambiguous sentences like "every horse didn't jump over the fence," interpreting
them as meaning only that no horses jumped. This observation holds for children
learning English and Kannada, despite the many apparent differences between
these two languages. This project will examine the syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic factors that contribute to this effect, with two aims in mind. First,
the project will determine whether children's errors are due their lacking the
correct representations of the quantificational expressions or to their
abilities to put their knowledge to use. Second, the project will examine the
role of experience in leading children towards ultimately understanding such
sentences like adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component of the
project involves language acquisition experiments with English- and Kannada-
speaking children. The project also develops a program of training for graduate
and undergraduate students which provides them with the skills required for
active involvement in integrated research in theoretical and developmental
linguistics. By comparing acquisition in children learning English and Kannada,
the project expands the range of data typically used in theoretical linguistics
and extends collaborations between American and Indian researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
