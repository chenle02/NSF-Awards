&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: EAR-0137983&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jordan&lt;br/&gt;Title: Moving
EarthScope Forward: A Series of Workshops for Science and
Coordination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is intended to support a series of
workshops that will help to prepare for the construction and coordination of the
EarthScope facility, which is a proposal to NSF's Major Research Equipment
account. EarthScope is a bold interdisciplinary initiative developed by a broad
segment of the Earth Science community to apply modern observational, analytical
and telecommunications technologies to investigate the structure and evolution
of the North American Continent, and the active tectonic processes that shape
our land. It will contribute to the mitigation of risks from geological hazards
- including earthquakes and volcanoes, the development of natural resources, and
the public's understanding of the dynamic Earth. Workshops supported by this
grant will focus the science, advance coordination among the EarthScope
components, and communicate the essence of the initiative to the full scientific
community, other federal agencies, state geologists, local officials, and the
general public.&lt;br/&gt;
