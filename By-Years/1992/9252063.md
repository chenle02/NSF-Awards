A multi-purpose Virology &amp; Cell Culture Facility provides an opportunity for
undergraduate students to develop technical expertise and to design projects
(both in class and as independent study projects) that deal with animal viruses
and cell culture. Equipment includes: laminar flow hoods, inverted microscopes,
incubators, computers for data analysis and an ELISA microplate reader. The
facility is used mainly by students in Virology laboratories, but secondarily by
students in eight other related classes. It is shared with faculty on other
campuses
