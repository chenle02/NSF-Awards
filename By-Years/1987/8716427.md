Many sessile marine invertebrates depend on forced convection of seawater to
deliver particulate food, dissolved nutrients, and respiratory gases. Previous
work with passive suspension feeding cnidarians has shown that the state of flow
in the boundary layer over the organism is the most important determinant of
particle and gas flux. The theory of mass transfer has been under-utilized in
the analysis of convection mediated gas flux in aquatic invertebrates. I propose
to investigate how flow modulates exchange processes in several species of
boreal and temperate cnidarians through experiments using gas microelectrodes,
recirculating flow respirometry, cell layer organism analogs, heated model
organism analogs, and field morphometry. The goals of this study include: (1) an
understanding of the effects of organism size, geometry, and spacing on the
Sherwood/Reynolds number relationship, (2) measurement of the frequency of
diffusional boundary layer limitation and turbulent enhancement effects in real
turbulent flows in shallow subtidal hibitats (3) testing of diffusional
similarity models as a scheme for understanding the allometry of polypal
geometry in cnidarians, and (4) investigation of microelectrode diffusional
boundary layer mapping as a physiological probe of areal exchange coefficients
and their relationship with animal structure and the momentum boundary layer.
The results of this gas exhanges study will also give insights into uptake of
DOM and some aspects of osmoregulation, and will be useful to workers interested
in estimating secondary productivity in marine habitats. This work will have
application to the study of fouling communities, coral reef ecology, and near-
shore benthic processes.
