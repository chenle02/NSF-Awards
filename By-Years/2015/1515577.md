Intrinsic cellular function is challenging to study due to many interconnected
pathways. There are two ways to attack this problem. One can work with a fully
functioning cell and attempt to turn off all the undesired signaling pathways to
only leave ?on? the function of interest. This is extremely challenging.
Conversely, one can address this problem using a bottom-up approach. This
project will be using the latter method. Starting with the simplest of building
blocks, lipid molecules, and adding proteins and internal structure the
complexity will be increased. In this technique, only the cell mimicking
molecules of interest need to be added. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Tae-Joon Jeon at Inha University in Incheon, South Korea.
The project will leverage the state-of-the-art electrophysiology equipment and
protein characterization in his laboratory.

This award will support the study the self-assembly of proteovesicles, bilayer
membranes containing integral membrane proteins. Using in vitro transcription
translation the project will incorporate aquaporin channels into phospholipid
membranes. These proteins span the bilayer and transport water molecules between
the internal and external cellular environment. Their function can be probed by
electrophysiology measurements that quantify the electrical conductance across
individual channels. The project will compare a new, simplified method of
incorporating these proteins to existing protein incorporation methods. The
validation of the new technique will be an important step in convincing the
community that the new technique is superior to antiquated methods. This award
is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.
