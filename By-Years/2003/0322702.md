We propose to fabricate a micromachined structure for tensile testing of
freestanding nano-scale thin films. The design will combine elements that
currently exist in different mechanical testing devices and will offer several
new features as well. The benefits of the proposed device include integrated
load measurement with a piezoresistive force sensor, very sensitive stress
measurement at high strain rates, table-top testing compatibility, in-situ
electron microscope testing compatibility, intrinsic specimen alignment, and
protection of the specimen during handling. The combined capabilities will allow
exploration of time and temperature dependent performance of various thin film
materials. The process flow for device fabrication will be compatible with a
wide variety of test materials and will be suitable for exchange between
laboratories. The finished device will be demonstrated through a study of strain
rate effects in aluminum and aluminum alloy films of 20-100 nm dimensions. A
fatigue fracture study performed on aluminum films will also showcase the unique
capabilities of the test device.

The proposed program will provide critical information necessary for reliable
design of devices that depend on nano-scale structural components. Although
graduate students will be performing the majority of the work, several
undergraduate students will be engaged each year in hands-on research, exposing
them to concepts and techniques being developed for the emerging field of
nanomaterials. Significant representation of women will be a part of this
effort, as has been demonstrated in prior projects. Furthermore, freshmen will
benefit from hands-on projects based on advanced materials through a new course
in development intended for all Lehigh engineering students. Infrastructure
enhancements to the Lehigh University Nano- and Micro-Mechanical Behavior
Laboratory and the Electron Microscopy Facility will fuel future collaborations
in mechanical behavior of nano-scale materials and structures
