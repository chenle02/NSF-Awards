This project develops a junior/senior level Controls Laboratory at Christian
Brothers University, with Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers and IBM
compatible 80386 machines.An Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC),
along with a multitude of input and output modules are provided at each station.
The PLC experiments use electromechanical equipment and allow the students to
network their own plant process. In addition to the broad applications of PLCs,
students explore how the PLC itself operates by running small controls
experiments, using the data acquisition capability of Tektronix programmable
GBIP instrumentation, such as oscilloscopes, digital multimeters and universal
sources. The equipment flexibility and adaptability are applied to a broad range
of experiments.
