This award to Dr. A. Georgopoulos will investigate the coordination of
movements and forces when the arm is steered in space. Human subjects will
operate a handle that can be moved in space, or can locked in place, so that it
becomes an isometric force device. Perturbations of the movement will be
delivered using two torque motors. The experiment wuill determine how the three-
dimensional motor trajectory is steered on-line when such perturbations are
applied. This on-line steering of the motor trajectory is embedded in cetain
organizational principles; for example, the slowing of the speed when the
trajectory is curved and the segmentation of the trajectory in planes. The
research will elucidate the interactions between these principles and the
steering of the trajectory in the presence of perturbations. This work will
contribute basic knowledge to understanding human motor function.
