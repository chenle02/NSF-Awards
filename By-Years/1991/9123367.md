The award will provide partial support for an International conference to
consider questions regarding the interactions of very high energy cosmic rays
with the Earth's atmosphere. The focus of the conference will be on all types of
cosmic ray showers observed in a large variety of different detectors, including
photographic emulsions and other electronic particle detector devices.
Fundamental questions regarding both astrophysics and particle physics are
addressed by data which are likely to be presented. In astrophysics, the sources
and the genders of cosmic rays as well as the acceleration mechanisms resulting
in their high energies are of profound interest. In particle physics, the nature
of the high energy interactions with the atmosphere are important, and can be
related to data from the world's highest energy accelerator - the Tevatron
collider at Fermilab - from which data should also be presented at the
conference. The conference is seventh in a bi-annual series, and is sponsored by
the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP).
