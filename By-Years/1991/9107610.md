This project will focus on a new area of research for Dr. Rakowski-DuBois. She
will spend a month at the beginning of the project interacting with research
groups which are active in the area on metal nitrogen chemistry. She will obtain
a better sense of properties and potential reactions of these complexes and get
a better perspective on important problems in organometallic chemistry. During
this period she will have access to original material not readily available at
the University of Colorado. Following this, a major portion of the project
period will be spent in her own laboratory where syntheses of new metalorgano-
nitrogen complexes and their reactions can be explored most efficiently. She
will renew her her synthetic expertise with hands-on research during this
period, and will acquaint herself with new instrumentation, software, and new
experimental techniques. In the latter part of this project she will spend an
extended period of time in laboratories at the University of Texas gaining
experience in photochemical techniques and exploring a collaborative
investigation of organometallic nitrogen and oxo complexes and clusters. The
remaining period of this project will be devoted to developing new techniques
and collaborations in her research group at Colorado. %%% This Career
Advancement Award will support activities that will expand Dr. Mary Rakowski-
DuBois' research career potential. The scope and intent of this award will
provide for the development of new skills in areas that will expand her research
programs and develop innovative research methods in collaborations with other
investigators.
