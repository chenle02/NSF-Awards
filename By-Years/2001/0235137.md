David Micha is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
to develop a theory of the quantum dynamics of the many-atom systems by
combining density matrix and time-dependent many-electron treatments. Research
outcomes will provide atomic models, and generate electronic potential energies,
couplings, and electric transition dipoles as needed for molecular spectra and
dynamics. A related research objective is to describe the femtosecond dynamics
and spectra of electronic rearrangement induced by collisions or by light
absorption, particularly for systems with an alkali atom and either a few or
many noble gas atoms. This effort involves atomic orbital changes, multiplet and
fine structure of atomic transitions, and similar transitions for molecular
electronic states.

The knowledge and computer software developed in this project will be applicable
to phenomena in photochemistry and photobiology that are relevant to societal
concerns about the environment and medicine, as well as energy production using
solar radiation. Minority graduate education will be actively advanced in this
project. Micha will also continue to coorganize Pan American workshops that
involve a significant fraction of Hispanic participants.
