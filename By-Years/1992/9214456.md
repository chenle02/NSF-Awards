Saint Edward's University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000
bits per second line through the Texas Higher Education Network (THEnet). The
connection enhances the school's undergraduate science education program by
allowing the students to communicate and collaborate with the national
scientific and educational community, and to access network resources. This
award funds part of the costs for two years.***
