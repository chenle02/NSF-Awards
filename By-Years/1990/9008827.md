This project supports research into fundamental problems in condensed matter
physics and high energy physics. The research includes rigorous renormalization
group methods in the theory of critical phenomena (self-avoiding walk,
percolation, and Coulomb gas). Other research directions include problems in
disordered systems related to the Ising model in a random magnetic field and
investigations into the phase structure of supersymmetric field theory models
and the way the phase structure is constrained by index theorems. This project
lies in the general area of 'theoretical' or 'mathematical' of physics with
emphases on directed polymers in a random environment, the inverse square Ising
model, phase diagrams, and models of quantum field theory important to matter
theory and high energy physics.
