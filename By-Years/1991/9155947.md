The calculus-based introductory physics course, with an annual enrollment of
roughly 150,000 students, is the educational cornerstone for all physical
science and engineering majors as well as the primary influence on general
physics courses at lower levels. This project draws upon: 1) physics education
research, 2) computer technology and software development for physics, and 3)
guidelines developed by the Introductory University Physics Project in order to
develop a unified new curriculum for the course. Emphasis is placed on
incorporating effective pedagogy into the course, on the use of a "story line"
and improved course structure, and on bringing a significant component of 20th
century physics into the course. The aspect of this course that sets it apart
from curriculum development efforts elsewhere is that it is aimed primarily at
universities that teach large numbers of students. This is the target audience
that must be reached if new developments in science education are to succeed.
Specific attention will be given to the many constraints that a large university
setting places on the course.
