Among the ramifications of the unification of the European Community (EC) in
1992 is the potential to create a formidable research and development (R&amp;D)
enterprise. For example, it is estimated that by 1992 national civil R&amp;D
expenditures of the 12 EC nations will reach parity with those of the United
States, and thereafter will surpass them. After unification, the EC will
therefore become one of the world's two major scientific entities. As the EC
moves toward unification, a major goal is to remove many of the barriers that
have inhibited the kind of university- industry-government laboratory
interactions in Europe that are beginning to be effective in the United States.
An increase in the proportion of cooperative research based on those
interactions is likely to alter the terms of cooperation between U.S. and
European scientists and engineers. For example, more of the research conducted
by European academic investigators could become proprietary or be restricted to
participation by European scientists. On the other hand, there is little doubt
that European economic unification, coupled with increasing university-
industry-government laboratory cooperation, will result in a markedly richer
European research environment. While the terms of U.S. participation will very
likely change, U.S. scientists and engineers should be able to participate to
their advantage, provided the nature of the evolving European research
environment is more clearly understood and provided that understanding is used
as the basis of science policy development in the United States. Dr. Walter
Massey, Vice President for Research and for Argonne National Laboratory,
proposes to make an intensive study of trends toward university-industry-
government laboratory research in the context of Europe 1992. He will (a) select
a few major corporations in key, technology-intensive industries and explore
their research goals through personal interviews with executives in R&amp;D
areas, as well as with those at the corporate level; (b) meet with university
and national laboratory administrators and scientists to learn of their efforts
and the obstacles faced in working with industry; (c) spend time with key
members of the EC and its subsidiary institutions; and (d) meet with senior
government officials in the major EC countries to become familiar with their
role in the promotion and sponsoring of joint research activities. Dr. Massey's
research will provide the basis for both a graduate course at the University of
Chicago and a book.
