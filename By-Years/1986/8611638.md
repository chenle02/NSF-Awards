The purpose of this research is to investigate new techniques for scanning
optical microscopy. Specifically, this research involves a Type II mechanically
scanned optical microscope and a separate electronically scanned Type II
microscope using a Bragg cell for scanning. The latter device gives direct
measurements of optical phase and amplitude. Fourier transform techniques will
be used to improve the transverse resolution of the microscope and to measure
the widths of films in the low submicron range while measuring film thicknesses
with accuracies targeted at 5-10 nm. If successful, this microscope would
provide an order of magnitude improvement in the capability of scanning optical
microscopy, and it could contribute significantly to materials research and to
research and quality control in microelectronic devices and emerging
micromechanical devices.
