Ecosystem management requires understanding how the ecological effects of forest
fire interact with slower, more subtle processes such as succession and soil
development to generate landscape-scale vegetation patterns. A long time
perspective is required to study these interactions because the results manifest
themselves over centuries, and are affected by climate variability. The primary
objective of this project is to refine paleoecological methods to document
changes in spatial patterns of fire and vegetation over the last 1000 years in a
network of sites across a 450,000 ha sand plain in northwestern Wisconsin. The
project will provide perspective for ecological studies and management goals and
will involve students at two state universities and one liberal arts college in
an interdisciplinary educational experience. Results will be shared with the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Chequamegon-Nicolet National
Forest, who are restoring ecosystem processes and structure to protect rare
species and communities on the sand plain.
