The PI lays out a number of outstanding issues in lipid-NP interactions that he
proposes to address via molecular simulations using an original mesoscale
simulation technique using ?ghost tweezers? as a method to explore the energy
landscape of interfacial interactions of lipid membranes with nanoparticles. If
successful, the project can provide important insights for as varied fields as
biomedical imaging, drug delivery, lipid-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles,
and biosensing with nanoparticle-lipid bilayers systems.
