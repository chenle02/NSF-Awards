This project targets a number of challenging problems in Algorithms and
Complexity that are amenable to an algebraic approach. Research is organized
around three major goals: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Algorithms for matrix
multiplication with the aim of achieving nearly-linear running time (i.e.,
proving that the matrix multiplication exponent equals
2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Algorithms for polynomial factorization with the aim
of achieving nearly-linear running time, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Explicit
constructions of randomness extractors with the aim of achieving logarithmic
seed length and optimal output length. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secondary aim of
this project is to explicitly cultivate novel algebraic methods with broader
applicability, and the choice of problems and approaches is made with this in
mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix multiplication is a central open problem in
theoretical computer science, and improved algorithms for this important problem
would have immediate consequences for a broad array of related problems.
Univariate polynomial factorization is a similarly fundamental operation on
polynomials, and it stands out as one of a very few such problems for which
nearly-linear time algorithms are not yet known. Randomness extractors are
unbalanced bipartite graphs with random-like properties that have emerged as a
fundamental object in theoretical computer science (and beyond) with a huge
array of applications spanning Complexity, Algorithms, Distributed Systems,
Cryptography, Coding Theory, Compressed Sensing, and other areas. Resolving
fundamental open problems such as those targeted in this project enhances our
understanding and mastery of efficient computation.
