CCR-0306303 TITLE: Supporting Change in Evolving Software Systems through an
Adaptive Learning Approach to the Dynamic Generation of Traceability Links PI:
Jane Huang

This research will investigate the dynamic generation of traceability links to
support the impact analysis of entirely new requirements. Without such support,
the introduction of new requirements into an implemented software system can
lead to unanticipated conflicts with existing functionality and can adversely
impact non-functional requirements such as performance, security, safety, and
reliability. The research will define a methodology known as Integrated Dynamic
Link Generation (IDLG) for dynamically generating traceability links between new
requirements and an existing set of software engineering artifacts. IDLG will
provide a dynamic environment in which link generation rules are learned and
refined throughout the lifetime of the software system. The research will
develop relevant algorithms and methodologies, and will deliver a fully
functioning prototype tool with interfaces to industrial strength software
engineering tools.
