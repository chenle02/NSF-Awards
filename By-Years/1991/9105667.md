This award will support research in mathematics and material science. In
particular, Professor Taylor will investigate the shapes of surfaces which
minimize surface energy subject to various constraints. The evolution of these
surfaces is determined by the current shape and position of the surface and
involves factors such as mobility and surface energy reduction. Surface energies
which are so anisotropic that single crystals in equilibrium are polyhedra are
of particular interest. Professor Taylor will continue to study both the
mathematical and physical theory of crystal growth. She will also continue to
develop computer algorithms which will illustrate the mathematical ideas and
serve as an experimental tool. The use of computer experiments as an aid in the
development of theory is one of the many unique aspects to the research.
