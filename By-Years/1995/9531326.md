Dr. Charles Garner and other members of the Chemistry Department at Baylor
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Additional acitivites include weekly research or instrumentation
seminars; hands-on courses in glassblowing, chemical structure drawing, and
literature searching; field trips to chemical industries; and opportunities for
presentation of research results. While participants are recruited nation-wide,
special emphasis is placed on two- and four-year institutions in the Texas
region with large Hispanic and African-American enrollments.
