Cooperative networking exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless channel by
effectively pooling the overheard information, which is traditionally treated as
harmful interference. While there is a mature suite of tools at the physical
(PHY) layer to harvest cooperative gains, it is still unclear how these tools
can be employed to deliver significant network capacity gains. The goal of this
project is to design and implement cross-layer mechanisms for cooperative
networking. By integrating PHY layer cooperation with Medium Access Control
(MAC) and application layers, the project will provide higher network capacity
and improved multimedia quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two
interrelated components investigating basic architectures for next generation
cooperative networks: (i) Cooperative data transmission, which focuses on a
robust cooperative MAC-PHY incorporating multiple relays under mobility and
loose requirements on synchronization and network topology. (ii) Cooperative
video transmission, which exploits the synergy between cooperation and layered
compression in providing unequal error protection, as well as differential
quality in multicast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from potential impacts on the
theory and practice of new wireless technologies, this project will train
undergraduate and graduate students in all aspects of wireless communications.
The impact on industry will be facilitated by the close relationship of NYU-Poly
with WICAT member companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
