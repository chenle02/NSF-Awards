0319578 Nesbit Through the Major Research Instrumentation Program, the PIs will
purchase instruments to enhance the bioengineering research capabilities and
strengthen the curricular offerings of the Department of Mechanical Engineering
at Lafayette College. The recent approval of a bioengineering minor, coupled
with the current renovation of the engineering complex, make this an opportune
time to acquire equipment that will supplement ongoing research in the study of
human motion and radio-frequency ablation of tumors. An eight-camera image
system for motion analysis and modeling software will be used for human motion
studies. The equipment to be acquired for radio-frequency ablation studies
includes the radio-frequency generator with electrodes and specialized
temperature measuring equipment.
