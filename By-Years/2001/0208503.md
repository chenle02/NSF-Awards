This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Natural
hybridization and its consequences on the organization of genetic variation and
population genetics of a crop and its wild relative." Hybridization between 2
genetically distinct natural populations can result in new genetic combinations
through the reassortment of genes and multilocus genotypes. This study examines
the evolutionary consequences of hybridization in co-occurring populations of
maize (corn) and its wild relative teosinte by comparing genetic markers across
the genome and among hybridizing and non-hybridizing populations.
