Dr. Geoffrey W. Coates has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Coates received his doctoral degree from Stanford University
under the supervision of Professor Robert Waymouth. Dr. Coates will continue
research at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Professor Robert Grubbs. His postdoctoral research will target applications of
chiral olefin metathesis catalysts in organic chemistry. In particular, he will
concentrate on the development of chiral ruthenium-based carbene complexes and
their application as catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. The development of new
organometallic reagents and catalysts is important to the synthesis of new
molecules of biological importance such as optically active helical complexes.
The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
