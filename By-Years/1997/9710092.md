9710092 Smith The objective of this RUI research is to identify the fundamental
physical parameters which determine the atomic structure of thin transition-
metal films deposited on aluminum single-crystal surfaces. The experiments are
designed to characterize the early stages of epitaxial growth and/or compound
formation in the limit of very thin overlayers. The selected transition metals
span a range of values for the mismatch in substrate-overlayer lattice structure
and for the chemical formation energy of the transition-metal aluminide. The
thermal stability and lattice matching characteristics of several of these
aluminides make them excellent candidates for epitaxial metallization on III-V
semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP. The research focuses on those systems
which appear most promising for growing epitaxial structures. In addition,
understanding and controlling the atomic structure of supported thin films of
Fe, Co and Cr is important for tailoring the magnetic properties of these films.
The measurements characterize the degree of ordered growth or substrate
disruption at the interface using high-energy ion backscattering and channeling,
low energy electron diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron diffraction. Core-
level binding energies measured with X-ray photoemission serve to identify
compound formation at the interface. Monte Carlo computer simulations, using the
Embedded Atom Method for calculating total energies, serves as a guide in the
structure analysis. %%% The results of this research will provide a better
understanding of, and ability to predict, atomic structure at metal/metal
interfaces. This area of research has great potential for contributing to
microelectronic and micromagnetic devices. ***
