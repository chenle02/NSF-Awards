This project addresses the uplift history of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM)
in Northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica, using apatite fission track
analysis. The project will attempt to confirm that a mid-Cretaceous uplift event
is recorded in the Admiralty Mountains, that most of the uplift in NVL was
initiated in the early Cenozoic and whether a later period of uplift, early
Paleogene, can be delineated in the south east coastal region where some 10km of
uplift is estimated. Results will place the post-Jurassic tectonic evolution of
NVL in context with the break-up of Australia and Antarctica and the formation
of extensional features within the Ross Embayment. The sampling strategy is to
take vertical profiles from granite plutons in the Admiralty Mountains and on
the inland edge of the south east coastal region, as well as a horizontal
transect. Apatite will be separated from returned samples and processed for
counting by the external detector method in the Fission Track Dating Laboratory
at Arizona State University. Track-length studies also form an integral part of
the analysis.
