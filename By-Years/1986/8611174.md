To effectively design a pneumatic transport system one must know precisely the
entrance condition to the delivery system. Although these systems have been in
common use for decades an accurate characterization of their inlet condition
still evades researchers. What is needed is a standard feeder whose feed
conditions can be uniquely determined. One such system that offers promise is
the spout-fluid bed with draft tube. In this design the feeder to the vertical
tube (termed a draft tube in spouted bed literature is essentially a shallow
spout-fluid bed which is analyzed theoretically to determine a) the entrance
conditions to the draft tube and b) the particle mass flowrate to the tube.
