With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor Richard G. Weiss of the
Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. The research
will extend the PI's work on novel materials and their ability to mediate the
reactivity of guest molecules. The materials will consist of self-assembling
systems such as ionic liquid crystals, thermally or chemically reversible
organogels, and sets of related polymers that can be varied structurally and
morphologically. An important goal of this research is to understand static and
dynamic interactions that occur when molecules meet molecules in anisotropic
environments. The way in which energy is deposited into materials will also be
explored by examining the consequences of UV-Vis and ionizing radiation on the
guest molecules and their hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies are
expected to assist the development of green solvents, media for 3-dimensional
structure elucidation, and membranes for molecular separations. An important
component of this research will involve the training of young scientists,
including those in under-represented groups and from developing
countries.&lt;br/&gt;
