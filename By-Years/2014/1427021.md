How do the characteristics of specific industries shape the way international
trade flows across national borders? Are changes in global trade dynamics at
least partly the result of how industry productivity evolves over time in
specific industries? Data show that across the globe, any country's success in
international trade at any moment in time is concentrated in just a few
products. However, those export products change over time; the top export goods
this year will most likely not be the top export goods in the future. Are these
two persistent features of country export success due to the same process? This
project uses data from five decades of exports and imports between a large group
of countries to test hypotheses about how industry characteristics determine
global trade patterns. The research will help us understand the forces
responsible for the rapid growth of emerging economies, and will help us to
predict future trade flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team develops an
empirical framework to characterize the dynamics of country export performance,
and will apply the framework to five decades of disaggregate data on
consistently defined trade flows that include all merchandise sectors and a
large set of countries conducting the bulk of global trade. The diffusion they
specify and estimate with a novel procedure combines stochastic growth in
comparative advantage (capturing random product innovations or discoveries of
new capabilities) with the dissipation of existing advantages (capturing
diminishing returns or resource depletion). The team will develop micro-
foundations via a model of innovation and resource discovery, develop a
multivariate stochastic process that allows for cross-country and cross-industry
linkages in export growth (eg, linkages due to global productions networks), and
explore the connection between export growth and changes in country
characteristics.
