CBET-0828370&lt;br/&gt;Guo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, we created a
femtosecond laser processing technique to transform highly reflective metals
either totally absorptive or reflecting only a certain color of light, creating
the so-called "black metal" and "color metal". The black and color metals have
many important applications such as making better sensors, detectors, solar
energy collectors, laser marking, and improved stealth technology. However, the
processes are still inefficient and the physical mechanisms remain unclear. The
goal of this project is to develop improved understanding of the thermal and
transport effects of metal blackening and colorization so that the processes can
be further refined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research employs
advanced femtosecond laser techniques for studying thermal and transport effects
in metals. The students trained in this project will develop better
interdisciplinary research skills. Because of the variety of technological
applications, the black and color metal work have gained extensive media
attention. The research project outlined in this proposal will not only
continuously help train graduate and undergraduate students, but also give
students and myself opportunities to further reach out to a broader community
and share our passions in science and engineering with the general public.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport
Processes (TTP) Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and
Transport Systems (CBET) Division, by the Materials Processing &amp;
Manufacturing (MPM) Program, of the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing
Innovation (CMMI) Division, and by funding provided from the Directorate for
Engineering (ENG) to support Inter Divisional Research.
