This proposal concerns studies of the behavior of interstitial ions, vacancies,
and photo-holes in single crystals of silver bromide and silver chloride. The
proposed work includes radiotracer mapping of lattice defects, electron
paramagnetic resonance studies of photo-holes, and studies on ion beam
bombardment and implantation in evaporated films of silver bromide to monitor
lattice defect concentrations and mobility.
