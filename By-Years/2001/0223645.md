Professor Catherine Fenselau of the University of Maryland is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities for a symposium entitled: "Analytical Chemistry for Homeland Defense
and National Security" at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Meeting in Boston
MA on August 18-22, 2002. This special symposium is in response to the urgent
need for analytical chemists to identify basic chemistry research required for
advances in national security. Several workshops have been held by various
government agencies, including the NSF, however, it is useful to have open
meetings to reach a broad audience, especially young scientists.
