This award provides funds for a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
award. Investigation of integrated single and parallel channel stopped-flow,
sorting cytometers will be carried out, employing novel detection methods and
fluid control elements. The single channel cytometer will correlate simultaneous
measurements of Coulter volume and fluorescence with high resolution images and
impedance-based immunological quantification. The parallel channel cytometer
will measure Coulter volume and two immunological parameters concurrently on
three flow channels. Both cytometers should sort at 100 to 500 cells/second per
channel as determined by Coulter volume and two fluorescence-equivalent
parameters.
