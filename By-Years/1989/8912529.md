Antarctic marine ecosystem research at the ice edge zone (AMERIEZ) is a
multidisciplinary program. AMERIEZ was started after the National Research
Council recommended multidisciplinary research on marine ecosystem in
Antarctica. AMERIEZ addressed two major hypotheses. The first hypothesis states
that the pack-ice is a major oceanographic feature where enhanced biomass and
biological productivity occur. The second hypothesis states that the seasonal
dynamics of the marginal ice zone affects the natural history of resident fauna
and flora. AMERIEZ completed three cruises in the Weddell Sea during the austral
summer 1983, austral autumn 1986, and austral spring 1988. In collaboration with
NASA, satellite remote sensing of southern ocean and marginal ice zone provided
a circumpolar view of the marine ecosystem. The program has published about 30
scientific papers. This proposal will support a workshop of all AMERIEZ
investigators. The purpose is to synthesize new findings with previous results
for interdisciplinary papers on marine ice-edge ecosystems.
