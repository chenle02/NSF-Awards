9406480 Roeske Northern and central Alaska consist primarily of large blocks of
continental crust that are locally overlain by oceanic crustal fragments. Gross
similarities between them has led to speculation that they are all fragments of
North America's continental margin, however data to support or refute this
hypothesis is particularly sparse int he Ruby terrane of central Alaska. This
project will provide the necessary thermal and structural history of this area
in order to reconstruct the subduction and exhumation events so that a firm
comparisons to other continental blocks can be made. Results should lead to a
rubust model of the Mesozoic paleogeography of the northern Cordillera and
answer the question of what the relative significance of strike-slip, thrust and
extensional tectonics were in the history of the Ruby terrane, and how it
arrival at its current oblique angle to the regional trends in the northern
Cordillera.
