Professors Byrd and Schnabel will continue their research in unconstrained and
constrained optimization. Four topics are investigated. First, tensor methods
for unconstrained optimization and initial development of such methods for
constrained optimization. Second, trust region methods for constrained
optimization that are relatively easy to implement, have satisfactory local and
global convergence theory even in the presence of linearly dependent constraint
gradients and perform efficiently and robustly in practice. Third, the
development of algorithms for solving implicit least squares problems, a version
of least squares that arises in curve fitting or where there are no dependent
variables. Fourth, a thorough analysis of several quasi-Newton methods for
nonlinearly constrained optimization, with the goal of guaranteeing local
superlinear convergence with an arbitrary positive definite initial Hessian
approximation, extending Powell's results for the BFGS methods. This research
addresses important optimization problems that occur in many applications.
