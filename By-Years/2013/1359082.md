This is a renewal of an REU site around the theme of sustainable bioenergy that
trains future scientists and engineers with the skills and perspective necessary
to address the world's future energy needs. To accomplish this, students perform
research in sustainable energy, attend seminars on topics related to
sustainability and personal development, and work on a team project related to
sustainable energy. Students are required to present their research in a
symposium at the end of the program as well as report their findings on a
website. Nine students are recruited each year for a 10-week summer program.
Targeted recruitment is done to enhance the diversity of the REU participants.
The program impacts the REU participants by providing them training in the
skills and knowledge they need for research in sustainable energy, giving them a
sense of the broader picture of sustainability, and helping them develop the
personal skills they will need to be successful engineers and scientists. Sixty
percent of the past participants who have graduated with a BS degree are now in
graduate studies. One hundred percent of the participants indicated that the REU
program positively impacted their career.

Intellectual Merit:

The research produced by the REU students under the guidance of their faculty
mentors advance the state of knowledge in sustainable energy. Researchers will
make advancements in the areas of conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals,
development of sustainable agricultural practices, and advance the understanding
of how rural communities are impacted by these systems.

Broader Impacts:

This REU site provides a rich research experience focused on the personal and
professional development of the participants. Students will gain not only the
technical abilities required to conduct research in sustainable energy, but also
become aware of the social and political issues associated with sustainable
energy. By being involved in a team project on sustainable energy, students
learn to seek outside sources of information and gain an increased capacity for
self-directed learning and original investigation.
