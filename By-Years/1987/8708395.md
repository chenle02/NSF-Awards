This project improves our understanding of international business cycles. It
provides new insights into the reasons American national output differs from
fluctuations in Europe or Japan. It explains the relation between business
cycles in different countries and between cycles and the dynamics of aggregate
trade within countries. Dynamic stochastic equilibrium models have had
considerable success recently explaining fluctuations in, and correlations
between variables in single economies. The theoretical contribution of this
project comes from developing multicountry dynamic stochastic models with
heterogeneous agents. Most models of macrodynamics are based on a representative
agent paradigm, but this assumption does not make sense for international
economics because without heterogeneity across countries there is no trade. The
project also introduces money into the model in order to examine the relation of
the exchange rate to the behavior of money supplies and real variables. The
theoretical work is paralleled by a systematic study of international time
series data, looking first at correlations between detrended variables in
particular countries, and second at correlations between like variables in
different countries. Preliminary results suggest that business cycles in
different countries have many features in common, but also point to a number of
puzzles for the theory. For example, fluctuations in the net exports and output
are negatively correlated. Consumption smoothing suggests exactly the opposite,
as consumers export when their incomes are high and import when they are low.
The project determines whether or not this puzzle can be explained by
productivity-induced fluctuations in investment.
