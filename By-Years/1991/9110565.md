This research project is aimed at developing new methods and instrumentation for
recording and analyzing steady state visual evoked potentials with the objective
of assessing visual function in infants and non-verbal children. The goal of
each of the methods to be employed is to increase the signal-to- noise ratio of
the processed responses. A new adaptive filtering procedure involving the use of
a highly selective notch filter will be developed. Multiple channel recordings
will be made using an of/off stimulus paradigm. Statistical methods to combine
response-related information across multiple channels and multiple response
harmonics will be used so that small visual evoked responses can be detected
more reliably.
