Dr. Charles Winter (PI) of the Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University,
and Dr. Judith Stein (co-PI) are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science
Foundation, to host the 2001, 2002 and 2003 NSF-sponsored Annual Inorganic
Workshops. The purpose of these workshops is to assemble researchers from
different geographical areas and broad diversity at different stages of their
careers to encourage informal and detailed discussion of in progress
investigations. The workshops will focus on emerging ideas, new techniques, and
unsolved problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will bring together
inorganic chemists, particularly the younger chemists at the Assistant and
Associate Professor levels to give them an occasion to "test" their ideas on
more senior chemists. An annual report will be made available to the NSF IBO
program and to the community based on input from the participants on the "status
of inorganic chemistry research" to provide NSF and the responsible program with
insight into emerging research areas.
