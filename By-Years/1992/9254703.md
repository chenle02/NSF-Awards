The Smithsonian Institution's Office of Environmental Awareness, National
Museum of Natural History, and Traveling Exhibition Service are developing a
major traveling exhibition, Ocean Planet, that will heighten public awareness of
the need for ocean conservation. Ocean Planet will show how our lives are
connected to the seas, illustrate the rapidly mounting problems threatening
coastlines and open oceans, and feature promising efforts to manage oceans and
oceanic resources in a sustainable manner. The exhibition and its accompanying
programs will introduce the American public to the science underlying ocean
conservation, including the fields of biogeochemistry, economics, fisheries
biology, geology, marine anthropology, marine biology, and oceanography.
Evaluation studies conducted before, during, and after exhibition development
will help make the exhibition and programs more responsive to its audience.
Following a six-month showing in the National Museum of Natural History, and
modifications based on visitor studies, Ocean Planet will visit eight American
cities, introducing millions of museum, aquarium, and science center visitors to
environmental issues affecting oceans. The exhibition will be accompanied by an
extensive program of educational materials and activities outside of the host
site. A program of education grants to the venues on the national tour will
encourage collaboration with local educational institutions and community
groups. We request $951,050 from the National Science Foundation's Informal
Science Education Program to Support exhibition research, designs, evaluation,
fabrication, and the development of accompanying educational materials. The
additional $3,000,000 needed complete the project will be raised from corporate
sources, private foundations, and the Smithsonian Institution.
