>This planning grant project will address an overall conceptual and
mathematical modeling effort aimed at low.input sustainable agroecosystems. The
project plan is well done. The background and more recent experience of the
investigator are appropriate to the tasks. Institutional support and environment
are also strong and appropriate. Results from the effort should be useful in the
area of agroecosystem research as well as to the personal professional
development of the scientist.
