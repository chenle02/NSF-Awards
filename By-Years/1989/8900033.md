This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Hans R. Bilger of
Oklahoma State University and Dr. G. E. Stedman of the University of Canterbury,
Christchurch. The investigators intend to complete construction and attain
operation of a high-resolution ringlaser at the University of Canterbury, and to
use the instrument to measure geophysical effects such as seismic action and
earth tides. The collaboration is a productive blend of the experimental skills
of Dr. Bilger with more theoretical interests of Dr. Stedman regarding the use
of ringlasers to measure geophysical, atomic spectroscopic, and general
relativistic effects. Sensing and recording earth tides and seismic activity
through the use of lasers is novel, and this project should significantly
advance assessment of the instrument to these applications. In addition, the
site of the ringlaser should allow more exact measurement of seismic activities
from the nearby, very active Pacific Plate boundary.//
