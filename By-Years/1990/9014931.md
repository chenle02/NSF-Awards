This award supports the scientific exchange of personnel between the USSR
Institute of Geography and the USA Ohio State University, Byrd Polar Research
Center, (OSU-BPRC) for the purpose of designing a cooperative ice core
paeloclimatology research program. The primary scientific goal for the
cooperative program is to extract high-resolution (annual) ice core records from
one or two appropriate ice caps in the USSR. The chemical and physical
characteristics of the atmosphere are preserved in these ice cores and
contribute unique, otherwise unavailable, information about the
paleoenvironmental history of the Tibetan Plateau region, The collaborative
effort would encompass fieldwork, laboratory analyses, data reduction,
synthesis, and publication. This research is supported as a "Small Grant for
Exploratory Research" (SGER) award.
