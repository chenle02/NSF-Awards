Jewitt Dr. David Jewitt will carry out a campaign of optical and submillimeter
wavelength observations designed to study the outgassing physics of the coma of
comet Hale-Bopp. These observations should provide a better understanding of
nuclear outgassing and of the relative contributions of nuclear and distributed
sources. =============================================
