In the statistical design of experiments rotatability is one of the many
desirable characteristics of a response surface design. Recent work has, for the
first time, provided ways to measure "how rotatable" a design may be when it is
not perfectly rotatable. This had previously been assessed by the viewing of
tediously obtained contour diagrams. By appealing to matrix majorization
arguments, a new and better criterion of rotatability can be obtained. Moreover
by adopting a new algebraic format for the response surface, this can be done in
a way that makes it easy to extend results to any degree. This new rotatability
criterion can then be applied to solve specific response surface design
problems. This objectives of this research project in statistics are to provide
a new improved way of measuring "how rotatable" a given response surface design
is, and to use this criterion to solve various design problems in the response
surface area.
