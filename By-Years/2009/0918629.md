0918629&lt;br/&gt;Wyner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City College of New
York and the American Museum of Natural History propose a three-year research
and development project to refine and test case study units based on existing
museum-developed scientific content on contemporary issues in ecology for
students underserved in their connection to nature. The resources are designed
to be used by teachers of middle and high school biology, ecology, and
environmental science classes. The project will produce three complete
curriculum modules. They will include new scientist at work profile videos that
will be disseminated online through a web interface that enables teachers to
select and customize scaffolding and to address their particular students' needs
in the classroom. The program will also develop in-person and online courses at
CCNY and AMNH for local New York City public school teachers and teachers
nationally to explore their own connection to environmental issues and ecology
and to reflect upon the role of scientific inquiry in building understanding of
the natural world. &lt;br/&gt;
