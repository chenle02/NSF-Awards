9320009 MERRY The boundary between legitimate and illegitimate violence is
culturally defined and historically changing. Through court cases involving
domestic violence, the law defines not only what constitutes criminal violence
but also what constitutes appropriate behavior for men and women in intimate
relationships. In order to examine the role courts play in reinforcing or
challenging cultural meanings about gender and violence, this project studies
the changing ways domestic violence cases are handled in a single local court
over a period of 140 years. Data will collected through a detailed study of
court records and observation of court officials as they process cases. Court
records indicate how domestic violence is described by victims, justified by
batterers, and determined to be acceptable or not by judges over this time
period. The ethnographic research will document how these cases are currently
being handled and how court officials, defendants, and victims now think and
talk about wife battering. The location of the study, a small town in the
plantation region of Hawai'i, is one which has experienced American colonialism
and now has a culturally plural community.
