The main objective of this project is to study basic processes in fluid
mechanics and spray formation and evolution using three instruments: 1) a Phase-
Doppler Analyzer to measure droplet sizes and velocities, 2) a Particle-Image
Velocimeter to measure droplet and flow field velocities, and 3) an Optical
Patternator to map spatial distributions for droplets and particles. The
instruments will be used to improve the understanding of basic processes in
spray droplet group evolution and combustion (applications include aero- and
industrial-gas turbine engines, as well as industrial furnaces such as those
used to manufacture steel), transport phenomena in buoyancy driven nano-fluids
(applications include high-flux heat transfer in computer cooling, currently
being studied through an existing NSF MRPG), and secondary breakup and motion of
non-Newtonian liquid drops (applications include food processing, pharmaceutical
manufacturing, gelled fuels, and paints and coatings, with the first being
studied under an existing NSF GOALI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The instrumentation
will be used for a collaborative research and teaching effort between a non-PhD
granting urban institution (Midwest Tier-4) that serves a diverse student body
and a Tier-1 land-grant research institute. It will significantly enhance both
research infrastructures, as well as markedly improving the educational
facilities at the non-PhD granting institution by making use of instructional
materials already developed at the Tier-1 school. It will also support the
educational mission at the Tier-1 school. This project will also allow students
to perform research from the university level through high-tech small business,
large-scale manufacturing, and on to corporate research and development
environments. Finally, this project will attract local professional engineers to
the university laboratories by providing instrumentation that can be used for
SBIR projects.&lt;br/&gt;
