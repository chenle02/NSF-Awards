In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
George Flynn of Columbia University will use high resolution infrared diode
laser absorption techniques to study four dynamical processes. Included in these
experiments are the study of energy flow from individual quantum states of
highly vibrationally excited molecules to acceptor collision partners; the
quenching of electronically excited molecules with unpaired spins, with emphasis
on the quantum states in which the acceptor molecules are left; reaction
dynamics involving hot atom reagents; and non-reactive hot-atom collision
processes which produce vibrationally excited collision partners. %%%
Experimental studies of chemical reactions and relaxation phenomena involving
electronic, vibrational, and rotational energies of molecular systems are
important to scientists examining the energy transfer mechanisms and chemical
reactivity of relatively complex species. Many biochemists, chemists, and
physicists are interested in a detailed understanding of energy exchange in
order to understand how chemical reactions occur as well as what causes a system
undergoing collision to react rather than transfer any excess internal energy.
These experiments should help elucidate the fundamental forces which control
reactive and nonreactive collision processes.
