Quantitative parameters for short-term (24-48 hours) forecasts of solar activity
will be computed from high-resolution vector magnetographs obtained at the Big
Bear and Huairou solar observatories. These parameters include the power-law
index b of the longitudinal magnetic field structure functions (i.e., two-point
correlation functions), and the cancellation exponent k of the electric-current
helicity. Data from a four-station global Ha network will be used to identify
solar flares for comparison analyses with changes in active region magnetic
fields. Extrapolation of the observed photospheric magnetic fields will permit
inferences of the field orientation in active region filaments, which in turn
may be used to forecast filament eruptions and their geoeffectiveness.
