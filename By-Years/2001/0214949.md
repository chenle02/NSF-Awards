This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new type of nanoengineered surface to epitaxially nucleate protein
crystals. These surfaces should greatly accelerate most high throughput
Structural Genomics efforts. The basic concept for the epitaxial surfaces is to
prepare a surface that possesses chemical modulations commensurate in size and
periodicity to protein unit cells. It is speculated that exposure of the protein
growth solution to certain compositional periodicities (5-100 nm) on the surface
of the heterogeneous nucleants induces an ordered layer of sorbed protein
molecules which form the incipient nucleus of the protein crystal. Since for a
given unknown protein the unit cell is not known in advance, the heterogeneous
nucleants are prepared as a combinatorial library in a chip based format, with a
wide variety of modulations per unit chip area. In this Phase I proposal,
methods and techniques will be developed to allow a more efficient survey of
surfaces and proteins with the goal of better defining the role of the surfaces
in inducing nucleation.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of biological
research and in drug discovery and development.
