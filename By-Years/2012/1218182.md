This research involves novel techniques for capturing natural human manipulation
actions in all of their complexity. Consider how we prepare food, pick up and
use a common tool such as a wrench, or plant a flower. We would like to learn
from human examples of such complex actions, so that we can portray convincing
graphical renditions of human characters for applications ranging from
education, training, and entertainment to exposition and scientific study.
Broader impact includes use of databases and the capture tool developed as part
of this research for development of dexterous robotic manipulation, design of
prosthetics, and understanding of human grasping and manipulation. The visual
nature and appeal of this research makes it especially suited for mentoring of
undergraduates and women, as well as for outreach to spark interest in science
for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional and established approaches
to motion capture, such as optical approaches, cannot handle the complex,
detailed, high degree of freedom interactions that must be observed to capture
dexterous manipulation actions. The alternative pursued in this research is
simulation motion capture, where a user interacts with and guides a running
simulation. Enabling technologies include (1) real-time simulation of a skeleton
driven deformable hand in close interaction with simulated objects, (2) novel
control algorithms and interface techniques to allow direct control of such
simulations, (3) a new language for segmentation and control law development,
based on user actions during the simulation, and (4) novel manipulation
objective functions learned from direct observation of human actions. Benefits
of simulation capture over current capture technologies include little or no
postprocessing, precise representation of contact forces, fast trial and error,
ability to make use of a variety of means for control, and ability to use a
variety of input devices. The resulting capture system will be inexpensive and
broady accessible.
