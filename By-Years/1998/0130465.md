Abstract CTS-0130465 J. Bush, MIT

It is proposed to perform research in three areas of fluid mechanics: free
surface flows, geophysical mixing, and sedimentation in stratified fluids. The
free surface flow consists of experimental and analytical study of Marangoni
convection in thin films and fluid polygons. The geophysical mixing forced by
plumes and gravity currents will be studied by detailed experiments. The
physical processes involved in the sedimentation in stratified fluids will be
studied by experimental and analytical means. The education plan is aimed to
bring direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics research to Mathematics
undergraduate and graduate students in MIT and to high school students and
teachers. The PI has been supervising undergraduates in the design and
construction of laboratory experiments for educational and research purposes.
And such activities will continue. The PI will also participate in two of the
MIT's high school outreach programs. One is the Science and Engineering Program
for Teachers, the other is to involve promising high school students in summer
research program.
