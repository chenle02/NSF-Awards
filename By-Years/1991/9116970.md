This purpose of this effort is to support the American Society for Engineering
Education (ASEE) in establishing and perpetuating a scholarly journal dedicated
to research in engineering education. The award is for $223,198. Establishing a
high-quality, peer- reviewed journal dedicated to encouraging scholarly research
in engineering education and disseminating that research widely will make a
lasting contribution to the discipline. By publishing current research on
curriculum reform, faculty development, and other areas of vital concern, this
journal will help to improve the quality of engineering education in the United
States.
