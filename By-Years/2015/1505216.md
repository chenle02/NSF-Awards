Design Thinking is ubiquitously taught and practiced across the Education
Enterprise, ranging from architecture, engineering, and fashion; and through the
Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards. Mobile devices and their APPs
are utilized around the globe by students of all ages to send messages, record
daily activities, and document their world. Online courses are pushing the
envelope of instructor and student engagement from passive to project-based and
active learning. Districts are providing Tablets to their students to review
digital material, document work, make measurements, and team-up on projects.
Organizations are exploring competency-based Badging and Certification for
College and Workforce Readiness. And finally, teachers are 'flooding' the online
space with 'home brewed' Design Thinking lesson plans. These efforts, while
commendable, are often applied locally or in isolation, and could benefit from a
commercial product that aligns learning models; inter-connects technologies;
provides standardized formats to exchange information; interlinks APPs to
facilitate the Design process; and systematically awards
credit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed MyDesign family of apps seeks to
address these transformational changes through a marketable product that
provides a mobile platform for design while harnessing the power of other
relevant 3rd party productivity apps. The MyDesign family of apps offers a
common platform and interface 'look' for students, instructors, technical judges
of design competitions, workforce managers, and design professionals. The apps
are organized into a series of screens, guiding users through each of the twelve
steps of design thinking. The mobile platform can be used anytime, anyplace, by
anyone while broadening the participation of students, teachers, and
professionals in the design process. The family of apps applies across a wide
variety of grade levels including K-12, community colleges, undergraduate and
graduate school as well as professions such as engineering, architecture,
fashion design, and graphic design. The apps use a coding process that concisely
captures user information, activities and progress as they proceed through the
design process. The coding process supports a seamless credit recognition system
that cuts across lessons, courses, competitions, game achievement levels,
badges, certificates, and credentials.
