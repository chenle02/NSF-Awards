9411620 Perdrisat Research will be carried out using polarization degrees of
freedom to study properties of the nucleon and few-nucleon systems. Focal plane
polarimeters will be constructed for use at the MIT/Bates and CEBAF
accelerators. The charge form factor of the proton will be measured using
electron scattering polarization transfer to the recoil proton. Hadronic studies
of few-body reactions, again using polarized beams, will be carried out at
Saturne and Dubna aimed at studying the deuterium d-state wave function and
other structure details. At CEBAF, nucleon and meson spectroscopy studies will
be carried out, one element of which will focus on phi-meson electro-production
to search for anomalous strangeness content in the nucleon. A search for
predicted nucleon resonances, but heretofore not observed, will also be carried
out at CEBAF. ***
