This project focuses on achieving control of molecular motion and quantum state
character through coherence effects inherent in the laser molecule interaction.
In addition, applications of these effects in photodissociation dynamics will be
investigated by using both the enhanced level of state selectivity as well as
the possibility of creating coherent superpositions of quantum states for the
purpose of developing possible bond breaking control mechanisms. Specific
experiments include alignment using the Autler-Townes splitting, modification of
the singlet vs triplet character of a dressed molecular wavefunction,
measurement of the transition dipole moments using electomagnetically induced
transparency and finally control of photodissociation and bond breaking
dynamics. In a broader sense, the project will provide research opportunities
for minority students as well as create opportunities in industry for the
undergraduate students.
