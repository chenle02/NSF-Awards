This proposal is designed to develop a mitochondrial antibiotic resistance
marker in soybeans. Soybean cell cultures will be initiated and mutaginized.
After mutagenesis they will be selected with the antibiotic, oligomycin.
Oligomycin resistance is due to a change in mitochondrial ATPase. Oligomycin
resistant cultures will be checked to see if the mutation to resistance is
stable by relaxing selection. Stable mutant cultures will be grown into plants.
It is important to have a selectable marker in mitochondria so that
mitochondrial transformation methods and studies can be developed.
