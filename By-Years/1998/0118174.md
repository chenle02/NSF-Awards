In this project, funds are requested for a two-year research program to
investigate basic plasma processes that seem to be responsible for the
surprisingly strong energetics that have been observed in the midlatitude E
region. The research plan is to utilize a numerical model of the phenomenon
already developed by the PI to model realistic distortions of an Es layer, apply
the results to the design of radar experiments at SRI, and to the design of the
SEEK-2 rocket campaign, in order to determine if the model can explain the
experimental findings.
