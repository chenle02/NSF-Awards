The goal of this research is to design micromachined patterned surfaces for
orthopaedic implant devices that selectively cause the following types of
reactions: 1) promote bone and restrict soft tissue ingrowth in critical
regions; 2) enhance soft tissue growth while inhibiting bone growth; and 3) act
as a barrier for soft tissue ingrowth into bone attachment areas. Combinations
of the microgeometries will be tested for their ability to encourage and/or
discourage site-specific tissue ingrowth and thus achieve a longer-lived hip
arthroplasty device. The enhanced design of bone attachment surfaces for joint
implant devices will provide an improved marketable product. The field of
orthopaedic joint implants is projected to grow at 20% per year over the next 10
years with currently over 400,000 total hip arthroplasties performed annually.
