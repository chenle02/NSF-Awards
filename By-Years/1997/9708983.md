Policy makers increasingly demand predictive information that can help guide
political decision-making on controversial environmental issues that include
global climate change, radioactive waste disposal, and mitigation of natural
hazards such as hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result of this demand, major
financial and intellectual resources in the earth sciences are now focused on
the development of models and techniques for predicting the future behavior of
natural and human-induced environmental phenomena Environmental problems and
controversies are becoming more pervasive and severe. At the same time, research
budgets are becoming tighter. Thus, the importance of effective prioritization
and allocation of research funds and activities is increasing, as is the need
for timely and effective political decision making. Whereas accurate, relevant
predictions may help decision makers respond to some environmental problems, the
misapplication or misuse of prediction research can undermine policy goals,
waste scarce financial and intellectual resources, and erode the overall
credibility of the scientific enterprise. For example, political response to
given issue may be deferred in anticipation of the availability of accurate
predictive data, even when the success of such a response does not depend on
predictive knowledge. Neither policy makers nor scientists possess information
necessary for understanding if, how, and when research focusing on prediction
can be productively applied to policy making. This project begins a process of
systematic analysis that can provide such information. Two workshops will be
convened to bring scientists, policy makers, and policy analysts together to
develop, present, and integrate case histories in predictive earth science
research (past and ongoing). Workshops will focus on the delineation of
principles and criteria that can help policy makers judge the potential value of
scientific prediction as applied to different types of political and social
problems related to the environment. Such principles and criteria may be
necessary for the design of science and environmental policies that are fiscally
responsible, scientifically efficient, and socially constructive. Towards this
end, a significant component of this project will be the dissemination of
workshop findings to the relevant scientific and policy-making communities
through publications and presentations.
