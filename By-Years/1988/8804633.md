A new REU site will be established in the field of mechanical enginnering for
twelve undergraduates, half will come from the University of Minnesota and half
from other schools in Minnesota. Close interaction of these students with each
other and with the faculty will be strongly emphasized. The individual research
activities of the REU participants will be complemented by a special weekly
seminar on Modern Research Directives in Mechanical Engineering. The
undergraduate student will select his research project from a comprehensive
group of projects including: photoelectric pressure distribution sensor, power
and propulsion systems, high temperature solar processing, generic center for
respirable dust, modal response of structures. The research experience will
culminate with the students' presentation, oral and written or their research
activities.
