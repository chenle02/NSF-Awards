This award supports research in extracting properties from action semantics
definitions and in improving programs by partial evaluation. Results from the
two areas will be combined into a methodology for compiler construction based on
staging semantic definitions automatically. Such a methodology will ultimately
be implemented as a part of a programming language design and analysis
workbench." Property extraction from action semantics builds on earlier research
on models and type inference for programs coded in action semantics notation.
Type inference algorithms will be extended so that analysis can be undertaken on
language definitions per si to elicit key properties regarding block-
structuredess and strong typing. Such information is crucial to the automated
construction of correct and efficient compilers. Research on partial evaluation
has centered on effective program improvement based on partial knowledge of the
nature of a program's input, for example, its type. Application of partial
evaluation to compiler generation from interpreter definitions has proved
fruitful. The work is to be extended so that it formalizes and automates the
"staging" of and interpretive specification into a static semantics processor
and a dynamic semantics processor.
