Young stellar objects (YSOs) are stars that are currently being born or that
have recently been born. They are surrounded by thick clouds of gas and dust,
hiding the stellar objects from direct view in optical light. Only in the
infrared and radio parts of the spectrum can details of the young stars be
observed. The Principal Investigator proposes to observe and to assemble an
atlas of YSOs. The atlas will allow the astronomical community to investigate
these interesting and only poorly understood objects and, hopefully, to develop
models of the physical processes that go on during star formation.
