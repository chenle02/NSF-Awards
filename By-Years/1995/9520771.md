9520771 Understanding the mechanisms that lead to differences between
individuals of related species is one key to understanding the pattern and
process of biological diversification. Such mechanisms can include changes in
gene sequences, changes in the expression of particular genes during growth and
development and environmental influences. This research is aimed at
characterizing the development of pigment patterns in a group of closely related
species. Collaboration with scientists in Thailand will provide essential data
and enhance research efforts in both countries. Analysis of growth rates and
changes in patterns during development will be used to test models of pattern
formation. The distribution of color patterns will be compared with phylogenetic
relatedness and habitat choice, to determine the evolutionary sequences of
pattern changes and the importance of adaptation to particular ecological
circumstances in controlling pattern formation. The results of this research
program will shed light on the developmental mechanisms that result in changes
in pattern formation, and on their ecological significance. It will aid in
understanding the origin and persistence of between species biological
diversity.
