DMS-0231521&lt;br/&gt;Ira Wayne Lewis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of
Mathematics and Statistics of Texas Tech&lt;br/&gt;University will host the
Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems&lt;br/&gt;Conference 2003. This conference
will feature over 20 invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers and will have special sessions
in each of the areas of&lt;br/&gt;Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General
Topology, Geometric&lt;br/&gt;Group Theory, Geometric Topology and Topological
Algebras, as&lt;br/&gt;well as providing opportunities for contributed talks.
This&lt;br/&gt;conference will build on a heritage of such conferences
held&lt;br/&gt;each year since 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference will provide a forum for an international group&lt;br/&gt;of up to
200 researchers to present and discuss the latest research&lt;br/&gt;results and
open questions. Topics covered will range over a&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum but
all have a common link to the core of topology.&lt;br/&gt;Among topics to be
discussed by invited speakers are virtual&lt;br/&gt;knot theory, fixed points
and periodicity, bottlenecks in&lt;br/&gt;dendroids, indecomposable Banach
spaces and applications of&lt;br/&gt;topology. The invited speakers have been
nominated by a steering&lt;br/&gt;committee of leading researchers in the areas.
Graduate student&lt;br/&gt;participation will also be strongly encouraged and
supported.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
