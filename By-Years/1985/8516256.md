This research is focused to resolve fundamental dynamic problems in porous
solids and fluid-porous interfaces. The applicability of ultrasonic phenomena
will be analyzed for a fluid-porous interface and scattering problems related to
pore-fluid resonance effects will be determined. Wave propagation in a fluid-
filled porous rock will be studied to determine the effect of porosity on
velocity and attenuation of guided waves. Scattering in porous media will be
considered by placing cylindrical and spherical inhomogenities in the body. The
results of this research will help to assess the feasibility of using
poroelastic phenomena to analyze the role of microstructure on effective elastic
moduli of porous structures such as rocks and composite materials containing
microcracks.
