Student Travel Grant 2004 American Control Conference Abstract: The purpose of
this project is to provide financial assistance for undergraduate and graduate
student presenting authors to attend the 2004 American Control Conference (ACC
2004), sponsored by the American Automatic Control Council. ACC 2004 will be
held in Boston, June 30 to July 2, 2004. The conference will focus on
theoretical issues, engineering methodologies, and industrial applications in
all areas of control research and development. The primary goal of this project
is to expose students to current advances in control theory and applications.
Travel support for student attendees, in the form of ACC 2004 Student Travel
Grants, will be advertised nationally. Women, minorities, and disabled students
will be especially encouraged to apply. Undergraduate and graduate students who
attend the conference, present papers, and participate in student-oriented
activities are likely to pursue careers in the field of control theory and its
applications.
