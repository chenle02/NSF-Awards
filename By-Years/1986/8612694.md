The efficient fractionation of crystalline polymers should be possible near the
upper critical end point (UCEP) which, for a sharp polymer fraction, is
connected to the triple point (melting point) of the polymer by a three-phase
line along which solid-liquid-gas equilibrium exists. By operating at
temperatures slightly below that of the UCEP, such fractionation can be
performed under conditions where solid-supercritical fluid equilibrium exists.
The advantages associated with supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) should
therefore be gained. The fractionation and relevant phase equilibrium near the
UCEP are to be studied for the system polyethylene-n-propane at about 100-140oC
and 400-600 bar. Under these conditions, fractionation induced by differences in
molecular weight, as well as in microstructural irregularity (short-chain
branching), is expected to occur.
