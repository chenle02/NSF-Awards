Low cost workstations and increasingly powerful PCs now make it feasible for a
computer to record experimental data and make high-level analyses of the results
for many classes of neuroscience experiments; the computer should further be
able to determine autonomously when statistically valid results have been
accumulated, recognize and repeat defective or failed measurements,
appropriately alter experiment parameters and protocol, and even recognize
unexpected opportunities and adjust protocol to take advantage of them. While
the best of current generation of experiment control software supports on-line
analysis and decision making, it requires sophisticated programming skills to
implement these capabilities, and the experiment must pause to analyze results
and evaluate control logic. This causes a loss of experiment time. We propose
research on a Real-Time Expert System Experiment Controller that will: 1)
capture data from a laboratory's present control computer; 2) perform
sophisticated analyses on incoming results; 3) make experiment control decision
of the sort presently made by the experimenter (basing them on the
experimenter's priorities, reasoning methods, statistical criteria and rules of
thumb, which are encoded in the expert system's knowledge base as a hierarchical
set of interdependent hypotheses; 4) either directly command the present control
computer to implement its decisions, allowing the experimenter to manipulate
priorities and high level control variables to influence the way the controller
allocates effort; 5) or convey recommendations to the experimenter so he may
make the ultimate decisions. Such a system should improve experiment flow
decision by increasing the sophistication of analysis on which they are based.
The proposed research will evaluate the Controller's performance, suggesting
design improvements and validating the concept of expert system experiment
control. Success will lead to improved productivity and cost-effectiveness of
neuroscience research that is amenable to computer control.
