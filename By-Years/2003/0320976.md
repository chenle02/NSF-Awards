0320976&lt;br/&gt;Geiss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major Research Instrumentation
Porgram (MRI) support will be used to acquire basic rock-magnetic
instrumentation consisting of a JR-6A automated dual speed spinner magnetometer,
a KLY-3 static Kappabridge, and a Magnon International AF demagnetizer. The
instruments will allow undergraduate students at Trinity College (Hartford, CT)
and neighboring institutions (e.g., Wesleyan University, Mt. Holyoke College) to
analyze rock and sediment specimen for studies in rock- and environmental
magnetism. Projects that will benefit from these aquisitions include the study
of loessic soils from the Great Plains, paleomagnetic investigations of Triassic
basalts, and multi-proxy paleoclimate studies of lake sediments from Connecticut
and Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
