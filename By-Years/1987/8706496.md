This project will continue the analysis of the compartmental models. The
fundamental assumption in compartmental models is that the system is divided in
to distinct coponents with outside input as well as feedback from the system
itself. Most of the work so far has assumed deterministic processes governing
the particles. Such models are used in pharmacokinetics, biological systems and
in manpower planning systems. The research will study linear semi markov
compartmental systems. Using marginal maximum likelihood, estimators of the
parameters of the system will be found. The methods will be extended to
copmartmental volumes.
