Greenleaf will apply the theory of group representations to problems in
mathematical analysis on nilpotent Lie groups and their quotient spaces. These
investigations will seek a description of the algebra of invariant differential
operators in terms of the coadjoint orbits in the dual of the Lie algebra of the
group. Initial efforts will address a basic conjecture: The invariant
differential operators on the quotient form a commutative algebra precisely when
the quasi-regular representation has finite multiplicities. Success in these
investigations will lead to understanding of solvability, and existence of
fundamental solutions, for invariant differential operators. The theory of Lie
groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one
of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
