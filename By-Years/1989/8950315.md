The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of redesigning
courses in mathematics and science by incorporating into the courses research
results from cognitive science, and by focusing on the development of
pedagogical content knowledge. The three courses selected, one-semester courses
in biology, calculus. and rational number learning and probability, are all
courses in a program for preparing middle school teachers of mathematics and
science. The project would begin with a preparatory faculty seminar covering
research on topics such as organization, memory constraints, analogical
reasoning, and semantic networks. Pairs of Faculty would plan each course in the
fall term, and team-teach it in the spring term. understanding of content will
be evaluated by content specialists and cognitive psychologists with written
examinations, individual interviews, and a computer-based semantic network
program. If successful, the project will form the basis for planning a new
teacher preparation program for middle school teachers of mathematics and
science.
