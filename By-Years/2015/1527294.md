This project develops technologies to improve stereo and multi-view stereo
algorithms by removing heuristics and hand-tuning using machine learning
techniques. Stereo matching is the process of estimating depth of points, or 3D
coordinates in a scene, and is enabled by the estimation of correspondences
between pixels or other primitives in two or more images. Even the most
successful current stereo matching algorithms, however, use a large number of
heuristics. The developed methods from this project eliminate the heuristics
from binocular and multi-view stereo matching and deliver algorithms with higher
accuracy, interpretability of the results and higher portability to different
settings. Stereo vision plays an important role in many applications, such as 3D
modeling, augmented reality, driver assistance, autonomous navigation and human
computer interaction. The educational and outreach aspects of the project focus
on involving K-12 and undergraduate students in STEM education and research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses stereo vision by training
classifiers that learn from pairs, or larger sets of images, with ground truth
depth to make more accurate predictions about unobserved data than those
obtained by hand-crafted rules. The approach is comprehensive and tackles all
stages of the binocular stereo matching process, including the matching cost
function, cost aggregation, optimization and refinement. Representations for
multi-view stereo based on surface patches, depth maps or occupancy grids and
the corresponding algorithms are also supported by the same framework. Random
forest classifiers are well suited for use in inhomogeneous feature spaces and
classifier calibration can ensure that their outputs are close to the true
posterior probabilities of the classes under consideration. The resulting
algorithms and findings can be transferred to other computer vision problems
that require pixel correspondences, such as optical flow estimation, image
stitching and template matching.
