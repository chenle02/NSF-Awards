Ramesh Rao&lt;br/&gt;University of California San
Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The New Role of Science and Engineering in Risk
Reduction"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In February 2002, NSF funded a
successful workshop in New York City, inspired by the events of September 11, to
develop a research agenda related to unexpected events. Now, one year later and
with the Department of Homeland Security established, the topic of homeland
security is much better defined as it relates to the Federal Government and NSF.
NSF is now engaged in developing a large cross-agency initiative in Cyber-
Infrastructure. The workshop being funded by this grant is intended to bring the
two areas of cyber-infrastructure and homeland security into juxtaposition, with
the goal of developing a computer/information science research agenda within the
context of homeland security, as related to cyber-infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;
