The focus of this research involves the synthetic use of nucleophilic and Lewis
acid metal complexes derived from chiral bicyclic lactams and related
derivatives. The complexes will be evaluated in the metal-mediated additions of
functionalized allyl moieties to aldehydes, cuprate mediated conjugate additions
and [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Robert K. Boeckman in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Rochester. Professor Boeckman will focus his research efforts on developing
methodology for catalytic asymmetric synthesis. There is potential for broader
impact of the work for the pharmaceutical industry and the project will train
graduate students to become experts in organic synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;
