This award will help the University of Louisiana at Lafayette transition its
IUCRC Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) into Phase 2 operation
for the next 5 years. At the start of Phase 2, the CVDI IUCRC is expanding from
three sites to 5 sites, with the addition of two new sites, and University of
Louisiana at Lafayette will serve as the managing lead site of the Center for
this phase. The Center seeks to continue its record of sustained accomplishments
in terms of strengthening and growing industry partnerships, delivering
innovation through intellectual property and publications, expanding research
competencies through increased faculty participation, and broadening educational
experience of students through participation in industry funded
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program of the Center focuses on
developing next-generation visual and decision support tools and techniques that
enable decision makers to fundamentally improve the way an organization's
information is interpreted and exploited. CVDI's area of research is industry-
relevant, attracts membership and has the potential to improve US
competitiveness in this area. The center intends to broaden participation
through center engagement in university programs. Through participation in the
Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation Program, of which the
PI is the co-coordinator, this site will introduce undergraduate minority
students to industry-driven research. CVDI will recruit students from
neighboring Historically Black Colleges and Universities to join our graduate
programs. The site will also participate in university outreach programs for
K-12 students, such as the annual Engineering and Technology Expo Week and the
Science Day.
