Cancer research is at a critical juncture in the interaction of mathematical and
biological knowledge for understanding cancer. Mathematical modeling of cancer
dynamics has improved to such an extent that we are at a point where
mathematical models can be used to probe cancer etiology and progression and
guide experimental research in an informed manner. The combination of multi-
scale mathematical modeling techniques and immense computing power affords the
possibility of integrating basic cancer biology through genetic, sub-cellular,
cellular, tissue, and epidemiologic levels. The continuation of recent research
progress in this interdisciplinary field requires the training of young
researchers to develop these specialized skills. This two-month program of
workshops will help to produce an energetic community of young researchers in
this field.

The plan of this research program is the organization of multidisciplinary
meetings focused on major outstanding problems in oncology. The series of
meetings will combine the expertise and intellectual resources of three leading
institutes: the Fields Institute in Toronto, the Ontario Institute for Cancer
Research, and the Vanderbilt Integrative Cancer Biology Center in Nashville. The
direct impact of NSF funding will be the training of a significant number of
junior United States researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and
graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the
workshops. This interdisciplinary program in oncology will bring together
researchers in the mathematical/physical sciences, oncologists and cancer
biologists to address a range of challenging problems and topics in cancer
research.
