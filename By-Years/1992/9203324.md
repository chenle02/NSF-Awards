An analysis of geophysical data, specifically gravity and magnetics, from the
Manus Microplate (Bismark Sea) will allow a well-constrained identification of
the nature of the deformation at the boundaries and an analysis of its
distribution and partitioning around the microplate. 3-D magnetization
inversions will be used to trace the details of the surficial evolution of the
magmatic systems. These results will be compared with recent microplate and
propagating rift models and observations, and with 3-D geophysical and theoretic
studies of mid-ocean spreading centers.
