In SANDALS, thirty young, minority women entering their senior year in
Baltimore City Public Schools sample college life in a supportive atmosphere
during a highly structured, rigorous five week, residential program. They will
encounter both the challenges and stimulation of college life as they explore
fields of science, examine ethical issues, learn mathematics, improve study and
communication skills and enjoy field trips in the arts and sciences. Through
dormitory living students become more independent and learn to better manage
their time and resources. The core academic component of Sandals-Teams consists
of week-long mini-courses in biology, earth sciences, chemistry and physics in
which students engage in laboratory activities utilizing instruments not
available in high school. The mathematics courses focus on skills needed in each
of the sciences. In Special Topics, ethical issues related to each science are
explored. A college-level English course with a writing support class balances
the offerings. Workshops in College Survival Skills, Study Skills and Personal
Development provide guidance and strategies for personal success. Field/career
experiences in the sciences, cultural events, and the high-lightning of the
achievements of women and minorities will expand students' horizons.
