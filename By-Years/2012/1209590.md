This action funds Barbara Allen Wheelden of Ohio University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Altering the properties of plant-based,
biodegradable plastics to make them suitable for replacement of petroleum-based
food packaging," during the summer of 2012 at The Laboratory for Rheology and
Processing of Microstructured Materials of Seoul National University in Seoul,
Republic of Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Seung Jong Lee.

The Intellectual Merit of the research is evidenced by the crossing of
boundaries between polymer science, material characterization, and commercial
applicability with the goal of optimizing properties of a sustainable plastic
material. The brittleness of polylactide (PLA) hinders its use in packaging
applications where flexibility is of particular importance. By melt blending the
bio-plastic with other biodegradable materials (cellulose acetate and triethyl
citrate), the flexibility of PLA is being improved without sacrificing its
advantageous properties.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
