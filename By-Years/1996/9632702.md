9632702 Mazumdar The purpose of the proposed project is to find suitable methods
for obtaining the statistical distribution of electric power system production
costs by taking into account the major sources of uncertainty that include
generator outages, load, and fuel prices. Information on the distributions is
important for risk evaluation, fuel inventory planning, model validation, and
sensitivity analysis of planning decisions. A distinguishing feature of the
project will be explicit modeling of the stochastic processes associated with
these generation outages and chronological load. The determination of the
expected values of these distributions does not require the consideration of
these random processes, but for computation of higher order statistics such as
the standard deviation or estimating the entire distribution, this is necessary.
Consideration of these processes for estimating the temporal correlations
between the amounts of energy production makes the analytical computations
difficult and challenging. It is argued in the proposal that this work will
maintain its relevance after deregulation and the arrival of the competitive
market structure in the operation of electric power companies. ***
