The 2000 IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems will bring
the researchers and educators from this country and elsewhere together to
discuss new results in areas of electrical engineering. The main topics are
divided into ten areas. They include: (1) Analog Circuits, (2) Digital Circuits
and Computer Arithmetic, (3) Programmable Logic, VLSI, CAD and Layout, (4)
Communication Networks, (5) Wireless Communication Systems, (6) Neural Networks
and Control Systems, (7) Digital Signal Analysis and Processing, (8) Power and
Energy Systems and Power Electronics (9) RF, Microwave and Optical Circuits and
Systems and (10) Engineering Education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will
provide financial help for the students in terms of travel, lodging, and
registration. The time they spend at the Symposium will benefit them in
education, provide industrial contacts for future employment and allow them to
visit with educators from various universities.&lt;br/&gt;
