This award will provide partial support for USA participants in the 1990 Japan-
USA Symposium on Flexible Automation. The intent is to help defray approximately
50% of the expenses for attendance at the three-day meeting and for two days of
arranged tours of Japanese manufacturing firms. The objective of this trip is to
learn about current academic and industry research in flexible automation. This
type of close interaction between researchers in these two distant communities
has, in the last two Symposia, proven to be quite beneficial, and with the
increasing awareness of productivity problems in USA industries, such programs
become more vital each year. At the conclusion of the meeting, the USA
organizers (a group of four to six) will travel to the National Science
Foundation in the fall of 1990 to provide a one-day briefing on the Symposium
and related events. Following that meeting, the group will submit a summary
report.
