Abstract Latushkin This project is concerned with asymptotic behavior of
differential equations and dynamical systems on infinite dimensional Banach
spaces. Dichotomy and stability of these equations will be considered, which is
crucial for the study of long-time evolution of complex systems. The infinite
dimensional setting covers equations important for application in mechanics and
physics. The core of the proposed approach is to study and apply the theory of
evolution semigroups. These semigroups absorb, literally, all information needed
to develop classical ideas of Lyapunov on stability at the level required by
modern applications. Concrete applications include: dichotomy for strongly
continuous semigroups and for linear nonautonomous abstract Cauchy problems on
Banach spaces; the hyperbolicity of strongly continuous linear skew-product
flows on Banach spaces; center manifolds theory for infinite dimensional
semilinear differential equations; stability in non-autonomous linear control
theory on Banach spaces; kinematic dynamo operator of magnetohydrodynamics for
an ideally conducting fluid; and spectral properties of the matrix Ruelle
operator of statistical physics.
