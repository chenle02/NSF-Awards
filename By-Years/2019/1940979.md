NSF has played a central role in the transformation of scientific research and
as a leader in enabling the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) to advance
discovery for almost four decades. The leadership-class computing program is
intended to provision advanced computational capabilities to enable
transformative research for all of Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) that would
not otherwise be possible. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment
is the support of the Frontera project at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
(TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin. Frontera is the Phase 1 system of a
two-phase approach to eventual deployment of a much more capable Leadership-
Class Computing Facility (LCCF) in approximately 2024. This award will support
the conceptual design of a Phase 2 system and facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project design approach will extend best practices in the
design/operate/evaluate cycle that TACC has used to successfully deploy some of
the largest computing systems in the world for open scientific research. This
process will have four keystones: science user requirements, future technology
assessment, alternative design evaluation, as well as risk management for cost,
scope and schedule. Testbeds feature prominently in the design process and will
provide users with early access to future computational hardware and will offer
system designers quantitative insights into the effectiveness of these
technologies. Testbed partners will include major cloud and technology vendors
as well as early exascale computing technology adopters. In addition, the design
process will be guided by science inputs and technology drivers identified by
science and technology engagement teams. These teams will be composed of
distinguished scientists representing a broad range of expertise and experience
to guide the Phase 2 system design. The team members will also serve as
community leaders to bring together colleagues in workshops, meetings, and other
engagement venues to inform the process further. Moreover, the project will
engage with the scientific software community, including library and community
code providers, to ensure the project optimizes the selection of Phase 2
computing technologies to enable transformative S&amp;E discoveries for the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
