This proposal is for a provisional allocation of time on the Blue Waters
computer system, due to become operational in 2011, and for travel funds to
support technical coordination with the Blue Waters project team.

The project will use Blue Waters to investigate a number of topics in quantum
chemistry and biochemistry including, the structure and behavior of protonated
water clusters, the conformational energy of amino acids, and the
photoisomerization of rhodopsin. The work on rhodopsin is important for
understanding one of the chemical processes involved in vision and will also
have potential application in the field of molecular electronics.

The project will provide a methodology for the creation of domain-specific
languages in a range of disciplines, providing a mechanism to efficiently
generate scalable, parallel software for scientific research.
