ABSTRACT

This award supports the project Building SPEED, which addresses challenges to US
global competitiveness by linking math, science and engineering to motorsports
and, in particular, NASCAR. NASCAR has 75 million fans from a surprisingly broad
range of demographic backgrounds, including a large group of people underserved
by traditional STEM outreach. Three types of materials will be developed: 1)
student worksheets and hands-on activities that reinforce the content knowledge
mandated by state and national Science and Math Education Standards; 2) career
information about how STEM is used in motorsports featuring people from a broad
range of educational levels and companies, and demonstrating the full diversity
of people involved in STEM and 3) hands-on materials to enhance the public?s
understanding of the math and science behind motorsports. Dissemination is
accomplished by partnerships with industrial sponsors, informal science venues
and other academic institutions. Dissemination mechanisms include teacher
workshops, public science events at race tracks, street festivals and science
museums, and visits to schools. Dissemination will occur in three locations
(Dover, DE; Dallas/Fort Worth, TX and Charlotte, NC), with each dissemination
consisting of a week of events prior to races in fall 2008 and spring 2009.
