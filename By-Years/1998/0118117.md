Rhythmic oscillating activity is a property of many biological systems, and we
are still far from understanding the theoretical basis for mechanisms driving
such rhythms. In the nervous systems of many animals, networks that produce
oscillations often have to be stable, yet capable of modulation or switching
between different modes. These networks often have individual properties that
have made it difficult to sort out what key elements are responsible for
stability in oscillators. This project develops new analytical methods to
predict oscillatory patterns exhibited by neural circuits composed of
physiological neurons (living nerve cells, not just modeled ones), using only
data that are readily obtainable from the isolated component neurons. A novel
approach here uses computational analysis of phase-resetting curves to make
theoretical predictions of network behavior, and to test whether these
theoretical methods apply to physiological data from small neuronal circuits in
crustaceans. Results will have a substantial impact on understanding oscillating
systems in the brain (such as those for locomotion, respiration, and sleep-wake
cycles), and could extend beyond neuroscience into areas such as ecology and
even non-living physical oscillating systems. This project also develops a
fruitful collaboration among four women scientists at a range of levels in the
computational field, where they are under-represented, with consequent
opportunities for mentoring, and an impact on women's careers.
