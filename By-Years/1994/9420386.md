9420386 Bradley The processing of zirconium diboride/copper composite parts by
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is being investigated. Zirconium diboride
powders with a thin polymer coating are processed using selective laser
sintering of the zirconium diboride powders followed by burn out of the polymer
binder in a later annealing step. Infiltration of copper produces the desired
composite. Evaluation of the zirconium diboride/copper composites considers (1)
the dimensional precision; (2) the surface finish; and (3) the performance (in
the form of electrical discharge machining electrodes by studying the sink rate
and wear ratio of the electrode as well as the surface finish of the cavity
produced). Comparisons of the performance of the SLS fabricated electrodes will
be made with electrodes created using conventional machining. Observations of
behavior during processing will be made after each step using scanning electron
microscopy to guide the development of physically based models that predict
dimensional changes and surface roughness. Once a workable process has been
developed, three dimensional electrodes will be fabricated and evaluated in an
electrical discharge machine. %%% Zirconium diboride powder/copper composites
are superb materials for electrical discharge machining electrodes, but are so
difficult to machine that they are never used. Rapid prototyping of zirconium
diboride powder/copper composites by selective laser sintering will allow
fabrication of these composites. Such composites will have significant
performance advantages over graphite and copper electrodes. ***
