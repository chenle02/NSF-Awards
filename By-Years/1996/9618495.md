9618495 Smith The project examines the physical structure, chemical composition
and reactivity of soot particles important to atmospheric chemistry. Different
types of black carbon are generated within the laboratory through separate
combustion of common fuels. The soot types are studied further as part of a
number of laboratory-scale investigations that examine the interaction of these
particles with water vapor and a variety of gas phase atmospheric pollutants.
The list of tasks to be undertaken includes: (1) the structure and the
reactivity of soot generated from the combustion of different fuels; (2) study
of the effect of unpaired electrons on soot surfaces and how these electronic
characteristics influence the chemical behavior of soot surfaces; (3) ozone
reaction/ decomposition on soot surfaces; (4) mechanisms of soot hydration; and
(5) adsorption of O2 on the different soot types for a preliminary assessment of
the soot adsorption behavior and reactivity with oxidants. The suite of
experiments to be conducted will bridge the gap between the fundamental
chemistry of soot particles and those reactions occurring in the atmosphere. The
research will develop new information concerning the role of soot physical and
chemical properties on the uptake of atmospheric water vapor and gas phase
pollutants. ATM-9618495
