Large rivers are important for regional economies and global ecosystems. Dam
construction is perhaps the most obvious human modifier of riverine ecosystems
and hydrology, altering not only the physical environment but also biodiversity
within the watershed. Well-functioning foodwebs are fundamental for sustaining
rivers. Understanding riverine foodwebs is essential in planning for wildlife
conservation, environmental protection, and floodplain management. Results of
this project will serve as a model of historical analyses of foodwebs and the
long-term implications of river engineering.

How has river engineering over the past hundred years altered food web structure
in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers? Documenting long-term changes in aquatic
ecosystems is notoriously difficult. In this proposal, we will use an
innovative, new, chemical analysis technique on the tissues of museum fish
specimens collected over the last century, thereby providing a more accurate and
precise measurement of food webs than ever before possible. From this, we will
determine what changes over time and possible shifts in food webs have occurred
in response to river engineering in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
