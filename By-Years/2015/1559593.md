This project is for a new REU site at North Carolina State University. It is
focused on training undergraduates in software engineering, particularly in
skills related to data analytics. Data analytics has become increasingly
important in how companies and researchers make decisions about improving the
reliability and usability of software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intention of the
project is to give research exposure and training to a diverse group of
undergraduate students. The project aims at building students' analytical skills
as well as research skills with the goal of leading them toward a research
career in future. The project will primarily recruit women and minorities
through the STARs alliance and from non-PhD granting universities.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project covers various areas of software engineering including
visualization and data manipulation in virtual reality, model-based reasoning,
human aspects (e.g., eye tracking data), bug fixing, and software analytics
which is a cross between software and data mining methods. The overall research
theme will investigate how to take advantage of qualitative organizational
knowledge which gives data its context and meaning integrated with quantitative
data mining methods that support exploration of large and complex
datasets.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will encourage the students to
disseminate their research findings through presentations as well as publishing
in research venues.
