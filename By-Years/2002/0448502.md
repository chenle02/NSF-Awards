NSF-0448502&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samudrala, Ram&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated platform consists of a "hands-on
"protein modelling course at the University of Washington,a web-based "graded
"protein modelling tutorial and course,and a collaborativ e .ort to evaluate the
e .ectiveness of modelling software in teaching the principles of protein
structure.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how protein sequence determines tertiary
structure is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in molecular biology. The
approach combines knowledge about known pro-&lt;br/&gt;tein structures using
rigourous statistical frameworks as well as the physics of the interactions that
occur within proteins to provide insight into this process.The development of
automated algorithms and tools to predict structure from sequence will
complement the existing structural genomics projects,aid in functional studies
of proteins important for human health and socio-economic development,and will
be of use to the general research community to pose and answer ever more precise
biological questions.The resulting publicly available resource will become an
integral part of any biologist 's workbench for both research as well as
learning and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of automated algorithms
for protein structure prediction requires&lt;br/&gt;expertise in several scienti
.c disciplines,including computing science,mathematics,physics,chemistry,and
biology.The problems that need to be solved generally involve exploration of
large search spaces and finding objects of interest within those spaces,as well
as managing the large amount of data produced and making predictions from
analysis of the data.The research has significance in not only answering
biological&lt;br/&gt;questions,but is also relevant for solving problems of a
similar nature in other scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
