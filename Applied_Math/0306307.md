Free boundary problems arising in shock reflection have been solved for regular
shock reflection in a model equation; the method will be extended to a larger
set of equations and other types of shock reflection. Solving a prototype
problem for the gas dynamics equations is in sight. Other two-dimensional
Riemann problems, such as reflection of rarefaction waves at the sonic line,
will be considered. A different free boundary problem, with connections to new
kinds of singularities, occurs in this case. By constrast with shock reflection
problems, in which the complicated behavior occurred in the subsonic region and
was analysed using Holder estimates for degenerate elliptic equations, the
interaction of rarefaction waves with the sonic boundary involves study of
degenerate hyperbolic eigenvalue problems.

The PI has had success, particularly with women graduate students and
postdoctoral visitors, in introducing beginning researchers to her areas in
conservation laws, and in helping to expand their career horizons. It is planned
to mentor two postdocs (at least one, already selected, is a woman), including
encouraging their teaching and professional development in ways such as writing
proposals, refereeing papers, and participating in conferences. In addition, the
second research topic is strongly interdisciplinary, and the PI's work has
aroused some positive interest in the multifluid science community. The PI and
co-workers will attend and make presentations at engineering conferences, write
articles for journals on multiphase flow to explain the results, and organize
sessions at conferences to bring together mathematical, computational and
experimental researchers in multifluid science.
