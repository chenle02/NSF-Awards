Creating a visual display archive &lt;br/&gt;Emilia P.
Martins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal behavior is the one of the most complex
phenotypes and that complexity is reflected in the myriad of ways in which it
has been measured and recorded by scientific researchers. Even simple storage,
access and retrieval of behavioral information presents a difficult problem
because of the variety of forms in which behavioral information is preserved and
disseminated. Coherent, effective combination of the data to address important
questions in animal behavior or for future communication with databases in other
fields (e.g., genomics) requires even more effort. Although recent years have
seen the creation of several public databases of biological information, there
are still relatively few in animal behavior and even fewer which have even begun
to address the considerable difficulties of fast, effective interaction among
the huge variety of possible behavioral data types. This proposal is to transfer
a large existing collection of lizard display footage from decaying 16mm film to
electronic form, preserving it for posterity and making it accessible to other
researchers. The lizard archive will be organized through a database and
metadata tag structure that is sufficiently general to allow for future addition
of visual display data from a wide diversity of other species. A series of web
pages will be created to illustrate the benefits of such an archive to the
biological community. &lt;br/&gt;
