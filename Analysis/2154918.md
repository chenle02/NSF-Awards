This project seeks to recognize the geometric and topological qualities of
metric spaces that allow for the development of a theory of analysis similar to
that of Euclidean spaces. While topology, geometry, and analysis are united in
the two-dimensional plane, higher dimensional Euclidean spaces or abstract
metric spaces lack such powerful tools. Such considerations prompted the
development of the field of "analysis on metric spaces," in which first-order
differential calculus and geometric measure theory are extended from the
classical Euclidean or Riemannian setting to the realm of spaces without a
priori smooth structure (such as fractals). Results and techniques in this field
have found important applications in geometric group theory, in the structure of
manifolds, and in analysis on fractals. Furthermore, besides their mathematical
importance, physical applications of these theories range from the
reconstruction of missing data in large data sets, to methodologies for data
storage and access, and to the study of thin films.

This project seeks to develop techniques to address several long-standing
questions in the field of analysis on metric spaces and geometric measure
theory. The first goal is to relate integral bounds for discrete forms of
curvature on non-smooth manifolds with locally Euclidean bi-Lipschitz
parameterizations. Such parameterizations are well understood in two dimensions
but have so far been elusive in dimensions greater or equal to three. Another
goal is to identify sufficient conditions for 2-rectifiability, that is, to
understand which sets are contained within the Lipschitz image of a square.
Results in this direction will in turn lead to an improved understanding of
2-rectifiable measures. Finally, the project addresses the Euclidean embedding
question, namely, to characterize those metric spaces that admit an embedding
into a finite-dimensional Euclidean space that does not distort the geometry of
the space too much. Apart from providing a better understanding of the geometry
and analysis of metric spaces, the existence of such embeddings has been
instrumental in recent advances in theoretical computer science and graphic
imaging.
