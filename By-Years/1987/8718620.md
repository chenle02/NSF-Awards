The main objective of this proposal is to test definitively the hypothesis that
mating type (mt) determination in the unicellular eukaryote Tetrahymena
thermophila is due to DNA alterations. The basic idea is to microinject DNA from
cells of one mating type into cells of different mt, in order to induce the
recipient to change mt. Our experimental design is directed toward cloning, as a
cosmid insert, the DNA segment responsible for this mating type switch,
presumably the mtd locus. This in turn will allow us to determine a) whether
mating type determination occurs via "deletion/splicing", or "cassette"
transposition, or something else, and b) whether the mtd locus is likely to
contain the structural genes(s) for the molecules responsible for the mt-
specific cell/cell interactions, or rather to be a regulator of the expression
of those genes. The ultimate aim is to provide a detailed genetic and molecular
description of the mechanism of mating type determination in T. thermophila.
Thermophila is a unicellular eukaryotic cell which contains two nuclei, the
micronucleus or germ line nucleus and the macronucleus or the somatic nucleus
which contains the expressing genome. The micronucleus carries genes encoding
seven different mating types which have the potential for expression, yet only
one of those types is actually expressed by the macronucleur genome during the
vegetative lifetime of the cell. The successful completion of this work will
give greater insight into how genome expression is regulated in a "simple"
eukaryotic cell.
