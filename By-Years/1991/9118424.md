This is research will place a newly developed instrument on an Office of Naval
Research sponsored marine mooring to measure sea- ice draft, as a method of
determining sea-ice thickness, in the Arctic Ocean over the Chukchi Continental
Shelf. Time-series measurements will be obtained on sea-ice draft distribution
over a one-year period at a single location. These data will be analyzed
together with a similar time series measured at a second location approximately
100 km away, to determine the spatial and temporal coherence of sea-ice draft
and the ice-draft distribution. The quasi-permanent sea-ice cover of the Arctic
Ocean is a central component of the northern high latitude climate system, and
secular changes in the concentration and thickness of the sea ice can be
important proxy indicators of wide-spread arctic climate variations.
