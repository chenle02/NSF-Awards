While we have learned much about language as a formal system over the past 50
years, language is an inherently social, physical, and moral activity that has
been treated as if it were an isolated cognitive skill, located in individual
brains. This conference, to be held at Gordon College, Wenham, MA, June 4-6,
2009, will be the first meeting in the United States of the Distributed Language
Group. It will bring together its array of interdisciplinary scholars with
leading researchers on language in dynamical systems and ecological psychology.
The conference will provide a rare opportunity for scholars dispersed by
geography and discipline to develop a more integrated and comprehensive
understanding of language as grounded in social perception and action. Such an
approach to linguistic activities has broad implications for robotics,
anthropology, philosophy, education, and rehabilitation, and it is expected that
scholars from all of these areas will participate. The transfer of skills across
domains (e.g., the use of nonlinear dynamics by linguists; the importance of
culture for ecological researchers) will be considerable, and new
interdisciplinary collaborations will likely be formed. A secondary audience
will be selected students and teachers in undergraduate colleges interested in
language theory and research.
