The AAAS Project on Science, Technology, and Disability has played a leadership
role in supporting the advancement of people with disabilities in science,
mathematics and engineering since 1975, more than a decade before the mandate of
the Americans with Disabilities Act. This program encourages scientists and
engineers to self-identify and thus created the AAAS Resource Group of
Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities, producing a group of about 1,000
scientists and engineers who serve as mentors. The AAAS Disability Project has
become the most important resource for individuals and organizations seeking to
encourage the entry and advancement of person with disabilities in science and
engineering. The AAAS Disability Project, has a new program: Entry Point!, which
has made more than 245 placements of students with disabilities in paid summer
internships. The students are diverse in ethnicity, gender, and type of
disability. All are mentored through the process of application, internship
offer, relocation, research work, and follow up.
