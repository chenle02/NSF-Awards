9731860 Mayo Penn State University will continue a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site in its Materials Science and Engineering department.
Undergraduate students will be recruited from the 19 Penn State Commonwealth
campuses throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Students will participate in
research projects on the theme of "Materials Stability and Reliability",
including nanophase ceramics, epitaxial oxides, semiconductor-metal contacts,
metal-insulator composites, and wafer bonding. In addition, REU participants
will attend weekly seminars and tours. %%% The REU site, with a regional focus
whereby high quality undergraduates will be recruited from the state of
Pennsylvania, will provide a research experience to students who would not
normally have access to a research environment. ***
