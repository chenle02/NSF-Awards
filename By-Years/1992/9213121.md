This equipment grant will be used to purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared
Analyzer (FTIR) which will be used to support several research projects. In one
project, a jet- stirred reactor will be used to simulate fuel-rich flame
conditions within incinerators where stable byproducts tend to be formed; this
equipment will be used to identify and measure such byproducts from the
combustion of surrogate waste compounds. In a second project, measurements will
be made of hydrocarbon and partially oxidized hydrocarbon (e.g, aldehyde)
species appearing near the lean limit in advanced gas turbine combustion
processes. While thermal incineration, if done properly, is an attractive means
of destroying hazardous wastes, the potential generation of toxic byproducts
presents a severe limitation on application of this technology. Identification
of species appearing under various operating conditions and waste feed
conditions is very important to advancing use of this technology. Advanced
combustors achieve low NOx emissions by operating under lean, premixed
conditions, where low peak temperatures strongly reduce thermal NOx formation.
However, under these conditions, the combustor is operating very near the lean
blowout limit and unburned hydrocarbon emissions can become very important.
Formaldehyde and other aldehydes, due to their toxicity, present particular
potential problems; accordingly, it is very important to identify their presence
as a function of various fuel feed and operating parameters.
