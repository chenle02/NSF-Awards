Macintosh computers are being used as tools for active investigation in two
different and innovative courses: MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS AND MATHEMATlCA for
upper division mathematics majors and MODELING AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD (using
STELLA II software) for freshman and sophomore non- science majors. Students use
computers to gain insight into mathematical problems through graphical
representation and use modeling as the basis for discovery of basic principles
common to all science disciplines. The software allows students to investigate
real world problems previously inaccessible using only paper, pencil, and
calculator.
