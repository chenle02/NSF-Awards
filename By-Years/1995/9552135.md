Through this project, the Departments of Geological Sciences and Physics are
provided funding for an x-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a host computer and
associated software for use in undergraduate education. This project provides
instruction that integrates science and technology in both geology and physics
for the following student groups: (1) undergraduates that are planning careers
in precollege teaching, (2) current science teachers enrolled in an M.A. in
Teaching Science, and (3) science majors in geology and physics. This goal is
accomplished by providing students with direct access to a modern instrument for
student research at the introductory science level and in more advanced science
laboratory courses. XRDs are central components in industry and the research
community. If our students are to function effectively in these technology-
dependent environments, they need experience with such equipment. Students in
both disciplines learn about the principles of x-ray diffraction and the utility
of such equipment. For the non-science-majors, experience with an XRD system
will take away the abstract nature of what they learn and make it a practical
reality. The choice of an XRD system is based upon issues of utility,
dependability, and safety. This instrument is powerful enough to serve
adequately in the advanced laboratories and in directed student research. The
new interlocks and remote computer control help ensure the safety of the
students and protect the equipment from abuse.
