This project continues an on-going series of active experiments utilizing a Very
Low Frequency (VLF) radio transmitter at Siple Station, Antarctica. These wide
ranging experiments study the interaction of electromagnetic waves with plasmas,
and in particular the interaction of waves with the energetic particles in the
Van Allen radiation belts. the Siple VLF transmitter is located in the antarctic
ice sheet so that the long wire antennas are effectively over a kilometer above
the surface. This permits a relatively high efficiency for the transmission of
the waves. The magnetically conjugate point is at Lake Mistissini, Que. Both
facilities are equipped with receivers for the transmitted and modified VLF
waves as well as a number of other diagnostic instruments. The experimenters
also use VLF instrumentation on several spacecraft. These experiments are among
the very few active experiments on space plasmas and are important for
understanding the ionosphere and magnetosphere. They also are important for
understanding astrophysical plasmas and laboratory plasmas for fusion machines.
In addition the knowledge gained has application to VLF/ELF/ULF communications
systems used for national security.
