This award is in support of fundamental research into the astrophysics of
ionized nebulae. Dr. Ferland is one of the leading investigators working on
numerical simulations of radiative transfer in astrophysical plasmas, and his
code has been used by many astronomers to understand the physical conditions in
astrophysical plasmas. This research will extend his already powerful code in
directions necessary for a fuller understanding of the broad line regions of
quasars.
