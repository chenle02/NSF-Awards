The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) was formed in the fall of
1982. It has held three meetings during each of 1982-83 and 1983-84. In each of
1984-85, 1985-86, 1986- 87, 1987-88, and 1988-89 at least four meetings were
held. The seminar covers a broad spectrum of mathematical logic with particular
emphasis on complexity theory and theoretical computer science, models of
arithmetic, model theory and model theoretic algebra, set theory, sub-systems of
analysis (the "reverse mathematics" program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson) and
topos theory.
