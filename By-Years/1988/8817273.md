The time evolution of the surface gravity wave field will be studied by
combining a comprehensive field program in the Bight of Abaco with a fully non-
linear model. The investigation began with the development of a two-dimensional
wave array to measure the evolution of the wave spectrum and the meteorological
forcing by the wind. Secondly, a new approach was developed for treating the
non-linear wave-wave interaction term to provide better resolution of the energy
transport and a more efficient scheme for evaluating the effect of the
interactions on wave evolution. The present effort consists of a pilot field
program in the spring of 1989 to be followed by a full experiment one year
later. On the modeling topic, an adjoint model necessary to optimize a
systematic expansion of the unknown source terms will be constructed. %%% This
project couples a field program to measure the response of the surface ocean
wave field to meteorological forcing with an attempt to develop a model
incorporating the physical processes. At present, a non-linear wave evolution
model has been developed, but required either massive computational effort, or a
truncation to an overly simplified representation. This effort examines an
alternate representation to the non-linear terms, which, if successful, would
permit an inversion of the data to better understand the physical processes at
work producing the wave field. The subsequent effort would then lead to a
predictive model of the surface wave field forced by meteorological variables
available from satellite or other techniques.
