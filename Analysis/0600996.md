Three projects are proposed. The first one is on a new approach to the analysis
of the dynamics described by the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes system. Such
system is being considered as an infinite dimensional dynamical system in
Fourier space. The second one is on ergodic properties of internal exchange
transformations, in particular the properties of weak mixing of flows on two-
dimensional surfaces and their applications, especially to number theory. The
last project is on the statistical version of the (3x+1)-problem.

The development of mathematical theory of Navier-Stokes system can lead to
better understanding of mechanisms of development of singularities in other
important non-linear systems of equations, in particular, the prediction of
tornados. The (3x+1)-problem will have connections and applications to number
theory. The PI will also actively involve in training and mentoring graduate
students and postdoctoral associates.
