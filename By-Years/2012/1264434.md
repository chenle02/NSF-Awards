The research will involve three laboratories at the BU Photonics Center
(Rothschild, Erramilli and Han) and utilize advanced spectroscopic and
biophysical/bioengineering techniques along with collaborators at UC Davis
Center for Biophotonics, MIT, Harvard University, and University of Texas. A
central feature of the research will be the use of time-resolved FTIR difference
spectroscopic, ultra-fast laser spectroscopy and confocal near-IR Raman
techniques to measure molecular changes in optogenetic rhodopsins upon light
excitation on a time-scale of seconds to femtoseconds. Preliminary work has
demonstrated that a variety of optogenetic rhodopsins can be reconstituted into
proteolipid membranes including nanolipidparticles and studied using advanced
spectroscopic methods to obtain detailed molecular information about their
function. In addition, spectroscopic studies have been extended to living cells
allowing these proteins to be studied in their native environment in order to
determine molecule effects of such factors as membrane potential. Collaborators
on this project include: Dr. Ed Boyden at MIT, widely recognized as one of the
co-founders of optogenetics and a leading developer of new neurophotonic
technology; Dr. Matt Coleman at UCD, who has developed methods of expressing
rhodopsins into nanolipidparticles (NLPs) and forming microcrystals suitable for
coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI), Dr. John Spudich, at the U. Texas
Med. School, a pioneer in the field of microbial rhodopsins and co-discoverer of
channelrhodopsins and Dr. Adam Cohen, whose laboratory at Harvard University has
recently demonstrated that rhodopsins can be used to monitor transmembrane
voltage in living nerves.
