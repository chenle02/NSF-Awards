9402357 Junku The workshop's goal is to provide a forum for open discussions on
a number of issues with significant impact on the future progress in the field
of underwater robotic systems. The objectives of the workshop are: (1) To
summarize the current state-of-the-art in underwater robotics; (2) To discuss
application areas with potential for immediate as well as long-term benefits and
impact; (3) To identify critical issues and challenging problems in underwater
robotics; (4) To initiate an effective mechanism for communication and
cooperation between different groups; and (5) To provide recommendations on
future research directions in underwater robotics. We would also like to discuss
the role of federal and local governments in addressing technical and scientific
competitiveness of the subject area. The workshop will produce not only
recommendations for future research directions, but also exploration of
potential applications. Research in underwater robotics can be enhanced by
establishing proper channels for communication and technology transfer between
different groups and optimizing efficiency of available resources.
