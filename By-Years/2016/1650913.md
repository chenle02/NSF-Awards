Streaming data over networks have become ubiquitous in today?s world. A
fundamental question is how to detect change-points (over time and space) from
network streaming data as quickly as possible. This arises from a wide range of
applications including geophysical exploration, social network surveillance,
power network monitoring, multi-sensor systems for smart cities, as well as
cyber security. Currently, not much is known about how to model these data, how
to design an algorithm through a rigorous theoretical framework, how to
implement algorithms efficiently online, and how fast we can detect the change
with false alarms under control. The proposed research will address these
fundamental theoretical and algorithmic questions. The efforts will lead not
only to novel technological advances but also help with a much wider
interdisciplinary audience in related fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
overarching research objective of this project is to develop a modeling and
algorithmic framework with theoretical performance guarantees for sequential
change-point detection over networks. This bridges the fundamental gap between
the statistical and computational approaches. Regarding modeling, the proposed
work aims to capture complex dependence of network streaming data and exploit
the structure of changes in the network setting. Regarding algorithm design, the
goals include efficient online implementation, scalability to high
dimensionality, and adaptiveness to data dynamics. Regarding theory, the goals
are to establish optimality and to characterize the fundamental performance
tradeoff between false alarms and detection delay. The proposed research will
build on recent progress in modeling complex network data such as network point
processes and correlation networks, algorithmic development such as sequential
optimization, sketching, community detection, and subspace tracking, as well as
theoretical advances in studying tail probabilities and extremal value theory.
