The research seeks to extend the effective use of binary decision diagrams
(BDDs), which have already proved an effective method for symbolically
representing and manipulating Boolean functions. A number of researchers
worldwide have found novel applications of BDDs to such areas as synthesis,
formal verification, and testing of digital circuits. Extensions to allow more
compact forms and to represent the behavior of arithmetic circuits have improved
the performance and extended the range BDDs, leading to a broader class of those
diagrams. The U.S. and German group collaborating in this effort have had a
synergistic relationship, with each group building on the work of the other.
This new effort will enable a more formal collaboration between the two groups.
