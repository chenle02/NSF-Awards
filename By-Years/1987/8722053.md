Polar bears undergo a period of fasting in the summer and autumn, when sea-ice
melting makes seals functionally unavailable as a food source. Pregnant polar
bears also fast overwinter, which reduces the food- intake period to only 4
months/year for this group. While polar bears do not undergo true hibernation,
preliminary data for both polar and black bears collected by Nelson suggests
that polar bears have a faculative ability to withstand absence of food for long
periods and at any time of the year by conserving body protein. Nelson now
proposes to document clearly that protein recycling metabolic pathways are in
operation in free-ranging polar bears, determine under what conditions of food
availability this adaptation to fasting is invoked, compare the metabolic
pathways involved in conserving protein with those determined for hibernating
black bears, and consider the ecological framework in which facilitated fasting
is adopted by polar bears, especially with regard to how it affects their life-
history parameters. Results may offer significant insight into both medical and
ecological questions and will contribute important data for undestanding the
mechanisms used by mammals for conservation of body protein under a variety of
ecological conditions. An understanding of polar bear fasting metabolism may
also result in the development of useful heuristic models of starvation,
associated weight changes, body weight setpoints and the long-term effects of
dieting.
