This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
bioactive, high-strength contrast agents for use in orthopedic and bone implant
applications. There is a clear clinical need for improved contrast agents that
increase the strength, toughness and abrasion wear of bone-void fillers, improve
its biocompatibility and ability to promote the growth of healthy bone at the
bone/filler interface. The innovation addresses the current shortcomings and
aims to produce contrast agents that improve the mechanical properties, fatigue
life, wear abrasion, and bio-compatibility with living bone. The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the success rate of
total joint replacement surgeries, increase the implant lifetime and reduce the
rates of revision surgeries. Surgeries involving hip and knee replacements (and
other surgeries utilizing bone-void fillers) are rapidly increasing world-wide,
and the trend toward performing these surgeries on a younger patient population,
who will more likely require replacement surgeries, portends a massive increase
in their incidence in the coming decades.
