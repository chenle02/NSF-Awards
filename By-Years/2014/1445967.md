Data provenance involves determining the conditions under which information was
originally generated, as well as all subsequent modifications to that
information and the conditions under which those modifications were performed.
As systems become increasingly distributed and organizations become reliant on
cloud computing for processing their data, the need to securely manage and
validate the provenance of that data becomes critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project develops new frameworks for evaluating secure fine-grained provenance
collection and management in hosts. The research activities examine the
architectures and algorithms required to make the collection and management of
trustworthy provenance feasible at scale. We provide a general architecture for
collecting provenance at the kernel level and consider methods of reducing the
amount of provenance generated and managed while maintaining high-fidelity
provenance records. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project introduces a number of
optimizations to enable scalable and performant provenance collection, including
policy-based log reduction and provenance deduplication. The project's main
scientific contributions include (1) the development of Linux Provenance Modules
that provide complete provenance mediation within the Linux kernel; (2) the
design of policy-reduced provenance through the use of mandatory access control
policies to reduce the number of subjects and actions that are provenance-
generating events to those of interest in a system; and (3) techniques for
deduplication of provenance such that minimal records for commonly occurring
events can be stored and later fully reconstructed. We will demonstrate that our
approach makes provenance collection practical at scale, enabling more secure
and trustworthy computing environments.
