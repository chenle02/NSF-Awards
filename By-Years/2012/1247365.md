This award will provide support for a satellite workshop to the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), to be held in Dallas, TX on August
4-9, 2013. The goal of the workshop is to explore subfields in cognitive science
that hold the most promise for increasing our understanding of neural networks
and computational intelligence.

The IJCNN explores the theoretical and computational understanding of the brain
in order to develop new and more effective forms of machine intelligence.
Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and
mental processes. The workshop is intended to foster more effective integration
between the two communities. The workshop will provide a venue in which neural
network researchers and students can learn more about the state of the art in
cognitive science and its interface with computational intelligence. The broader
impacts of the workshop include fostering new collaborations between neural
network researchers and those working in other areas of cognitive science. In
addition, it provides for reduced registration for women and other scientists
underrepresented in the field.
