The search for high temperature optimal superconductors is motivated by the
immense impact such discoveries would have on the electrical power transmission
and storage, transportation, communication systems etc. This elaborate effort
thrives on the availability of experts scientists, combining skills from
materials synthesis to complex electronic, magnetic and structural
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for junior
researchers to attend a joint US-China Winter School on Superconductivity held
in Hong Kong January 21-23, 2013. The workshop will feature attendance and
invited talks by many prominent scientists from both United States and China. By
bringing young scientists together for the winter school, they will have a
unique opportunity to learn about the century-long history of superconductivity,
as well as experimental and theoretical developments both in the context of
conventional and unconventional superconductors. The interactions are likely to
catalyze future collaborations between graduate and postdoctoral students from
US and China, two of the most active and successful communities currently
involved in the search for optimal superconductors.
