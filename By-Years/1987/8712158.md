A new scientific documentary film dealing with the Gulf Stream and the North
Atlantic subtropical gyre will be prepared by Peace River Films. This
documentary is intended to inform the public of the historical, present, and
expected future importance of the Gulf Stream in economic, social, political,
military, and, especially, scientific terms. The film will focus on scientific
observation and study of the Gulf Stream, describing research now underway and
planned for this important current system and how new technological developments
are aiding these studies. The Federal agency portion of the overall funding
support for the film will permit augmentation of the film to include special
educational features, including animated sequences to explain the oceanographic
characteristics of, and processes going on within, the Gulf Stream and its
adjacent ocean areas.
