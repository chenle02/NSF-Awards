Recent experiments at the Michigan State cyclotron, the SPS at CERN, and future
experiments at RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory promise to create
conditions where enough heat is supplied to dissolve nuclear matter into
constituent protons and neutrons at cyclotron energies, and to vaporize the
matter into constituent quarks and gluons at the large facilities. At these
higher energies, the structure of the vacuum itself should actually melt for a
brief instant throughout the nuclear volume. Since these collisions result in
the emission of thousands of subatomic particles from a single event, the
promise of various experimental observables and signals depends crucially on
experimental details regarding the geometry, acceptance and resolution of the
detectors. By collaborating closely with experimental groups and by carefully
modeling the collisions and the experimental response, we hope to resolve
several outstanding questions regarding the nature of these fundamental phase
transitions.
