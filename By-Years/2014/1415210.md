This award supports an NSF/CISE CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop, to be held as
a one-day event in March 2014 in Arlington, VA. The workshop will introduce
junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program and provide them with invaluable
insights from past awardees and NSF program managers on features of effective
CAREER proposals. The objective is to better equip junior faculty to write
effective, ultimately successful, CAREER proposals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
NSF CAREER program is central to NSF efforts to identify, foster and support the
nation's most promising junior faculty in research and education. It is well
known that junior faculty have had limited experience on grant writing and few
opportunities of interaction with NSF program directors. As many faculty learn
during their careers, the opportunity to obtain direct insights and feedback
from grant awardees and NSF program directors is invaluable to learning how to
write effective, ultimately successful, grant proposals. The purpose of this
workshop is to provide such a venue for junior faculty to help them jumpstart
their academic careers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A limited number of scholarships
will be made available for HBCU and other minority faculty, including women, to
attend the workshop. The workshop will be a unique opportunity for such faculty
to network with recent NSF CAREER awardees. This will enhance the overall
research capabilities of HBCU and other minority faculty to perform cutting-edge
research. Additionally, presentation materials (slides, videos, etc.) from the
panel sessions will be made available on the workshop website for other junior
faculty to download; this will allow the impact of this workshop to reach beyond
the direct participants to other junior faculty nationwide.
