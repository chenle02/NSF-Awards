This grant is for a workshop to examine the current state of understanding of
the properties of the Tau lepton. The reports will be presented by experimenters
and theorists from institutions around the world. It is the second workshop on
the subject, the first having taken place in 1990 in Orsay, France. The
organizers expect an attendance of about 120 physicists.
