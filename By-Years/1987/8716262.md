How a newly translated linear polypeptide folds into a functional native
protein is the central issue in protein biochemistry today. The purpose of the
proposed research is to delineate the mechanism by which the subunits of
bacterial luciferase fold and assemble into the functional heterodimeric enzyme
in vivo. Genes for the two subunits, luxA and luxB, have been cloned and
expressed in E. coli. Thus, the subunits can be easily prepared. Moreover, their
structures can be readily altered by oligonucleotide-directed site specific
mutagenesis. The ease with which low light intensities can be measured permits
the detection of specific activites in mutants over a range of six orders of
magnitude. Thus, the luciferase heterodimer provides an ideal system for
studying the principles which govern protein folding in vivo. In this project
mutants of the subunits will be prepared, and the way they combine to form
active enzyme will be analyzed through kinetic and physical characterization of
the folding and assembly process.
