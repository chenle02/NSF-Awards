ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to
support the participation of student attendees at the&lt;br/&gt;International
Limnogeology Congress, to be held in Tucson, Arizona, Mar 29-Apr. 2, 2003. The
congress is intended to promote interaction between specialists in all aspects
of the study of the geology of lake deposits. Specialists in geochronology,
sedimentology,&lt;br/&gt;paleoecology, paleoclimatology and sedimentary
geochemistry will all be in attendance at the meeting, which is expected to draw
approximately 200 participants. Cross-fertilization of ideas at conferences such
as this are critical for graduate students at an early stage of career, both in
establishing a wide network of contacts (both in the US and internationally) and
in efficiently showcasing their work to a key element of the scientific
community. We request sufficient funds to defer registration costs and provide
partial travel support for approximately 10 students. Selection criteria for
student support grants will be based on both relevance of the student's research
work to the general conference goals, and on evidence from the student
(advisor's letter of support and personal statement) indicating the quality and
significance of the work to be presented.&lt;br/&gt;
