This award will support planning by the Institute for Science, Space and
Technology to establish a new alliance in American science and engineering. The
principal purpose of this alliance is to form academic-business-government
partnerships that advance minority interest, access and participation in
science, engineering and technology. The award supports formation of a
Washington based non-profit organization affiliated with the Congressional Black
Caucus and science and engineering programs in minority institutions,
particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities, educational
associations, minority technical businesses, minority civic organizations,
government R&amp;D agencies, minority public officials and major scientific
organizations.
