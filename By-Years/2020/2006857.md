Public-key cryptosystems are protocols that enable secure communication, even if
the communicating parties have never met before. Such cryptosystems are
essential to the modern Internet, where a majority of all communication is now
encrypted. However, all public-key cryptosystems in widespread use today would
be breakable by large-scale quantum computers. This fact, combined with recent
rapid progress on quantum computing, has motivated the development and
standardization of quantum-secure cryptosystems based on geometric objects
called lattices, which will likely be in widespread use in the near future. This
project will inform and strengthen understanding of the security of lattice-
based cryptosystems, aiding ongoing standardization efforts for quantum-secure
cryptography and the adoption of advanced, socially beneficial tools like
encrypted computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The security of lattice-based
cryptosystems is based on the apparent intractability---even for quantum
computers---of a few main computational problems on lattices. Sufficiently
strong complexity results for these problems would allow for very efficient
implementations of lattice based cryptosystems that simultaneously ensure high
levels of security. The objective of this project is to work toward such results
by showing improved hardness of approximation and fine-grained complexity
results for these central problems, and to show tighter cryptographic reductions
between problems assuming realistic adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
