With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Collum of Cornell
University will investigate the dynamic effects of ligating solvents on the
reactivity of alkyl lithium complexes. Since these reagents are commonly used in
organic syntheses, this research will have a significant impact. The efficient
use of natural resources for the synthesis of materials and medicinal drugs
requires a series of reagents. Optimization and understanding of these reactions
provides a more efficient process which preserves resources. Since alkyl lithium
is often used, its reaction characteristics are of immediate interest. This is a
very significant investigation.
