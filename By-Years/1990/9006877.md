The taxonomic classification of the southern hemisphere plant family
Proteaceae, distributed in Australia, South Africa, and South America, is based
largely upon morphological features of the flowers and fruits. About 67 genera
and 1450 species are currently recognized. To test the classification of these
plants with new data, Dr. Sylvia Feuer of DePaul University is investigating the
pollen structure and sculpturing of representative samples using light- and
electron-microscopy. Fine details of the pollen wall surface and wall layering
are being analyzed with cryosections and with transmission electron microscopy,
to obtain information useful in determining equivalent features for comparison
among pollen from different genera. Patterns of pollen wall structure and
sculpture are expected to be similar among closely related groups of taxa, and
to exhibit recognizable trends of evolutionary change. Differences among pollen
grains of this family that are being described by Dr. Feuer will also allow
determination of the correct taxonomic association of dispersed fossil pollens.
Grains thought to be from Proteaceae occur in deposits in the northern
hemisphere, far outside the current geographic range of the family. Accurate
determination of their taxonomic status is prerequisite to resolution of the
historical biogeography of these plants and to further analysis of climatic and
other controls on plant distribution.
