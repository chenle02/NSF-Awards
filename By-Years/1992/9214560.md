This is a proposal to purchase a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer. This is proposed as a part of a comprehensive upgrade of NMR
instrumentation at the College of Staten Island - City University of New York.
The 300 MHz widebore instrument will be used primarily for static and magic-
angle spinning solid-state experiments. The equipment will be operated and
maintained by CSI staff for the benefit of researchers at CSI, Hunter college,
and other CUNY campuses.
