This research will examine the global extinction of the Inoceramidae. The work
will focus on the stratigraphic distribution of both clam fragments in deep sea
cores and body fossils from land based sections. In addition, sedimentological
observations will be used to try to constrain possible forcing mechanisms for
the extinction. The major pulse of the Inoceramidae extinction seems to have
occurred at least two million years prior to the K/T boundary event. This work,
thus, should provide information regarding ecological conditions prior to an
event which resulted in the extinction of over 50% of all species on earth.
