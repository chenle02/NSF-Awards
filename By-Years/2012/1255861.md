As transistors get smaller, they become increasingly susceptible to variations
in their timing characteristics. One way to deal with possible variations is to
assume worst-case characteristics during hardware design. Unfortunately, the
power and performance costs of worst-case design are becoming prohibitive.
Consequently, processor designers have sought more aggressive design styles that
permit better-than-worst-case operation. One such approach uses "canary
circuits" that indicate when a processor is on the verge of unsafe operation due
to variations. This research investigates "software canaries" - software
routines that exercise the most susceptible circuits of a processor to determine
an aggressive safe operating point. Software canaries enable all the benefits of
hardware canary circuits, without the corresponding hardware overhead. More
importantly, they may provide additional benefits as they can track aging and
temperature - variations that may be indistinguishable to hardware canary
circuits. Furthermore, unlike hardware canary circuits, they allow identifying
the most aggressive operating point on a per application basis. This research
focuses on exploring the benefits of software canaries, developing use cases,
developing techniques for building software canaries for different
microarchitectures, and developing microarchitecture and system support needed
to support software-canary-based execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of the research lies in enabling computing systems with significantly
lower energy consumption by selecting aggressive operating points. Other
specific impacts include development of open source tools that may be used for
further work by other research groups, and a greater discussion of variations
and energy efficiency in graduate and undergraduate coursework.
