The predictions made by classical linear shell theories on the deformation or
critical buckling load of thin structures often fail to match the actual
performance of such physical structures. Among the several phenomena that may be
responsible for this failure is so-called "sensitivity to imperfections," or the
highly oscillatory nature of energy minimizers resulting in non-compactness even
in very simple geometries like cylinders. The imperfection sensitivity
phenomenon poses an ongoing challenge to engineers working with a wide range of
thin-shelled structures, from aircraft and automotive components, buildings,
poles, and other civil infrastructures, to carbon nanotubes and biopolymer
shells. One of the goals of this project is to use the general theory of
buckling of thin structures to quantify the imperfection sensitivity phenomenon.
Another goal is to solve the longstanding problem of determining the rigidity of
a given shell, which is believed to be identified by the principal curvatures of
the shell.

While the problem of determining the rigidity of plates is well understood,
determining the rigidity of a given shell has been a longstanding problem in
continuum mechanics. Recent results on shells in the linear elasticity setting,
with vector fields satisfying Robin boundary conditions on the thin face of the
shell, provide evidence that the rigidity of a shell is determined solely by the
principal curvatures of the shell's mid-surface. One of the goals of the project
is to extend ansatz-free lower bounds to the nonlinear geometric rigidity
setting. The strategy is to use existing estimates inducing artificial boundary
conditions by test functions as well as a universal Korn interpolation
inequality, which reduces the linear geometric rigidity estimate to a Poincar?
type estimate. Once this is done, a new hierarchy of shell theories with smaller
gaps will naturally follow, which will encompass the existing ones derived by
Gamma-convergence. The second part of the project is to further develop the
theory of buckling of thin structures. The theory has two ingredients: (i)
proving sharp Korn's inequalities, and (ii) proving the existence of bending-
free trivial branches. While (i) has been almost entirely done in previous work,
(ii) is the goal of the second part of the project. The investigator and
collaborators will adopt the approach of quantitative implicit function theorems
and quantitative approximation of nonlinear elasticity solutions by the ones in
the linear setting.
