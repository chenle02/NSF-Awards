In view of their large potential climate impacts, the role of cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) in determining the global distribution of clouds and
their optical properties is of great current interest, but is not yet well
understood. Insight into the nature of the steady states attainable in the
marine boundary layer will be obtained by simulating the interactions between
aerosols, clouds, and radiation using a simple model that describes the key
components of the system in a parameterized way. The boundary- layer cloud model
to be developed, implemented, and tested includes: (1) A physically based
parameterization of CCN sources, sinks, and transports; (2) A parameterization
of boundary-layer cloud formation and dissipation, including the effects of
drizzle formation as regulated by the predicted CCN; and (3) A parameterization
of radiative transfer in the cloudy boundary layer, including both solar and
terrestrial radiation, and taking into account the cloud particle number density
and size distribution and the cloud liquid water content. A case study from the
1992 Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) will be selected and
used to test the model. The proposed study will provide a foundation for future
work to incorporate CCN physics into general circulation models.
