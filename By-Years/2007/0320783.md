With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Tufts University will purchase an electrospray
ionization (ESI) Mass Spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization (APCI) source. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including a) chemical synthesis of phosphorylated inositol-containing
oligosaccharides relevant to biological signal transduction; b) studies on the
influence of interfacial chemistry and primary sequence on protein conformation,
self-assembly, and mesophase formation in fibrous proteins; c) self-assembly and
de novo design of peptides and proteins; the design of selective, efficient
switchable receptors, reagents and catalysts based on transition metal
complexes; and e) the assembly of filaments and ribozyme selection.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. It is one of the
fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques.
Because of this, it is critically important for undergraduate and graduate
students to be exposed to the technique. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, especially biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
