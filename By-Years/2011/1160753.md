1160753&lt;br/&gt;van Geen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports development
of new drilling and sampling technology to recover uncompromised aquifer
sediment simultaneously with groundwater and to make this technology available
to the scientific community under the auspices of the International Continental
Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). The development engages an academic-private
partnership to build and test a prototype Peltier cooler based freeze core
system designed to recover in situ, unconsolidated aquifer matrix and fluids to
depths of 300 m for subsequent geochemical and sedimentological analysis. Upon
completion of the development, the freeze core system will be deployed in a
ICDP-funded project to study the provenance and redox controlled geochemical
processes associated with the subsurface transport and fate of arsenide species
and ultimately would be available to the broader science community for
groundwater geochemical and microbiological investigations
globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
