The planned Texas A&amp;M University site of the Next-Generation Photovoltaics
(NGPV) I/UCRC will seek to address the major challenge facing the solar industry
which is no longer the cost of the cell, but rather the cost of the rest of the
"system" that is needed to interface the cells, which generate low-voltage
direct current, to the electric utility grid, which operates with high-voltage
alternating current. The proposed research site will integrate Texas A&amp;M
faculty with expertise in power electronics, materials, grid infrastructure and
design, public policy and safety with industry stakeholders in complimentary
energy sectors to transform PV into a safe, affordable, and reliable source of
electricity. Collaboration among university and industry experts from solar
cells to grid promises to enhance the PV market space through significant
advances in knowledge and widespread adoption of PV energy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient, low-cost, and dependable electricity generated
from photovoltaics can be this century's electrification project and will lift
the standard of living and quality of life in the developing world. The
capability and knowledge generated by the NGPV Center can support PV as an
export industry for the US - not through manufacturing components, but instead
by providing energy solutions. The proposed research site at Texas A&amp;M will
leverage public interest in renewable energy to attract students into the field
of energy and power electronics. Dissemination and education plans include:
scientific collaboration through conference participation, undergraduate and
graduate student research, creation of a teaching module and curriculum, and
community activities such as "Solar Saturday" to showcase the existing campus
30kW PV demonstration system.
