University of Southern California The research will investigate the influence of
urban population diversity-cultural, economic, socio-demographic and ethico-
political-on the formation of attitudes toward animals. Attitudes toward animals
are critical to understand, because they underpin the social construction of
animals and animality by human society. The initial goals are to refine a
conceptual framework for understanding urban population diversity and attitudes
toward animals, based on current theoretic approaches and a meta analysis of
past studies. In addition, the spectrum of attitudes and behaviors toward
various types of animals and the dimension of urban diversity which may be
related to attitudes toward animals will be identified. Expert interviews and
focus groups will be carried out to discover information on attitudes, behaviors
and conflict. This information then will be utilized to design a survey
instrument which allows a description of attitudinal variation with respect to
animals. In addition the research will develop a conceptual typology of local
animal management institutions and urban animal social movement organizations to
inform the design of appropriate methodologies for larger scale data collection
efforts and criteria for case study selection.
