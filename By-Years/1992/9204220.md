Phases II research will provide a knowledge base for developing new generation
anti-reflective coating products using intrinsically absorbing polymer
materials. It will establish how molecular structure affects the optical,
physical, processibility properties of the polymers in real life lithographic
conditions. Intrinsically absorbing polymer films for anti-reflective coatings
(ARC) applications is a significant technological advance over dyed polymer
systems. By increasing optical density and eliminating resist mixing problems,
this new approach allows ARC technology to be extended into I-line and DUV
lithography.
