This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, examines the surface structure, defect structure, and surface chemistry
of the semiconducting metal oxides TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO. Using scanning probe
microscopy, coupled with UHV electron spectroscopic methods, a detailed
understanding of the effects of surface and defect structure on the surface
chemistry of these important materials is obtained. Professor Ulrike Diebold and
her group in the Department of Physics at Tulane University are applying this
information to the development of novel gas sensing devices.

High temperature semiconducting oxide sensors are used in a variety of gas
sensing and monitoring applications. The detailed understanding of the surface
structure and surface chemistry of these oxide materials is crucial to the
design of robust sensors in these applications. Professor Diebold's studies of
the surface structure and chemistry of this class of materials is providing this
information and understanding.
