Research, primarily experimental, will be focused on the various instability
phenomena which occur for thin liquid films flowing over a solid surface. Non-
linear interaction between solitary waves, three-dimensional wave patterns, and
the growth of spatial and temporal disorder will be investigated. Film thickness
observations will be used to test various current methods and theories for the
representation and analysis of spatially and temporally complex data. Film flow
instabilities are of intrinsic interest in a variety of technologies. In
addition, films are an excellent testing ground of emerging ideas involving
disorder and noise, and useful diagnostics to extract meaningful information
from disordered systems. Thus the applicability is wider than only to thin
films. ***//
