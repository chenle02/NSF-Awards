The Carnegie Museum of Natural History houses one of the most comprehensive
bird collections in the New World. During the past ten years, support from the
National Science Foundation has improved research access to these collections
through the installation of compactorized storage cabinets and implementation of
a computerized specimen database. Origianl data entry was from collection
ledgers, and the essential step of verifying the accuracy of the computer
records against individual specimens is now commencing. When data verification
has been completed, the Carnegie Museum Ornithological Collections will be
highly accessible to the entire community of systematic and evolutionary
biologists. Modernization of natural history collections such as the bird
holdings in the Carnegie Museum serve a wide research community. This computer
database will not only serve collection managers and curators, it will
facilitate more active use of the collections and data for a variety of
projects. Land management decisions, environmental impact analyses, natural
resource conservation, and the full spectrum of evolutionary studies can benefit
from this collection database.
