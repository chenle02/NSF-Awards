Bytes Tran The research issue is representing and reasoning about interactive
discourse during a human-computer natural language interaction. During an
interaction, a computational system must be able to take conversational control
and release control to another participant to simulate the turn- taking that
takes place in task-oriented interactions. In addition to representing and
reasoning about when to take control, an artificial agent (a computational
system) must know how to signal what it is doing through its choice of content
and linguistic cues. The system must also be able to recognize when the human
participant is taking control and reason about whether or not to allow it. Three
problems will be addressed in this investigation: reasoning about control,
representing discourse to accommodate conversational role change, and
producing/interpreting linguistic cues that indicate who has control. Methods
that will be applied to development of a model are use of a uniform
representation for domain and discourse information, and reification of
conversational roles as collaborative modes. As part of the p roposed planning
period, a prototype model will be developed, implemented, and evaluated using
two different application domains: an interactive spreadsheet and a medical
tutoring system. It is unquestioned that natural language is a useful tool for
for human- computer interaction. The ability to interact in natural language
provides a flexible and efficient means of communication to systems that are
becoming increasingly complex to use because of their capabilities
