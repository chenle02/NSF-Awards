Bacterial denitrification is the major pathway by which organic nitrogen is
returned to the atmosphere. The process involves a series of enzymes and
electron donors, which reduce nitrate to molecular nitrogen. The objective of
this award is to define the structure and function of two nitrite reductases
which are key components of the system. One is a tetraheme cytochrome and the
other a non-heme copper protein. The genes of the two enzymes will be cloned.
Crystals of the enzymes will be prepared and their 3 dimensional structure
determined. A tremendous amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil is
lost by bacterial denitrification. Results of this research will help us
understand how this process takes place at the molecular level, and may enable
us to devise strategies to reduce denitrification and thus cut down the amount
of pollution caused by fertilizer run-off.
