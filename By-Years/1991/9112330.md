The research proposed here concerns the properties of two classes of physical
systems: flux-line arrays in type II superconductors and complex classical
liquids. The work on flux-line arrays mainly focuses on equilibrium and
dynamical properties of flux-line liquids, with the object to make contact with
experiments. The work on liquids aims to gain a better understanding of the role
of compositional disorder and orientation correlations in governing the
structural relaxation in dense fluids. This will be achieved by studying
specific model systems, namely hard sphere mixtures and rod models for nematics.
