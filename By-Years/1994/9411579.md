9411579 Morse The Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale University
proposes to purchase a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation 10 Model 41 computer
workstation which will be dedicated to support research in systems engineering
at Yale. The computer will be used by students and post doctoral fellows within
a research group headed by A.S. Morse. The machine will be used as a research
tool in conjunction with projects in the areas of self-adjusting, intelligent
and hybrid dynamical systems. The computer will be used primarily for simulation
studies, for system synthesis, for software development, and for graphic and
visualization applications. ***
