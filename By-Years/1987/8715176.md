Reciprocal interactions between granivorous animals and seeds can have
important consequences in arid ecosystems. However, the specific behavioral
responses of granivores to seed resource characteristics are poorly understood.
A series of studies that combine field investigations at three spatial scales
and simulation modelling will address the interactions between an important
shrub-steppe granivore, the western harvester ant, and its seed resources.
Studies range from a mechanistic analysis of individual ant foraging behavior in
native seed patches to measuring various aspects of colony organization and
patterns of resource use. An integration of behavioral and resource-based
approaches will improve our understanding of interactions that are widespread
among arid environments.
