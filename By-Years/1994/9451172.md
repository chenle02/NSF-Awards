9451172 Johnson This proposal requests funding for an Electro-Magnetic
Interference (EMI) emissions apparatus. The requested laboratory equipment will
provide practical experience in measuring EMI emissions from design projects
constructed by students in the Electrical Engineering Technology program. The
analysis of data obtained from the measurements will lead to examples of
corrective action required in a product development and manufacturing
environment. This project will serve as a national model for integration of EMI
measurements into Electrical Engineering Technology programs. The project
addresses a need to provide engineering technology students with an awareness of
environmental issues and to engage them in finding solutions to the problems.
