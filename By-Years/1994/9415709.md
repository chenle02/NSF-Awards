9415709 Swinney This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between dr. Harry Swinney, University of Texas, Austin, and Dr.
Francisco Melo, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, on the physics of granular
flow. The researchers will conduct experiments on the formation of two-
dimensional spatial patterns in vertically oscillated granular materials. The
formation and evolution of the patterns will be studied using digital imaging
techniques and analyses will examine the effects of energy dissipation, air
pressure, particle size, and forcing on the collective motion . The goal of the
research is to develop new insights towards a full understanding of the
underlying mechanism in the formation of the spatial patterns in these granular
materials. Granular materials play an important role in industries such as
mining , agriculture, and construction, yet an understanding of the fundamental
processes governing the collective behavior of these materials is lacking. The
proposed collaborative research should make a fundamental contribution to the
understanding of the physics of granular flow, and should help in understanding
the role of parameters that are varied in industrial processes involving the
granular flow., ***
