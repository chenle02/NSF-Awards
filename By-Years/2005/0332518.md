ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0332518&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds for U.S.
scientists to travel to Yalta, Crimea, Ukraine to participate in the NATO
Advanced Research Workshop entitled "Past and Present Water Column Anoxia" to be
held October 4-8, 2003 has been requested. The primary objective of the workshop
is to facilitate exchange and communication between scientific groups from
different countries studying past and present anoxic conditions in pelagic
marine environments. The meeting will focus on the following four main topics:
(1) nutrient and metal cycling at the redox transition: (2) microbial ecology of
the oxic/anoxic interface; (3) biogeochemistry of anaerobic methane oxidation;
and (4) anoxia development and oceanic anoxic events in the past. It is
anticipated that approximately 8 participants from the United States will travel
to the Ukraine to attend the workshop. Costs for the participants to attend the
workshop will be covered by NATO grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
