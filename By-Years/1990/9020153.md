This project deals with aspects of descriptive set theory and its relationship
with analysis. These include (i) the study of the structure of Borel equivalence
relations, both in a general descriptive set theoretic context, as well as in
connection with specific situations arising in ergodic theory, as, for example,
with equivalence relations induced by orbits of group actions, and (ii)
definability and descriptive classification problems in harmonic analysis and
the theory of operator algebras.
