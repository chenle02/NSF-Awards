Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An auditory display utilizes sound to communicate
information to a user and offers an alternative means of visualization. By
harnessing the sense of hearing, audio rendering can further enhance a user's
experience in a multimodal virtual world. Acoustic realism has many areas of
applicability including virtual reality, computer gaming, training systems,
desktop interfaces, education, and scientific
visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are conducting an ambitious research
program to develop interactive auditory displays. Our goal is to develop new
algorithms for physics-based sound synthesis and sound propagation for
interactive applications including computer gaming, training systems, and
enabling technologies. The approach involves the fusion of both geometry (for
high frequencies) and physics (for low frequencies) to model sound propagation
and the development of techniques for acoustic levels of detail. To this end we
are developing efficient numerical algorithms based on domain decomposition and
exploiting modern architecture features to further accelerate the overall
performance. We are also evaluating the performance of our algorithms on
different applications. In addition to acoustic simulation, our research is
generating a fundamental scientific foundation and interactive performance
methods for solving wave/sound propagation problems in highly complex domains
that span many scientific and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
