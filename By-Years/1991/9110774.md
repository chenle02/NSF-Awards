The project involves the synthesis and characterization of the platinum
complexes of thiazole derivatives and subsequent studies of their binding to
nucleic acids and their constituents. This will be part of an undergraduate
research program at Trenton State College. A detailed examination of the
complexes by x-ray crystallography is planned. Additional work will include a
detailed analysis of their binding modes in order to elucidate the mechanism of
interaction with DNA. %%% Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had
prior independent Federal research support to develop a competitive research
proposal. This project involves the synthesis and characterization of platinum
organometallic compounds and their bonding to DNA.
