National reports over the last decade have focused on the need for change in the
way mathematics is taught at the elementary and secondary levels. The GeoSet
project supports the full development and dissemination of the curriculum and
pedagogy for a discovery-based course in geometry for prospective elementary
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry is an ideal course in which to model
discovery-learning and the use of technology for pre-service teachers. This
project draws on the experiences gained from a well-established course in
geometry for elementary teachers and an experienced team of project directors at
Oklahoma State University. Project materials support a cognitive level and
require a substantially higher level of participation than is normally the case
for the course audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of curricular and
pedagogical activities is supported by the prototype workbook-style text
currently being used. The intellectual merit is realized through the development
of materials that include: group activities, extensive writing, math-literature
connections, projects, construction with manipulatives, and mathematical
proofs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of "GeoSet" is realized through
the development, testing, and revision of innovative materials that targets pre-
service elementary teachers. In addition, these materials support innovative
professional development activities both as a basis of discovery-style pedagogy
and as a foundation to promote ongoing professional growth as teachers through a
lesson study model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
