The proposed research will investigate the origin of igneous rocks in the
Klamath Mountain province that are the remnants of two extensive arc systems.
Although the systems, the western Hayfork/Ironside Mountain complex and the
Rogue/Chetco complex, represent the most voluminous accretionary arcs in the
province, they have received little detailed petrologic study. Their origin will
be investigated with the use of detailed mapping and sampling, U-Pb (zircon)
geochronology, mineral analysis, bulk-rock elemental analysis, and isotopic
analysis of bulk samples and mineral separates. These data will be used to
estimate the composition of the source rocks, to model the effects of fractional
crystallization and crustal contamination, and to provide a means of comparing
the arc-related rocks with adjacent, well-studied, remnant arc and back-arc
magmatic systems. The results will be interpreted in the context of local and
regional tectonic activity and metamorphism, and will be used to compare
Mesozoic arc magmatism in the Klamath Mountain province with that elsewhere in
the North American Cordillera.
