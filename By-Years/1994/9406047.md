9406047 Brown The PIs will use high pressure experimental methods and
instrumentation to measure a full set of elastic constants using impulse
stimulated scattering, bulk compression, and crystal structure refinement using
x-ray diffraction methods on the same sample and in the same diamond anvil cell.
In this way, it may be possible to obtain an independent check on room
temperature elastic parameters and to extrapolate results to elevated
temperatures. Samples to be measured include natural and synthetic cubic garnets
of the pyrope-grossular-almandine ternary, olivines and pyroxenes. ****
