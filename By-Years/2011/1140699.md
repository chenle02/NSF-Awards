In this collaborative project Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University
of Massachusetts at Boston are joining forces to provide undergraduate students
with experience in computational modeling, simulation, and systems approaches to
biology. Using StarLogoTNG software, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, students can represent various levels of biological organization
from molecules to cells or even organisms. They can define the rules anticipated
to govern the behavior of the designated agents and compare the simulated
behavior to that observed experimentally. The closeness of fit estimates the
accuracy of the definition of the rules. Through hypothesis testing and
successive refinement of the simulation, the important rules are revealed. This
hands-on, team-project-oriented approach not only immerses students in engaging
learning but also provides an appreciation for the value of mathematics and
computational modeling in understanding biology. Ongoing evaluation measures how
successful these strategies are at influencing student learning in both a small,
private, technological institution and a large public university. Widespread
dissemination is anticipated.
