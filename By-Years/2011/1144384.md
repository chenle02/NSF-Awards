This project will investigate a little-studied and potentially important factor
in the development and maintenance of biological diversity in plant communities:
the spatial arrangement of individual plants. The investigators will study how
this factor may also control the productivity of communities and their
invasibility by new species of plants introduced by humans. While many
researchers have studied how altering the number and abundances of the species
in an area affects invasion and biomass production, few have considered how the
location of the individuals of each species affects these properties.
Researchers will experimentally establish tallgrass prairie communities with
contrasting spatial arrangements of individuals to determine the effects of
initial species pattern on invasion and production of biomass, and test whether
commonly reported effects of species number and abundance are instead
attributable to spatial patterns. The project will test previously
indistinguishable factors that affect invasion and biomass production in plant
communities and shed new light on the effects of altering plant diversity in
grasslands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include
strengthening the infrastructure and workforce for science, training of
students, public education, and potential applications to natural resource
management. The project will be the inaugural experiment for the University of
North Dakota (UND) Biology Experimental Field Station and support UND's research
and education focus in grassland ecology. The project will train graduate and
undergraduate students and findings from the study will inform grassland
restoration practices throughout the tallgrass prairie region. Laboratory
personnel will also participate in outreach projects with the Grand Forks County
Prairie Partners, a group dedicated to preserving and promoting citizen
understanding of the tallgrass prairie in the northern Great Plains.
