&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project STAMP - Science Technology
and Mathematics Partnerships - provides graduate fellows from the University of
Boston, from the departments of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and
Engineering, for educational activities with grade 6-12 students in the urban
and suburban Boston, Chelsea, Newton and Quincy school districts. External
partners include the Boston Museum of Science, the New England Aquarium, Melles
Griot (an optics company) and the New England Board of Higher Education. Nine
graduate students and four advanced undergraduates are supported per year. The
themes are investigation, experimentation and problem solving. Innovative
aspects include the use of a mobile laboratory as a capstone experience. The
wide variety of school districts participating illustrate the broader impacts of
this project as does the extensive use of the many resources available in the
Boston area. This project is partially supported with funds from the Directorate
for Mathematics and the Physical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project title:
