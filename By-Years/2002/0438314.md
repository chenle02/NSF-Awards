The proposal describes a DHT-based approach to constructing a scalable and
distributed information management system that aggregates information about
large scale networked systems. Such a system is envisioned to be a key enabler
of large-scale distributed applications through monitoring, querying and
reacting to changes in the state of the distributed system(s). A prototype will
be developed and experiments in collaboration with TACC are expected to enhance
grid infrastructure in the near-term with usable technology to improve data
replication, grid information systems, and distributed network monitoring. The
proposal addresses new scalability, flexibility, autonomy, and robustness
concerns raised by the tight integration of the aggregation tree abstraction
with the internal DHT structure. By providing the equivalent of a distributed
systems control backplane, middleware infrastructure should be greatly enhanced
and simplify distributed application development and use.
