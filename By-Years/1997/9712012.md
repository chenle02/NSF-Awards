9712012 Liu This grant provides partial support for acquisition of additional
ground penetrating radar (GPR) antennas, a workstation and a PC for the shallow
geophysics program at the University of Connecticut. Three GPR antennas at
frequencies of 25, 200 and 1000 MHz will be purchased to examine the attenuation
of GPR signals through various geological and structural environments. The
computers will be used for data acquisition and subsequent inversions and
modeling. Together with research support from a companion geophysics proposal,
the PI will develop a non-linear frequency dependence model for high resolution
GPR tomography of soils and the shallow crust and will investigate the
propagation of radar signals through inhomogeneous strata. The potential of
improved GPR tomographic techniques to problems of environmental significance
(i.e. mapping contaminated groundwater plumes) warrants continued development of
this geophysical technique. ***
