This research aims at developing a design methodology for sliding mode observers
for a class of nonlinear systems. The dual problem, that of sliding mode control
presents some very interesting features in that in principle it possesses ideal
robustness properties in the face of parametric uncertainty and disturbances. In
practice, however, control chattering has severely limited the method's
applicability. Observer design deals with the problem of reconstructing the
state vector from measurements of the system output. For nonlinear systems,
observers are currently designed using linearized techniques, particularly
extended Kalman filtering. It would be highly desirable to design observers that
directly account for the full nonlinear dynamics of the plant, as do sliding
mode controllers. This award will allow the exploration of the ideas described
above. In developing the theory and considering a simple practical example it
should be possible to determine if the appplication of sliding mode observers is
truly practical, or contains hidden difficulties.
