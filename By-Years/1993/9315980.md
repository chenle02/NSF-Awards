9315980 Derby Funded with a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, numerical
simulations are to be carried out of a process for growing single crystal
sheets. Finite element methods will be applied to a radiatively melted fluid
zone, contained by surface tension, in which a polycrystalline sheet is
subsequently reformed as a single crystal. Items to be examined are the shape of
the melt- crystal interface, the meniscus shape, the overall heat transfer, and
the overall process stability. The ability to grow single crystal semiconductor
materials directly in sheet form would permit drastic improvement in process
efficiency for the production of semiconductor wafers. ***
