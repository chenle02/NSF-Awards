This is a proposal requesting partial funding to purchase a vibrating sample
magnetometer for the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode
Island. The magnetometer will be used to measure the weak magnetization acquired
by sediments as they form under the influence of the ambient geomagnetic field.
Specific research projects that will benefit from the acquisition of the
magnetometer are: (1) High- resolution paleointensity studies of lake and marine
sediments for purposes of stratigraphic correlation, dating, and geomagnetic
source modeling, (2) Paleoenvironmental studies of lake and marine sediments,
and (3) Studies of diagenesis in lake and marine sediments.
