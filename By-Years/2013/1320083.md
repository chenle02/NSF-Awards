What does it mean to "understand" an image? One popular answer is simply naming
the objects seen in the image. During the last decade most computer vision
researchers have focused on this "object naming" problem. While there has been
great progress in detecting things like "cars" and "people", such a level of
understanding still cannot answer even basic questions about an image such as
"What is the geometric structure of the scene?" "Where in the image can I
walk"?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a geometric
and functional representation of our visual world for scene understanding. This
project aims to develop this functional representation by learning relationships
between the physical/visual representation of the scene and the space of the
interactions an agent can perform in that scene. The key advantage of functional
scene representation is that it is subjective, explicitly task-based and takes
into account the agent?s capabilities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is
anticipated to result in major advances within the image understanding
community, bringing it closer to researchers in robotics. It is anticipated to
result in improvements in: (a) 3D Scene Understanding; (b) Recognition; (c)
Human Activity Understanding, and hence could be a critical enabling technology
for applications such as autonomous systems, surveillance, and personal
robotics. This project is also expected to contribute to education through
course development, student projects, workshops, and tutorials involving a
broader audience as well as using popular online media (e.g., YouTube) and
interactive web demos to involve young children.
