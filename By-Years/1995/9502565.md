ABSTRACT CTS-9502565 Kevin Howell Texas A&amp;M University The molecular
thermodynamics of polymer blends and solutions will be investigated using new
liquid state theories, computer simulations and small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS). Integral-equation methods, such as PRISM theory, will be developed to
understand the interplay between chain conformations and phase behavior in
solutions. The computer simulations will employ the Gibbs ensemble approach to
study symmetric binary blends and osmotic equilibrium in polymeric solutions.
SANS experiments will probe the phase behavior of polyolefins as a function of
molecular weight, architecture and composition. The research may contribute to
improved processing of recycled plastics and development of advanced polymeric
materials. The educational plan includes revision of thermodynamics course and
introduction of a course in experimental design at the undergraduate level. New
graduate courses will be developed in statistical mechanics and polymer physics.
