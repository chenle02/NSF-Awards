The Chemistry Department is using an FTIR to catalyze a major revision of
laboratory and lecture courses in chemistry. This instrument is being used to
introduce basic spectrometry to students in teacher education programs, to
underclass liberal arts majors and to bachelor of science majors (including
chemistry and pre-professional majors) who in the past received no exposure to
this type of analysis. Students and faculty at the three private colleges and
three community colleges allied with Kansas Newman also have access to the FTIR.
Its application is being further expanded via workshops and advanced laboratory
experiences for secondary teachers and for high school students enrolled in the
Junior Academy of Science or in the Investigative Summer Science Program. The
FTIR is making possible major changes in upper level laboratory courses by
allowing fast, simple, and highly accurate analysis of all types of processes
and compounds.
