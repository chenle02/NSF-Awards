The primary goal of the STEM Evaluation Community project is to increase the
capacity of evaluators to produce high quality, conceptually sound,
methodologically appropriate evaluations of NSF programs and projects. The
project will contribute to the exploration of innovative new approaches for
determining the impact of NSF programs and projects, promote the usefulness of
NSF program and project evaluations, and help to expand the theoretical
foundations for evaluating STEM education, workforce, and outreach
initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM Evaluation Community will serve as a
focal point for evaluation capacity building with and across the NSF programs
that fund STEM education, workforce and outreach activities, bringing people and
ideas together, facilitating dialogue, sharing resources, offering opportunities
for dissemination and more. The resulting connected system of evaluators will
promote social innovation through a lively, dynamic evaluation professional
community in which NSF program and project evaluators will share their work,
learn from each other, and, ultimately, leverage and enhance the existing
evaluation capacity building infrastructure that has been developed for specific
NSF programs and audiences, thus charting a course to build further evaluation
capacity across NSF.
