PI: Lynne Billard&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS 9730906&lt;br/&gt;Project:
International Biometric Conference - Cape Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Biometric Conference is the
biennial meeting of the&lt;br/&gt;International Biometric Society, a Society
dedicated to the "advancement&lt;br/&gt;of biological science through the
development of quantitative theories and&lt;br/&gt;the application, development
and dissemination of effective mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and statistical
techniques". Members and conference participants are&lt;br/&gt;concerned with
the cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary interface of&lt;br/&gt;the
theoretical and application oriented real-world problems.
This&lt;br/&gt;proposal requests partial support for ten U.S.-based individuals
from&lt;br/&gt;academic and nonprofit institutions to participate in the
International&lt;br/&gt;Biometric Conference to be held in Cape Town, South
Africa, on December&lt;br/&gt;13-18,1998. About one third of those supported
will be those with an &lt;br/&gt;official capacity and two-thirds will be new
researchers especially those&lt;br/&gt;traditionally underrepresented groups
such as women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
