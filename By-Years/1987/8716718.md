The Ionosphere is the conducting region of the upper atmosphere produced by
absorbtion of solar ultraviolet light. It interacts strongly with radio waves
and reflects, refracts and absorbs them depending on the frequency. When
irradiated with sufficiently powerful radio waves of appropriate frequency it
will absorb sufficient power to become heated, form localised plasma density
enhancements, emit energetic electrons, and emit light. The approach being
explored under this award involves irradiation by two radio beams with closely
spaced frequencies, which are expected to produce ionospheric oscillations at
the beat frequency, and thus act as a radio transmitter for very low frequencies
without the need for a huge antenna on the surface. This work provides insights
into the fundamental physics of ionized media, and may have practical
applications for communication.
