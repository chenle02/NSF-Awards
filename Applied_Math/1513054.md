Waves in nature (for example, water waves or electromagnetic waves) can be
modeled by solutions of certain differential equations that incorporate various
physical processes into a mathematical framework that admits further detailed
study in principle. But even with such a wave equation in hand, there remains
the difficult task of deducing important information from the model, information
that is needed to solve important problems of engineering that motivate the
study of waves in the first place. One common approach is to use computers to
solve the equations (approximately). However, such an approach is limited in
scope to very concrete simulations involving particular initial conditions, and
it holds only in parameter ranges in which the numerical methods can be
accurate. On the other hand, there are other parameter regimes that are quite
common (for example, the situation that electromagnetic waves can be
approximated by light rays) in which the computer-based approach becomes
difficult, and therefore one would like to have an alternative method of
analysis. This project is aimed at developing such alternative methods of
asymptotic analysis for wave propagation problems that are nonlinear (so that
large waves can be accurately modeled) but that nonetheless admit a kind of
transform relating them to linear problems (for which the familiar superposition
principle applies). One application of such theoretical analysis would be to
describe the evolution of sub-surface oil plumes caused by an oil leak like the
Deepwater Horizon disaster.

This project is an attempt to place completely integrable nonlinear wave
equations on a similar footing as constant-coefficient linear equations, from
the point of view of asymptotic analysis (i.e., to further develop nonlinear
analogues of the classical methods of stationary phase and steepest descent for
integrals). The specific problems to be addressed include the study of the
inverse-scattering transform for the Benjamin-Ono equation (a nonlocal
integrable model for internal gravity waves) in the small-dispersion limit, the
study of the resonant interaction of wave packets through a quadratic
nonlinearity in the semiclassical limit, the study of an analogue of the
defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation describing waves in two spatial
dimensions in the semiclassical limit, the study of dynamical stability of so-
called rogue waves, the study of mixed initial/boundary-value problems for
integrable equations in the semiclassical limit, and the investigation of
"universal wave patterns", analogues to wave propagation problems of universal
phase transitions in statistical mechanics and mathematical physics.
