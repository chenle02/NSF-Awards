This project enhances the education of students in the critical area of
geotechnical engineering by their participation in field laboratory exercises.
This improves the present practice of classroom lectures coupled with only
traditional laboratory exercises. Without field sampling and testing
experiments, the student is left with only "textbook" knowledge of field aspects
of geotechnical engineering. The equipment purchased in support of this project
makes it possible for students to obtain soil samples from the subsurface using
a distributed sampling technique (the Split Barrel Sampler and an undistributed
one (the Shelby Tube). Rock samples are obtained using a rock recovery core
barrel. The students conduct property tests on these samples in the geotechnical
laboratory. In addition to soil and rock sampling, the project enables student
to measure the in situ strength, compressibility and permeability of soils using
state-of-the-practice in situ testing techniques. These techniques include the
standard penetration test, the core penetration test with pore pressure
measurements (the piezo- cone), the flat-plate (Marchetti) dilatometer, and the
vane shear device. Finally, the students acquire and analyze geotechnical data
using a field computer with data acquisition capability. The award is being
matched with a greater amount by the principal investigator's institution.
