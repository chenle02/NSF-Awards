We are requesting support to obtain a preparative HPLC. With this apparatus, the
extensive and heavily-used fermentation plant facilities in operation here are
complemented and extended. Cells will be grown, collected, broken and, with the
HPLC apparatus requested, their contents can be fractionated quickly and with
high resolution. The extended capability will greatly accelerate progress in
several Federally-supported projects. Projects described herein involve the
mechanism of hydrogen production and metabolism in anaerobic bacteria,
interconversions of non-heme iron-containing ferredoxins and the possible
synthesis of artificial enzymes concerned with electron transport and hydrogen
metabolism, methanogenesis and carbon dioxide metabolism, photosynthesis,
bioluminescence and growth of anaerobes utilizing interspecies hydrogen transfer
and cycling.
