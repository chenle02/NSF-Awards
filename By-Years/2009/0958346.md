Software testing techniques are fundamental to the development of dependable
software. Computer scientists studying testing techniques must be able to
evaluate and compare them empirically, and this requires access to a wide range
of infrastructure support including programs, program versions, test suites, and
fault data. This project provides that support, focusing on test generation and
on software domains that are increasingly important: concurrent and distributed
systems, software product lines, and web services. The PIs are collecting and
constructing systems, specifications, version attributes, test attributes and
fault attributes relevant to these domains, and organizing them in formats that
allow computer scientists to utilize them efficiently in controlled experiments.
Th PIs are embedding these artifacts in the existing Software-artifact
Infrastructure Repository (SIR), a repository established under prior NSF
support to facilitate experimentation with deterministic C and Java systems.
They are also enhancing SIR's support for community contributions, by providing
moderated write access to the repository; this will be expanded in the latter
years of the project, following the spirit of open-source models for system
management. The infrastructure being assembled enables several specific research
and educational projects related to software testing, by the project researchers
themselves and by the software engineering research community as a whole.
