*** 94-22662 TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses a passivation coating for
semiconductor laser diode optical facets. Phase I showed that 980-nanometer
quantum well lasers operated at high power with extended lifetime capacity when
its laser diode facets were treated for passivation by cubic-gallium sulfide. In
Phase II laser facet temperatures will be monitored by Raman spectroscopy, and
failure modes will be evaluated by chemical and structural analyses. Lasers to
be used in Phase II will have a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) and
unstable resonator 980-nanometer quantum well structures. This technology is
expected to find application in optical amplifiers in optical communication
networks and more generally in passivation of gallium arsenide minority based
devices, such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), light emitting
diodes (LEDs), and solar cells. ***
