The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and
education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
students and faculty at HBCUs. Winston Salem State University will organize the
3rd NOBCChE Collaborative Conference to be held on April 9-10, 2020 at Hampton
University. Undergraduate and graduate students from six institutions will
attend this two-day conference to present their research and build a network of
support by interacting with faculty and industry representative.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOBCChE is the National Organization for the Professional
Advancements of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, a professional
organization dedicated to assisting black and other minority students and
professionals in fully realizing their potential in academic, professional, and
entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and allied fields.
This conference will facilitate the creation of networks of underrepresented
students and faculty members; offer technical and professional development
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students; generate potential
collaborative research opportunities for faculty; and build long-term
trustworthy relationships. This conference will build on and strengthen these
relationships through frequent interactions, face-to-face encounters, and a
thorough understanding of the uniqueness of each of the institutions - Auburn
University, Hampton University, Jackson State University, Ohio State University,
University of Pittsburgh, and Winston-Salem State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
