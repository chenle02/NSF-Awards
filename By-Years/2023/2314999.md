The physical impacts of climate change on agriculture vary in unpredictable ways
across both space and time, creating substantial risks for farmers, consumers,
and governments. Those risks can be managed by changing what is planted, storing
crops, and through trade. However, it is not well understood how those risk
management strategies interact to jointly redistribute the risks and impacts of
climate change on agriculture. To address that gap, the project develops a
theory on how risk management affects trade policy and volumes, quantifies the
persistence of trade patterns, and brings together satellite and administrative
data to document the role of risk in planting decisions at scale. Further, the
project pairs these results with climate models to refine projections of climate
damages, informing climate, trade, and aid policy discussions. In addition, the
project integrates the co-development of educational activities at the K-12
level. It advances the training of graduate and undergraduate students,
emphasizing broadening participation among students from underrepresented
groups.

Local risk management tools and trade are likely to alter the distribution of
climate damages jointly but are often investigated separately. This project (a)
advances the integration of risk-aware behavior into general equilibrium trade
models, (b) applies econometric tools to quantify how risk shapes trade
persistence, trade policy intervention (e.g., export bans), and what farmers
plant, and (c) couples those advances with climate models to improve predictions
about when and where climate-induced agricultural losses will be felt. The
resulting predictions inform ongoing negotiations about climate policy, finance,
food security, and targeted interventions to assist people at the greatest risk.
