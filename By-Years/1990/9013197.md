This project will underwrite the construction of additional housing for
scientists near the main laboratory at the University of Minnesota Cedar Creek
Natural History Area (CCNHA). "Pre- built" units will be used to eliminate most
of the University-mandated costs of planning for new construction. The
accommodations meet local building codes and to provide handicap access. The
support includes funds for housing, site preparation, electric utilities, well,
septic system and complete furnishings. These new accommodations are required to
meet the demand imposed by an ever increasing group of researcher at CCNHA. The
research being performed at CCNHA has expanded greatly assistants, 18 graduate
students, 9 post-doctoral researchers, and 19 faculty from other institutions
working at Cedar Creek. Almost all of these require on-site housing because it
allows them to more easily complete their research and be more a part of the
Cedar Creek intellectual community. In addition, 21 UM faculty, the data
manager, the site manager, and the chemist will be working at Cedar Creek, but
will not require housing.
