9452911 Huband The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will
publish the results of NSF/DUE-sponsored research and innovation in engineering
education in ASEE's Journal of Engineering Education, The Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) journal Transactions on Education,
and other appropriate learned journals. In keeping with the scholarly spirit of
these journals, funding from NSF will assure valuable dissemination of the
results of NSF-funded research. Thus, findings from NSF-funded research by
principal investigators in the field of engineering education would be assured
of the broadest possible dissemination in scholarly journals dedicated to
expanding the body of knowledge that supports engineering educators nation wide.
