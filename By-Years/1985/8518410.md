This project will be the second workshop involving bridge engineers from the
United States and Japan and is under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Agreement of
the Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects. However, this workshop will discuss
topics of general interest in the subjects of performance of bridges under
current conditions, strengthening of bridges to meet existing standards,
techniques to repair bridges, and estimation of the remaining life of various
types of bridges. The preservation of today's bridges is an important factor in
the nation's highway transportation problems. The proceedings will include
suggestions for future research needs to solve the problems of repair, retrofit,
and rehabilitation of bridges in the United States. The information derived from
this workshop will be very beneficial to bridge engineers, academic faculty,
bridge researchers, and government agencies.
