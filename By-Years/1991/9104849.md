The principal investigator will study silicate growth from low temperature
geologic fluids using sepiolite as an experimental analogue. Results will be
extrapolated to natural systems in order to determine the role of growth
kinetics in the formation of magnesium-bearing silicates, clay minerals, and
zeolites from low- temperature natural waters.
