9406912 Rigby The focus of this research is the development of strategies for
alkaloid synthesis that involve the use of vinyl isocyanates as the 4-pi
partners in cyclocondensation reactions. The work will extend this reaction
profile by including partners such as isocyanides and triene-metal complexes.
The unique characteristics of vinyl isocyanides will be examined to obtain an
"umpoled" version of the vinyl isocyanate series. The methodology will be
showcased on a series of alkaloids including pancratistatin. %%% With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
James H. Rigby of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University.
Professor Rigby will focus his work on developing methods for the synthesis of
nitrogen containing organic compounds by the use of vinyl isocyanates. A key
target for synthesis will be pancratistatin, a molecule with interesting
biological properties.
