In this project the PI will characterize the first steps of gene activation by
nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are proteins with the ability to regulate
the expression of adjacent genes and these receptors are classified as
transcription factors. The PI will investigate the synergistic ligand effect
observed for a hetero-dimeric nuclear receptor by examining its interaction with
two cofactor proteins. The PI will use three-color brightness analysis to study
ternary protein complexes directly inside living cells. The proposed studies
will inspire further applications of three-color brightness analysis to other
complex biological problems. The PI will provide research opportunities for REU
students during the summer, which will expose these students to biological
physics and encourage their interest in this subject. In addition, the PI will
organize an annual three-day hands-on work shop for students from the biological
sciences. The workshop will provide needed training for students who apply
fluorescence techniques in their daily research, but without necessarily having
a detailed understanding of the underlying principles.
