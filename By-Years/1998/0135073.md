This project presents a career development plan for integrating research and
education in the area of ionospheric and space remote sensing and imaging. The
research component is funded on developing, implementing, and integrating space-
based/ground-based optical and radio techniques for multidimensional,
multisensor remote sensing and imaging of ionospheric electron density
structures, and airglow emission layers that will provide insights into many
current ionospheric science issues: equatorial anomaly, spread-F, TIDs, gravity
waves, and ionosphere neutral coupling at the equator.

Education through curriculum development, advising, mentoring, and involvement
of students at both undergraduate and graduate levels in all aspects of research
is key element of the proposed career development plan. In particular, the PI is
committed to introducing space remote sensing and imaging concepts and
methodologies to engineering students, by developing their enthusiasm and
inspiration for studying natural phenomena.
