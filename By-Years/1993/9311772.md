9311772 Batterman The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) operated by
Cornell University, is a national user facility that provides state of the art
high energy X-ray synchrotron radiation to the scientific community.
Experimental studies carried out at CHESS impact condensed matter physics,
chemistry, materials science and engineering, biology, geology, and other
disciplines. CHESS is a user oriented facility which accepts proposals from all
qualified investigators on a competitive basis. In addition to providing
operating costs, this project supports the development of synchrotron radiation
facilities using high photon power levels provided by the Cornell Electron
Storage Ring(CESR). At present, more than 500 individuals per year from
universities, industries, and national laboratories, conduct research on the 10
experimental stations at CHESS. Some of these stations are equipped with
unprecedented fluxes and brightness. The facility development program is
directed towards equipping these stations with cutting-edge x-ray optics. ***
