Biotic and industrial activities result in the environmental accumulation of
organic toxins. Cellular protection against such "xenobiotic stress" agents is
afforded by increasing the rate of transcription of nuclear detoxification
genes, through changes in the activity of basic/leucine-zipper (bZIP)
transcription factors. Key structural and regulatory features of xenobiotic-
responsive bZIP factors of animals and yeast have been elucidated. By
comparison, less is known about their functional counterparts in plants. The
long-term goal of this research is to understand how transcription involving a
tobacco bZIP factor termed TGA1a is regulated by cellular and stress cues.
Recently it has been shown that xenobiotic stress induced by
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid can stimulate DNA-binding and trans-activation
functions of TGA1a. A nuclear TGA1a-binding protein termed p120, with properties
of a co-repressor, is strongly implicated in stress-responsive regulation of
these transcription activities. The PI's laboratory will investigate the mode of
action of the p120 co-repressor, through in vivo functional studies with its
cloned gene. TGA1a and its cognate as-1-type cis-elements have been implicated
in the regulation of a number of plant detoxification and host-defense genes.
Thus, elucidating the molecular basis of this transcriptional response pathway
is important for advancing basic knowledge of cellular detoxification processes,
and for developing effective genetic strategies to manipulate natural protective
genes of plants. Because xenobiotic toxins accumulate in crop plants and retain
significant latent activity, research aimed at understanding plant
transcriptional control of detoxification pathways may have important
implications for human health.
