9410474 Clark An innovative active mode localization methodology is developed in
this research project for structural vibration control. The approach uses
feedback to alter the mode shapes such that those areas of structure which are
very delicate or critical, sense little vibration, while other areas may vibrate
at large amplitudes. Both transient and steady-state vibrations are controlled.
This research work includes analytical development and laboratory demonstration,
and emphasizes the elaboration of a general vibration control technique for
commonly encountered situations in manufacturing, space, robotics and automotive
industries. ***
