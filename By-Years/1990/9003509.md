The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the synthesis and characterization of a wide variety of new
fluorine-containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus compounds. It is expected that
the presence of fluorine will endow the new compounds with desirable properties,
such as special high temperature stabilities and concommitant high densities and
long liquid ranges, compared to nonfluorinated analogs. The target compounds for
synthesis are in three families: (A) fluorinated cyclophosphazenes and
polyphosphazenes; (B) fluorinated tetrazoles and other tetraza-5-membered ring
systems; and (C) fluorinated high-nitrogen compounds. Many of the new compounds
will be synthesized by procedures analogous to those used for nonfluorinated
analogs, but using fluorinated starting materials. In other cases fluorination
will be accomplished with either carbonyl fluoride or trifluoroamine oxide. The
new compounds will be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods and by
x-ray and electron diffraction structural techniques.
