DMS-0354994&lt;br/&gt;Sean M. Keel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
centers on the study of fundamental objects in mathematics and theoretic
physics: moduli spaces of hyperplane arrangements, moduli spaces of curves, and
moduli spaces of Abelian varieties. The research involves the application of
basic ideas of Mori theory. For example the largest portion of the proposal, and
the portion with the largest potential payoff has to do with finding a natural
compactification of the&lt;br/&gt;moduli of hyperplane arrangements (i.e. moduli
of ordered n-tuples of hyperplanes in projective space modulo automorphisms of
the projective space) with reasonable singularities. This is of interest for
example because the obvious compactifications -those that come from geometric
invariant theory, have boundary with literally arbitrary singularities (all
possible affine schemes occur as boundary strata), so a natural
desingularisation would include a desingularisation of all singularities at
once. The researcher makes the elementary observation that the moduli space of
hyperplane arrangements is (log) minimal, and thus the main conjectures of Mori
theory predict the existence of a canonical compactification, with reasonable
boundary. The main question is to find this
compactification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher proposes to consider the
geometry of some of the basic parameterising spaces in mathematics -- the so-
called moduli spaces of hyperplane arrangements, Riemann surfaces, and Abelian
varieties. The unifying theme of the proposal is the application of fundamental
ideas from one branch of geometry, Mori theory, to other branches, where the
ideas have not yet been widely exploited. The simplest and potentially deepest
example is in the first and main part of the proposal, where the researcher
observes that Mori theory predicts the existence of an absolutely canonical
object for the resolution of singularities -- one of the central problems in
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
