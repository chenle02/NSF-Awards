This SBIR project proposes to develop a system for detoxifying contaminated
groundwater using in-situ anaerobic bioremediation. The focus of the project
will be the ability of multi-functional nano-powders to produce groundwater that
supports effective in-situ anaerobic bioremediation. This improved method would
use organic bio-amendments applied with anaerobic microbes to contaminated
groundwater.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be to treat
contaminated groundwater in a more cost-effective manner. Halogenated
hydrocarbons, perchlorate, and other toxic substances contaminate groundwater
and threaten public water supplies. The slow natural attenuation of TCE and
other toxic chemicals makes effective in-situ treatment that much more
important. In-situ methods, where the contaminants are consumed underground, is
lower cost than pump and treat options and is a more complete remediation
solution.
