A variety of phenomena arising in nature and applications, such as ocean waves
(rogue waves) and wave breaking, optical transmission lines and optical
communications, novel materials (graphene) among others, involve single-wave
structures (solitons) that travel without change of shape. This project is aimed
at the study of the nonlinear partial differential equations, which are
instrumental for analysis and modeling of such soliton-like structures. Many
important phenomena most readily manifest themselves through the behavior of the
special solutions such as traveling or standing waves, which not only serve as
basis for the behavior of the system, but also determine the related nearby
dynamics. These structures and their stability are of great importance and are
essential in practical applications. Stable states of the system attract all
nearby configurations, while the loss of stability or being unable to control
the dynamics is of practical importance as well. The investigator will involve
undergraduate and graduate students in various stages of the project and will
aim to recruit and retain them to continue working in the field of applied
mathematics. Exposing students to parts of the project that require broad
interaction with other sciences such as optics, water waves and liquid crystals,
will be particularly beneficial for the students' training.

Throughout the project, the point of view in working with these partial
differential equations will be one of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems,
which allows us to take advantage of the classical tools by adapting them to the
infinite-dimensional setting. The project focuses on Hamiltonian models with
sign indefinite energy functionals such as various Dirac systems. The goal is to
investigate the linear and spectral stability for certain solitary waves, but
also to prove results on uniform bounds for the spectrally stable solutions.
Investigating the dynamics near solitary waves for some exotic NLS models and
for water wave models such as the Benney-Luke equations is another focus of this
proposal. The study of the long-term dynamics and asymptotic profiles in the
Landau - de Gennes models of liquid crystals rounds up this research program.
All these directions will require new techniques and tools from diverse areas
such as functional analysis, dynamical systems, and harmonic analysis as well as
numerical simulations. The local and long-time behavior of solutions, as well as
their stability is of great practical importance as they describe systems in
optics, liquid crystals, and water waves, among others.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
