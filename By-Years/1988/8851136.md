The Council for the Advancement of Science Writers (CASW), a nonprofit
organization of scientists and science writers, will provide an additional four
years of New Horizons In Science briefings for science reporters and editors.
These annual briefings, which have been conducted since 1963, bring together
leading researchers in the most active areas of science and engineering with
science journalists to educate journalists about the latest developments in
scientific discovery and inquiry, and to allow the two groups to interact with
each other to discuss common aspects of the public understanding of science.
Each year, the CASW Briefings engage more than a hundred science journalists
from around the country with more than a dozen speakers reflecting as many
fields of scientific discovery. The activities cover all fields of science and
engineering and are carefully constructed to reflect a variety of points of view
within disciplines. This standard award for three years will allow CASW to
develop independent long.term funding for the series. Evaluation and marketing
studies will take place in each of the next four years. More than $100,000 in
additional project support will be provided by the CASW and other New Horizons
sponsors.
