Chestnut Hill College (CHC) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is designing,
developing, and implementing a new degree program to produce cybersecurity
professionals, an employment sector with a critical shortage throughout the
country. CHC's cybersecurity program will be the first undergraduate degree to
be offered in the Philadelphia region. Fifteen students are expected to enroll
as new cybersecurity majors each year. The unique factors of the program are:
(1) involving industry experts with real-world experience in the creation and
implementation of the academic curriculum, (2) wide-ranging infusion of
cybersecurity principles in all information technology and computer science
curricula offered by CHC, and (3) hands-on skills development with actual
hardware and software, not just virtual environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interaction with the cybersecurity community will allow CHC to incorporate
state-of-the art applications, based on real world situations, into the
development of the new academic program. In addition to assisting with
curriculum design, subject matter experts will serve as adjunct teachers. All
recruited subject matter experts have extensive backgrounds in cybersecurity and
are recognized as leaders in the industry and government agencies, such as the
FBI and DHS. The opportunities for students to work with real-world experts will
enhance their understanding of the role of cybersecurity in today's complicated
technology environment. CHC will share the process of creating the new
curriculum through the academic--industry expert partnership with other colleges
throughout the nation. In addition, the team will apply for the designation as a
National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program, jointly sponsored by The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and The National Security Agency (NSA).
