Engineering - Other (59)

The project addresses an important national need: evaluating effectiveness of
engineering education innovations and research. The goal is to build an
annotated inventory of evaluation tools for determining the effectiveness of
projects targeted at improving engineering education and student retention along
the engineering pipeline. An experienced team of engineering education,
assessment and evaluation professionals will conduct an extensive search for
existing evaluation tools and document their usefulness for the engineering
education research and development community. Recognized national experts in
engineering education and evaluation will review and contribute to the
evaluation of tools and the resulting inventory. Products of this work include:
(1) a catalog of evaluation tools characterized by outcomes addressed,
instrument stage of development, and instrument usability, (2) a prioritized
list of evaluation tool gaps needing to be addressed to support engineering
course, curriculum, and laboratory improvement, (3) a journal publication
presenting the methodology and results of the evaluation tools inventory, (4) a
national workshop to refine and disseminate results and to promote needed
evaluation tools development, and (5) a strategy for broad dissemination of
findings and evaluation tools
