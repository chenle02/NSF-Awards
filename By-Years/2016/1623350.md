Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research.
The project at Lincoln University seeks to build on previous successful efforts
to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. The
project aims at improving retention, persistence and graduation rates of STEM
students through an evidence-based set of activities and strategies. Colleges
and universities facing similar retention problems as Lincoln University can
benefit by adopting best practices from the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities and strategies to achieve the
goals are: curriculum and pedagogy reform for gate-keeping mathematics and
science courses; establishment of an integrated freshman science course;
undergraduate research for about half of all STEM majors; increased enrollment
of community college students into STEM majors; increased outreach activities to
high schools in the Philadelphia; and establishment of a Science Village for
STEM freshmen students that will include joint housing, study halls and academic
support. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based
and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness through formative and
summative evaluation as well as a research study.
