Ranking functions trained via machine learning are ubiquitous in todayâ€™s online
systems, where they are used to rank virtually anything - from products and
movies to job candidates. By deciding where individual items get ranked and how
easily users can find them, the ranking function greatly influences which
products get purchased, which candidates get a job, and which movies get
streamed. This raises questions of fairness, asserting that the ranking
functions should be fair to both the users of the systems as well as to the
items being ranked. The project develops new fairness criteria for ranking
functions, as well as new methods for designing and learning ranking functions
with fairness guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a model
of ranking systems as two-sided markets, where utility goes not only to the
users issuing the queries, but also to the items that are being ranked.
Unfortunately, virtually all learning-to-rank (LTR) methods in use today only
optimize the average utility to the users, which can lead to unfair treatment of
the items and of minority user groups. To overcome this deficiency, the project
develops LTR methods that can enforce desirable fairness constraints. These new
methods can remedy disparate treatment of user groups (e.g. amplification of
gender bias in a hiring system), market concentration in online markets, and the
dynamics of participation in online systems (e.g. polarization). To achieve
these goals, the project addresses both endogenous and exogenous causes of
unfairness. Exogenous causes are due to biases in the training data, which often
lead to rich-get-richer dynamics. However, even when trained with unbiased data,
causes endogenous in the design of the LTR algorithm can lead to unfairness.
Therefore, the LTR methods developed in the project address both endogenous and
exogenous causes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
