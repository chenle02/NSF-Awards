In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Anne Kelley and David Kelley, from the
University of California, Merced, will investigate by resonance Raman
spectroscopy such effects as electronic dephasing and coupling of optical
phonons to excitons, electrons, and holes in II-VI nanocrystals and
heterostructures. The work will contribute to our understanding of ultrafast
dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of the
exact ways in which electric charge migrates in nanometer-sized structures is
essential for the design and implementation of new technologies that can lead to
further miniaturization of devices. The work by Drs. Kelley and Kelley will
reveal details of charge migration in nanometer-sized structures and inform
future technological advances. Along the way, the investigators will engage
graduate and undergraduate students - many from groups traditionally under-
represented in science - in cutting-edge research and discovery.
