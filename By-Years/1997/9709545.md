This proposal consists of two projects that extend theoretically and
empirically the PI's previous work on increasing returns and local factor
productivity. The research uses variants of the familiar division-of-labor
models, which are now standard in trade, development, and growth to estimate the
importance of external economies through increased local specialization. The
first project tests the effect of factor supplies on relative wages directly
using panel data from the PSID. The local division-of-labor model suggests a
relationship between factor supplies and factor returns that is observationally
distinct from alternative model specifications. New theoretical work shows that
this relationship is observationally distinct from the Heckscher-Ohlin model and
a model in which scale economies in education do not have a sectoral bias, as in
Miyagiwa, 1991. Thus we test the local division-of-labor model against
theoretical alternatives. The second project is an estimation and analysis of
state-level total factor productivity. The theoretical model suggests that
states with greater variety in intermediate inputs should have higher TFP. The
basic model suggests a particular relationship between TFP and this
characteristic of the local economic base. The first task of this project is to
calculate TFP indices across industries and states. In doing so we follow
procedures similar to those used by Harrigan (1996) to calculate TFP indices
across countries. The second task of the project is to estimate the relationship
of these indices to characteristics of the local base. Among the characteristics
we consider are descriptors of the manufacturing base, the local service sector,
and local relative supplies of human capital. An important aspect of this
project is the development of additional measures of `local diversity,`
estimating the correlation of these measures to TFP.
