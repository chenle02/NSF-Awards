With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports the continuing work of Dr. Frederick D. Lewis in the Department of
Chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The research is
based on earlier studies of the spectroscopy and photochemistry or organic
molecules. The relationship between molecular structure and the behavior of
electronic states will be explored in three different systems: 1) one-
dimensional arrays of pi stacked poly(arylurea) chromophores, 2) aromatic
amines, and 3) unsaturated aromatic molecules that undergo photochemical
cyclization reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research in the area of organic
photochemistry involves synthesis, structural studies using NMR and x-ray
crystallography, and studies of excited state behavior using a combination of
spectroscopy, computational methods, and product isolation and characterization.
The work is expected to provide excellent training for the students involved,
and could lead to the development of organic materials with applications as
wires and sensors.
