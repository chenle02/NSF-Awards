The theoretical physics group at the University of California Berkeley (S.
Mandelstam, B. Zumino, M. Gallard, L. Hall and O. Alvarez) will carry out
research over a broad area of particle theory. The topics include the random
triangulation approach to 2-D gravity and its application to non-critical
strings, applications of quantum groups to superstring theory, string
perturbation expansions with space- time supersymmetry, new inflationary
cosmology scenarios.
