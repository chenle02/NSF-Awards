The evolution of the upper mantle will be examined by analysis of compositional
zonation of minerals of xenoliths. Electron and proton probe analysis will be
combined to provide data both for major elements and for trace elements to
levels of a few parts per million. The results will be related to numerical
simulations and to models in order to understand both processes and their rates.
Data on minerals in xenoliths with high equilibration temperatures will provide
information on the movement of melts in the mantle and on the compositional
evolution of "fertile" peridotite. The zonations of major and trace elements
will be used to interpret substitution mechanism, partition coefficients, and
interdiffusion effects in garnets. The temperature-composition histories of
coarse-textured xenoliths with Cr-Al zoned garnets will be modeled, in order to
learn how thermal events in the lithosphere are recorded by peridotite minerals
at temperatures below 1100 C.
