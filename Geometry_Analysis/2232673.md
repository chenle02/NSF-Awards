This award provides support for the ninth Poisson Geometry Conference to be held
at Amherst College on March 16-23, 2023. This conference series consists of
regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson
geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers
alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians
inspired by problems arising in physics, and physicists searching for new
mathematical tools. The meetings also serve as a unique forum for junior
mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge
developments in Poisson geometry and to disseminate their own research results
in the field.

Poisson geometry originated as the mathematical formulation of classical
mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history began
with classical work by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a
separate field in its own right around 1980 via the work of Lichnerowicz and
Weinstein. Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent
areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex
geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster
algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry,
stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson
structures. The annual workshops provide an excellent opportunity for members of
various groups working on related areas from different perspectives to exchange
new ideas and stimulate collaboration. The goal of each workshop is to address
important questions and future directions of the subject. More information is

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
