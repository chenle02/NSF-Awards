The goal of this research is to prepare and characterize single-bead-string
reactors (SBSR's) in which enzymes have been immobilized. These reactors are
prepared by packing a tube with solid glass spheres whose diameter is slightly
larger than the radius of the tubing, creating a zig-zag pattern when properly
packed. Two reactor designs will be examined, one with enzymes bonded to the
tube walls and the other with enzymes immobilized on the beads. These
immobilized enzyme systems will then be used to study mixing in continuous flow
systems. Using a very active enzyme, such that molecular movement is the
limiting factor (i.e., the rate at which the reactant reaches the enzyme), mass
transfer can be calculated by measuring the changes in product concentration.
