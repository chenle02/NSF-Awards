ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0327738&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0327730&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at Bowling Green State University and
Clarkson University will collaborate to develop a series of luminescent
cyanobacterial Fe-dependent bioreporter strains capable of quantifying the
bioavailability of iron in aquatic environments. This project will use the same
genetic techniques and expanded analytical approaches used to develop a
prototype freshwater bioreporter with the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC
7942. By analyzing dose-response curves generated for each promoter, the
investigators hope to construct a series of bioreporters with an expanded
dynamic range of detection of bioavailable iron. While the information provided
from this study will address a gap in our current knowledge on the availability
of iron to freshwater organisms, the investigators expect that it will
eventually be applicable to the development of analogous marine sensors.
