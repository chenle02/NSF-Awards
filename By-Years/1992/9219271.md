The Pacific Northwest and Alaska consists of accreted terranes, many of which
are far-traveled relative to the North American craton. Geological relationships
and paleomagnetic constraints on the origin translation, collision and
subsequent movement along the orogen margin have been worked out for many of the
terranes. The Pacific margin of the Eurasian plate likely had a similar history,
but little is known about the terranes in the Koryak and Kamchatka regions of
northeastern Russia. This project is to analyze paleomagnetic samples previously
collected in conjunction with Russian scientists, and to integrate these data
with literature on the geology of these areas. Results will be of interest to
Pacific northwest and tectonics.
