This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder acquire an
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer with variable temperature
controls. The EPR will be used by five faculty members to characterize free
radical reactive intermediates in a variety of liquid and solid organic systems.
Electron resonance is a branch of absorption spectroscopy in which radiation of
microwave frequency is absorbed by molecules possessing electrons with unpaired
spins. In electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) two different
energy states arise when a magnetic field is applied and a transition between
the two different electron spin energy states occurs upon absorption of a
quantum of radiation in the microwave region. When an unpaired electron comes in
the vicinity of a nucleus with a spin, an interaction takes place which causes
the absorption signal to be split into several components. From this interaction
molecular structure can be inferred. EPR spectroscopy is also used in studies of
the rates of reactions and in studies involving radical intermediates produced
in a reaction.
