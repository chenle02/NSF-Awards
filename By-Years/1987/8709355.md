Following a lifetime of field and laboratory study of the several thousand
species of Hepaticae (liverworts) of the world, Dr. Rudolf Schuster will
synthesize the morphological, ecologi- cal, and geographical data in a
comprehensive classification of these primitive land plants. A projected two-
volume treatment will be encyclopedic in scope, providing detailed descriptions
of all recognized genera, identification keys, notes on ecology and breeding
systems, and superb illustrations of vegetative and reproductive structures. Dr.
Schuster's unparalleled field experience with these plants, in tropical and
temperate regions of the world, provides him a unique vantage to survey the
natural history and evolutionary biology of hepatics. A compre- hensive and
consistent taxonomic treatment of the group will open the way for future
detailed investigations of evolutionary processes and ecological
specializations.
