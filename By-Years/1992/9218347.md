9218347 Tong The goal of this project is to purify, characterize, and determine
the effects on flavor and ripening of an endogenous tomato fruit trigger of
ethylene production which we have previously partially purified from fruit cell
walls. This trigger is produced when the fruit are unripe and before ethylene
production begins. It will induce ethylene synthesis and red color development
in normal ripening fruit as well as in mutant fruit that normally do not produce
ethylene or turn red when ripe. It clearly has a role in fruit ripening,
affecting ethylene synthesis and therefore fruit softening and color
development. Preliminary characterization of the trigger has shown that it
contains both carbohydrate and protein. The proposed project will 1) determine
if both carbohydrate and protein are necessary for trigger activity by
selectively degrading the carbohydrate or protein moiety using enzymes or
chemicals and then testing for activity, and 2) purify the endogenous trigger
using various chromatographic procedures. Achieving the goals of this project
should provide new information in an under-studied area of plant hormone
research, the onset of hormone production. ***
