This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is an
interdisciplinary project that brings together an expert in adaptive control
with an expert in the cognitive basis of anomaly response. The focus is on
providers of highly automated, business critical, smart digital services in
which human supervisors normally monitor automatic controllers, but must take
over control if anomalous events occur that the automation is not designed to
handle. The objective is to ensure that such transitions occur safely, smoothly,
and reliably. An industrial research partner will provide a set of cases of
anomaly response from actual business critical software
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart services increasingly rely on autonomous
computational mechanisms to quickly handle extremely large numbers of
transactions extremely. Given the scale and dependence on automation, even small
disrupting events can cascade quickly, and human supervision may lead to late
and erroneous responses when anomalies occur that challenge automated
capabilities. This project promises to re-engage human supervisors in the
developing anomaly (a) smoothly, by providing anomaly visualizations that
anticipate when the automated activity is at risk of saturating control, and (b)
quickly, so that supervisors can intervene to block cascading problems.
Performance testing will be based on actual cases of anomaly response and will
estimate how re-engagement following anomalies is smooth or bumpy, the increase
in responsiveness to anomalies, and the range of autonomous activities that can
be supervised effectively with the new form of shared control.
