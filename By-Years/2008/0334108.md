Improving the reliability of inter-domain routing is arguably one of the most
daunting challenges faced in securing the Internet today. Inter-domain routing
protocols provide the means by which organizations under cohesive administrative
control (e.g., universities, companies, ISPs) exchange and propagate
reachability information among themselves. In essence, such protocols de.ne
policies by which data traverses the Internet to arrive at its intended
destination(s). As such, disruptions in inter-domain routing protocols, whether
benign or intentional, may result in large segments ofthe Internet becoming
inaccessible.

This proposal encompasses the design, analysis and deployment of a protocol to
better analyze and validate routing protocols, with particular attention to the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),which is the de facto inter-domain routing
protocol used in the Internet. Rather than attempting to change widely deployed
protocols like BGP, this project is an attempt to validate the observed
information in messages that result from protocol interactions. In this
proposal, we discuss ways in which such a validation protocol, running adjacent
to BGP for example, can improve the security and reliability of the Internet,
while at the same time, allow for incremental deployment. This latter goal is
significant, as it is not realistic to assume that every edge router on the
Internet can(or will) adopt a new protocol at the same time.

In that regard, the project is specifically designed to offer immediate benefit
to anyone deploying a server to support protocol validation, so that the
incentive is for sites to participate, regardless of how many others are
executing the protocol. However, as adoption increases, so will its benefit to
the greater Internet community at large.
