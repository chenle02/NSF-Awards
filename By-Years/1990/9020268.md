Vibrio related bacteria comprise a significant portion of the heterotrophic
bacteria of the world's oceans, costal waters and estuaries. The systematics of
these organisms is of major importance in understanding biodiversity at the
microbial level. Numerous studies in systematics have been done using
traditional traits and, more recently, RNA and DNA data. This study seeks to
incorporate phenotypic and genotypic attributes to define more accurately the
systematics of the Vibrionaceae, Aeromonadaceae and related organisms. Previous
investigations carried out in the laboratory of the PIs focused on collection of
morphological and RNA data, as well as developing a number of analyses of this
information. This effort will add further RNA and DNA data to the data bank. Our
ultimate goal is a complete set of information for reference strains of the
genera Vibrio, Aeromonas, Photobacterium, Alteromonas (Shewanella), and others.
