9514816 Dohanich The neural basis for the development of learning and memory is
currently unclear. However, studies have implicated the cholinergic nerve
network in the brain as being an integral chemical component of the process of
learning and memory. Recent investigations noted that gonadal hormones,
particularly estrogen, may participate in these complex behaviors, especially
during advancing age. The investigations of Dr. Dohanich will establish the
linkage between these chemical messenger molecules in learning and memory across
the ages. As part of these investigations, the experiments will characterize the
hormonal conditions that affect performance in tasks of learning and memory,
particularly following the compromise of the cholinergic system. Further
innovative investigations will elucidate the interrelationship of the
environment, either simple or complex, with the hormonal milieu in the
development of learning and memory. Unfortunately, ample basic information
regarding the complex interactions of the brain chemical messenger molecules and
the environment has precluded a clear understanding of the development of
learning and memory behaviors. The present investigations will foster greater
understanding of these critical behaviors. Moreover, the role of the environment
in learning has been proposed but critical investigations have not been
undertaken. These studies will be among the first to generate quantifiable data
on the role of the environment in information processing in biological systems.
