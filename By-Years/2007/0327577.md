The primary objectives of this investigation include
&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary studies of tectonically driven spatio-temporal
&lt;br/&gt;signals resulting from complex geophysical processes. These
&lt;br/&gt;processes include convergent plate boundaries, earthquake
&lt;br/&gt;deformation cycle, mantle convection, intra-plate deformations and
&lt;br/&gt;Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). At present, these processes
&lt;br/&gt;generate small but measurable signals in the form of surface
&lt;br/&gt;deformations, which at present can only be detected over land by
&lt;br/&gt;either point measurements using GPS, or on small spatial scales
(&lt;100 &lt;br/&gt;km) using InSAR. These "slow deformation" signals have
spatial &lt;br/&gt;scales longer than hundreds of km to continental and
planetary &lt;br/&gt;scales, and temporal scales of a year to decades, and
millennia. The &lt;br/&gt;Earth's gravity field and its spatio-temporal
variations, providing &lt;br/&gt;insight on the integrated mass redistributions
within the Earth's &lt;br/&gt;systems, represent a unique fundamental measurable
quantity to &lt;br/&gt;directly study mechanisms which drive these complex
processes with &lt;br/&gt;many degrees of freedom. For the first time ever,
dedicated &lt;br/&gt;satellite gravity missions like CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE are
anticipated &lt;br/&gt;to measure these small, broad-scale tectonically driven
signals in &lt;br/&gt;the form of integrated mass change and vertical
deformations. &lt;br/&gt;However, the contemporary mathematical functions to
represent the &lt;br/&gt;geopotential are conventionally spherical harmonics
which do not &lt;br/&gt;allow spatial localization. 3-D wavelets have notable
advantages &lt;br/&gt;over spherical harmonics, e.g. for multi-resolution
representation &lt;br/&gt;and localization, however, would have to satisfy the
so-called &lt;br/&gt;"boundary-value problem". The overarching scientific goal
is to &lt;br/&gt;develop multi-resolution based 3-D wavelet tools to enhance the
&lt;br/&gt;tectonically driven spatio-temporal gravity signals for improved
&lt;br/&gt;analyses and to make progress towards addressing the major open
&lt;br/&gt;scientific questions of understanding the driving mechanisms of these
&lt;br/&gt;"slow deformation" over land, ocean and ice-covered surfaces. The
&lt;br/&gt;investigators propose to develop mathematical tools based on two
&lt;br/&gt;wavelet approaches: (1) the rotational invariant spherical wavelet
&lt;br/&gt;function, and (2) the non-separable compactly supported
&lt;br/&gt;tensor-product wavelets to represent the spatio-temporal gravity
&lt;br/&gt;field signals and perform geophysical "inversions" to enhance the
&lt;br/&gt;signals. The "inversion" of these gravity signals represents
&lt;br/&gt;stringent mathematical and numerical challenges, especially in light
&lt;br/&gt;of the need for multi-resolution representation to enhance localized
&lt;br/&gt;signals and to consider extending wavelets to include the time
&lt;br/&gt;dimension. The broader impacts and anticipated results include the
&lt;br/&gt;development of 3-D wavelet tools capable of solving the boundary
&lt;br/&gt;value problem and inversion of gravity signals using satellite data
&lt;br/&gt;and to demonstrate and apply the technique in the Nazca and South
&lt;br/&gt;American plate region. The developed mathematical tools are intended
&lt;br/&gt;to be among the first steps to "popularize" the use of 3-D wavelets
&lt;br/&gt;for teaching and research, and are applicable to numerous
&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary scientific studies and engineering
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
