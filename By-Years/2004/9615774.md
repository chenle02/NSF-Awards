Abstract EEC-9615774 Muller This award provides funding for a three-year
collaborative project with University of California, Davis is funded to study
the development of an integrated, raster-scanning optical microdisplay - the
project will study flexing and sliding hinges, accurate hinge and mirror
systems, electrostatic actuators and standard as large-aspect-ratio structures,
high available-force actuators based on chosen principle, reduced -specification
scanning display, packaging, integration and testing. The award is significantly
cost-shared by Dr. Deborah Crawford, Program Director, Communications and
Computational Systems program.
