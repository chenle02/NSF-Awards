This agreement is in support of the National Forum on "Meeting the Challenge:
Health, Safety and Food for America". Several agencies will be contributing
toward this Forum that is scheduled for November 21-22, 1994. The Committee on
Health, Safety, and Food will host a forum as part of the effort to develop
implementation plans for FY 1996 Research and Development policies, including
goals and priorities, developed through the National Science and Technological
Council (NSTC). The aim of the forum is to obtain expert advice from academia,
industry and others in the private sector. It is planned to invite 200-300
guests to participate in the two-day discussion to be held at the headquarters
of the National Academy of Sciences. A series of papers will be prepared for
discussion by forum participants. Six of the Subcommittees working under the
aegis of the Committee on Health, Safety and Food are developing white papers.
Participants will be sent a list of topics and as a condition of participation
will be required to submit a 2-page paper on any one of the subjects.
