Professor Charles L. Wilkins of the University of Arkansas is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry for
conducting fundamental studies in polymer mass spectrometry, focusing on the
characterization of copolymers. In particular, a combination of high-resolution
mass spectrometric techniques will be employed for solving the problem of
copolymer sequence determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic polymers are an
important component of every-day life, and new polymers for tailored
applications aimed at improving the quality of life are constantly being
developed in academia and industry. To accomplish this goal, methods for the
accurate characterization of polymer structures are essential. Mass
spectrometry's dispersive nature makes this method ideally suited for the
analysis of polymers that are essentially mixtures of molecules of different
masses. This work will improve the methods available for polymer analysis,
facilitating the development of novel polymers. Besides the potential broader
scientific impacts, this work will educate students, including undergraduates
and minorities, in the expanding area of mass spectrometry. &lt;br/&gt;
