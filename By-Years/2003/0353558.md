The Baylor REU program offers research opportunities in a wide range of physics
topics. Selected student Fellows reside on-site for approximately ten weeks with
two-week extensions available for those requesting them. Fellows are selected
using a national application process with the program advertised at universities
around the nation, smaller undergraduate and technical institutions with little
or no research capability and historically minority institutions. Complete
application information, research information and the ability to apply to the
program on-line is provided through a dedicated REU web page. Participating
Fellows choose from theoretical or experimental research opportunities in
astrophysics, dusty plasmas, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, space
physics or surface physics. All REU Fellows are required to give an end of
summer presentation. Additionally, they are strongly encouraged to present their
results at international conferences and invited to publish their results (when
possible) in peer-reviewed journals. The program provides funding both for
student participation at such conferences and the associated publication costs.
Research opportunities are also available for in-service teachers through the
RET component of the program.
