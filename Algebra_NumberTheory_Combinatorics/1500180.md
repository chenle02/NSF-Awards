Modern group theory is a very fast developing area of mathematics that uses
methods from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, topology, probability, logic, and
computer science. Applications of group theory are ubiquitous throughout
science, from physics and chemistry to cyber security. This award supports
collaborative research in the area of asymptotic methods in group theory, an
area that has been extremely active since seminal papers by Gromov on hyperbolic
groups and asymptotic invariants of groups. This project will significantly
advance knowledge of the area by solving several open problems. The
investigators will advise graduate students, organize research experiences for
undergraduate students, and organize conferences on the subject of asymptotic
methods in group theory.

The problems under study in this research project include * estimating Dehn
functions of metabelian groups; * constructing actions of hyperbolic groups
resembling Tarski monster groups; * constructing simple groups that admit highly
transitive actions; * describing all possible Tarski numbers of groups; and *
finding an amenable group with all asymptotic cones tree-graded. The results of
the project will advance understanding of asymptotic methods in group theory.
