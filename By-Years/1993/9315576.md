This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware acquire a
400 MHz spectrometer which will be used in the following research
investigations: Structure Determination of Synthetic Peptide Analogs of
G-Proteins; Peptide Model for B-sheet Formation; NMR Studies of Substrate
Binding Sites of NAD-Dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Peptide Models of Small
Tertiary Structures; Intramolecular Diene Cyclozirconation; Xe-129 NMR
Spectroscopy of the Gas Sorbed in Zeolites; and Substituted Phosphonate
Syntheses. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
