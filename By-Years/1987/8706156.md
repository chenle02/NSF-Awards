An increasing number of social psychologists are interested in investigating the
physiological underpinnings of social behavior. Many of these researchers have
had little experience with the sophisticated technology now being used in
psychophysiological measurement. The major objective of this award is to advance
the technical and theoretical foundation for research in the Social Sciences by
providing a forum for advanced study and research in psychophysiological
principles and techniques. The centerpiece of the program is an annual 28- day
conference in the Iowa Social Psychophysiological Laboratory. During this time,
the participants are engaged in the intensive study of: (1) the general
theoretical issues involved in inferring psychological processes and states from
physiological data; (2) the neurophysiological foundations of psychophysiology;
3) psychophysiological concepts and principles; (4) psychophysiological
recording procedures; (5) general issues in the analyses of psychophysiological
data; and (6) computers and instrumentation. Participants also update limited
hands-on experience in recording electromyographic, electroencepholographic,
electrodermal, cardiovascular electrooculargraphic, and respiratory responses.
Finally, the program involves overcoming traditional obstacles to the
application of psychophysiological principles and techniques in the social
sciences. These efforts include the development and distribution of algorithms,
software, recording procedures and instrumentation. The Principal Investigator
has an established reputation as a superb researcher, extremely knowledgeable
about psychophysiological theory and techniques and dedicated to sharing his
knowledge and experience with others. He has assembled an outstanding staff to
aid him in this endeavor.
