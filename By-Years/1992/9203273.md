The PI's two main purposes in this proposal are: (1) to add a Peruvian
scientist (Dr. Carlos Calderon) to the Jicamarca Radio Observatory staff, and
(2) to continue upgrading the data taking and processing equipment. The focus in
equipment upgrades will be placed on interfacing both new and old receivers with
the Harris Night Hawk computer and CSPI array processor.
