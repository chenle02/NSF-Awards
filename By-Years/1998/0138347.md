Angel, Roger&lt;br/&gt;AST-0138347&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative approach
to creating a Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope (GSMT) that meets the
requirements of the decade report will be investigated. The engineering and
scientific issues for the coherent combination of two telescopes and the
technically challenging multiple conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) will be
examined in detail. Replacing a single 30-meter telescope by coherently
combining light from two 20-meter telescopes may be a less expensive, more
reliable approach to the realization of the GSMT. Much of the science to be
accomplished by the next generation ground-based telescopes relies on a working
MCAO. MCAO has not yet been demonstrated. This effort will advance the state of
the art in MCAO significantly by providing a critical test of the dynamic
refocus at an actual astronomical telescope: The MMT near Tucson Arizona.
