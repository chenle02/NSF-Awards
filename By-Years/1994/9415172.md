This award will provide funding for the renovation of the Hobbs Science Building
on the campus of Lynchburg College. Constructed in 1959, the building can no
longer support ongoing research and research training activities. Though
structurally sound, the facility lacks modern interior space, mechanical and
electrical systems, and controlled climate critical to the operation of
computers and research equipment. The renovated Hobbs Building will become the
cornerstone of the Lynchburg College Science Center, a comprehensive science
facility that will house all of the science programs. With improved ventilation,
adequate electric power, and more effective use of existing space, the quality
and quantity of research and research training will be significantly enhanced.
The new facility will also assist the College in its efforts to attract and
retain qualified students pursuing scientific endeavors. As a modern science
facility, it will be a showcase to demonstrate effective science research and
training methods and provide a technologically advanced science resource for the
entire educational community of Lynchburg, Virginia.
