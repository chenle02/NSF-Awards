Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory proposes to support costs associated with
preparation of environmental assessments, incidental harassment authorizations,
on-board observers, and post-cruise reporting to National Marine Fisheries
Service (NOAA) as part of compliance with environmental regulations (National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and
Endangered Species Act (ESA)). Support is provided for such activities from the
Oceanographic Technical Services Program at NSF primarily to address concerns
regarding anthropogenic noise impacts on marine mammals by the large seismic
arrays on R/V Marcus G. Langseth operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
