Pittler 9321132 During development many different cell types are formed that
must migrate to their proper locations in central nervous system (CNS) tissues
such as brain and retina. It is during this time that neural networks are formed
that remain for the life of the organism. A pathway in the rat retina has been
identified that when perturbed leads to gross morphological disruption of the
distribution of retinal cells with minimal degenerative changes. It is
hypothesized that this pathway is involved in maintaining cell architecture and
overall cell morphology of CNS tissue. It is also possible that this pathway
functions to direct migration of cells to their proper location during
development. This pathway in the retina is being characterized beginning with
the identification of the proteins involved. The location of these proteins
within the retina will be analyzed and compared with the location of the major
structural elements that exist within cells. From these results the proteins
that mediate the observed cell changes, their distribution within cells, and the
major structural elements that are affected can be determined. This will
contribute significantly to our understanding of structure\function
relationships in the CNS.
