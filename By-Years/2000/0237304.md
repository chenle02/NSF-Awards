The project will investigate dynamical mechanisms governing intraseasonal
variability in the extratropical winter atmosphere. A leading example of this
variability is the North Atlantic Oscillation - a meridional dipole in sea-level
pressure (and related fields) in the extratropical Atlantic, which influences,
notably, the European surface temperatures and precipitation in winter. The
relationship of these regional modes with the annular (or hemispheric scale)
modes of variability (e.g., Arctic Oscillation) is unclear, although its
implications for extratropical variability and predictability are considerable.
Dr. Robinson (U of Illinois) will investigate this relationship, including the
role of tropical intraseasonal variability in influencing extratropical
predictability, from numerical experiments with idealized dynamical models;
these models can resolve the involved nonlinear interactions. These models
provide an opportunity for systematic investigation of the fundamental dynamical
issues, and Dr. Robinson will conduct a suite of experiments to fully
investigate the involved mechanisms and interactions. The project will advance
theoretical understanding and modeling of dynamical processes governing
wintertime intraseasonal variability in the Northern extratropics, and
potentially influence operational strategies for extended range weather
forecasting.
