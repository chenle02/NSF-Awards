This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Subfactor Theory in Mathematics and Physics Conference 2014" that will be held
July 14-18, 2014, on the Maui campus of the University of Hawaii.

This interdisciplinary meeting focuses on the interactions between the theory of
operator algebras and mathematical physics. Talks will be arranged under four
main headings: subfactors, free probability, and random matrices; approximation
properties for groups, von Neumann algebras, and subfactors; classification of
subfactors; conformal and quantum field theory. The conference program provides
ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
