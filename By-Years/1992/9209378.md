This project begins the preliminary research in the development and
implementation of optimal Bayesian experimental designs based on expert opinion
and informative priors. Expansions from fixed designs derived from fractional
factorial designs will include sequential designs for response surfaces and
designs for yield optimization. The role and practicalities of prior elicitation
processes will also be examined. Bayesian statistical methodology allows direct
incorporation of expert opinion or of good prior information, as is often
available for experiments in physical science and manufacturing. This project
will develop Bayesian optimal designs for experiments for response surface
models, for yield optimization and for particular application with the Taguchi
method.
