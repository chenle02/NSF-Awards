The goal of this project is to conduct disk-wind simulations that extend
previous work from 2-D to 3-D and simultaneously account for radiation, thermal
and magnetic driving effects. The program will address the following questions:
1) How are AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) fed on scales of tens to hundreds of
parsecs, and what is the relationship between feeding and feedback? 2) How
frequent are mass outflows in the NLRs of AGN as a function of intrinsic AGN
properties like black-hole mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio, and what are
their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities? 3) What is the connection
between nuclear star formation and AGN activity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students and
a postdoc, a website to distribute data, and a multimedia presentation to
attract high school students into science majors.
