IBN 9601282 PI: Jocelyn Shaw The long-term objectives of this research are to
understand aspects of neuronal structure and function in a model animal as part
of an overall goal of understanding how a complete nervous system is formed and
functions. The unc-7 gene is required in the nervous system for properly
coordinated movement in the nematode worm and is the focus of these
investigations. unc-7 appears to affect several properties of neurons including
the specificity with which they make electrical connections to other neurons.
unc-7 is related to other genes in C. elegans, which are postulated to be
required for communication between cells via small channels (gap junctions). The
function of unc-7 will be investigated by analyzing in more detail which cells
in the animal express unc-7, the location within these cells of the UNC-7
protein, and the manner in which loss of unc-7 function affects neuronal
development and function in the animal. Genes that may interact with unc-7 or
modulate unc-7 function will be identified genetically, a powerful technique
well-suited to C. elegans. Identification of such genes will broaden our
understanding of how unc-7 functions. The hypothesis that unc-7 and related
genes encode the protein components of gap junction channels will be tested by
examining the effect that these proteins have on gap junctional connections
between cells. UNC- 7 and a related protein will be expressed in cells that do
not normally form gap junction channels to see whether channels are now formed
between cells. They will also be expressed in cultured insect cells to see
whether the properties of the gap junction channels formed between these cells
are altered.
