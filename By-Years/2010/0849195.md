This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports opportunities for undergraduate students
to participate in ongoing research projects in experimental physics are
structured in a summer REU program at the University of Arizona. Students may
choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under the direction
of senior faculty members from the Department of Physics at the University of
Arizona, or also from in research groups located in several other university
academic units including Astronomy, Chemistry, Optical Sciences, Lunar and
Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric Sciences. The primary source of participants
is students who have completed the equivalent of the first or second year
curriculum in science or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation
for transfer to a 4-year degree program (although all undergraduate students are
eligible to apply). Graduate Teaching Assistants from the physics department
serve as mentors for the participants. Special orientation and skills activities
are individually tailored to enable the students to make significant
contributions to the research projects.
