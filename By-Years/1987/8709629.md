Reptiles are becoming recognized as an excellent model species for approaching
questions in behavioral development. They have well documented behavioral
patterns, which are ideal for ontogenetic study. Baby snakes are precocious,
with no help from the parents, thus they have to fend for themselves from birth.
Litters are often large--60 or more--and many do not survive to reproduce. There
is thus a premium on performing adaptive responses via genetically determined
behavioral mechanisms and/or rapid learning or other developmental mechanisms.
The present research will focus on several issues. First, there is a large
amount of diversity found among individual snakes born to the same mother, yet
little is known about the reasons underlying the individual variability. Large
effects are seen between litters in feeding, social, and defensive behaviors,
but it is not clear if these are due to environmental or genetically determined
traits. The diversity may be due to different fathers even for litter mates.
Careful behavioral observations will allow some conclusions to be drawn
regarding these questions. Snakes are also the land vertebrates with the most
complete reliance, as a group, on the chemical senses in virtually all aspects
of their behavior. The possibility that social grouping in snakes is related to
the transmission of information about food sources via chemical cues will be
examined. Such data will allow clarification of the role of chemical cues and
the mechanisms through which they act. Therefore, this research project will
address behavioral, hormonal and genetic factors that underly the adaptations
and behavioral development exhibited by this species.
