A new modernized curriculum for teaching Engineering Design Graphics (EDG) was
developed by Barr and Juricic as part of NSF Grant No. USE - 8854623 (1990).
This project is based upon the theory that an engineering design graphics
currIculum can be taught in a different way such that the learning and interest
level of students that have varied backgrounds can be optimized. The concept
involves moving earlier in the semester the 3D modeling work which is used as a
tool to explain traditional concepts of 20 orthographic work as it applies to
design and manufacturing. Students can relate to 3D modeling easily since they
have dealt with 3D objects since early childhood. The success of the theory
hinges on utilizing an "enhanced" CAE Lab that is based on a unique "LINKING"
hardware system that connects the instructor and individual students' computers
allowing communication and individualized self-paced instruction. This
"individualized" approach will enhance the students' interest and desire to
continue the study of engineering and allow them to exit the class with a more
uniform level of knowledge and experience.
