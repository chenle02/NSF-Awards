0115157&lt;br/&gt;Furse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Transportation Safety
Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Aviation Pilots Association, and
the Naval Air Warfare Command have identified aging aircraft wiring as one of
the most significant safety issues facing aviation today. In spite of the
severity of the problem, the technology to inspect the wiring to prevent serious
accidents is still very limited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is part of an
ongoing effort to develop a "Smart Wiring" system for in situ testing of aging
aircraft wiring that promises to dramatically improve wire testing and
maintenance with resulting improvement in aircraft safety. While present
technology is nearing completion for pre-flight testing, the purpose of this
grant is to expand the science available for in-flight testing of live wires.
This requires adapting spread spectrum communication techniques to overlay FDR
signals on live wires, using matched detection filters for optimal signal
detection, and use of blind source separation (signal processing) techniques to
analyze the returned signals to detect damaged wires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
"Smart Wire" concept promises a dramatic change in how cable and wire are built,
analyzed, and tested in the near future. Wire will no longer be a "passive" part
of a system, but will actively participate in its own diagnosis and maintenance
planning. The ability to test and diagnose wire failures is critical to
virtually all electronic systems, and extends far beyond aircraft wiring. The
space shuttle, nuclear reactors, high speed trains, critical data and
communication networks, life saving medical equipment, and even the family car
will benefit by an in situ cable monitoring
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
