9451553 Poston The goal of this proposal is the development of a laboratory
component requiring students to solve problems utilizing multiple laboratory
techniques. An advanced laboratory course will be developed in which students
draw upon laboratory skills acquired in general, organic, analytical, and
instrumental analysis to solve problems posed in real life scenarios that
simulate investigations a laboratory chemist might encounter. The students will
gain experience in developing problem-solving approaches, obtaining and
preparing samples for analysis, analyzing data collected from several
techniques, determining the relevance of collected data, and articulating the
results of an investigation in a format appropriate to the type of inquiry. The
investigations will rely heavily on such instrumental techniques as gas
chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), atomic
absorption spectroscopy (AA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and mass
spectroscopy (MS). This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of the GC-MS
system, graphite furnace (AA applications) and ion specific electrodes necessary
to enable implementation of this course. Use of the requested equipment will not
be restricted to the advanced laboratory course described in this proposal. The
GC-MS system will be used throughout our program. It will be introduced in
general chemistry and extensively used in organic and instrumental analysis. The
graphite furnace will be used in instrumental analysis and the ion selective
electrodes in the general, analytical and instrumental courses. It is
anticipated that about 150 students per year will gain direct experience with
this equipment.
