9753277 Spink, Amanda H. University of North Texas POWRE: Interaction in
Information Retrieval: Successive Searching by Usage over Time The proposed
study is a pilot investigation in a new and little explored line of inquiry in
Information Retrieval (IR). The primary goal is to study refinement of
successive searching in information retrieval, investigating the nature,
manifestations, and behavior of successive searching in IR, deriving criteria
for use in the design of IR interfaces and systems supporting successive
searching behavior. The following objectives will be examined: --The nature and
extent of successive IR search episodes by a set of users over time
characterizing the changes that occur in user situational context, user
information problem, cognitive and affective states of the user, and
consequently in the queries. -- On the computer side, characterize related
changes over time in the type and use of information resources and search
strategies, particularly related to the capabilities of systems and search
engines. -- Examine changes in user's relevance judgments and criteria,
characterizing their difference. -- Characterize progressive changes in shifts
in successive interactions between users and computers. -- Develop appropriate
models for IR interactions in successive search episodes. -- Derive a set of
design criteria for interfaces and systems supporting successive searching. The
research is significant in the following respects. First, as the size and
variety of information resources in IR systems and the Web grow exponentially,
the problem of searching becomes The critical problem for most users. Second,
technologically-driven designs for IR and related systems are lacking in many
respects when encountered and judged by users. Human-driven designs have to be
incorporated as well. This research is oriented towards a human dimension of
design.
