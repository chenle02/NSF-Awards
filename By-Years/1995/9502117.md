9502117 Goorsky This research program aims to develop a deeper understanding of
the connection between microscopic materials structure and performance in
compound semiconductors. The relationship among substrate properties, initial
defect nucleation, and device performance in GaAs- and InP-based
heterostructures will be studied. The role of substrate perfection and substrate
miscut on the initial stages of misfit dislocation formation and related defects
in strained epitaxial structures will be explored as well as the behavior of
layers grown under either tensile or compressive strain. This will help develop
a fundamental understanding of precisely how the magnitude and sign of stress in
the layers influences the formation of defects. %%% This research will
contribute to improving the general performance and to the realization of
advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information
processing, and telecommunications. An important feature of the program is the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials and processing research. ***
