The Department of Chemistry at Duke University will use this award from the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and
Instrument Development Program to help acquire a mass spectrometer system. The
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1. Free Radical Reactive Intermediates and Free Radical Biology. 2.
Synthesis and Analysis of Biologically Important Oligosaccharides. 3. Protonated
Base Pairs, Cytosine Deamination, and Cross- Strand Mutagenesis. 4. Boron
Containing Nucleosides and Nucleotides. 5. Molecular Metaphors and Enzyme
Inhibitors. 6. Biodegradation of Environmental Contaminants Using White Rock
Fungus. 7. Identification of the Toxic Metabolites Formed from Environmental
Contaminants. Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate structural
details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,
bioorganic and organometallic molecules. When combined with a gas chromatograph,
the resulting system affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the separation and characterization of compounds. The acquisition
of a mass spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in
many fields in chemistry.
