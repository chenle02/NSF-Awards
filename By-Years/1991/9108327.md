The SAGE (Soviet-American Gallium Experiment) project is an international
collaboration to extract and use 60 tons of the rare element gallium to detect
low-energy neutrinos from the interior of the Sun under a mountain in Baksan,
Russia. This experiment is perhaps the most critical of all solar neutrino
experiments because the low-energy neutrinos are the dominant ones released in
nuclear fusion reactions inside the Sun. The PI is generally credited as the
"father of neutrino astrophysics." This one year award will permit the PI and
his collaborators to enhance existing neutrino detection electronics and to
consult directly with their Russian counterparts in Baksan on the progress of
this experiment.
