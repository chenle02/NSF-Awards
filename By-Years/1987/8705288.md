Two new devices are being developed at the University of New Hampshire to
measure the in-place lateral stresses and strength of soils, as well as the
stiffness degradation of the soil under full cyclic stress reversal, simulating
earthquake loading. Validation of these techniques requires that the results
obtained using these devices be compared with the results from other field tests
of soils. This will be achieved with the purchase of a vane borer and a flat
dilatometer. The Mexico City earthquake of 1985 has emphasized once again the
need to be able to characterize the in situ behavior of clays subjected to
earthquake loading. However, no generally-accepted method exists for measuring
such behavior in the field over the range of strains induced by a destructive
earthquake. The self-boring pressuremeter and the cyclic pressuremeter being
developed at the University of New Hampshire show great promise of being able to
meet this need: the validation of these devices will be greatly assisted with
the purchase of a vane borer and a flat dilatometer.
