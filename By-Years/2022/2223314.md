This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant, co-funded by the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), focuses on
understanding the mechanical behavior of additively manufactured lattice
structures (AMLS). AMLS are hierarchical materials whose effective properties
depend upon both the topology of the lattice structure and the base metallic
material microstructure. Therefore, understanding the interplay between topology
and microstructure is necessary to maximize the potential application of AMLS.
In general, one of the major factors that limits a complex engineering systemâ€™s
performance is that conventional structural metallic materials serve a singular
purpose of providing structural support. However, flexibility in the design of
AMLS enables an array of multifunctional applications, such as controlled heat
transfer, vibration, energy management, and light-weighting. In this research,
the potential of AMLS will be enhanced with an in-depth experimental-
computational investigation of the combined role of microstructure and topology
in the mechanical deformation mechanisms that control the mechanical behavior
over a wide range of loading conditions. The educational part of this grant will
provide: (1) an opportunity to senior design teams to build educational tools
and techniques to teach mechanical engineering concepts to people with visual
impairment; and (2) a hands-on research opportunity to low-income
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of this project are
understanding the specific contribution and interplay between the
microstructurally driven mechanisms (e.g., those due to grain structures,
orientation, and porosity) and geometrically driven events (e.g., unit-cell
buckling, node fracturing, and macroscopic shear) on the deformation of AMLS,
and determining which mechanisms dominate under different loading conditions. In
order to elucidate the specific contribution of local microstructural features
relative to topological attributes, experimental data obtained from
microstructural and mechanical behavior characterization will be coupled with
the local state of stress computed from finite element (FE) simulations. The FE
analysis will use a yield criterion that will be customized for AMLS to capture
the anisotropic behavior of the struts originating from the repeated solid-phase
changes during layer deposition. The new yield criterion will be built based on
the strut-level tension, compression, and shear experiments for different
microstructures controlled by heat-treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
