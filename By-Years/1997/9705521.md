9705521 Du This experimental research project is a study of magnetotransport
and millimeter wave spectroscopy of the 2-D electron gas in the fractional
quantum Hall effect regime, specifically the properties of composite Fermions in
a partially filled Landau level. The experiments open a new window to probe
dynamics of the quantum Hall system. The internal structure, ie, the dispersion
w(q) of the bound states, and the inherent fluctuations of the bound states,
will be investigated. Millimeter waves tunable in energy from 1-10K will couple
into the 2-D gas via a surface metal grating or periodic density modulation, and
a sensitive differential photoconductivity technique will be used for detection.
The experiments will also involve nanostructure techniques such as high-
resolution electron-beam lithography and processing. %%% This experimental
research project is devoted to basic properties of a conducting electron system
when confined into a two- dimensional planar region. Such a confined set of
electrons at low temperatures and with high magnetic fields exhibits a very
unusual set of characteristics, and in some ways the entities which are relevant
are not electrons behaving as they behave in vacuum, but "quasi-particles"
having separable spin and charge properties. The "composite Fermions" of this
situation are to be studied by shining radio waves onto them and making
measurments to determine the response to the radio waves. On the one hand the
experiments will provide new basic information about electrons when they are in
interaction in confined layers at low temperatures. On the other hand the device
structures which are used in these experiments are similar to those used in
advanced microelectronic devices in the GaAs technology. This research will
involve students who will be well trained in the area of physics and will also
gain familiarity with semiconductor device technolgy, and who will be
excellently trained for employment in industry, government, or education. ***
