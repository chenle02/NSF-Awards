Abstract

Award: DMS-0505701 Principal Investigator: C. Robin Graham

The investigator will carry out several research projects studying various
aspects of conformal geometry and asymptotically hyperbolic metrics. These
include analyzing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Poincare-Einstein metrics,
studying the boundary rigidity problem for asymptotically hyperbolic metrics,
and developing the theory of the ambient metric in even dimensions beyond the
obstruction. The main objectives are to further understanding of these
geometries and their relationship. The methods are analytic, geometric, and
algebraic, with an intimate connection between these different aspects of the
study.

This project will study the relationship between different geometric structures:
conformal geometry on the one hand and asymptotically hyperbolic geometry on the
other. Conformal geometry is the study of properties of space which depend only
on angles but not on distances. Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces of negative
curvature, in which the analogues of straight lines separate more than in usual
flat space. Several projects will study the relationship between these
geometries. Apart from the intrinsic geometric interest, one motivation is the
AdS/CFT correspondence in Physics, a proposed holographic correspondence for
certain physical phenomena. The proposed activity will further enable the
development of human resources through educationally oriented activities of the
investigator, including advising, mentoring and teaching graduate students, and
curricular development. International cooperation and partnership will be
promoted. Ties between the mathematics and physics communities will be enhanced.
The results will be effectively disseminated through attendance and speaking at
meetings and conferences and through posting and publication of articles.
