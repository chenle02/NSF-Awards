The research objective of this award is to simulate and measure the formation of
acoustic solitons in two-dimensional granular waveguides. The PIs will design
and fabricate hexagonally packed granular lattices "defined as granular phononic
crystals" contained in a narrow channel. The PIs will unveil unique soliton
formation and transmission mechanisms in the assembled granular architectures.
The fundamental understanding of soliton propagation will enable a new class of
waveguides that can filter, delay, and redirect acoustic solitons in a
controllable and efficient manner. The PIs will achieve this research goal by
developing an advanced discrete element model (DEM) and a novel digital image
correlation (DIC) technique. Based on molecular dynamics techniques, the DEM
will simulate the propagation of solitons under the full consideration of axial
and rotational dynamics of tightly packed, frictional particles. The PIs will
verify the numerical simulation results by the DIC techniques that measure
extremely small particle displacements at high sampling
rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the viewpoint of physics, the findings in this
study will contribute to the advancement of nonlinear mechanics of granular
media based on the Lagrangian description of particle dynamics. With a view
towards potential engineering applications, the fabricated solitonic waveguide
can open a new paradigm in mechanical wave filtering, acoustic imaging, and
nondestructive evaluation by leveraging an added degree of freedom in
controlling mechanical waves. Besides contributing to science and engineering,
the research activities will also have a broader impact on educating students.
The PIs will recruit and train underrepresented students via student services
and programs at the University of South Carolina (USC). The knowledge and
product obtained from this work will be integrated into the new graduate program
in aerospace engineering at USC.
