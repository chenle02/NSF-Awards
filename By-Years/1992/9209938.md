The focus of this research is on the signal processing techniques needed to
develop a new imaging modality to detect the current distribution that exists
within the body. This modality is based on the passive measurement of the
magnetic fields of the body. The investigators will develop mathematical and
physical models to solve the magnetic inverse problem, compute the current
distribution, locate the position of the conductors in 3-D free space, and
reconstruct the image of the current distributions in a bounded conduction
medium. This research is important since it will contribute to an imaging
modality that is totally noninvasive and which has the potential to measure
physiological events (currents) which cannot be detected by any of the present
medical imaging devices. The main application of this imaging modality is
expected to be in tracking the electrical activity of the heart and the brain.
