The workshop aims to provide guidance for conducting ethical and responsible
research with marginalized individuals in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education. The workshop includes both
virtual and hybrid components for educators and researchers to identify best
practices in the ethical and responsible research for under-represented
communities. Identification of research considerations for marginalized
individuals in higher education will assist researchers in STEM to ensure
implementation of ethical, confidential, and appropriate research for vulnerable
communities. Workshop products will be of interest to educators, researchers,
students, administrators, and vulnerable research
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together subject-matter
experts to discuss salient research ethics, create resources for educators and
researchers, and to draft guidelines for ethical and responsible research
involving under-represented groups in STEM. Products will include a checklist-
style resource of considerations and an initial set of materials to use in
ongoing professional development in STEM higher education contexts. The project
include a brief pre-conference survey, idea generation virtual workshop series,
an idea synthesis hybrid workshop, and idea propagation activities. Working
groups composed of participants will focus on roadmap building and developing
materials for dissemination of current best practices to appropriate audiences
to ensure broad participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
