The NP-hardness of many natural computational problems has become a strong
obstacle to the real world of computing, where we are experiencing a pervasion
of virtually all aspects of life by computers. Dealing with NP-hard problems in
practice has become unavoidably important. A number of approaches have been
proposed but none of them has perfectly satisfied the requirements posted in
applications. This proposed research studies an alternative approach to NP-hard
problems, parameterized computation, which has recently turned out to be very
promising and useful, in particular when traditional approaches are not
applicable. The research will emphasize the difference between parameterized
computation and traditional computational approaches, and develop new and non-
traditional algorithmic techniques that are effective and special for
parameterized computation. More specifically, the following new algorithmic
techniques in parameterized computation will be systematically investigated: (1)
parameter dual bounds; (2) effective process of small unknown subsets; (3) new
analysis techniques for parameterized algorithms; (4) parameterized
computational lower bounds; and (5) parameterized algorithm libraries. The
success of the proposed research will significantly advance our understanding on
the concepts of computational tractability and intractability, and provide
effective techniques and solutions for solving difficult computational problems
in the real world of computing.
