Changes in the upper atmosphere and in its ionized part (ionosphere) can be
detrimental to human activities. They can affect satellite drag, which in turn
affects satellite lifetimes. Short term changes can lead the formation of storm-
enhanced densities, rising atmospheric bubbles, solar flare-induced ionization
enhancements, and propagating atmospheric holes and plasma patches. These upper
atmospheric disturbances have adverse effects on GPS navigation systems, power
grids, over-the-horizon radar systems, and High Frequency (HF) communications
used by the military, emergency responders, and airlines. This research is
focused on elucidating the physics that governs these processes, leading to
improved specification and forecast models, and better mitigation strategies for
adverse upper atmosphere weather disturbances. Space 'climate' studies will
involve the use of long-duration radar and satellite datasets and model studies
to determine the reasons for long-term upper atmosphere changes. &lt;br/&gt;The
primary goals of this research are to study the effects that various plasma and
neutral gas transport processes have on the ionosphere-thermosphere system, and
to study coupling mechanisms that are relevant to the near-Earth space
environment. The research involves an extensive use of data from NSF-funded and
other ground-based facilities and satellites, including data from Incoherent
Scatter Radars [Arecibo, Millstone Hill, Poker Flat (PFISR), Resolute Bay (RISR)
and EISCAT], SuperDARN radars, ionosondes, and satellites (DMSP, ACE and SDO).
The research will be conducted with the aid of high-resolution, global-scale,
physics-based models of the ionosphere, thermosphere, and electrodynamics. The
project will focus on long-term ionospheric changes and observation and modeling
of the space-atmosphere interaction region.
