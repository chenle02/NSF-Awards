The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has made an award to Professor
Charles Wight to support his work on "Structure and Reactivity of Amorphous
Solids". This investigation concerns new techniques for forming amorphous and
crystalline solid films, for developing methods for characterizing the nature
and extent of molecular disorder in such films and to assess the effects of this
disorder on chemical reactivity. The principal scientific objectives are to
demonstrate how the physical properties of disordered material relate to more
familiar properties of liquids and crystalline solids and to determine the
effects of disorder (fluctuations in local concentrations and molecular
orientations) on the chemical reactivity of solid materials, especially with
respect to chain reactions. This basic knowledge will provide an important
foundation for understanding solid-state chemistry in a number of commercial and
technological applications such as amorphous semiconductors, optical memories,
metal films photoresists, and stabilization of high energy materials.
