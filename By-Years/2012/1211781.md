This collaborative program will conduct a multi-year project to make precise
measurements of the large scale structure of the universe using recently
developed 21 cm intensity mapping techniques. The program will create spectral
maps of 500 square degrees, spanning the frequency range 700 to 900 MHz (0.58 <
z < 1). The principal goal is to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation feature
at these redshifts in an innovative program which is complementary to, and
competitive with, optical galaxy surveys. The acoustic scale provides a standard
ruler which measures the Universe's expansion, providing an observational handle
on Dark Energy.

Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate student, and outreach
to the public via a planetarium show called "The Hydrogen Sky" produced in
English, French and Chinese, and distributed worldwide. Additional outreach
activities include tours of the night sky through the Universe in the Park
program in Wisconsin and teaching electronics to under-represented groups
through CMU's Summer Academy for Math and Science.
