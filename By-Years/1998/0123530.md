This project will carry out an invitational conference for 35 U.S. and Russian
experts in mathematics education, mathematics, materials development and
psychology in late January, 2002. The conference will determine the usefulness
of the Elkonin-Davydov mathematics curriculum for the U.S. The conference, a
collaborative project of a non-profit organization with expertise in
international education (Best Practices in Education) and the University of
Hawaii's Curriculum Research and Development Group, is expected to be the first
phase of a multi-year effort in curriculum analysis, materials development,
field testing and professional development. The project will investigate how the
key features of the Russian (Elkonin-Davydov) curriculum, with its emphasis on
mathematics as an integrated whole and its foundation in Russian research on
mathematics learning, make it responsive to concerns that traditional U.S.
curricula are fragmented and lack a sound basis in research. The results of the
project will be published by Information Age Publishing Company.
