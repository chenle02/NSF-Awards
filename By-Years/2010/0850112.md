The Paschal-Science, Technology, and Mathematics (P-STM) Scholarship program
improves the recruitment and retention of talented female students in the STEM
fields by providing scholarships to four cohorts of at least 8 women who
demonstrate both academic talent and financial need. The P-STM project is
building upon both the current CSEMS Paschal scholarship program and the
college's current STEM recruiting efforts, providing approximately 96
scholarships over four years for 32 students to pursue degrees in one of the
STEM disciplines. The intellectual merit is in (a) establishing Just-In-Time
Mentoring activities, (b) establishing Math and Science Cafes, and (c) enhancing
student awareness of STEM career options. The broader impact of the program is
that, as a women's college, Meredith is uniquely situated for recruiting women
into STEM fields as it is located near the Research Triangle Park and it offers
many STEM activities for middle and high school girls on campus. The college's
strong commitment to professional development for K-12 teachers contributes to
P-STM scholars becoming mathematics and science teachers in elementary and
secondary schools.
