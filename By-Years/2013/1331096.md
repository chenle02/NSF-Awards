The Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - An Additive
Manufacturing Conference is a topical meeting that is a research exchange in the
area of Additive Manufacturing, also known as Three Dimensional Printing and
Rapid Prototyping. Over 25 percent of meeting attendees historically are
students. The objective of this grant is to make the 2013 meeting more
accessible to students by cost sharing the majority of the student registration
fee. The 2013 meeting is expected to be similar in demographic but slightly
larger in size compared to last year's 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting drew 170
researchers from all over the world, representing 12 countries. There were 114
talks and posters presented. Thirty five universities were represented, 19 of
which were domestic. For the 2013 meeting, this funding will enable the student
registration fee to be set at $225, compared to the anticipated actual meeting
cost per participant of $530.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The benefit of this grant is
facilitating access of students to the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium.
Providing student access to other students working in their area as well as
world-class research and researchers will contribute to the development of
future researchers in the field. Students are encouraged to present their work
personally. The strong international participation gives domestic participants
an excellent opportunity to gain valuable information firsthand on research in
the field. The meeting is an excellent model for advancing discovery and
understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning. The networking of
world-class researchers with students is strong. The meeting is a pinion for
research infrastructure by the networking of research personnel and information.
