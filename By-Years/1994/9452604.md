9452604 Cotts A differential scanning calorimeter system will be used in
undergraduate laboratories primarily at the sophomore, junior and senior level
and in summer independent research projects in the Physics Department at SUNY-
Binghamton. The instrument will be utilized in a series of laboratory
experiments designed to illuminate the subject of Thermal Physics for physics
and pre- engineering majors. The differential scanning calorimeter will allow
the introduction of a wide variety of experiments, at a number of different
levels. The experiments will range from those with a high level of direction and
firmly established procedure, to those which attempt to generate original
contributions in current research topics in Physics. The experiments include
measurements of phase transitions in materials (including melting, lambda
transitions, and impurity freezing point depression), the heat capacity of
solids, and solid state reaction kinetics and energetics. Additional experiments
involve the study, in the context of Thermal Physics, of the operation of the
calorimeter.
