Drugs such as cocaine, the opiates and nicotine lose much of their
effectiveness--that is, show tolerance--after repeated administration. It was
once thought that the development of drug tolerance depended exclusively only on
exposure to the drug. However, it is now quite clear that learned associations
with the environmental conditions within which drugs are taken, referred to as
drug-related cues, can greatly influence this tolerance process. Dr. Caggiula
and his colleagues have recently demonstrated that tolerance to both the
analgesic and appetite- suppressant effects of nicotine are strongly influenced
by learned associations with environmental cues signaling drug delivery.
Administering the drug in the absence of these cues reverses the tolerance, and,
renders the drug significantly more effective. Dr. Caggiula is now extending and
complementing this work with more detailed learning analyses. The first series
of studies focuses on pharmacological and learning variables that control the
maintenance of tolerance, using rats that had previously been made tolerant to
the anorectic effects of nicotine. The second series of experiments are
investigating which factors that are responsible for the development of
tolerance in drug-naive rats.
