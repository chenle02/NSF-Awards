This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that will
focus on improving dielectric mixing models used to estimate the relative
permittivity of coarse aggregate mixes. Dielectric mixing models relate the
physical characteristics of soil or aggregate (the water, air, and solid
particles) to the bulk relative permittivity (bulk electrical material property)
captured by ground penetrating radar (GPR). These dielectric mixing models in
turn are what allow engineers to estimate properties such as water content,
saturation, density, or object depth from GPR data. The research will
investigate the effect of particle gradation on relative permittivity
measurements by creating a high-quality open data set of relative permittivity
measurements on gradations ranging from smaller particles to larger particles
which will close an existing gap in the literature. From these data a new
dielectric mixing model suitable for coarse aggregate will be created. In
addition, the funding will allow for Smith College students to work with the
Girls Inc Eureka! program which will have the synergistic benefit of putting
Smith College students in a mentoring role to middle school and high school
girls in engineering and STEM. Simultaneously, it is anticipated that the
Eureka! program students will be inspired by the college-aged women in
engineering.

In order to achieve the goal of producing an improved dielectric mixing model
for coarse aggregates, large box tests (approximately 1 cubic meter in scale)
will be conducted to produce a data set to develop a new dielectric mixing
model. These box tests will consider a variety of materials with particle sizes
ranging from sand-silt mixtures (which existing models should model well) up to
cobble-gravel mixtures (which existing models are anticipated to model poorly).
Specimens will be tested under dry, saturated, and partially saturated
conditions. The work has three main objectives. The first objective is to
establish the repeatability of common practices for specimen preparation and
methods that produce the highest quality specimens. The second objective will be
to create the data set of relative permittivity values covering a wide range of
aggregate gradations, density, and water content. The third objective is to
create and verify the dielectric mixing model suitable for coarse aggregates.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
