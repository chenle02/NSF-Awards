The Delmarva Peninsula is a particularly appropriate location for a research
program in Environmental and Quaternary Geophysics. The rise and fall of sea
level during the Quaternary is abundantly evidenced in this area by relict
strandlines and barrier-spit deposits from previous relative sea-level maxima
and buried paleochannels of the Susquehanna and Delaware river systems from
several relative sea-level minima. These features have been identified and
mapped offshore and in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays using marine seismic
data. The continuation and geometry of these features on land can be estimated
from well data where available but high-resolution seismic reflection data on
land is required to accurately map them and to characterize their boundaries and
internal structure in detail. The mapping and stratigraphic positioning of these
features allow us to better reconstruct climatic change in the Quaternary and to
understand the impact of sea-level rise or fall on coastal features. The
paleochannels hold an additional interest environmentally, in that the coarse
materials within the channels may act as preferred pathways for the transport of
fluid media, including fluid contaminants.
