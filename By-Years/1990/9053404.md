A forum is established for the dissemination and classroom testing of innovative
ideas, pedagogy, and technological advances in teaching calculus. Classroom
testing is taking place on campuses of California Community Colleges and State
Universities under the auspices of the California Calculus Consortium. Faculty
are introduced to innovative approaches via a summer workshop and these
approaches are reinforced through follow-up activities during the academic year.
