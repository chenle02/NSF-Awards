This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of California at
Irvine to acquire a atmospheric pressure ionization (API) quadrupole mass
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1)synthesis and integration of non-natural amino acids
into peptides and proteins for fundamental structure/function studies, (2)
polyguanidinium/polyamine containing alkaloids, (3) structural determinations on
macrolide antibiotics, (4) oligonucleotides and synthetic ionomers, and (5)
dearomatization reactions of amino aids, peptides and in indolocarbazole
glycoside synthesis. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the
technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic acid
molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
