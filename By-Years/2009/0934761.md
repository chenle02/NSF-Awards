The CSUSB Noyce Mathematics Teaching Fellows project represents a partnership
among California State University-San Bernardino, the San Bernardino City
Unified School District, the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools,
and the non-profit partners of the Center for the Enhancement of Mathematics
Education and the California Math Council. The partners are working together to
recruit fourteen STEM professionals and prepare them to teach mathematics in
middle or high schools. The partners are also recruiting six Master Teaching
Fellows who serve as mathematics mentors and leaders in the district. The
Fellows are enrolling in a Master of Arts in Teaching Mathematics degree program
with licensure in secondary education. Fellows are also being prepared for work
in urban school settings with an emphasis on effective strategies to assist
diverse populations, especially students who are English language learners. The
Teaching Fellows are participating in professional development activities
focused on pedagogical content and teaching strategies and are engaged in Lesson
Study activities. The Master Teaching Fellows are supporting existing teachers
and Teaching Fellows and are serving as resident teachers for credential
candidates. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine its impact on
recruitment, quality, and continued support of Fellows, and ultimately its
impact on teaching effectiveness and teacher retention.
