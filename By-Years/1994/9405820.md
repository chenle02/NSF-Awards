9405820 Furlong The PIs will incorporate laboratory derived grain growth laws in
a numerical study to determine the evolution of the lithospheric mantle
consistent with the observed recrystallization data for the Ronda peridotite in
the Betic Cordillera. This study will advance the understanding of the processes
that occurred in the upper mantle of the Western Mediterranean during the late
Mesozoic and Tertiary, and by analogy in the mantle of other
convergent/extensional regions. ****
