The principal investigator will conduct research in an area of mathematics
which involves differential geometry and several complex variables. The problems
to be investigated concern the intrinsic geometry of convex domains based on
rescaling and distortion theorems, compact complex manifolds and harmonic maps,
and canonical structures on the boundary of hyperbolic space. The research to be
conducted by the principal investigator involves differential geometry,
convexity, and the theory of several complex variables. The first is an
outgrowth of Newton's calculus and involves rates of change on surfaces. The
second is the study of shapes which have no indentations. And the third is an
area of analysis where functions have more than one independent complex variable
instead of several real variables, as is the usual.
