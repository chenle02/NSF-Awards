This project aims to commercialize the technology this I-Corps team has
developed for low-cost, high-performance solar cells. Laboratory testing has
already demonstrated power output that is competitive with the best commercially
available devices and improvements are still being made. The materials used in
the proposed design are common and devices can be manufactured in a few simple
steps. Depositing a pre-mixed solution at relatively low temperatures can
produce these solar cells. This type of production lends itself to "roll-to-
roll" fabrication on lightweight, flexible materials. The use of common
materials and simple production techniques has the potential to dramatically
reduce the cost of solar energy. In addition to large scale power generation,
inexpensive, lightweight, flexible solar cells could find new applications in
construction, portable power generation in disaster relief efforts, and military
applications such as drones and remote power.

This team has developed a simple, and readily scalable, technique to rapidly and
inexpensively produce large grain perovskite absorbers for perovskite solar
cells. The results indicate that the large grain perovskite material this team
has created results in fewer defects and increased device performance, similar
to what is seen with other thin film solar cells. With all other photovoltaic
(PV) devices, large grains are essential for high?]energy conversion. The team's
goal is to determine the market interest in perovskite solar cell technology.
This will help them determine the best path forward with the proposed technology
- should they seek to become a provider of material, a perovskite solar cell
manufacturer, or just license the technology to a company already in the solar
marketplace. The team intends to learn to identify and quantify the metrics that
must be met for adoption of this technology.
