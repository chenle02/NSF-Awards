To promote high achievement in science, math, and engineering (SMET), the United
States must commit and offer resource to students of color, who are
underrepresented in these fields. SHARP is an exciting, multi-faceted summer
program that will kindle minority youth's flame for science, math, and
engineering--and for careers in SMET fields. Through SHARP, 50 African-American,
Latino, and Asian students will be exposed to institutions of higher education,
minority professionals in SMET career fields, and hands-on opportunity to work
on SMET-related projects. In the summers of 1995, 1996 and 1997, SHARP will run
a 4-week, 5- day-per-week commuter camp for 50 participants on the campus of the
University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Half will come from Boston and half from
Lowell, a small, economically distressed city north of Boston. They will learn
by doing in the University's classrooms and its science, engineering, and
computer labs. They will be instructed by minority professionals from technology
corporations and colleges that are current ESRA partners; these organizations
and individuals will also show them that people of color can and do achieve
successful careers in these fields, a critical missing piece for so many
minority youth. Field trips will expose them to colleges and businesses and
provide further options for hands-on learning. Parent activities and follow-up
opportunities will ensure that students continue to build on their newly
acquired purposefulness and skills. SHARP involves a strong partnership of
businesses, colleges, schools, and other organizations. It is coordinated by
ESRA, a minority-controlled organization that is dedicated to minority access to
SMET fields. ESRA has 9 years experience in just this type of educational and
support program, including substantial experience in programs for inner-city,
middle school students of color. ***
