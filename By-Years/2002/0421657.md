This series of six studies will examine eyewitness guessing from an objective
and a subjective perspective. We seek to understand whether and to what extent
different forms of guessing are (differentially) influenced by substantive and
procedural manipulations explored in prior eyewitness research and the extent to
which RKG judgments by themselves and in combination with other subjective and
objective measures, can predict accuracy and account for the effects of
substantive and procedural manipulations. Study 1 is a small-scale meta-analysis
that will apply the Penrod (2003) analytic strategy to studies which provide
complete information on hits, misses and false alarms in target-present and
target-absent lineups together with the rates of false alarms on a designated
target look-alike. Study 2 will examine the judgments of individuals who are
inclined to make guesses and explore the nature of the "lost" accurate
identifications that appear to accompany the use of sequential lineups. Study 3
will examine the effects of varying forms of target exposure on the use of
Remember/Know/Guess (RKG) judgments. Study 4 focuses on the effects of bias on
guessing rates, the ability of the RKG responses to differentiate accurate from
inaccurate judgments and the sensitivity of use of RKG to bias manipulations.
Study 5 will explore misinformation effects using the RKG paradigm. Study 6 will
explore unconscious transference effects using the RKG paradigm.
