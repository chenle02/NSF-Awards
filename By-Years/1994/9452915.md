9452915 Hall ABSTRACT Children's Television Workshop will plan how science and
mathematics can be incorporated into the plot line of the series, GHOSTWRITER.
The major work to be undertaken during this planning phase will be to assemble a
group of science and mathematics educators to work with a subgroup of the
existing series advisory board and with series content and research staff to: o
examine the interrelationships among disciplines such as science, mathematics,
and English and language arts within the context of GHOSTWRITER, o explore the
integration of science and mathematics into GHOSTWRITER and devise educational
goals that reflect the outcome of this exploration, and o generate content
topics and presentation techniques that will address these mathematics and
science goals in GHOSTWRITER.
