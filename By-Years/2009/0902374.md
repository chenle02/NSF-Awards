Funding is provided to explore the variability in temperature and precipitation
and their inter-relationship through Bayesian analysis of a combination of
instrumental and proxy records. The premise of the research is that,
climatologically, variability in temperature and precipitation over the last
millennium is uncertain but can be empirically better constrained using existing
data. This project will support a graduate student and post-doctoral scholar and
bring a different quantitative perspective to the analysis of paleoclimate data.
