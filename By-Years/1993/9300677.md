This proposal is a request for support from the National Science Foundation for
a conference primarily on 3 and 4- dimensional topology, to be held at the
University of Georgia, August 2-3,1993. Since 1961 the University of Georgia has
organized and hosted a major international topology conference every 8 years.
The 1993 conference will reflect the tremendous current interest in 3 and
4-dimensional topology. Among the topics that will be discussed by invited
speakers are gauge theory, topological quantum field theory, new invariants of 3
and 4-manifolds, progress on the geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds, and
new approaches to knot theory. These topics have developed very rapidly in
recent years and our conference will give researchers and opportunity to explore
the connections between them.
