The Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics will be held in
Jekyll Island, Georgia on June 4-7, 2017. This meeting is the 53rd in a sequence
of annual conferences. Its purpose is to encourage the interchange and mutual
understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to
give motivation and direction to further research progress. The conference
focuses on young researchers, placing them in close proximity to leaders in the
field for person-to-person interactions in a manner not possible at most other
meetings. Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed
for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small
groups. With the travel support provided by this award, students will attend and
present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced
researchers.

The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) is a consortium of
statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, with member programs at 45
universities in 16 states in the region. This project will fund student
participation in the 2017 Summer Research Conference (SRC) sponsored by SRCOS.
The meeting is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller
schools in the region, affording them the opportunity to participate and
interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the
cost of travel to distant venues. It will strengthen the research of the
statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the
relatively underdeveloped southern region. The conference's five session topics
are Complex Spatial Environmental Problems, Statistical Education, Functional
Data Analysis, Causal Inference, and Integrative Omics. More details can be
