1352930&lt;br/&gt;Mattioli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Grant for Rapid Response
Research (RAPID) supports UNAVCO, Inc. to assist efforts by Mikhail Kogan of
Columbia University and Jeff Freymueller at the University of Alaska to observe
postseismic deformation patterns following the May 24, 2013 Mw 8.3 earthquake at
the Kuril subduction zone. This event struck the lower end of the Kuril-
Kamchatka subduction zone, at a depth of &gt;600 km. Continuous monitoring of
the postseismic deformation caused by the earthquake will provide valuable data
for the understanding of mantle rheologic properties and subduction processes of
the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
