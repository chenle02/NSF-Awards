9317832 Brunger Computational approaches are important for structure
determination by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy, studies of
macromolecular structure/function relationships, protein folding, structure
prediction, and drug design. The proposed workstation cluster will enable us to
extend the limitations of these methods and to apply them to more difficult and
important biological problems. The workstation cluster will also serve as a
platform for testing advanced algorithms for the parallelization of our
programs. The main computational tool for the proposed projects is the program
X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b). We routinely use X-PLOR for structure determination and
refinement of X-ray and solution NMR structures, as well as for free energy
perturbation calculations, structure prediction and certain aspects of
structure-based drug design. It is proposed to acquire a workstation cluster
which provides the most cost-effective and flexible solution to satisfy our
needs. X-PLOR performs very efficiently on the proposed workstations. We intend
to primarily use the cluster in a mode where multiple and independent jobs are
run independently on the processors. Thus, we can readily make use of the
proposed cluster without extensive software development.
