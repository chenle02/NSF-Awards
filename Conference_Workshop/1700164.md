This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"2017 Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS)" that will be held from May
22-26, 2017, on the campus of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas.

This conference is the 2017 version of the Great Plains Operator Theory
Symposium, a series that has been an annual major operator algebras and operator
theory meeting since 1981. The meeting will be of broad scope and of interest to
the full operator theory and operator algebras communities with well over 100
participants expected. Topics to be highlighted in the 2017 meeting include the
following: the corona problem; Hilbert modules; noncommutative function theory;
deformation-rigidity; subfactors and fusion categories; classification of
C*-algebras; C*-algebras and dynamical systems: the Baum-Connes conjecture;
noncommutative differential geometry; index theory; operator spaces. The format
of the meeting with plenary lectures and contributed talks allows participants
to learn of the latest developments from world leaders and provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigator to present
their work.
