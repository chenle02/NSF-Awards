0129616 &lt;br/&gt;Rob Jackson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent genome projects
and the growth of molecular biology in general have had an enormous impact on
the biological sciences at cellular and subcellular scales. While systematic and
evolutionary biologists have been quick to incorporate molecular advances in
their research, plant ecologists have only recently begun using such approaches
to discern how populations, communities and ecosystems function. This four-day
workshop will bring together plant ecologists and molecular biologists to
discuss ways to hasten the incorporation of molecular techniques into ecological
studies and to foster interactions between the two groups. The workshop will
address opportunities for collaborations and two-way interactions between
molecular biologists and plant ecologists, and will explore particular needs of
ecologists that may require development of new molecular tools. It will address
training needs for ecology graduate students applying molecular approaches to
ecological questions. The workshop will produce a joint publication that
outlines specific ideas and methods for increasing the use of molecular
approaches in ecological research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
