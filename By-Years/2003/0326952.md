ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0326952&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boron isotopes in
marine carbonates may provide information about past ocean chemistry because the
inclusion of this isotope into carbonates is controlled primarily by the
carbonate chemistry of the ocean. However, to date no systematic, global
evaluations of this proxy have been carried out. For this reason, a PI from
Queens College plans to test the utility of the boron isotope paleo-pH proxy by
analyzing planktonic and benthic formaminifera obtained from surficial sediments
recovered globally from regions with well-defined water chemistries. Results
from this study will provide an opportunity to document potential deviations
from predicted isotopic compositions in response to species effect, temperature
and alkalinity. In addition, the PI will carry out laboratory calcite growth
experiments to determine the influence of pH, temperature, pressure, salinity
and growth rate on the boron isotope composition of calcite. Foraminifera
culture experiments with Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides (species
with and without symbionts, respectively) also will be done under controlled
water composition and temperature to assess boron fractionation in response to
symbiont density and other variables. Lastly, the effect of diagenesis
(dissolution and recrystallization) on the boron isotope composition will be
evaluated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Results from this study will
determine whether boron isotopes can be used as a paleo-pH proxy to obtain
information on ancient climate change in lieu of direct evidence. An
understanding of past natural fluctuations in the earth's climate is essential
to comprehending and evaluating current pattern of, and anthropogenic impacts
on, global climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
