The proposed studies seek to elucidate the mechanisms by which bidirectional
organelle movements are mediated and regulated in fish melanophore cells. The
principal investigator has recently demonstrated that pigment granule dispersion
and aggregation are regulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,
respectively. Moreover, these studies suggested either that pigment granule
dispersion is mediated by protein phosphorylation alone or that dispersion is
mediated by a unique force generating ATPase that can utilize ATP-gamma-S for
motility. In the proposed studies, experiments are designed to reveal if an
ATPase is involved in dispersion. Additional experiments will be conducted to
determine if exogenous cAMP protein kinases can rescue dispersion in cells
treated with 8- azido-ATP, which inhibits endogenous protein kinases and
ATPases. Studies will also be done to identify the protein whose phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation are responsible for controlling the direction of pigment
transport, to determine whether it is localized on pigment granules or in the
cytoskeleton, and to determine if its interaction with these organelles differs
during granule aggregation and dispersion. The ability of isolated granules to
move along purified microtubules or melanophore cytoskeletons will be assessed,
and the transport proteins will be identified and isolated. Cell biologists have
long recognized that particles, molecules and organelles are transported in a
highly regulated fashion within the cell. Recently, progress has been made in
identifying the molecular basis of particle transport. The results of the
experiment proposed here will contribute materially to our understanding of the
transporter system and the proteins that constitute it.
