This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Arthur S. Goldberg of
Long Island University at Southampton and Dr. John C. Coll of James Cook
University of North Queensland, Australia. This research is to investigate
indicators, such as, toxicity, of the presence of chemical defense substances in
worms of the marine annelid family. Chemical studies will be carried out aimed
at isolating and determining the structures of those compounds used for chemical
defense. Building on these studies, the effects of these chemical defenses on
the diverse marine ecosystems found in the coastal waters of central and
northeastern Australia will be explored. The project represent excellent
collaboration between the Australian group and its interest in marine natural
products and chemical ecology, and the Goldberg work on marine repellent toxins.
This is important fundamental work in the chemistry of worms of the marine
annelid family and the role they play in the marine environment, as well as
having potential for isolation of bioactive compounds with useful applications.
