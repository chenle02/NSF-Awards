The purpose of the proposed research is to develop models for prediction of
microstructure and transformation temperature for materials that undergo phase
changes under stress. As an integral part of this research, the theoretical
model will be checked experimentally. The research will provide fundamental
knowledge for present and future applications of materials which change phase.
The behavior of these materials under stress plays a central role in the
transformation toughening of ceramics, the optimization of ferroelectrics in
hydrophones and the potential use of shape-memory materials. The proposed
research has a great potential for providing a better understanding of
microstructural effects and new discoveries in a technologically important class
of materials.
