BDEI: Spatial Data Infrastructure for Ecological Research (Planning Grant)

Summary

The Biodiversity and Ecosystem Informatics Research Agenda
(http://bio.gsfc.nasa.gov) notes the current inability to compare data across
spatial scales as a critical problem: "Biological data from different sources
are frequently collected and presented in different scales and resolutions
resulting in a loss of detail when multiple data sets are required for data
synthesis and analysis".

This grant brings together a team of ecologists and computer scientists to plan
a proposal for a "Spatial Data Infrastructure for Ecological Sciences." The
proposed infrastructure would allow a scientist to define a data set by putting
together the proper "spatial." building blocks -- building blocks represented in
conceptually familiar, domain-specific terms. Data sets thus constructed (or
recast) would be amenable to the automatic integration of spatial locations and
measurements with automatic spatial data transformations.

This would allow spatial analysis of individual field data sets and the linking
together at same and different spatial scales data sets defined within the
spatial infrastructure. We aim to include productivity enhancing research tools
such as field data gathering devices and data validation and analysis, and to
automatically tag field data with metadata early in the research cycle. We thus
also contribute to the synthesis of metadata and data.
