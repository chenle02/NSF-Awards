This dissertation research examines differences in the ranking of graduate
programs of study in American universities across disciplines and over a period
time (1964-1981). The goal is to determine the significance of organizational
factors, within departments and within universities, in promoting the
effectiveness of doctoral programs. Effectiveness is gauged by faculty ratings
of these programs. Both stability and change in the ranking of doctoral programs
will be examined, using existing faculty rankings from 1964, 1969, and 1981.
Similarities and differences in factors affecting the ranking of graduate
programs in the natural and social sciences will also be investigated. The
project will contribute to an understanding of trends in higher education in the
United States and the role of organizational factors in promoting quality
education.
