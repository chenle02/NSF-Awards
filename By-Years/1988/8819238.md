A photoreceptor cell responds to light in a series of steps. In the vertebrate
eye, cyclic GMP is a compound in the photoreceptors that increases in internal
concentration when the cell is illuminated. The increased concentration of cGMP
then triggers opening of channels in the cell membrane that allow ions to cross
it. Since the ions carry electrical charge, their movement produces the
electrical event called the receptor potential. Very little is known about the
light-dependent cation channel in photoreceptors of invertebrates, although
invertebrates offer the promise of understanding the genetic basis for the
development and regulation of this important feature. The fruit fly, Drosophila,
is well-known for its use in genetic studies, and a wide variety of mutant
strains are available. This project will study light-dependent cation channel in
flies, using a newly developed preparation in vitro that allows access to cell
membranes for the electrophysiological technique of patch-clamp recording. The
properties of channel opening and closing will be established and compared with
those for vertebrate photoreceptors. Biochemical compounds will identified that
control the opening of the channel to compare to the cGMP role in the vertebrate
photoreceptors. Visual mutants of Drosophila will be screened to identify
possible genes that determine the structure or function of the genes controlling
this important membrane component. This work will lead directly to the promise
of genetic manipulation allowing structural analysis of these channels; such
analysis of proteins important in sensory transduction will have substantial
impact on all sensory science.
