This is a phase II award under the small Business Innovation Research program.
In Phase I, the efficient photocatalytic decomposition over titanium dioxide of
several organic pollutants in the gas phase under a range of concentrations and
conditions was demonstrated. In this work, it will be established whether the
pollutants are in fact detoxified and not converted to decomposition products
that are still toxic in an environmental sense. The products of the process
under various radiation intensities, flow rates, and concentrations are
identified. Photoefficiency and product measurements are made for gas streams
typical of those found in the field. An attempt to define the useful scope of
the gas-phase sensitization method is made.
