0929609&lt;br/&gt;Khan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuskegee University proposes to use
a low-cost flight simulation environment to enhance learning physics and
mathematics for students in grades 8-12 in a rural community in Macon County
schools in Alabama. It outlines a development strategy for module development
that engages undergraduates and teachers in the development process followed by
teacher implementation including teacher training and student workshops. The
proposal design calls for adapting an innovative and successful strategy for
engaging and teaching undergraduates to grades 8-12. Hands-on learning modules
will be developed and teachers trained in their use. An interdisciplinary team
from the Aerospace Science Engineering, Mathematics, and Psychology &amp;
Sociology Departments will develop the hands-on learning modules and provide
training to teachers on using these modules as well as on developing their own
modules. Exposure of 8-12 grade students to this environment at Tuskegee
University which has the rich heritage of the Tuskegee Airman will excite
students interest in STEM and motivate the target audience. The learning modules
will be pilot tested and then offered as intensive on-campus workshops during
weekends and summer to middle and high school students and teachers. The
learning modules utilizing the flight simulation environment as a virtual
laboratory will provide a dynamic, engaging and realistic environment of hands-
on activities to learn the various concepts of physics and mathematics and their
inter-relationship and application in real life.&lt;br/&gt;
