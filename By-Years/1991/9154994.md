The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Research Center for
Energetic Materials will initiate a year-round, Early Alert Young Scholars
project in the Physical Sciences to include an intensive, four-week,
residential, summer component for 24 students entering grade 9. This program is
for minority participants and will focus on the applications of physics and
physical science to explosive technology, as well as to other disciplines.
Participants will be involved in a research project, field trips, science
ethics, career decision making, the development of a science project to be
completed during the academic year and instruction in math and science.
