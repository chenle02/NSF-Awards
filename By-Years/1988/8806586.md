Graptolites were marine colonial invertebrates that floated in the world's
oceans during Paleozoic time. Their flattened remains are common in grey shales
of this age, and they are important stratigraphic age indicators. Dr. Charles
Mitchell proposes to collect and study graptolites that are preserved as
unflattened specimens in limestones. These collections will reveal the
intricacies of how the individuals grew and budded to form colonies. Dr.
Mitchell will use a computer-based image analysis system in a quantitative study
of morphology and growth. These analyses will be combined with a cladistic
analysis of evolutionary relationships, resulting in a clearer picture of the
early evolution of this important fossil group. The proposed research represents
an ambitious and very modern study of an important fossil group by a young
investigator. The project will help to establish procedures for combining
morphometric studies with phylogenetic analysis, and it has potential for far-
reaching impact on the study of colonial groups in general.
