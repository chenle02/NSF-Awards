The mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods developed in this
project will address key scientific challenges in applied mathematics including
three-dimensional electromagnetic wave propagation in periodic chiral or
nonlinear structures; global uniqueness and numerical solution of the ill-posed
inverse diffraction problems; adaptive techniques for solving linear and
nonlinear Maxwell's equations; second harmonic generation in dielectric and
metallic nonlinear optical media; and multiscale modeling, analysis, and
computation of optical responses of nano structures.

The recent enabling technologies of high-performance computing facilities and
microlithographic fabrication techniques have led to applications of diffraction
from subwavelength structures, establishing diffractive optics and nano optics
as two of the most rapidly advancing areas of current research in optical
engineering. Possible application include: fast optical switches that are a key
element of purely optical computers; plasmonic materials and optical
metamaterials, which are leading to really amazing technological innovations,
such as "invisibility cloaks" and "superlenses"; near-field or super-resolution
optical microscopy that allows to observe objects that a smaller than the light
wavelength, etc. The substantial growth of significant applications of
diffractive and nano optics has driven the need for novel mathematical models
and numerical algorithms. Accurate modeling of electromagnetic fields within
these materials presents challenging mathematical questions both in theory and
computation. Our computational models and optimal design tools will provide an
inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the
design and fabrication of optical devices. The research results will benefit the
optics industry and nano technology.
