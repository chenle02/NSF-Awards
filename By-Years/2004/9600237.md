This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research between the
PATH project of the University of California at Berkeley, led by Pravin Varaiya,
and the SPECTRE project of INRIA (French National Institute for Research in
Informatics and Applied Mathematics) led by Joseph Sifakis of INRIA/Rhone-Alpes.
The objective of the PATH project is to design automated highway systems so that
capacity and safety of surface transportation are increased substantially. This
project is part of the Federal Highway Authority's Intelligent Transportation
Systems Program. SPECTRE's objectives are to (1) design and develop programming
languages for concurrent and real-time systems; (2) define and study models and
specification languages; and (3) design and implement validation techniques
adapted to specification languages. The objective of the proposed collaboration
is to apply techniques in hybrid systems theory and verification tools to PATH's
design of automated highway systems. The U.S. groups brings to this
collaboration their expertise in theory for hybrid control and verification and
a test environment, the automated highway systems project. This is complemented
by the control and verification tools developed by French group at INRIA. The
project is expected to advance our understanding of hybrid systems theory and
verification tools.
