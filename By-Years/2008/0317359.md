The confinement of non-neutral plasmas by magnetic surfaces, such as those of a
tokamak or a stellarator, is a new area of plasma research. This research
focuses on the development of the theory of confinement by magnetic surfaces of
plasmas that range from single component to quasi-neutral, which is in part
motivated by the confinement of electron-positron plasmas. The strong
electrostatic potential that arises when plasmas on magnetic surfaces are far
from charge neutrality provides excellent confinement for the minority species.
This makes magnetic surfaces (a stellarator) particularly suited for confining
positron-electron plasmas. Positron-electron plasmas, also known as pair
plasmas, are uniquely different from electron-ion plasmas due to the perfect
mass symmetry and perfect charge antisymmetry. Partly neutralized and pair
plasmas are relevant to fusion plasma physics. State of the art fusion plasma
simulation codes, such as GS2, can be benchmarked against a pair-plasma
experiment. The codes should be able to accurately predict the physics of pair
plasmas in a magnetic surface configuration, since the mass symmetry actually
simplifies the problem.
