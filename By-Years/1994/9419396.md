This award is for support of a three year program of measurements of the rate of
thickening or thinning of the ice sheet at selected sites in Antarctica. The
work involves measuring the vertical velocities of markers anchored at several
depths in the ice sheet and retrieving shallow firn cores to determine density
and long-term average accumulation. Precise, absolute marker positions will be
obtained using Global Positioning System (GPS) Surveys. The three existing sites
will be revisited and thirteen new sites in nine locations have been proposed
for establishment on the East and West Antarctic ice sheets. Measured thickening
or thinning rates will be used to test various glacio-logical hypotheses. The
results of the work will also be useful for calibrating data from satellite and
airborne altimetry of ice sheets. ***
