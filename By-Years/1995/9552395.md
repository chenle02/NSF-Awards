ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Neuroscience Laboratory
Courses Developed A new interdisciplinary program and major in Neuroscience was
inaugurated in 1994, which is a collaborative effort between the Departments of
Biology, Psychology and Anthropology. The program is a rigorous approach to the
study of the functions and mechanisms of the nervous system and related organ
systems, and rests on a foundation of lower-division laboratory courses in
Biology, Psychology, and Chemistry, plus 2 introductory core courses in
Neuroscience. Upper division classes are specialized lab classes in the
participating disciplines. The equipment pupchased is allowing for the
development of modern, investigative laboratory courses in molecular and
cellular neurobiology, and in behavioral and comparative endocrinology. Students
are conducting lab exercises in electrophysiology and neuroanatomy, the
properties of hormone receptors, and of the role of the endocrine system in
regulating metabolism.
