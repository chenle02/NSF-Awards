This project co-funded by the Science, Technology &amp; Society Program and the
Environmental Sustainability Program is a study of building codes in the City of
Austin. The PI analyzes four historical types of architectural codes -- tacit,
representational, economic, and civil -- to assess their potential for including
social equity as a publicly acceptable dimension of sustainable development.
Each code type has one or more strategies of implementation, employs different
technological frames, and relies upon different kinds of authority for
implementation. The hypothesis is that civil codes have the most potential for
success in legitimizing social equity as a dimension of sustainability. Upon
completion of this part of the project, the PI tests a new theory of equitable
code-making by drafting an Alley Flat Code for the City of
Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie in its
combination of transdisciplinary research and community-based teaching, research
engagement with underrepresented communities, and its combination of analysis-
oriented social sciences with action-oriented design.
