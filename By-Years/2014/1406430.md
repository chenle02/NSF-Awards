1406430&lt;br/&gt;Slater&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a suite of near-surface field geophysical instruments to support research and
research training at Rutgers University ? Newark and the City College of New
York. Specific instrumentation that will be acquired includes: 1) a
magnetometer; 2) borehole logging tools (e.g., gamma ray detector and magnetic
susceptibility); 3) electromagnetic instrumentation; 4) a multi-channel
seismograph; and 5) global positioning system (GPS) receivers. The requested
instrumentation will support studies of carbon cycling in peatlands,
groundwater-surface water interactions, solute transport in various geological
settings, and biodegradation of contaminants in the subsurface that will benefit
from various near-surface geophysical remote sensing modalities and precise
positioning capability. The equipment will support research training and
educational outreach activities at two urban academic institutions with a focus
on engaging underrepresented students in geophysics, archaeological research,
and applications of near surface geophysical imaging tools to urban
environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;***
