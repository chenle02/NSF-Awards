The investigators are organizing the Second Workshop on Computational Issues in
Nonlinear Control, which will be held in Monterey, California during the first
half of November, 2011. This workshop will bring together top researchers in the
areas of numerical methods for nonlinear control as well as related areas of
computational methods. This will include researchers from the US, Europe and
Australia. Further, a significant portion of the workshop attendees will include
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. Researchers from
lesser-known institutions within the southwestern US, specifically including
members of the CalState system will be invited as well. In addition to the PI,
Prof. W. McEneaney (UC San Diego), the organizers include Profs. W. Kang and
A.J. Krener of the Naval Postgraduate School. The website of the conference is h

df .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major developments in the theory of nonlinear control
began taking place roughly a half-century ago. Of course, further advances in
the theory have been made since. However, over the intervening decades,
application of this theory has seriously lagged due to the lack of sufficiently
fast and robust associated numerical methods. A particularly vexing problem has
been the so-called curse-of-dimensionality, which loosely speaking, refers to
the fact that standard numerical methods for these problems have been such that
the computational requirements grow exponentially with problem complexity. In
fact, numerous advances in control were partly motivated as means for avoiding
this numerical bottleneck. In recent years, a number of remarkable new
approaches have been developed to combat the fundamental computational
difficulties. At this workshop, we will share ongoing developments in order to
accelerate this progress.
