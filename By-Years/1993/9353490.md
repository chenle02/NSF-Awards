9353490 Stanley This exhibit will integrate graphics, artifacts, highly
interactive electro-mechanical demonstration devices together with state of the
art interactive educational computer technology to demonstrate how probability
shapes nature. It will draw its examples from a variety of scientific fields
including physics, chemistry, earth sciences, and biology. It is planned as a
permanent addition to the Museum's exhibition program, but will be designed to
facilitate easy reproduction for individual copies or for circulation as a
travelling exhibit. Millions of visitors--families, teachers, children form
diverse communities--will gain a first hand aesthetic appreciation of the
pattern finding process of scientific investigation as well as a better
understanding of the usefulness of mathematics in explaining how the natural
world works. ***
