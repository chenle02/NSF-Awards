Professor Wei Zhan of Auburn University is supported by the Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to
develop a new class of molecular photovoltaic systems using chromophores
(porphyrins), electron acceptors (fullerenes) and donors (ferrocenes) assembled
within solid-supported thin lipid bilayer films. Organothiol adsorbates on gold
will be used to adjust the surface properties of the solid support including
polarity, charge, work function, redox properties, and degree of electronic
conjugation. Photocurrent generation will be correlated with molecular and
bilayer structural changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms
of charge transfer and the relationship between film structure and photocurrent
generation will shed light on important current-limiting processes, and help
improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. The educational initiative
includes classes and demonstrations to broaden awareness of alternative energy
generation, and outreach activities for a broad audience in Alabama.
