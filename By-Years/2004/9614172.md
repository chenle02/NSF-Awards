The title of this workshop is Parallel Unstructured Mesh Computations. The goal
is to bring together leading researchers to design new, fundamental algorithms
and software infrastructure that provide an integrated approach to parallel
unstructured mesh computation. An important focus is on moving the basic
computer science and mathematics research developments into the application
arena, while simultaneously fertilizing the basic research with the ideas and
difficulties that arise in real application codes. This workshop is being
organized by the University of Tennessee and will take place September 9-11,
1996 at the Argonne National Laboratory, in Argonne, IL.
