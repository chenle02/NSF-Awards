year component and a summer session component. The academic year components is
open to all junior year electrical engineering students and the summer session
focuses on recruiting underrrepresented students from nearby undergraduate
colleges and universities. Example research projects are: 1.) Theory and
Application of Microwave Backscattering, 2.) Practical Optical Waveguide Grating
Fabrication, 3.) Applications and Implication of Virtual Reality, 4.)Multilayer
Perceptron Neural Networks, and 5.) Measurements for Automated Surfaces
Finishing.
