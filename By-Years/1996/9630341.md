9630341 Grusak This award supports studies on the processes, regulatory
mechanisms, and cellular compartments that are involved in the transport of
micronutrient metals in higher plants. The capacity to mobilize iron, copper,
zinc and mangenese in the phloem transport system will be studied using a
combination of physiological, biochemical and analytical approaches. Special
emphasis will be given to identifying the endogenous metal-binding compounds
(chelators) that are involved in the loading and transport of metal ions in the
phloem system. Pea will be used as the experimental system. Details on the
cellular events and endogenous compounds involved in the transport of metals in
higher plants will provide the foundation for identifying regulatory mechanisms
that mediate the integration of metal-associated processes from source tissues
to the whole-plant level. Because the transport of metals and other nutrients to
developing sink regions of the plant is often entirely dependent on phloem
delivery, and because metals play such an integral role in numerous metablic
functions, the understanding gained in this research will have significant
relevance to improving the nutritional quality of seeds, ensuring successful
seed germination and early seedling development, enhancing the process of
phytoremediation, and manipulating metal-induced gene expression in sink
tissues.
