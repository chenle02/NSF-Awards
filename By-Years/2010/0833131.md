Peta-scale systems have tens of thousands to millions of cores. To exploit the
performance for applications such as climate prediction, environmental modeling,
astrophysics, biology, life-sciences, etc, the problems of programming these
systems must be solved. Programming language enhancements, compiler techniques
and runtime support must be developed to enable computing and knowledge
discovery at this unprecedented scale. The challenges faced by a user in
programming these machines include performance, power, productivity, and
portability, which are inter-related in a complex way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This project entails the design and development of programming language,
programming model, and compilation optimizations for I/O and storage performance
and power optimizations. The project is investigating ?What minimal set of
changes or enhancements to programming models, programming languages, and what
optimizations to compilers and runtime systems are needed to enable better I/O,
file and storage systems performance while optimizing power and improving
productivity?? Some specific questions include: What language enhancements can
be used by to specifically improve the I/O and storage performance? Should
interfaces be developed that can be used across languages for I/O? What compiler
optimizations are needed? Can the compiler identify transform codes that can
inform the I/O runtime and storage systems on phases to power-down disks to save
power at certain times as required? The project tasks include: the design and
development of programming-language enhancement; the design of a compilation
framework and performance- and power-oriented I/O optimizations using novel
compiler analyses; and the design of a novel hint-handling mechanism within the
I/O stack. &lt;br/&gt;
