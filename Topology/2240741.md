This award supports the Richmond Geometry Festival: Knots, Moduli, and Strings
taking place between June 2-4, 2023, at Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond, VA. This conference aims at bringing together specialists in two
research fields: low-dimensional topology and algebraic geometry from various
career stages and from a variety of institutions. In addition to lectures by
internationally recognized experts, vertically integrated participation will be
fostered by a poster session, featuring work by early-career researchers, and a
Career and Mentorship Panel.

The first two (virtual) editions of the Richmond Geometry Festival were held in
2021 and 2022. These events showcased new trends in knot theory, algebraic
geometry, and string theory, and emphasized interrelationships in the study of
braid varieties, Khovanov homotopy, complex Chern-Simons theory, link lattice
homology, and the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence in families. The
third edition of the Richmond Geometry Festival will provide an in-person venue
for dissemination of the most recent results in this exciting line of research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
