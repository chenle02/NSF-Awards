The Coalition to Increase Minority Doctorates has the formal support of 35
universities and colleges, two government laboratories (Los Alamos and Sandia),
eight professional organizations, nine educational projects and twenty one
corporations. At the precollege level the Coalition utilizes programs developed
with the College Board and Educational Testing Service at three broad sites
(Central and Southern Arizona, the Navajo Reservation, and Northern New Mexico
and Southern Colorado). The activities at the undergraduate level include the
following: 1. summer bridge programs, 2. summer research and graduate
preparation institutes, 3. career awareness programs and 4. faculty directed
student research. At the graduate level, through Project 1000, the students will
join a network of 70 participating graduate schools throughout the nation.
