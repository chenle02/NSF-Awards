This research project is an interdisciplinary study to identify and to quantify
biological chemicals that affect ecological relationships among benthic
antarctic marine invertebrates. This research is a continuation of a program
that succeeded in documenting a moderate incidence of chemical influence on
ecological relationships in polar communities, contrary to contemporary theory
that suggests an inverse relationship between latitude and incidence of chemical
defense. This project extends the scope of that earlier study by addressing the
chemical nature of defensive agents. The objectives are to isolate and to
characterize biologically active chemicals from previously identified
invertebrates with chemical defense mechanisms. The goals are to evaluate the
role of these chemicals as feeding deterrents, anti-fouling agents or overgrowth
inhibitory chemicals, to determine the biological origin of these chemical
metabolites, and to examine the storage of defensive agents in specific tissues
or mucus. Ecologically significant bioassays will guide the analytical isolation
and characterization of identified defense metabolites. The proposed research
will enhance our understanding and significance of defense metabolites in the
ecology of antarctic marine benthos, a changing paradigm.
