Easy access to scholarly resources is at once a frustration and a challenge.
Both archivists and scholars in the history of science have become increasingly
aware of the opportunities afforded by the use of electronic media. The
possibility of integrating productivity-enhancing tools with the resources
themselves holds great promise for more efficient, and more thorough, archive
use. By its close, Scientists on Disk, will have processed more than 20,000
pages from the J. Robert Oppenheimer archives at the Library of Congress. Under
a previous grant, Dr. Kargon has assessed and tested several delivery media,
including CD-ROM and digital tape. Yet an important consequence of their
investigations has been to realize the current and future significance of
network-based information. They have concluded that the existing research
network, Internet, is the best way to allow world-wide scholarly access to
electronic media archives. Existing communications software can be adapted to
facilitate Internet access to the Oppenheimer archives already converted to
digital form. Doing so would make possible the near-instantaneous use of these
resources by scholars and students world-wide. Under this grant, Dr. Kargon and
his collaborator Jeremy Kargon are: 1) extending an existing network protocol
(WAIS) to accommodate electronic resources such as images and multiple-type
documents so that electronic archives might more accurately represent scholarly
documents; 2) making a prototype and disseminating a model information client to
handle better such extensions, as well as a wider range of data types (including
compressed images and bibliographic information); 3) implementing and
maintaining an information server integrating these changes, using the
previously scanned Oppenheimer documents. Properly equipped users around the
world will be able to access this and other archives in a single, integrated
fashion. Together with other fast-developing network tools, these efforts should
encourage the proliferation of network-based, multi-media resources.
