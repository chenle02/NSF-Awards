This proposal investigates an extended longitudinal chain of high-latitude HF
radars in order to obtain global-scale coverage of high-latitude ionospheric
convection and related phenomena. This chain will provide continuous, two-
dimensional observations of high-latitude plasma convection within a field of
view that will eventually extend over as much as 14 hours of magnetic local time
and 65o to 85o in invariant latitude. The SuperDARN network consists of four
pairs of radars sited at five locations extending from Alaska to Finland; this
proposal will study the first of these pairs. This network will provide insight
to studies in large-scale structure and dynamical evolution of the high-latitude
ionospheric convection pattern and its effects on the structure and dynamics of
the upper atmosphere. Further, the network will aid in studying global
distribution and transport of high latitude ionospheric irregularities as well
as the large-scale distribution and propagation gravity waves excited by high-
latitude sources.
