Observed electron density distributions for the silica polymorphs coesite and
stishovite will be analyzed in terms of their topographical features. Critical
points and bond paths for these distributions will be located by calculating
gradient vector maps and regions of bonded and nonbonded densities will be
located by calculating Laplacian relief maps. An analysis of the maps will
pinpoint regions that are susceptible to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack,
information that is important to understanding mechanisms of surface reactions,
transition states and catalytic reactions in zeolites. The method will also be
examined as a tool for monitoring phase transformations. It is anticipated that
the calculations will generate new zeolite structure types, materials of
considerable interest in the petrochemical industry as solid state acids and
catalysts for producing high-grade gasoline from coal gases and molecular sieves
for beneficiating petroleum products and for serving as environmental filters.
