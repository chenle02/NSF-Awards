This project involves a series of analytical experiments aimed at determining
the major-element and important minor-element concentrations within selected
fluid inclusions in a variety of oceanic rock samples. Both conventional methods
(microscope heating/freezing experiments) and new methods (synchrotorn-source
x-ray fluorescence) will be used. These analyses will enable well- constrained
pressure-volume-temperature modeling and thermodynamic modeling of oceanic rock-
fluid systems.
