0424401&lt;br/&gt;Doherty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exploratorium, a leading
informal science education institution, will establish an internship program
that brings cutting-edge research to the museum's visiting public while
developing long-term capacity in education outreach for participating research
scientists and research science institutions. In 18-month positions, four
Exploratorium Interns from the fields of physics and mathematics will use their
disciplinary expertise to integrate scientific research into informal learning
by developing, implementing, and evaluating activities such as Web sites and
Webcasts; online science activities; publications; demonstrations; workshops for
teachers, museum educators, and the public; and interactive science exhibits.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Funds for this award are provided by the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
