Adsorption is under development worldwide as a chemical- engineering unit
operation for the separation and purification of gaseous and liquid mixtures. In
addition to separation of air into its components and removal of pollutants from
air and water streams, adsorption is being considered for a host of new
applications, including separation of proteins from bioreactor product streams,
recovery of carbon dioxide from combustion of fossil fuels, recovery of uranium
from sea water, methane storage, and ultrapurification of water and raw
materials for the electronics industry. Current research using molecular
simulation by grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics is providing
new insights into the physics of adsorption. Results from these fundamental
investigations provide a solid foundation for the development of new theories to
replace the classical thermodynamic methods. The objective of this research is
to bridge the gap between adsorption theory and practice by developing a
molecular theory capable of predicting preferential adsorption from fluid
mixtures. Adsorption isotherms of single gases and their binary mixtures, and
isosteric heats of adsorption of single gases, will be measured. Experimental
data collected for four binary systems will serve to test theories for
predicting mixed-gas adsorption equilibria from single component isotherms and
heats of adsorption.
