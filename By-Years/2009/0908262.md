This study will test hypotheses about the responses of marine birds to spatial
and temporal variability in ocean processes in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands. Using a data set of over a million records compiled over thirty years,
this group will analyze (1) seasonal patterns of seabird occupancy of various
ocean domains, (2) the stability of distributional patterns of seabird species
among oceanographic habitats at annual to decadal time scales and (3) temporal
patterns in seabird abundance within different ocean regions over annual to
decadal time-scales. The approach will permit testing the temporal stability of
patterns in distribution and abundance previously hypothesized to be important,
but for which initially only one to three years of data were available. The
researchers will seek mechanistic explanations for the patterns observed in
seabird distribution and abundance using concurrently-obtained physical and
biological data, where available. These data include information on zooplankton
distribution and abundance collected during seabird surveys since the early
1990s, monitoring conducted by the Japanese training ship Oshoro Maru, and the
distribution and abundance of forage species as determined by the NOAA bottom
trawl and acoustic surveys. These evaluations of seabirds-at-sea in relation to
ocean conditions will provide a broad evaluation of the utility of pelagic
studies of seabirds as indicators of ocean conditions.

This study is the first to examine the at-sea distribution and abundance of
seabirds over a 30+ year period. It is expected to show how seabirds have
responded to climate-driven changes in hydrographic conditions and in the
distribution and abundance of zooplankton and forage fish over the southeastern
Bering Sea shelf. It will be the first high-latitude study to test how the
responses of piscivorous and planktivorous (and diving vs. surface-foraging)
seabird species to ecosystem change may differ.
