This project provides a summer institute for granting Master of Science in
Astronomy degrees to middle and secondary school teachers. The model involves
the use of astronomy as a framework within which participants' knowledge of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and their skills in classroom teaching, are
enhanced. The curriculum includes refresher courses in physics, solid geometry,
and pre-calculus mathematics. The studies progress through calculus and
differential equations, and to more advanced physics, astronomy, and chemistry.
The program also contains seminars on teaching methods, laboratories, and
exercise development. Laboratory and classroom demonstrations are featured,
along with exercises and visual aids that the participants can use in their own
classes. The participants will also be familiarized with useful computer
software. Each fall, the participants return to their home schools with an
assortment of tools to enrich their teaching. They keep in touch with institute
staff by a computer bulletin board system based on the University of Arizona's
internal computer conference network.
