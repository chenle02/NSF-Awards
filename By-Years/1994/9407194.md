9407194 Langer The Institute for Theoretical Physics will continue its very
broad and unique effort. The Institute promotes research in theoretical physics
with a particular emphasis, when appropriate, on problems that cut across the
traditional subfields of physics. Its main activities are long term research
programs which typically run five to six months. These programs bring together
diverse groups of theoretical physicists and other scientists to work in
research areas that are especially timely, important, and intellectually
challenging. Two programs operate in parallel at any one time, each with
approximately fifteen physicists in residence. The topics of the programs, which
have spanned the entire gamut of theoretical physics, are usually an outgrowth
of suggestions from the national and international theoretical physics
community. Most program coordinators are from outside the Institute, although
the permanent members often play a major role in these activities. In addition,
the Institute conducts an average of six conferences or workshops per year, most
of which are associated with the long term programs. The Institute's effort will
foster the health of theoretical physics generally, and permit particularly
effective research on cross-subfield problems. ***
