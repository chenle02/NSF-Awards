This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the
feasibility of long-term leak monitoring of water, gas, and petroleum pipelines.
The firm has designed and validated a portable acoustic leak detector which
exceeds the performance of other devices which are limited to detection of
acoustic leak signatures of 60 dB below the pipe noise level. Alternative
technology consists of vehicle-based surveying methods, registering emissions.
The new system is aimed at the challenging, unsolved problem of detecting leaks
whose acoustic signatures are 90 dB below the noise level. Pipeline sensors are
placed up to 20 miles apart and data is analyzed remotely. The present proposal
will develop sophisticated signal processing methods needed to detect small,
emerging leaks automatically. The firm is partnering with a well-established gas
pipeline supplier. A series of experiments performed on a 10-mile gas pipeline
will establish the sensitivity of the technology and the parameters of
monitoring. Results will determine whether long-term, computerized small-leak
monitoring of pipelines (gas, water, and petroleum alike) is feasible. The
concept has generated enthusiasm from the gas industry. The Company projects a
potential market of over $400 million, building on a portable-device water
market of $100 million in which the firm is active. This award is supported by
the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
