The research on this new grant will focus on transverse phenomena in ensembles
of multistate fermion systems. One theoretical objective is to bridge the gap
between the new, actively developing field of spin-polarized quantum systems and
conventional theories of low temperature systems of particles with internal
degrees of freedom. Another objective is to develop a general theory of
transverse (off-diagonal in internal states) phenomena in systems of multistate
fermions. The Fermi liquid theory fails to describe this class of effects and
needs, at the minimum, to be modified. There will be strong interactions with
various experimental groups in order to apply the developed theories to
ultralow-temperature thermometry, boundary effects and new quantum coherent
effects in ultra-cold atomic ensembles and beams, and some quasi-particle
systems in solids. %%% Fermi liquid theory has been the standard model for many
years of the collective properties of interacting fermions at low temperatures.
However, recent work on spin-polarized systems at ultra-low temperatures has
indicated that the Fermi liquid model is deficient at these extreme conditions.
This research will modify the Fermi liquid model, or develop new models as
necessary, to deal with these new phenomena.
