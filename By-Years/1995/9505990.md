9505990 Gurnis This award provides 55% of the funds required for the acquisition
of a computer system that will be installed and operated in the Seismological
Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The equipment will
be used primarily in computer-intensive research that includes geophysical
modeling of the structure and processes occurring in the Earth's crust and
mantle regions. It will be managed as a research and teaching resource available
to staff and students involved in solid earth sciences research at Caltech. ***
