The PI will develop, refine and test models for the recording process. This
includes both phenomenological and fundamental micromagnetic models for the
recording head and medium. These three-dimensional models are mainly extensions
of previous work. The phenomenological models are intended for the systems
designer who wants to optimize performance, and the fundamental models are
intended for the materials engineer who wants to understand the relative role of
particle interaction on the magnetizing process. Such factors as over-write and
track width effects will be analyzed.
