Quantitative description of the primary nucleation kinetic region is vital to
the state-of-the-art in hydrate research. Without kinetic research, the basic
physics and chemistry cannot be used to interpret the fundamentals of hydrate
formation. Since the kinetics of primary nucleation from liquid water seems
experimentally elusive and resists duplication in different laboratories, the
starting point must be experiments which are reproducible - those kinetic data
obtained for hydrate formation from ice. This first step has useful analog for
later extension to hydrate formation from liquid water. The impact of the
proposed research represents a part of a turning point in the history of hydrate
research from time- independent studies (thermodynamics) to time-dependent
(kinetic with physical forces) studies. The results of the work are too long-
range to be supported by industry. Yet the results have impact on such diverse
problems as rates of gas release from hydrates for environmental problems,
energy recovery, and the plugging of pipelines in the North Sea environment.
