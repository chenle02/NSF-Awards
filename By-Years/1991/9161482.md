The flatjack is an hydraulicly pressured bladder which will measure in-situ
stress and modulus of elasticity of a masonry wall panel. The research will
investigate the use of polymer materials with fiber reinforcement to develop the
equipment. The equipment will be validated under known conditions of stress in
test wall panels.
