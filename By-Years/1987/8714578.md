This award will enable Prof. George Nagy of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
and Dr. Bianca Falcidieno of the Italian National Research Council in Genova,
Italy, to continue a successful collaboration that started in 1981. An algorithm
developed in the previous stage of the research is used to define a data
structure, called a visibility map, on an appropriately triangulated terrain
model. The map shows whether there is an unimpeded line of sight between any two
points. The algorithm is related to existing hidden-surface algorithms, but
incorporates concepts based on the unique characteristics of the problem.
Additionally, the global nature of the visibility model provides a useful
alternative to partial derivatives for defining topographic entities. Other
algorithms have been developed applying the resulting visibility map to rank
order the best observation points. Among the problems to be considered by the
investigators are: line of sight (television, FM, radar) communications and
surveillance problems; hidden paths; orientation and navigation; the inverse
transform from the visibility map to the original terrain data; data
compression; and the extraction of significant terrain features such as ridges
and valleys. The U.S. PI will bring to the collaboration experience with
computer vision, optical scanning, and engineering applications of pattern
recognition, remote sensing, geographic data processing, and computational
geometry. The Italian side will provide expertise in computational geography,
computer cartography, computer graphics, solid modeling, and graph theory. The
research is expected to contribute to computational geometry, to topographic
information systems, and to telecommunications.
