Astronomical observations show that collisions between large galaxies are
violent events. During collisions galaxies form many stars, and the galaxies
change shape. Sometimes small galaxies, called dwarf galaxies, merge with larger
galaxies during collisions. Other times the collisions produce long trains of
stars thrown out into the space between galaxies. The investigators have
numerically simulated the mergers of dwarf galaxies and studied the remnants of
these mergers. In this project, they will improve their simulations and compare
the simulations with new observations. New telescopes, like the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST), are designed to study the smallest and faintest
galaxies in the Universe. Many more colliding dwarf galaxies are soon to be
discovered with these telescopes. The investigators will use their simulations
to better understand the merger history of galaxies. This topic is important for
understanding the history of formation of our own Milky Way galaxy. This
collaborative project will leverage strong existing outreach efforts at both
Columbia University and The University of Arizona. They will expand the TIMESTEP
program, which reaches under-represented minorities and develops a community to
support them throughout their academic careers. They will also support graduate
students who produce popular YouTube videos, which answer top public astronomy
questions.

The investigators will improve their previous simulations by increasing mass
resolution of the cosmological simulations and by modeling larger volumes of
space. They plan to model dwarf galaxy pairs in the region near our Milky Way
galaxy. They will dynamically match the models and explore the role of dwarf-
dwarf galaxy mergers. The investigators will also create a simulated catalog of
dwarf sub-halo pairs using the high-resolution, dark-matter-only, cosmological
simulation. They will compare the observed dwarf galaxy pair counts with
expectations of Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological models.
