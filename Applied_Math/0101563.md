Proposal No: 0101563 - Abstract

Some problems of mathematical and numerical analysis related to singularly
perturbed boundary value problems will be studied. The mathematical problems
include obtaining sharp bounds for derivatives of the solution that take into
account boundary layers, interior layers, and corner singularities. The
numerical problems include the development of stabilized discretizations for
these singularly perturbed problems and the study of the best approximation
properties of singular perturbation problems.

The proposed work studies physical systems in which some quantities undergo
rapid changes in certain regions. Such systems include fluid flow, where the
rapid changes occur at boundary layers, shocks, and interior layers. These
systems arise in the design of fluid machinery, the study of underground oil and
water transport, the modeling of airflow over cars and airplanes, and other
areas. The results of this research will be of use in the development of more
accurate computer simulations of these systems, with consequent improvements in
the design of equipment used in such real-world problems. In addition, the
proposal provides for regular visits of Professor M. Stynes to the U.S.; it is
planned that Prof. Stynes will interact with graduate students in mathematics
who are working in related areas.
