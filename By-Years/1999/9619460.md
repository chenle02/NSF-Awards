Smecker-Hane, Tammy 96-19460 Dr. Smecker-Hane and collaborators will determine
the star-formation and chemical-evolution histories of dwarf galaxies in the
Local Group. They will combine photometry of stars from the tip of the giant
branch to well below the main- sequence turnoff with spectroscopic metallicity
determinations for a few hundred stars in each of three galaxies. A fourth
galaxy will be observed with the Keck 10-m telescope to determine compositions
for stars outside of the inner regions of our own Galaxy. The abundance patterns
will lead to estimates of how the star-formation rate and gas content evolved.
These studies will be combined with new theoretical models and numerical
simulations of dwarf galaxies. Comparing the models with the data obtained will
lead to fundamental advances in understanding the physical mechanisms that
control the evolution of galaxies.
