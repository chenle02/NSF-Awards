w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705242 Northby This experimental research project
focuses on unusual properties of nanometer scale droplets of helium and other
rare gases, produced in a beam apparatus, including excited states of the
nanodroplets produced by electron excitation. The bombardment with electrons of
variable energy produces various charged and metastably excited states of the
droplets. The proposed work builds on a previous observation that infrared light
can produce photodetachment of electrons and also of metastable helium molecules
from the clusters. A time of flight velocity spectrometer will be added and used
to measure the energy distributions of the detached species. Experiments will be
perfomed to measure (1) the energy of the bombarding electron which creates the
initial excitation, (2) the energy of the photon which detaches the resulting
relaxed particle, and (3) the velocity distribution of these particles after
detachment. The goals are to learn about the cluster density of states, to
measure the ground state kinetic energy of an electron trapped in a bubble, and
to study the evolution of excitonic states of the cluster. %%% This experimental
research project probes unusal properties of nanometer size droplets of rare
gases, particularly helium, produced in a beam apparatus. Of particular interest
are interactions of the nanometer scale droplets with electrons of variable
energy, which put the drop into states of altered energy and/or altered charge.
The excited states thus produced are of fundamental interest, and will be probed
by use of light, which has been found to lead to detachment of metastable helium
molecules from the excited clusters. The velocity distribution of resulting
photodetached molecules will be measured with a time of flight apparatus. The
research will add important information about nanometer scale clusters, their
interactions with electrons, and the nature of their states as their energy is
raised. This research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves
graduate students who will be excellently trained to enter positions in
industry, government or education. ***
