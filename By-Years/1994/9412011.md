9412011 Rutledge This Equipment Grant funds the purchase of computer equipment,
audio interface components and support software which is dedicated to support
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several projects,
including speech processing to compensate for sensorineural hearing losses,
speech recognition over the telephone, enhancement of alaryngeal speech, and
audio processing based on psychoacoustics. Acquisition of this equipment will
permit processing of higher quality speech and audio signals, and implementation
of algorithms having much greater complexity with more efficiency. ***
