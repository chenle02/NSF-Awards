This grant provides funding for research pertaining to the computation and
analysis of extended Nash equilibria that arise from many applications in
operations research, including pricing and design in electric power markets,
internet network analysis, resource allocation in communication systems,
competitive capacity expansion in uncertain environments, supply chain
management, as well as open-loop differential games with state dynamics and
control constraints. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the design of
fast efficient methods for (a) computing standard Nash equilibria with cost
functions that are at best once differentiable, and (b) solving generalized Nash
games (i.e., games with joint constraints), multi-leader-follower games (which
include Stackelberg games, i.e., those with one leader and multiple followers),
dynamic Nash games for which continuous-time solution trajectories and pathways
of disequilibria are sought, Nash games with random elements (e.g., players'
optimization problems are stochastic programs with recourse), as well as
collusive games where players collude to&lt;br/&gt;increase their Nash payoffs.
We will also investigate the price of anarchy for some extended games on
networks. The application areas provide a rich source of open problems that
encompass all the challenging features mentioned here: joint constraints,
hierarchical structure, dynamics, stochastics, and collusion.&lt;br/&gt;
