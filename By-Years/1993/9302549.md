Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake an Ocean Sciences
instrumentation development project to design and construct an integrated
capture and aquarium system for obtaining, studying, and maintaining live deep-
sea animals. Components of the system will include a variable-ballast float
package that will be capable of lowering and raising the aquarium to full ocean
depth, pressure-retaining traps outfitted with observation ports for viewing
animals inside, a deep-sea camera system for monitoring trap performance on the
sea floor, plus necessary mechanical and electronic systems for keeping the
water within the aquarium at high pressure and cold temperature once the system
is recovered. Progress in the study of deep sea organisms is being impeded by a
lack of ability to capture them and study them while alive. This aquarium system
will meet this requirement and open up new areas for deep sea biological
research.
