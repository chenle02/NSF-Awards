This award supports cooperative research between Daniel Jay of Harvard
University and Fan Peichang of East China Normal University on mapping of active
site residues in the erythrocyte anion exchange protein. The opportunity
provided by this cooperation to study an important question of protein structure
and function requires the complementary experience and capabilities of the two
investigators and is thus well suited to support by the US-China Cooperative
Science Program. This cooperative work will involve use of facilities both at
Harvard and at East China Normal University in Shanghai. It is expected that use
of the relatively inexpensive and rapid approach proposed by the PI's will
result in a strong and mutually beneficial cooperation.
