The area of superconductivity is receiving considerable attention because of the
development of the recent high-Tc ceramic materials. While much work needs to be
done to exploit these for electronic applications (for example the production of
good quality amosphous films, high quality Josephson junctions, and other basic
circuit elements) other materials of high quality and reasonable Tc, such as
niobium oxide, have already been exploited to demonstrate various electronic
circuits. The future of the superconducting electronics area looks exceptionally
bright because of the future potential offered by these recent materials
developments. The present proposal deals with an investigation of the microwave
and optical properties of combined semiconductor and superconductor circuits.
Although the panel felt it was out-dated by the recent developments, it
recommended funding it with the realization that the perspective PI would have
kept abreast of these and would be sensitive to their potential in the device
areas he wished to pursue. Funding is recommended with $49,840 from lightwave
technology and $20,000 from SSME.
