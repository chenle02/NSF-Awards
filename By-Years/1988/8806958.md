The PI has considerable experience in computer recognition of objects which, if
improved, could be of considerable value to areas like robotics and industrial
automation. The PI proposes to improve the quality of features used in object
recognition, by using newly developed methods for supervised learning taken from
the "back propagation" school of neuroengineering. The chances of success in
this work are considered quite good.
