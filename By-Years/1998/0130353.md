The National Science Foundation supports the Boston University Conference on
Language Development to be held at Boston University each November from 2002
through 2006. The conference is an internationally recognized meeting for
researchers in the areas of first and second language acquisition, bilingualism,
language disorders, and literacy development. It is attended by 400-500
researchers from around the world. Its presentations are chosen by anonymous
peer review, and its proceedings are published by Cascadilla Press. The 2002
keynote speaker is Susan Goldin-Meadow; the 2002 plenary speaker is Bonnie
Schwartz. Since 1976, the faculty and students of Boston University's Applied
Linguistics Program have organized and run the conference. Dr. Shanley Allen
leads this year's team of student and faculty organizers.
