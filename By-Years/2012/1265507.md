In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Robert A. Pascal, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at
Tulane University will explore the synthesis of new types of configurationally
stable, chiral, polycyclic aromatic molecules. With the exception of the
helicenes, such structures are quite uncommon and often difficult to synthesize,
and their properties are largely unexplored. Four new classes of these compounds
are proposed, with syntheses that are very short and easily modified for the
tuning of shapes and properties. Their structural features ensure both high
barriers to racemization and generally high thermal stability, and most of the
molecules should be strongly luminescent. The resolved enantiomers of these
compounds are expected to show very high optical rotations, strong circular
dichroism, and strong circularly polarized luminescence, which in some cases may
be modulated by external factors (temperature, light, etc.).

The expected photophysical and chiroptical properties of this class of molecules
make them candidates for application as organic electronic materials,
particularly in display technologies or as electrooptic modulators. The expected
structures may lend themselves to application as chiral catalysts or chiral
hosts for separation technologies or medical diagnostics. The research itself
will provide training for a variety of undergraduate and graduate scientists
including women and underrepresented minorities, who will later enter into
productive careers in science, engineering, and medicine.
