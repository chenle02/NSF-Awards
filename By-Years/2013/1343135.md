This project supports summer schools in Geometry and Physics held at The Simons
Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP) at Stony Brook University. The first
summer school is titled "Moduli spaces and singularities: algebraic and
differential-geometric approaches" and will take place in June-July 2014. The
summer schools are aimed at graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific activities
of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP) at Stony Brook University
are supported by the Center's endowment, and are aimed at the research community
of mathematicians and physicists. The goal of these activities is to further
knowledge in the collaborative areas of theoretical physics and geometry. Modern
theoretical physics has contributed a series of profound geometric ideas which
gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. By now
there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and
physicists working at the interface between physics and geometry. The influence
flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing
crucially to major advances in mathematical and theoretical physics. In addition
to research workshops the SCGP plans to run summer schools in Geometry and
Physics aimed at graduate students. The annual activity called for under this
proposal is a two-week summer school for graduate students. The lion's share of
the NSF support is for graduate student support (lodging and meals) during
summer schools. The remaining funds are necessary to pay for travel and lodging
of outside senior lecturers at the summer schools.&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of
this activity will be to bridge the existing gap between mathematicians and
physicists at the level when new researchers are entering academia and encourage
interdisciplinary research up the pipeline. The interdisciplinary character of
the Center provides a nice environment for training graduate students and young
researchers. An effort will be made to involve many women as participants.
