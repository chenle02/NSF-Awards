Kammerer, Martin T U. of Southern California The research is directed toward an
improved understanding of process-response interactions within river channels.
Specifically, the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of bottom
roughness elements and sediment transport rates will be examined with particular
focus on feedback interactions. It is hypothesized that bedforms exert important
controls on in-channel processes and thereby influence the spatial and temporal
distribution of sediment transport rates and pathways. Frictional components of
bedforms are viewed as active, rather than passive. This ultimately has
important ramifications for channel stability. The crucial aspect of the work is
to evaluate sediment transport processes in light of a drag-partitioned view of
the fluid power available in a river system. A detailed study of velocity
profiles, sediment transport rates and bottom configuration will be collected in
the Green River of Colorado. The data will be analyzed within 'local' and
'spatial' frameworks. The results will yield new understanding of sediment
transport predictive capabilities and bedform existence fields.
