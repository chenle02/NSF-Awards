Thioredoxin is a redox protein implicated in reducing functions in a wide
variety of cell types, and is recognized as playing significant roles in
metabolism and survival. The functions of this enzyme(s) in cyanobacteria is
here focused on the physiological functions of two distinct forms of the enzyme
present in the cyanobacteria and in chloroplasts of green plants. The effects of
nitrogen and sulfur starvation on the amounts of these enzymes present in cells
will be assessed, as will also the function in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis.
Molecular genetic aspects of the two thioredoxins will be studied in
relationship to function in photoautotrophic growth. Seeking a more thorough
understanding of the functions of two forms of the enzymes known as thioredoxins
is the object of this research. These enzymes are present in green plant
chloroplasts and in the cyanobacteria, the latter the focus of this project; the
functions effected by each form is unclear and should be clarified by the
approaches to be employed. The role of these enzymes in regulation of cell
activities in a wide variety of organisms is being recognized as of increasing
significance.
