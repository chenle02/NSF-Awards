Manifolds are geometric objects modeling the universe. Geometry and topology of
manifolds are often governed by certain natural differential equations. One of
the greatest discovery in mathematics is the Fredholm index, which measures the
size of solution space for such differential equations. The beauty of the
Fredholm index is that it would not change under small perturbations. The famous
Atiyah-Singer index theorem computes the Fredholm index of these differential
equations when the manifold is compact. This theorem has numerous applications
to geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. If one takes symmetries into
consideration, then there is a much more refined invariant of the differential
equation called the higher index. When the higher index vanishes, a new subtle
higher secondary invariant naturally arises. These new invariants have powerful
applications to mathematics and physics. The PI and his students plan to study
these invariants and their applications. This project will contribute to US
workforce development through mentoring of graduate and post-doctoral students.

The higher invariants of differential equations or operators live in K-theory of
certain geometric operator algebras in the context of noncommutative geometry.
It remains a major challenge to compute these higher invariants. Part of the
underlying difficulty comes from the lack of understanding for the universe of
groups, which plays the role of symmetries here. The PI and his students intend
to devise new methods to compute these higher invariants and apply these
computations to solve problems in analysis, differential geometry, topology, and
mathematical physics.
