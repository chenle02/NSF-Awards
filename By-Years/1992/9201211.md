This research on mixture models will develop graphical diagnostics and formal
tests to identify the presence of mixing in generalized linear models and to
determine the number of mixing components for finite mixtures. Methods will also
be developed to incorporate full information for case-control studies with
errors in variables. The theory will draw on ideas and techniques from
nonparametric maximum likelihood, empirical processes, asymptotics, convex
geometry, total positivity and from simulation. Mixture distributions arise when
homogeneous populations are combined in such a way that the origins of
individuals are lost. A fundamental problem involves determining whether or not
this combining has occurred and if so, how many different originating
populations there were. This research will investigate graphical techniques and
will use mathematical theory to develop practical statistical methods to answer
these kinds of questions in many scientific applications.
