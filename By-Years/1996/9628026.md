Li, Gang SUNY-Buffalo This proposal deals with a soil erosion model and
specifically within such a model the sediment transport capacity of overland
flow. The ability of future models to predict soil erosion depends upon the
predictive accuracy of erosion and deposition which in turn is contingent upon
the development of a reliable transport capacity equation for overland flow on
rough surfaces. The proposed research will develop such an equation for laminar
interrill overland flow. A secondary goal is the investigation of the effect of
suspended and saltating sediment on the velocity profile and flow resistance.
These goals will be pursued by performing flume experiments using differing
roughness elements and simulated rainfall at differing intensities. In a second
set of experiments, a hot-film anemometer will be used to measure velocity
profiles and flow resistance will be calculated from the profiles. The effect of
sediment transport on shallow laminar flows has not been investigated
previously. The determination of the effects has important implications for our
further understanding of the hydraulics of laminar overland flow. Statistical
analyses, especially mutiple regression, will be used to develop the necessary
predictive equations.
