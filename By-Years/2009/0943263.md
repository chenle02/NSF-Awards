This EAGER proposal will test the hypothesis that insects and other taxa that
induce plant galls have acquired the necessary biosynthetic pathways from
bacteria via symbiotic associations with bacteria or by horizontal gene
transfer. If supported, this hypothesis would provide a comprehensive
explanation for a very widespread evolutionary phenomenon, which is the origin
of plant galls. Genomic DNA of a limited number of gall formers will be searched
for evidence of transfer of bacterial genes. Molecular tools will then be used
to demonstrate the presence of genes in gut versus non-gut tissues. This simple
analysis should resolve whether the important gene sequences appear to be host-
or bacterially-derived.

The broader impacts of this EAGER are potentially very significant. Results
could lay the foundation for methods to control insect, nematode, and protistan
gall formers that cause extensive loss to agriculture and forestry. If these
gall formers have acquired the ability to form galls from bacteria, then new
approaches to control gall formation can be developed. The study also will
provide a new, more parsimonious explanation for a very widespread ecological
phenomenon.
