ABSTRACT, Lepowsky Lepowsky plans to continue his investigations of the
algebraic and geometric features of vertex operator algebra theory and conformal
field theory, and to apply this work to a range of problems. He will continue to
collaborate with Yi-Zhi Huang on their theory of vertex tensor categories, with
applications to algebraic, topological and geometric questions, including
questions associated with the remarkable phenomena known as ``monstrous
moonshine.'' He will also pursue connections between vertex operator algebra
theory and both algebraic geometry and number theory. In recent years, there has
been a great deal of progress on a range of mathematical theories related to
string theory in theoretical physics. This project focuses on vertex operator
algebra theory, which provides the algebraic basis of conformal quantum field
theory, a foundation of string theory. The mathematical theory has its own
motivations and points of view, sometimes directly related to physical
structures and sometimes not. In the project, basic problems on the algebra and
geometry of vertex operator algebra theory will be addressed, and the results
will be applied to problems in algebra, geometry, number theory and finite group
theory.
