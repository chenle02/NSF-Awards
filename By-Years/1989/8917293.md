Dr. McFall-Ngai proposes to investigate the initiation, development and
maintenance of the symbiosis that exists between a sepiolid squid, Euprymna
scolopes, and the marine luminous bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, which E. scolopes
harbors within the tissues of a complex light-emitting organ. The work outlined
in the present proposal will focus specifically upon: 1) assessing the influence
of the bacterial partner on stage-specific host tissue morphogenesis, 2)
identifying temporal windows during which developmental interactions must be
initiated, 3) determining the bacterial specificity of the association, and 4)
isolating and identifying classes of symbiosis incompetent mutants of Vibrio
fischeri that will define crucial symbiotic genes. %%% The Euprymna/Vibrio
symbiosis presents a rare opportunity to discover the significance of
interspecies interactions in the control of gene expression, organ
morphogenesis, immunological recognition and the consequences of other
developmentally controlled signal processes.
