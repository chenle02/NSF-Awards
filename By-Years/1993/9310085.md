9310085 Liu The purpose of this research initiation award (RIA) is to conduct
research to determine the thermomechanical properties and behavior of VLSI
semiconductor devices. Experiments and analytical studies will be performed to
measure the material response and the interfacial strength for various bi-
material combinations such as thin specimens of metal/polymer, silicon/metal,
fiber reinforced layer/metal, and fiber reinforced layer/patterned metal at
elevated temperatures and various moisture levels. The emphasis of these
experiments will be on determining the mode dependent interface fracture
toughness for delamination. Then, damage tolerance analyses of packaging
devices, based on analytical/numerical modeling, will be performed and the
results will be compared to data obtained from experimental test chips. ***
