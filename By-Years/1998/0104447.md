This MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
award supports a research project in the study of quantum gases, or Bose-
Einstein condensates, an area that brings quantum mechanics from the level of a
single atom to millions of atoms. The proposed research will study vortices, a
fundamental structure in Bose-Einstein condenstaes, at the Ecole Normale
Superieure in Paris. The research will be undertaken in collaboration with other
theoretical and experimental groups in Europe and the US, specifically at Oxford
University in England, at the F.O.M. Institute in Amsterdam, and at the National
Institute for Standards and Technology.
