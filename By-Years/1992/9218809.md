This research is to investigate the implications of a new, unusually long (at
least two hours) seismic wave train having periods of about 230 sec that was
recorded at seismic stations throughout the world following the major eruption
of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. Preliminary analysis
indicates that this was a Rayleigh wave excited by atmospheric oscillations near
the volcano that were set off by continuous thermal energy flux from the
volcano. If this conclusion is correct, one can expect similar oscillations for
other eruptions observed on the new NSF-supported Global Seismic Network (GSN).
Acoustically coupled Rayleigh waves can be used for detection, characterization
and quantification of major volcanic eruptions and for study of the properties
of the Earth's atmosphere. A quantitative description of the source is desirable
as it would allow us to estimate the amount of material injected in to the
atmosphere which in turn permits us to estimate the general impact on the
environment. Volcanic plumes pose a particular threat to air traffic and the
seismic signal emitted by large volcanic eruptions has the potential to yield
rapid estimates about the plume dimensions.
