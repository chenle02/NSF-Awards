The McCullough building, erected in the 1960's, is the home for materials
research at Stanford University. Currently the building houses the Center for
Materials Research, an NSF Material Research Laboratory. It is the goal of the
Center to created a new Laboratory for Advanced Materials that will bring 15
faculty from Applied Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Physics and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory to form a
multidisciplinary advanced materials research and education community. However,
present infrastructural conditions within the building have created an unsafe
facility that lacks proper ventilation, electrical, plumbing and air
conditioning systems. The building is not in compliance with existing codes for
the type of research activities it currently houses nor the for the planned
program activities in advance materials. ARI funds will provide support to
assist Stanford in its efforts to renovate laboratory research space in
McCullough, specifically, the HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems. The major
objective is to ensure that the building is upgraded to occupancy code to
accommodate the research and research training activities required in the
facility. The project is critical to the long-range plans of Stanford in the
area of materials research, a research area of national importance. New
renovated space for advanced materials will be dedicated to research in the
synthesis, understanding and application of advanced materials, and to the
education of students from various science and engineering disciplines in the
multidisciplinary style essential in materials research.
