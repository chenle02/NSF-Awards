Japanese skills in applied research and manufacturing have enabled them to take
over markets for many products. More recently, they have begun to excel in
targeted areas of basic research. Assessment of such Japanese R &amp; D is
necessary to guide management of U.S. research and to ensure that the most
advanced technologies are available to the United States. The proposal presents
plans and methodologies for a study of Japanese R &amp; D in five emerging
engineering technologies (to be determined) where focussed funding could
accelerate progress in the United States. The detailed research will be done by
five expert panels who will analyze Japanese literature, visit Japanese
laboratories and present their findings in workshops and technical reports.
Several Federal agencies have agreed to support funding to this phase of the
study.
