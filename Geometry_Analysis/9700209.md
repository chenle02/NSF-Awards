9700209 Cieliebak This project lies in the area of symplectic topology with an
emphasis on symplectic manifolds with boundary. Specifically, the investigator
wishes to give a geometric interpretation of Gromov's squeezing theorem and to
obtain new results about the structure of Hamiltonian flows on 3-dimensional
manifolds. Symplectic manifolds are curved spaces admitting a structure akin to
that possessed by complex Euclidean space. Symplectic manifolds have
applications in mechanics as well as other parts of mathematics including
complex geometry. In Hamiltonian theory of mechanical systems for example, the
use of symplectic manifolds results in certain conceptual as well as
computational simplifications.
