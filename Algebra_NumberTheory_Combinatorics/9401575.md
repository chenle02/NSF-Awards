9401575 Stembridge This award funds the research of Professor John Stembridge
into applications of combinatorial methods into problems of Algebra. The goal is
to produce algorithmic methods for producing certain generating functions,
enumerating reduced expressions obtained from studies of algebra, and
constructing particular bases. The results should have applications in algebra,
number theory and algebraic geometry. This research falls in the broad category
of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.
At its roots, combinatorics is the study of systematic counting. Counting can be
incredibly difficult when the objects are difficult to list, and combinatorists
look for general methods for overcoming these difficulties. Today's
combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern
mathematical techniques. Although its roots go back several centuries, the field
has had an explosive development in the past few decades. This growth comes from
its importance in communications and information technology and from the success
of modern techniques to problems of counting.
