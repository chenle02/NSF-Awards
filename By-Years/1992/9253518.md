Dr. Gerard Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia University, is one of
thirty recipients of the 1992 Presidential Faculty Fellow Award. This
prestigious award for young faculty members is given in recognition of
excellence and promise in scientific research and teaching. Parkin was honored
for work in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry. He has shown through
meticulous methods that bond-stretch isomerism is an artifact of
crystallographic impurities. His work with main group and transition metal
complexes of (pyrazolyl)hydroborate have led to novel results. First, he
isolated and characterized the first monomeric three-coordinate zinc alkyl
derivative and the monomeric terminal hydride complexes of zinc and beryllium.
In addition, he has developed a monomeric zinc hydroxy derivative which serves
as a structural and chemical model for active site of the enzyme carbonic
anhydrase. Recently, he has isolated compounds with terminal tellurium bonds. He
is also known as an enthusiastic teacher and mentor and has been involved in
curriculum revision and a special program with high school students.
