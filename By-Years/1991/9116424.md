This award supports a U.S.-Japan cooperative research project between Professor
Bikram Gill, Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, and
Professor Takashi Endo, Institute of Natural Science, Nara University. This two-
year project, which also involves Professor Rama Kota of Kansas State
University, will use the approach of genetically-induced deletion mapping to
construct comprehensive cytogenetic maps of individual chromosomes of common
wheat. The chromosome deletions are caused by certain Aegilops chromosomes when
added to wheat. These so-called "gametocidal" chromosomes will be used to
construct unique deletion stocks. Deletion mapping with multigenic tester stocks
consisting of morphological, physiological, protein, and DNA marker loci will
also be undertaken. The size and breakage-point in deletion chromosomes will be
identified by C- banding and in situ hybridization techniques in order to
determine the physical location of specific genetic markers. This is a no-cost
proposal for NSF. It is required because the Japanese counterpart proposal to
the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) requests funding for the
Japanese investigators. The award will combine the research interests of the
U.S. investigators on physical mapping of the genome of wheat with the research
of the Japanese investigators on the production of deletion stocks.
