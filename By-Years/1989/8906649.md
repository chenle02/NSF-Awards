The toothed-lipped gobies are a group of some thirty to forty species of fishes
distributed in insular freshwater streams throughout the Indo-Pacific. They are
distinguished from all other fishes by a unique typed and arrangement of teeth
in their jaws and also on their gill arches. This study is aimed at describing
the tooth arrangement; determining the number of recognizable species; and
describing how the species are related to each other. Distribution of plants and
animals throughout the Indo- Australian Archipelago has held a particular
fascination for naturalists since the last century when Alfred Russel Wallace
attempted to divide the biota into an Australian and an Asian segment. The
toothed-lipped gobies are born and live most of their lives in freshwater but
make a larval migration to the sea. This unique lifestyle will be examined to
understand how these gobies came to be widely distributed on oceanic islands.
