Performance enhancements and increased energy efficiency that could be obtained
by reducing the dimensions of transistors is becoming difficult. Thus, Moore's
law no longer holds true for conventional approaches to chip design. Three-
dimensional (3D) integration of chip components has emerged as an innovative
packaging alternative to conventional approaches where multiple layers of
silicon are stacked and interconnected using directly through the silicon layers
(this technique is known as "Through Silicon Via" or TSV). Using TSVs and 3D
packaging enables significant benefits to the performance, functionality and
energy efficiency of future CPUs. However, 3D integration results in new types
of interaction patterns between computing cores and between core and memory
components. In addition, the close proximity between cores and memory causes
their physical attributes, such as their temperature, noise of power delivery,
and reliability to become uniquely interdependent. If innovations in 3D
integration are to continue, substantial investment in frameworks that can
simulate and evaluate 3D computer architectures are necessary. This project
seeks to develop such a simulation framework and make it available to the
computer architecture design community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this project is to develop a full system simulator for 3D CPUs while accounting
for the architectural and physical interactions between the cores and memory
components thereby allowing the co-simulation of power, performance and
reliability characteristics. The framework supports a wide array of 3D CPU
configurations including intricate specifications of cores, core counts, network
on chip protocols, on-chip/off-chip caches, main memory and off-chip secondary
storage (built using diverse set of devices including SRAM, DRAM, non volatile
devices). The project is a substantial addition to the repertoire of 3D
integrated circuit design and simulation frameworks and shall play a vital role
in future innovations in 3D CPU architectures.
