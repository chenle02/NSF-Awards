&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop and analyze new
approaches to enhancing security in wireless networks. The approach is to
exploit physical layer attributes, in particular the properties of the wireless
medium, to significantly enhance user authentication. Openness of wireless and
sensor networks makes them vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an unauthorized
user masquerades as another legitimate user/device. While conventional
cryptographic security mechanisms can be used to foil such attacks, they do not
offer a complete solution. This research exploits the distinct channel state
information of a legitimate user to authenticate subsequent transmissions from
this user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes
a thorough consideration of novel efficient approaches to channel estimation for
time-varying frequency-selective fading channels under various interference and
noise scenarios. The intellectual merit also includes a fairly complete
statistical characterization of the estimated channels for use in robust
statistical hypothesis testing to ascertain if the estimated physical layer
attributes match the previous physical layer attributes from the legitimate user
or if they are from a spoofer. Sequential Monte Carlo (bootstrap) approaches in
a Bayesian framework are also considered for user
authentication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, this
research has the potential to address some of the security challenges that arise
from the increasing deployment of wireless networks through enhanced
countermeasures. The proposed design methodology for wireless authentication
provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing conventional wireless security
mechanisms. The project promotes education of students from underrepresented
groups and dissemination of research results through teaching at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels.
