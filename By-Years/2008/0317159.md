TRAVEL SUPPORT FOR THE 10th INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY MEETING
TO BE HELD IN JYVASKYLA, FINLAND, 10-15 JULY 2004 This award will support travel
by younger U.S. scientists to attend the International Society for Behavioral
Ecology meeting to be held in Jyvaskyla, Finland, 10-15 July 2004. This biennial
conference is the primary international gathering of scientists focusing on the
ecological correlates of behavior. The meeting brings together workers from
approximately 30 countries and offers an unparalleled opportunity for behavioral
ecologists from the United States to meet new colleagues and share their work
with an international audience. The conference is organized by the International
Society for Behavioral Ecology, a relatively young organization founded in 1986
that publishes the scientific journal Behavioral Ecology, now in its 14th year.
The awards will specifically target younger, less established scientists lacking
access to other funding sources, and thus will help to increase participation by
recent Ph.D.s initiating their careers in this field.
