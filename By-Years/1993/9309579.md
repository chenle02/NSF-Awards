9309579 Papastavrou Real-world vehicle routing problems are characterized by
imprecise or unknown information about future customers and travel times,
constantly changing planning horizons, queuing considerations, resequencing and
reassignment decisions, and a variety of performance criteria that include
waiting time and delivery costs. However, classical vehicle routing models are
static, assume perfect knowledge of demands, ignore queuing effects and
typically only consider travel costs. Only recently, have new approaches been
investigated, taking into consideration both the dynamic and the stochastic
aspects of the problems. The researchers will combine techniques from both areas
of operations research, stochastics and combinatorics, to analyze a variety of
stochastic and dynamic (mainly vehicle routing) problems; these problems are
more applicable than their traditional deterministic counterparts. Research
results will demonstrate that the models will not only be useful for
transportation planning, but also for other classes of problems where congestion
effects dominate; these include scheduling problems, bin-packing problems,
facility location problems, and a special class of information retrieval
problems in computer science.
