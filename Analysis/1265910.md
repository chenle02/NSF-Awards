This project is aimed at investigating stability, regularity, and symmetry
issues in various geometric variational problems, and at exploiting the
corresponding results in the effective description of equilibrium configurations
of surface tension driven physical systems. For example, the stability theory
for isoperimetric-type problems recently established by the PI and his
collaborators, beyond its intrinsic mathematical interest, has revealed useful
in studying minimizers of classical sharp interface energies, of the Gates-
Lebowitz-Penrose energy, the Ohta-Kawasaki energy and variants, and in
cavitation models in Non-linear Elasticity. This research program will achieve
significant improvements in the stability theory for geometric inequalities,
broadening the reach of the theory to include new and challenging situations,
and opening new spaces for further applications to problems of applied interest.
Specific stability issues considered in this project arise in the study of
minimizing clusters, Plateau's problem, and isoperimetric problems in arbitrary
codimension and in Gauss space. The project will also advance the mathematical
theory of capillarity problems, by addressing regularity issues related to the
validity of Young's law, and by providing a quantitative description of
geometric properties of equilibrium configurations. Finally, the project aims to
some conclusive developments in symmetrization theory, by characterizing, from a
geometric viewpoint, those situations where equality cases in symmetrization
inequalities imply symmetry of minimizers.

This project aims to advance the mathematical understanding of geometric
variational problems. Geometric variational problems play a fundamental role in
the mathematical modeling of Nature, and in particular, in our quantitative and
qualitative understanding of equilibrium states of physical systems. Despite
their ubiquitous interest, and the very considerable amount of work that has
been devoted to their study both from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers,
several questions remain unanswered, or just partially understood, due to the
mathematical challenges they arise. In turn, geometric variational problems play
also a pivotal role in various area of Mathematics, including Analysis,
Probability Theory, and Geometry. Several important contributions to the
stability theory for geometric variational problems has been obtained in recent
years by the PI and his collaborators, with applications to the effective
description of equilibrium states of physical systems, and with the introduction
of new mathematical ideas and techniques. An important part of this project will
consist in the training of graduate students on these new mathematical
developments.
