Object detection cascades are one of the most significant recent developments in
computer vision. By enabling real-time object detection, they are a potentially
disruptive technology, which is already making a commercial impact in industries
as diverse as digital photography, automotive, surveillance, personal
identification, and traffic safety, among others. However, this disruptive
potential is currently stifled by the substantial complexity of training
detector cascades. In practice, this complexity limits the application of the
cascaded architecture to a small set of domains (most notably face detection)
which have been heavily researched by the academic community and for which
detectors are publicly available. This project aims to eliminate the complexity
hurdle, by laying the theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the fully-
automated, low-complexity, design of optimal detection cascades, which guarantee
high detection-rate while minimizing false-positive rate and detection
complexity. In particular, the project addresses major current roadblocks in
architecture design, detector design, and training complexity, through novel
contributions in cost sensitive boosting, weak learners, and optimal cascade
design algorithms. All contributions will be evaluated in the context of an
effort to deploy real-time animal detectors in some of the most popular wild-
life attractions of San Diego. This also provides an exciting and unusual
opportunity for the involvement of undergraduates in
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on the project can be found at
