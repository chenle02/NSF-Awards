9212437 Orlans This project will plan and test a pilot program to train college
teachers to introduce the consideration of ethical issues that deal with the use
of animals for research and education into their biology classes in their home
institutions. College teachers in the biological sciences need preparation to
enable them to consider these controversial ethical and policy questions, that
face them directly, and that face society generally. This six-day intensive
summer program will include approximately 15 participants from academic centers
in the 100 mile region surrounding Washington DC. Course content will be broad,
well-balanced, and will include opposing viewpoints. Visits to the surrounding
institutions before the workshop will identify a biology faculty consultant who
will work with the course directors to assure its relevance and sensitivity to
the needs of faculty participants, and will stimulate faculty interest in the
course. Post-course visits will assess progress in achieving the course goals of
stimulating curriculum change to include discussion of ethical and policy issues
involving animal use. Planning for further workshops will depend on and
incorporate results from this pilot effort. ***
