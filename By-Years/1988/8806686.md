The eighth biannual meeting of the International Symposium on High Energy Spin
Physics will be held at the University of Minnesota from September 12 through
17, 1988. About 250 participants, including 100 speakers are expected. A large
number of topics including accelerators, targets, sources, weak decays, hadron-
hadron interactions, lepton-hadron interactions, and theory will be covered. The
symposium will be preceded by a set of workshops from September 6-11.
