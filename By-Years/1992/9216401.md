Three is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) effort. The research is
a contribution to the theory of non-linear simulation, to the theory of adaptive
human interfaces and intelligent interface agents, and to the theory of human-
computer interaction. Episodic transitions occur during human-computer
interaction and in systems in related fields including biolog, the physical
sciences and the behavioral sciences. For examples, the transition from one
focus of attenstion to antoher is an episodic transition between homeostatic
states of selkective attention. These "phase transition" behaviors may be
triggered by a variety of events such as completion of a cognitive subtask or by
external interrupts. The present research is to develop tests for the hypothesis
that critical phase transitions are governed by a conservation law called the
lae of "conservation of affordance.." Affordances are expressions of system
needs which are dynamically created and annihilated through the perturbation and
subsequent restoration of homeostatic conditions. Affordances constitute the
linking of behaviors of various parts of the system that normally operate at
different time scales in order to achieve behavioral goals. Affordance is
modeled mathematically by two oppowsing sources in a non-conservative energy
flow on embedded Hamiltonian manifolds. This mathematical formulation provides
an explicit theoretical basis for dynamic engines in use on the domain of human-
comupter interaction and elsewhere. In particular it provides a portable
computational modules that support the conservation law. A set of simulations
will be developed useing this mechanism whcih can support modeling of higher
order functions such as perceptual simulation issues. An important anticipated
result is that the correct use of these mechanisms will make possible sensory
encodiung and data fusion for artigificial syustems to permit the capture and
understanding of rare and novel events. The interface and modularity ussues have
conseqwuences for interoperabbility, software capitalization adn the flexibily
sharing of research results between groups of investigaotors.
