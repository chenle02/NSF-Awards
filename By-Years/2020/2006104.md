This award investigates the unintended consequences of Internet technologies
that people have experienced in the past and that may arise in the future.
Leveraging the "wisdom of the crowd," the work will give a voice to people
across the US, including underrepresented populations, by surfacing how
technology products have affected themselves and their communities - both
positively and negatively - beyond the intended purposes. The work will also
provide tools and predictive models that help product teams anticipate the side
effects that new technologies might have on specific user groups and their
communities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research includes (1) a large-scale study
on the principal investigator's LabintheWild platform to elicit qualitative
reflections on a set of existing technology inventions; (2) automating the
analysis of this data using unsupervised structural topic modeling to determine
how different demographic groups perceive current technology and to relate
themes of unintended consequences to specific categories of technology; and (3)
developing a volunteer-powered, data-driven tool that provides a lens into the
views of broader society and supports companies in assessing and foreseeing
potential unintended positive and negative consequences without needing to
reveal proprietary ideas. The tool will automatically update its predictions
based on newly collected data to remain useful as society moves on and new
technology inventions appear. Educational components include a new course module
on societal implications and ethics of technology, involving students in all
parts of the research, and visualizations of unintended consequences that will
be developed for scientific outreach at middle and high schools and for public
access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
