The influence of the 11 year solar cycle on weather has been suspected for
centuries, but only within the last year has real progress been made on
describing with confidence the changes that are occurring. The work of Labitzke
and van Loon has shown that the effects are very different depending on the
direction of stratospheric winds at equatorial latitudes, and it is necessary to
sort the atmospheric data (winds, temperatures, pressures, location and
frequency of storms) according to the phase of the oscillation of equatorial
stratospheric winds. These winds change direction with a period of a little over
two years, and are said to undergo a "quasi-biennial oscillation" or QBO, and it
has been found, for instance, that in the West phase of the QBO the storm tracks
in the North Atlantic above 50o latitude move equatorward by about 6o at solar
maximum as compared to solar minimum. This award is for an analysis of
tropospheric wind data from 170 radiosonde stations for the years 1950 through
1987, with sorting according to the phase of the QBO, to evaluate the strength
of the correlations with solar activity. Hopefully, specific variations will
emerge that will provide a clue as to the nature of the causitive mechanism.
