Support is provided for the "Workshop on Future Directions in Evaluating
Earthquake Hazards of Southern California." The objectives of the workshop
include: (1) to summarize some of the results of recent research on evaluating
earthquake hazards, (2) to present examples of ongoing earthquake - hazard -
reduction efforts, and (3) to discuss what additional scientific and technical
information is needed and which hazard - reduction techniques are most
effective. This project will help the program assess its earthquake research
activities and identify possible future directions.
