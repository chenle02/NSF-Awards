This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will use
novel laboratory techniques to determine the relationship between the standard
turbulent plasma parameters as found in ion density fluctuations and the
corresponding parameters in the spontaneous and stimulated emissions.
Investigators will examine argon plasmas at several pressures, using current-
saturated ion probes, collision-induced optical emissions and laser-induced
fluorescence. Data collection will include fluctuation spectra, correlation
profiles, bicoherent spectra, and an evaluation of the characterizing chaotic
indices. This comprehensive study of turbulent fluctuations in collisional
plasmas will significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly
minority institution. The principal investigator has long-term experience and
the necessary expertise to do the research. Faculty and students working on this
project will have opportunities to examine mode-mode coupling mechanisms and
their probable role in fully developed turbulent plasmas.
