A Transputer-based undergraduate parallel processing laboratory is being
established with IBM-PC-compatible MS-DOS machines equipped with INMOS
transputer boards and the Transputer Development System (TDS) environment using
the parallel programming language OCCAM2. The purpose of this laboratory is to
support instruction in parallel programming and architectures, using the
Occam/TDS environment, for undergraduate computer science and mathematics
majors. Target courses are Algorithms, Computer Organization, Computer Graphics
and Numerical Analysis, ranging from sophomore to senior level. Selected
projects provide the students with hands-on experience for reinforcing the
conceptual understanding of parallel design issues, including parallel
architectures, systematic mapping of systolic arrays on transputer networks,
process farming, pipelining, buffering, message-passing, inter-connection
topologies and speed-up analysis of common algorithms. After an introduction,
the students are expected to program variations of these developed projects.
