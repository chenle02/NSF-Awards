Abstract&lt;br/&gt;NSF proposal 0810159&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flag curvature is a
natural extension of the sectional curvature in Riemannian geometry. One of the
fundamental problems in Riemann-Finsler geometry is to study and characterize
Finsler spaces of scalar/constant flag curvature. In this proposal, the PI will
investigate such Finsler metrics and propose the following research plans: (1)
Construct new examples of Finsler metrics of constant/scalar flag curvature, and
(2) Determine the local structure of Finsler metrics of constant/scalar flag
curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemann-Finsler geometry is a subject
studying regular (not necessarily&lt;br/&gt;reversible) metric spaces. Finsler
metrics are just Riemannian metrics without quadratic restriction. Modern
differential geometry provides the concepts and tools to effect a treatment of
Riemann-Finsler geometry in a direct and elegant way. Riemann-Finsler geometry
has many applications to other areas in mathematics and physics, such as
mathematical psychology, general relativity, partial differential equations,
navigation problems, imaging process, and module spaces, etc. It will continue
to develop through the efforts of many geometers around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
