9455614 Bagert 1The question to be addressed is: Can icon-based programming
languages be used to teach first-year programming concepts to undergraduate
students more effective!y than text-based languages? The specific objectives
are: 1) To develop a complete set of course materials for BACCII, an already-
existing iconic programming environment under ongoing development at Texas Tech
University, and use them in the first two computer programming courses. For this
project, the first course is an introduction to procedural programming, software
engineering, and C, while the second course teaches concepts in object-oriented
programming, data structures and C++. 2) To determine whether iconic
environments (and BACCII in particular) can be used to more effectively teach
procedural and object-oriented programming concepts in the first two courses,
while still allowing students to learn the syntax of text-based languages such
as C and C++. The grant would test out the course materials at Texas Tech, while
a possible later grant would allow for pilot programs to be started at five
higher education institutions. Data would be collected and evaluated not only
for the general student population of each course, but for various groups such
as women, underrepresented minorities and future teachers. 3) To advance
research in the area of using iconic programming languages as learning
environments. The results of the data will allow for an evaluation of how future
iconic languages for learning programming skills should be developed. If it can
be demonstrated that iconic languages perform significantly better than text-
based languages in the learning of programming skills for a wide variety of
schools and student groups, it could revolutionize how software development
techniques are taught.
