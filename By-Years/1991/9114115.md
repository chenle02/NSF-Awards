The workshop examines the state of the art in dilute separation with emphasis
on environmental problems and life science and life applications. The goal is to
identify research needs, detect current trends, and define opportunities for
research. Experts from industry, university, and government will give
presentations and discuss outstanding problems in dilute stream separations. The
results will be useful for determining priorities for future research projects
and for resource allocation at the National Science Foundation.
