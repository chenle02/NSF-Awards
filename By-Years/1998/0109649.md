This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop the hardware implementation of a novel image compression/signal
decomposition algorithm based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This
fully parallel, low-power, scalable, multi-resolution implementation is
particularly well suited for use in reduced bit-rate applications over wireless
communication channels as found in the next generation of web enabled cell
phones. This particular implementation is a highly efficient implementation of
the wavelet transform and makes use of a novel overlap state wavelet
decomposition algorithm that minimizes both memory usage and interprocessor
communication overhead. Over the next decade, spiraling consumer demand for fast
mobile communication of voice and IP over increasingly integrated terrestrial
and satellite-based radio systems plagued by a limited electromagnetic spectrum
allocation necessitates the pursuit and development of better compression
algorithms at low bit-rates.

As a consequence of extensive research, transform-coding techniques has come to
virtually dominate every single image and video coding scheme proposed to-date.
Consequently, efficient software and hardware based transform coding system
designs and implementations have become a high priority objective at both
academic and commercial research centers.
