This Pilot Local Systemic change project is a partnership between the University
of Missouri-Columbia and the Columbia Public Schools. It supports forty
mathematics teachers (grades 8-12) as they implement Contemporary Mathematics in
Context (Core Plus). Using a model of professional development designed around
four important issues (building teachers' knowledge base about content and
pedagogy, supporting teachers in both the planning and implementation phases of
instruction, and helping teachers reflect on the entire process), project staff
and a Core Plus author design and implement over 200 hours of professional
development over a two-year period. The project seeks to understand the
professional development support and its influences on teacher knowledge and
practices. The project supports building a continuing educational infrastructure
in which preservice mathematics teachers can actively participate and learn
about teaching mathematics in classrooms where reform curricula are being
faithfully implemented.
