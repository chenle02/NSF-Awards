This grant supports a workshop to study human resource issues in computer
science and technology. At the workshop some of the issues to be addressed are:
what is known about the existing labor market? What are the strengths and
weaknesses of existing data collection systems? How will industry growth,
workforce attrition and labor supply interact during the next decade? How are
computer specialists currently trained? How should their training be altered to
meet future needs? A steering committee will be established, a workshop
conducted, and a final report will be prepared.//
