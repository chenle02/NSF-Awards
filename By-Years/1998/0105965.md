Rex Skodje of the University of Colorado is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply new theoretical techniques
to achieve a better understanding of chemical processes. This research has
several components. First, there will be a study of short-lived intermediates in
chemical reactions using quantum scattering theory and wavepacket dynamics.
Second, a new technique for simplifying large systems of kinetics equations will
be developed and applied to large chemical models. Finally, the kinetics of thin
films will be studied with the aim of understanding aggregation in thin films.
The last two topics are strongly synergistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide
variety of chemical problems, such as combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and
surface reactions, are modeled using complex networks of nonlinear kinetic
equations. Unfortunately, most realistic models involve many species, reactions,
and time scales, which can hinder numerical treatment as well as meaningful
physical analysis. The goal of this research is kinetic simplification that
promises to impact many fields of science and engineering.
