Subject: The Effect of Mesoscale Physics on the Upper Ocean Carbon Cycle In
field studies and in global scale models, it has been difficult to understand
how dissolved nutrients are supplied to support the observed discrepancy between
eddy diffusive transport and production demand: (1) the transport of nutrients
in the until recently "invisible" pool of dissolved organic matter; (2) the
transport of inorganic nutrients by episodic mixing or nutrient injection.
According to recent work, mesoscale upwelling in the upper ocean associated with
fronts and eddies may drive a significant vertical nutrient transport. Global
scale circulation nutrient cycle models are unable to reproduce the observed
nutrient cycle in the upper ocean without recourse to either (1) transport of
nutrients in the form of dissolved organic nutrients, or (2) incresased
concentrations of inorganic nutrients at the sea surface, which allows
presumably unrealistic horizontal advective transport. GCM results may be biased
by inadequate resolution of the mesoscale processes that are responsible for
vertical nutrient transport in the real ocean. To test this hypothesis, a
nutrient dynamics model will be run with the physical variables from the eddy-
resolving circulation model of Semtner and Chervin (1992).
