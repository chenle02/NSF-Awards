This award supports research and education on electrons in low-dimensional
condensed matter systems with a large number of strongly coupled degrees of
freedom. The properties of these systems are dominated by large quantum
mechanical fluctuations. The ideas, concepts, and methods of quantum field
theory will be used to carry out theoretical research in a wide range of areas
including: electronic liquid crystal phases in strongly correlated fermionic
systems, high temperature superconductors, and quantum Hall systems; quantum
Hall topological entanglement and its applications to quantum computation;
fractional quantum Hall effects and non-commutative geometry; and condensed
matter analogs of general relativity, including analogs of the Hawking radiation
in super liquids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research
and education on electrons in low-dimensional systems. Research will focus on
new physical phenomena that have been uncovered in the past few years, such as
particles with fractional charge and fractional statistics, topological quantum
computing, liquid crystal phases in electron liquids, and the possible existence
of phases of matter with electron fractionalization. The physical systems where
such phenomena take place are two-dimensional electron gases in large magnetic
fields, strongly correlated systems such as high temperature superconductors,
and the recently discovered ultracold dilute gases. Advanced methods of
condensed matter theory, such as quantum field theory, will be used to address
the intellectually challenging fundamental problems that arise in the condensed
matter physics of these low-dimensional systems. This work may contribute to the
intellectual foundation of future electronic device technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
