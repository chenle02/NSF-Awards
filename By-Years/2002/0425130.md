A new downhole magnetic susceptibility (MS) tool will provide logging data to
enhance paleoclimate and sedimentological studies under IODP and will complement
the existing multisensor gamma ray tool (MGT). The project will design a MS tool
that has better resolution (10 cm as opposed to 1 m) than the tool previously
available for some legs of the ODP program. The resulting data will prove
critical for the intercorrelation of cores from multiple holes and the
integration of cores and logs from single holes. The tool will be built from
off-the-shelf sensor fit with the appropriate pressure housing and data
acquisition/transmission system, and the proponents intend to comply with third-
party downhole tool guidelines articulated by the IODP advisory structure. The
MS tool could find potential application not only in the deep-sea environment,
but also in lacustrine and continental settings. It is expected that the MS tool
will eventually be routinely run as part of nearly every IODP program on the
non-riser vessel. Field tests on the new tool are scheduled for late 2005 and
2006.
