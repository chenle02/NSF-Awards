A conjecture of Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod p representations
of Galois groups over Q arise from modular forms, and it further predicts the
level and weight of the form. The principal investigator and his collaborators
are investigating a possible generalization of Serre's conjecture to the context
of Hilbert modular forms and Galois groups over totally real fields. The
prediction of the weights suggests interesting new phenomena, and the immediate
aims of the research are to investigate these phenomena and provide numerical
evidence for the generalization.

Serre's conjecture and its generalizations can be viewed as part of Langlands'
program, which predicts a deep correspondence between objects from algebraic
geometry (solution sets of polynomial equations, such as elliptic curves) and
objects from representation theory (functions with symmetry properties, such as
modular forms). While there has been significant recent progress (for example,
the investigator and collaborators, building on Wiles' work on Fermat's Last
Theorem, proved that all rational elliptic curves arise from modular forms),
Langlands' program remains largely conjectural. The links it provides between
two seemingly different branches of mathematics reveal properties of the
integers, which can, in turn, have applications to cryptography.
