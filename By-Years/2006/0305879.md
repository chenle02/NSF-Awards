This research is to investigate statistical and computational methods for
simultaneous clustering of data matrices and their extensions to handle data
hypercubes using spectral techniques. It uses techniques of cluster analysis,
which is method of extracting information from large data sets. Many existing
methods rely on clustering the data objects using all the attributes for
similarity measurement. However, often the natural groupings of the data objects
do not involve all attributes. For example, in gene expression analysis, for
data generated by DNA chips under various conditions (tissue types, individuals,
external stimuli etc.), it is unlikely that biologically related genes will
behave similarly across all conditions, nor related set of conditions will
involve all the genes. The focus of this project is to develop clustering
algorithms that can, for example, find subsets of genes that behave similarly
across subsets of conditions. The techniques are based on spectral methods for
simultaneous clustering of data matrices. The results, algorithms, and
techniques developed will have applications in bioinformatics and text analysis
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research is on identifying
classes of cluster patterns in a data matrix that can be recovered by the
spectral information of the data matrix. The research explores various objective
functions that characterize desirable grouping patterns, and develops algorithms
for cluster membership assignment from the spectral information. The methodology
is being extended to the case of multi-way data hypercubes and to exploring
connection of clustering and dimension reduction.&lt;br/&gt;
