Reed&lt;br/&gt;0109872&lt;br/&gt; Certain cells in the mammalian auditory
brainstem (three&lt;br/&gt;neurons from the periphery) show exceptionally small
standard&lt;br/&gt;deviations in the microsecond range of the timing of the
first&lt;br/&gt;action potential response under repeated trials of the
same&lt;br/&gt;sound. Moreover, the latency and its standard deviation
are&lt;br/&gt;quite independent of frequency and decibel level over
large&lt;br/&gt;ranges. This behavior is exceptional since the inputs to
these&lt;br/&gt;cells come from octopus and other cells in the
contralateral&lt;br/&gt;cochlear nucleus, a nucleus which is ennervated by
auditory nerve&lt;br/&gt;fibers that have much larger standard deviations and
high&lt;br/&gt;dependence on frequency and decibel level. Thus, this system
is&lt;br/&gt;an example of how the brain can use relatively sloppy
and&lt;br/&gt;variable devices (neurons) to perform surprisingly
accurate&lt;br/&gt;calculations. Professor Michael Reed, with colleague
physiologist&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Blum, investigates this system with three
research&lt;br/&gt;projects: (i) They create and investigate by machine
computation&lt;br/&gt;a large scale mathematical model of the whole system using
known&lt;br/&gt;physiological properties of auditory nerve fibers and
recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered properties of octopus cells; (ii) They
use&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis investigate of the improvement of
the&lt;br/&gt;standard deviation of latency in converging networks where
the&lt;br/&gt;target cells require coincident inputs within time windows
in&lt;br/&gt;order to fire; (iii) They use partial differential equations
to&lt;br/&gt;understand the special properties of dendritic
information&lt;br/&gt;processing in octopus cells.&lt;br/&gt; Using mathematics
and machine computation, Professor Michael&lt;br/&gt;Reed continues to study how
groups of cells (neurons) in the&lt;br/&gt;auditory brainstem perform
calculations that individual cells can&lt;br/&gt;not do by themselves. Neurons
are inherently sloppy and variable&lt;br/&gt;devices that perform differently
even under (apparently) the same&lt;br/&gt;conditions with the same inputs.
Nevertheless, large groups of&lt;br/&gt;these neurons are able to perform
together, reliably, highly&lt;br/&gt;accurate calculations. This project tries
to understand this&lt;br/&gt;apparent paradox. The project sheds light on how
and why human&lt;br/&gt;brains are organized the way they are and it suggests
new&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for the development of man-made thinking
devices.&lt;br/&gt;
