This proposal partially supports 26 students for their travel to attend the 2019
Real World Cryptography Conference (RWC) to be held on Jan 9-11, 2019 in San
Jose, CA, USA. RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the presentation of ideas,
advances and challenges from both academic and industrial cryptographers and
security researchers. The conference aims to bring better understanding of real-
world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community, helping to inform their
research and set new research challenges for the theoretical community, and
enables practitioners to develop a clearer view of the current state-of-the-art
in cryptographic research and what it offers to practice. The organizers will
prioritize student speakers, students from underrepresented groups, and students
from universities where research funds are not available. As such, it fits
closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic
schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
