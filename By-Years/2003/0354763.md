The generally accepted view of the meridional circulation in the tropical
Eastern Pacific is one of a deep overturning cell driven by deep convective
heating in the inter-tropical convergence zone, similar to the zonal mean Hadley
circulation. However, recent observations of the atmosphere from a field
campaign have called this view into question. In several independent data sets,
a significant meridional return flow out of the region of the inter-tropical
convergence zone was observed, but not only at high altitudes, but at low
altitudes just above the atmospheric boundary layer. The causes and dynamics of
this shallow return flow will be investigated with theoretical models and high-
resolution three-dimensional numerical modeling. The interaction of the shallow
return flow with the atmospheric boundary layer through shear-driven entrainment
will be explored. The project will lead to new insights into tropical
circulation and climate, as observations and preliminary numerical modeling
suggest that this shallow return flow is equal or greater than that at high
altitude.
