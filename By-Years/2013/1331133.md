This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in
Computer Science (USICCS) program. Through this program, NSF and the United
States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support
collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative reserach project between
Duke University and Tel Aviv University aims to study several topics in
geometric optimization and related problems that arise in the processing of
geometric data in a variety of application areas, such as sensor networks,
imaging, surveillance, navigation, geographic information systems, modeling and
animation, meshing, computer graphics and vision, bioinformatics, robotics and
manufacturing. Processing geometric data in these applications is challenging,
because this data is typically huge, measured with uncertainty, obtained in a
distributed manner (e.g., in sensor networks), or in an online manner (e.g., in
streaming applications), and may involve moving points (e.g., in imaging,
animation and modeling). All these traits make the processing a rather demanding
task, and call for the design of novel algorithmic techniques for handling it
efficiently. For many of these problems, exact algorithms, even polynomial in
the input size, are impractical, and approximation algorithms are needed. Even
then, making these algorithms depend efficiently on the error parameter is often
a difficult and challenging task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the
above challenges by developing general algorithmic techniques such as computing
geometric summaries (including coresets and random samples), handling noisy
geometric data under various probabilistic models of uncertainty, handling
online data, and handling kinetic data (involving moving objects). Some of the
specific problems that are targeted include shape matching, clustering, and
geometric searching. Each of these topics raises interesting algorithmic
questions, both theoretical and practical, and the project will address as many
of them as possible.
