The Greater Alabama Black Belt Region (GABBR) Alliance goals are to (1) increase
the quantity and quality of underrepresented minority STEM degrees, (2) increase
the quantity and quality of underrepresented minority undergraduates entering
graduate school, and (3) investigate and disseminate the project's impact on
recruitment, retention, success, and graduation of target students. The Alliance
uses contemporary mentoring strategies to create a network of scholars who are
adequately supported through research-focused interventions, public-private
partnerships, and study abroad programs to enhance the quality of STEM education
for its scholars as they progress through the STEM pathway (pre-college, first
two years of college, and last two years of college). The knowledge and findings
that is being generated by the project illuminates factors central to promoting
interest and persistence in STEM studies and in STEM career trajectories for
URMs, especially those from rural communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GABBR
Alliance consists of eight colleges and universities: Alabama State University,
Auburn University, Auburn University Montgomery, Enterprise State Community
College, Southern Union State Community College, Troy University, Tuskegee
University, and University of West Alabama; and two national laboratories:
Brookhaven National Laboratory Center and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. GABBR
encompasses 17 counties in the Alabama Black Belt and three counties adjacent to
the Alabama Black Belt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these counties and at the
partner institutions, GABBR aims at increasing the number of underrepresented
minority STEM bachelor and associate degrees by 100% in five years, from 422 to
844 and 91 to 182, respectively.
