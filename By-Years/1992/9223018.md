Since the Late 1950s, the Latin American Church has undergone radical changes
in terms of theology and pastoral organization. Innovations such as liberation
theology and comunidades eclesiales de base (CEBs) have tended to reinvigorate
the political role the Church plays in society. Moreover, in several
authoritarian regimes, the Catholic Church as been the sole source of
opposition. Nevertheless, this change has not been uniform across Latin America.
Several national episcopates supported authoritarian rule in the 1960s and
1970s. This doctoral dissertation research investigation examines the role of
religious competition (between Catholics and non-Catholics) in determining
whether the national Church hierarchy endorses or opposes dictatorial rule. The
dissertation student investigates whether increasing presence of Protestant
sects in some countries has forced the episcopate to adopt membership-retention
strategies that are antithetical to the military's goal of suppressing
subversive organizations. Furthermore, conflict between the Church and military
regime is assessed concerning whether Church access to state patronage was
reduced during the early part of the century. The student will combine
historical research with field research (interviews with church leaders) in
Chile to examine this topic.
