9321262 Yau,S. S-T The research entails several problems in complex-analytic
geometry. One problem relates to the topology and combinatorial aspects of
certain linear configurations in complex projective spaces. This research has
applications to algebraic geometry and number theory. Another topic involves
studying the invariants of the embedding problem for CR-manifolds. ***
