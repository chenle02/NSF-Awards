HELP is a cross cutting and transdisciplinary initiative of the United Nations
Educational Scientific Organization (UNESCO) led by the International
Hydrological Programme.&lt;br/&gt;HELP is creating a new approach to integrated
catchment management through the creation of a framework for water law and
policy experts, water resource managers and water scientists to work together on
water-related problems. From the technical perspective, the broad objectives of
HELP are to strengthen field-oriented, experimental hydrology using the drainage
basin (up to scales 104 to 106 km2 as the framework. Water related physical
(hydrological, climatological, ecological) and non-physical (technical,
sociological, economics, administrative, law) observations will be made in these
catchments which address the most critical policy and management issues as
perceived by ?users? under different biophysical and socio-economic
environments, taking into account needs for sustainable development. The desire
for this new programme to be truly ?user-driven? will require the active
involvement of both policy and facilitating (water and land resource managers)
groups to set the policy agenda and ensure the scientific results will benefit
societal needs through the revision of policy and management
practices.&lt;br/&gt;A workshop is being held in Tucson, Arizona, hosted by
SAHRA and sponsored by ICIWaRM, to conduct a ten-year review of the progress in
the HELP program as measured by the original HELP objectives and to provide new
or modified programmatic guidance for the next phase of the HELP program. To lay
the foundation for cooperative work between HELP Basins within North America and
between North America and South America Basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
