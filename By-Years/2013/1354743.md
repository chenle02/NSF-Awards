Many insects, including pests of agricultural and medical importance, bear
symbiotic bacteria that provide essential nutrients to their insect hosts, but
the composition and amount of nutrients transferred between the partners are
largely unknown. This project will investigate insect-bacterial nutrient
exchange in insects that feed on the extremely nutrient-poor diet of plant xylem
sap. Exploiting recent advances in genomics and metabolic modeling, the
investigators will quantify the capacity of both insect and bacteria to
synthesize key nutrients, and then integrate these results in the form of
metabolic models that describe the amount of each nutrient transferred between
the partners. These models enable testing of two fundamental predictions: that
nutrients produced in excess by one partner are required by other partners,
achieving the nutritional efficiency that is required for insects to survive on
xylem sap; and that the profile of nutrients received by the insects from their
bacterial partners is defined by the overall metabolic network, and not simply
the gene content of the bacteria. The integrated molecular understanding of the
nutritional interactions between the insects and bacteria generated by this
research will identify specific targets for novel pest control strategies
against important xylem-feeding insect pests which transmit plant pathogens
affecting citrus, grape, coffee and other crops. The project will provide
training in state-of-the-art genomic and modeling methods for a postdoctoral
researcher and graduate and undergraduate students. To address the increasingly
recognized gap between research infrastructure and educational resources in
sequence analysis and bioinformatics, the investigators will provide hands-on
experience in genomics to students from local higher education institutions with
limited genomics educational resources, and also develop lesson plans for
genomics/ bioinformatics education in schools.
