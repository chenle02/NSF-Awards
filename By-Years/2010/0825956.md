The objective of this research is to (1) confirm that it is possible to
introduce auxiliary forces to detach the droplet of melted wire in gas metal arc
welding while still maintaining the required arc stability, and (2) confirm that
metal transfer variables, including droplet mass/diameter, impact speed, and
trajectory, can be fully controlled by adjusting the power and application time
of the auxiliary forces. The approach is to (1) aim two lasers of relatively low
power to the droplet to apply auxiliary forces from opposite directions, (2)
establish a model to correlate metal transfer variables with laser powers, arc
variables, and droplet state, (3) apply the model to adaptively determine the
power and firing timing of the lasers based on droplet state and arc variables
to achieve the desired metal transfer variables, and (4) monitor the resultant
metal transfer variables to improve the model.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Gas metal
arc welding is the most widely used process in automatic welding. The completion
of the research will be of significant help in better understanding and
controlling this complex but important process. Possible transfer of this
technology will help our industry maintain its manufacturing technology
leadership and compete with countries where the labor cost is relatively low.
The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed research and possible
collaboration with national lab, industry and international institution will
provide a variety of opportunities to train next generation academic and
manufacturing experts/researchers in a wide range of levels in forms of hands-on
design course, undergraduate research experience, thesis/dissertation research,
application-oriented case study, knowledge dissemination and possible
commercialization with industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;
