Collaborative Research: Graphs on Surfaces and Related Problems Mark N.
Ellingham and Xiaoya Zha

The investigators study properties of graphs embedded on surfaces, together
with some closely related problems. The proposed research addresses five types
of problems. First, traversability problems for graphs embedded on surfaces, or
with related conditions, are studied. In particular, the existence of k-walks
and k-trails, ways to traverse a graph visiting each vertex at least once and at
most k times, are investigated. Second, the investigators study the spectral
radius (largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix) of graphs embedded on
surfaces, particularly the plane; this is an important parameter with
connections to the number of walks in the graph. Third, the investigators
examine the relationship between a surface and the connectivity of graphs that
embed on that surface in particularly natural ways, as genus embeddings. Fourth,
the existence of graph embeddings with nice properties, such as every closed
face being homeomorphic to a closed disk, and the relationship of such
embeddings to decomposition problems such as the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture,
are studied. Fifth, the investigators are concerned with the problem of cutting
a surface with an embedded graph into smaller nontrivial pieces along a
noncontractible cycle in the graph, as results in this area would give a very
promising tool for studying many problems in the area of graph embeddings.

Graphs are abstract mathematical models of networks. In the modern world, the
study of communication and transportation networks is becoming ever more
important. In particular, many real-world networks are planar, meaning that they
can be drawn on a piece of paper without any links crossing. How close a network
is to being planar is related to many of its useful properties, and
mathematicians study this by looking at so called embeddings of graphs on
surfaces. The useful properties examined by this research include traversability
(how can we travel around a network, visiting each node, in a more or less
efficient way - this is the motivation for such problems as the Traveling
Salesman Problem), how well a network works as a traffic network (this involves
a number known as the spectral radius, which has been of interest to
geographers), and connectivity (resistance to disruption by attack). Besides
studying the useful properties of networks, this research also develops new
tools for studying such properties. Networks drawn on a surface are easier to
work with if none of the regions into which the drawing divides the surface
touch themselves, and the investigators are interested in the question of
whether networks can always be drawn in this nice way. The investigators are
also interested in the question of whether networks drawn on a surface can be
cut apart in a natural way to give networks drawn on less complicated surfaces.
Both of these questions should lead to better understanding of networks drawn on
surfaces, and hence to ways to examine useful properties of such networks.
