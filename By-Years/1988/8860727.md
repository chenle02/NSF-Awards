The long term goal of this fundamental bioengineering proposal is to produce a
device which will convert sound into a tactile sensation using a vibro- or
electrotactile stimulator. The tactile sensory output could be attached to the
arm or abdomen. Such a device could provide the deaf with a greater degree of
auditory communication than is now currently available. This project will
address the issues of the resolution for the auditory input and the tactile
output. This is a high-risk high-gain feasibility study.
