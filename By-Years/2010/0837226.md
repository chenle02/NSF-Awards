Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to promote
creative thought in freshman engineering students in order to enhance the
engineering design process. The creative process of students is stimulated and
engaged through a series of laboratory modules in a freshmen level introductory
course in electrical and computer engineering. The laboratory modules are
designed to explicitly address the artistic aspects of the design process. This
is done by involving faculty and students from nonengineering programs in the
laboratory modules. The first project requires electrical and computer
engineering students to work with music students to design and build a
functioning incandescent lamp from a retired musical instrument.
Multidisciplinary student teams participate in the laboratory modules and are
given instruction in team building and team dynamics. The project includes an
evaluation that measures the impact of the laboratory modules on the students'
interest in engineering and on the students' ability to think about engineering
design problems in a creative manner. The evaluation plan also measures the
impact of the laboratory modules on students from underrepresented groups. The
project results are being disseminated through conferences, journals and the
National Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education Digital
Library.
