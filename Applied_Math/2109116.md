This project will focus on seismic tomography to understand the substructure of
the Earth by studying various seismic data produced by natural earthquakes or
artificial seismic sources. This research has important applications in
practice, such as characterizing fractured bedrock, and searching for oil and
gas deposits. The project will address both theoretical foundations and
applications of seismic tomography. The results will also be useful in medical
imaging applications such as detection of tumors. The investigators will provide
training opportunities for graduate students, especially those from
underrepresented groups.

The research will bridge the mathematical theory and practical inversion methods
for fundamental models arising in transmission and reflection seismology,
including the cross-well model and domains with obstacles, which will have
positive impacts on laying a solid theoretical backbone for practical seismology
studies. The investigators will introduce rigorous statistical inversion methods
for recovering isotropic seismic wave speed from the transmitted travel-time
data, with applications to both global and regional seismology. The
investigators will also conduct convergence analysis on computational methods
for seismic tomography with reflection travel-time data. This includes analysis
of some deep learning methods for solving high-dimensional optimization
problems. The research will address both the theoretical aspect, such as
uniqueness and stability, and applications, including reconstruction algorithms
and numerical implementations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
