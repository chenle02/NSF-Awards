The goals of the Delaware State University Summer Science Camp are to increase
students awareness of mathematics and science careers, to develop a deep
appreciation for mathematics and science in underrepresented minority students
(African-Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics), to improve and strengthen
students academic preparation in science and mathematics. The objectives are to
build the confidence levels of students so positive attitudes will gradually
replace negative attitudes toward science and mathematics, to maintain the
students high interest in science and mathematics by mentoring, counseling and
continuing with follow-up activities during the academic year. to develop
participatory laboratory activities, to expose students to professional role
models through interactions with local scientists and mathematicians, to use the
team approach to expose students to scientific principles, laws and theories via
group science projects, to increase the depth of the student's prior experiences
in reading interpreting and communication through the individual tutorial
conference technique, and to urge parent to become more involved in their
children education. The methods to be employed are hands-on classroom
activities, computer-assisted instruction in each subject area, science
exploratory field trips and experimental demonstrations in research
laboratories. Local scientists, SSC staff, those in industries, undergraduates
will serve as role models. Students will get the opportunity to present their
science projects to the community and will be engaged in follow-up activities
during the academic year. There is expected to be an increase in
underrepresented minorities who are committed to attending graduate school and
obtaining Ph.D. degree in Science, Mathematics and Engineering. The challenge is
to provide productive citizens that are versatile and well-trained to met the
nation's need of scientists. ***
