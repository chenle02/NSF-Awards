Using private and University of Pittsburgh funds, the Allegheny Observatory has
purchased a Perkin Elmer 10-by-10 inch PDS measuring machine and computer
facility. However, as normally supplied, the Perkin-Elmer machine provides
precisions only slightly better than machines of a decade ago. The full
potential of the machine is only realized with the installation of a laser
interferometer. The National Science Foundation will support the acquisition of
this interferometer. A new program is planned with this machine that will
provide: 1) direct trigonometric measurements of a representative sample of the
stars making up the luminosity function within 100 parsecs of the Sun, 2)
accurate masses for most of the nearby binary stars, 3) accurate distances to
most of the stars known to be within that volume, and 4) a systematic search for
unseen companions with masses down to that of Saturn. The Observatory's 110,000
plate collection, as well as plates being obtained with the Thaw 30-inch
refractor and a Keeler Ritchey-Chretien reflector, will be used with the
upgraded PDS machine to attain the scientific goals.
