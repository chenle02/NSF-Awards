9724809 Ting Chu This proposal supports collaborative research between Drs. C.
S. Ting and Paul C. W. Chu of the University of Houston and Dr. Alvaro Ferraz at
the University of Brasilia and Dr. A. J. Aguiar at the Universidade Federal de
Pernambuco. Their research will involve the theoretical and experimental aspects
of high temperature superconducting materials(HTS). Dr. Ting will be responsible
for the theoretical portion, with the experimental aspect primarily handled by
the Brazilians, with the aid and direction of Dr. Chu. This collaboration will
link three strong centers for superconductivity - the Texas Center at the
University of Houston, the International Center of Condensed Matter Physics at
the Universidade de Brasilia and the Physics Department of the Universidade
Federal de Pernambuco. This project may lead to better understanding of high
temperature superconductivity, particularly of superconductivity at temperatures
above the current record. * * *
