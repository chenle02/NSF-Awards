The goal of the SoLEAP Program at Old Dominion University (ODU) is to provide
academic, social and financial support to approximately 36 talented, motivated,
and financially-needy students enrolled in the photovoltaic Solar Engineering
Academic Program (SoLEAP). SoLEAP at ODU impacts student success and addresses
the urgent need for well-trained energy scientists and engineers at both
regional and national levels. SoLEAP scholars receive access to innovative
academic training, mentoring, and career development/transition programs that
help them enter into the solar energy sectors with the expertise needed for
successful careers. The program expands and advances the solar engineering
workforce to become globally competitive in photovoltaic industries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SoLEAP program at Old Dominion University is an
educational program that incorporates innovative academic strategies with
resources needed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to confront
problems in the rapidly changing field of photovoltaic technology. The academic
support approach combines virtual and physical hands-on activities and project
based learning. Student support programs are improved by using reciprocal
mentoring/peer mentoring programs and social networking by a peer-learning
community of students. Academic success is fostered through support provided for
career development and career transitions through collaborative research and
industry-based projects with local industry partners, academic and national
laboratories. The comprehensive academic training and mentoring programs
prepares students with the skill sets essential to photovoltaic technologies. To
maximize student learning, integrated modules of theory, virtual learning, and
hands-on experience complement theory-based lectures with project-based
learning. In addition, reciprocal mentoring between students and
faculty/industrial partners is practiced for transformative support of success
in completing degrees, career counseling, development, and transition. A SoLEAP
mentoring cohort consisting of undergraduates and graduates forms reciprocal and
peer mentoring networks in which more experienced students mentor less
experienced peers. SoLEAP offers comprehensive training and career development
programs to help students as they transition between their academic and
professional careers. The project includes efforts to make the project results
known to the broader STEM education community.
