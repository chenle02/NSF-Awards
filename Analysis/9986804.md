Abstract

This project will focus on the relationship of affinely-invariant measures to
certain problems in harmonic analysis. Drury observed that affine arclength
appears to be the natural measure to use when considering averaging and Fourier
restriction operators associated with certain curves. More recently, the PI has
obtained certain uniform results along these lines for curves in two dimensions
and for surfaces in higher dimensions. He intends to continue these
investigations and also to consider some questions of an integral-geometric
nature. The latter stem from the concept of affine dimension, an analog of
Hausdorff dimension which also takes into account a set's curvature.

The averaging operators considered in this project belong to a class of
smoothing operators which play an important role in the study of physical
processes like wave motion and heat propagation. These operators are also
related to the Radon transforms which appear in tomography. Similar operators
are important in signal analysis and communications theory. The Fourier
restriction operators considered here are part of the theory of Fourier
analysis. Their study contributes to the general understanding of the Fourier
transform, a tool which is vital to applications of mathematics ranging from
electrical engineering and communications theory through fluid dynamics.
