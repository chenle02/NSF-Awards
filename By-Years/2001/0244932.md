This project uses a novel apparatus for the measurement of gravity-like forces
in the 10 micrometer to 100 micrometer range, having an estimated sensitivity of
order Newton's gravity at this range of length scales. The technique is similar
to that of a miniature Cavendish-type experiment, with the original torsion
balance replaced by the spring of a cantilever beam. A first generation of the
apparatus was already built and tested yielding a first set of data in a new
excluded range which improves previous bounds by more than four orders of
magnitudes in interaction strength at the length scale of approximately 10
micrometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to impact science at
all levels. First, all theories that attempt to unify&lt;br/&gt;gravity with the
other forces in nature involve the modification of Newton's law of gravity. The
&lt;br/&gt;experiment will therefore guide the theory in the currently most
exciting range of length scales. The first set of data put new and important
constraints on a large class of string theories where&lt;br/&gt;moduli particles
are expected to appear as a consequence of broken supersymmetry. Since Newton's
law of gravity is one of the first concepts of nature that young students
learn&lt;br/&gt;at grade school, the possible modifications of this law at
short, but mentally comprehensible, distances will ignite young peoples' minds.
The problem becomes even more interesting as the technology used in the proposed
experiment is at the cutting edge of micro-fabricated devices.
