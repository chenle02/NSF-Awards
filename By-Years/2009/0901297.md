The objective of this research is to develop a process which integrates high
performance thin film silicon circuitry with compound semiconductor devices, and
to use this process to demonstrate an active matrix light emitting diode capable
of projecting a video brightness image. The approach is to start with high
quality compound semiconductor wafers, and then deposit and recrystallize the
silicon circuitry using low temperature deposition and a laser annealing process
known as sequential lateral solidification. This process produces thin film
silicon transistors with high mobility and minimal thermal load to the
substrate.

Compound semiconductor materials are favored for a number of optoelectronic
applications including photodetectors for visible, IR, and UV; light emitting
diodes; and lasers. The materials used in these applications, however, generally
do not form transistors and cannot be used for switching or local
ampli&#64257;cation. The approach presented in this proposal reverses the usual
heteroepitaxy strategy, in which compound semiconductors are grown on a silicon
wafer, and instead fabricates silicon devices on a compound semiconductor wafer.
This allows integration of high quality compound semiconductor materials with
silicon circuitry for switching and amplification, avoiding the limitations of
other approaches.

The technology developed has a range of applications including energy efficient
displays, lithography, hyperspectral detection, communication systems, and
miniature biological sensors. In addition to training a graduate student, the
program will mentor a high school student and an undergraduate working on the
project. Light emitting diode wafer materials will be used for high school
demonstrations and a course on display devices.
