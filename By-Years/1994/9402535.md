9402535 Gordaninejad Innovative control systems for bridges and other large-
scale civil structures are needed for enhancing safety in the event of
earthquakes, strong winds and other man-made and natural hazards. In this
project, electro-rheological (ER) fluid dampers, piezoceramic sensors and a
self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller will be developed to control the response
of bridge structures. The self-adaptive nature of the fuzzy controller and
condition under which the controller may fail will be carefully examined by
applying different excitation forces and frequencies, and by using several
different ER fluids and piezoceramic sensors. The implementation of the proposed
dampers will be examined through earthquake simulations and analytical models of
real bridges. ***
