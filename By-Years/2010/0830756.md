Many aspects of computation can be viewed as communication processes.
Communication complexity is the mathematical theory aimed at estimating the
amount of communication necessary for such processes. Communication complexity
arguments can be used to provide estimates on various other resources needed for
computation, including time and space (memory) and circuit size. Communication
complexity has many applications in different areas including computer networks,
VLSI circuits, data structures, cryptography, learning theory and distributed
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on exploring the
connections between communication complexity and the complexity of computational
problems in other models of computation. The main objectives of this research
are developing new techniques for proving lower bounds on communication
complexity, and using these methods to obtain lower bounds on resources in other
models. The project addresses problems of randomized and multiparty
communication complexity, private information retrieval, and estimating the
space requirements of data stream algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proving lower
bounds on the complexity of specific functions with respect to various resources
has been one of the most challenging areas in complexity theory. Communication
complexity arguments and techniques originating from communication complexity
have been at the core of several lower bound results that are at the boundary of
what is achievable by current techniques. The project can potentially lead to
new methods for attacking fundamental problems in complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;
