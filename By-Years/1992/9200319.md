The Center for Energy Studies and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at
University of Texas-Austin will involve approximately 36 undergraduates over a
three year period in energy research (12 per summer). Schools from which these
students will be recruited will have a high predominance of under-represented
groups enrolled, such as Prairie View A&amp;M, Pan American, Texas Southern,
Texas A&amp;I, University of Texas at San Antonio, University of Texas-El Paso.
The goal is to have at least 75% of the participants chosen from the
aforementioned schools in the female, minority, or disabled categories. The
balance of the research opportunities will be awarded to qualified
minority/female students from the University of Texas-Austin campus.
