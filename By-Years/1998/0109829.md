This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
methods to prepare 60-200 base RNA/DNA oligonucleotides. Current methods for
preparing long oligonucleotides suffer from limitations that hinder their
application in biological science. Investigators have expressed an immediate
need for longer material incorporating unnatural modifications and non-canonical
substitutions. Access to these oligonucleotides is critical for continued
discoveries in molecular biology and nucleic acid based therapeutics. Despite
such demand, the most reliable synthetic method, 2-ACE chemistry, can provide
quality oligonucleotides no longer than 50 bases. This SBIR Phase I project will
use 2-ACE RNA to develop a novel biochemical technique using RNA ligase to
enzymatically splice oligonucleotides together. RNA substrates will be coupled
as part of a complex with a complementary splint. This project will evaluate
different conformations of the ligation site, the tolerance of the enzyme for
different substrate sequences, the optimal design and composition of the splint,
and the ideal concentrations of substrates and cofactors. Once determined in an
iterative process, the best conditions will be applied to more challenging
research problems identified by collaborators. This research will directly
address a critical deficit in the resources available to the national
biotechnology research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of this project are expected to be varied and immediate. As
example, site-specifically modified RNAs of 50-200 bases in length should be in
high demand by investigators who are developing RNA-targeted drugs or other RNA-
dependent technologies beyond the reach of current synthetic
means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
