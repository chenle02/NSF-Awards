The MAA, through its project SUMMA (Strengthening Underrepresented Minority
Mathematics Achievement) proposes the development of a national consortium of
mathematics-based intervention projects aimed at strengthening the existing 50+
projects and increasing the number of projects by at least 10 each year. The
Consortium will provide networking opportunities for mathematicians, mathematics
teachers, and mathematics educators, building on the structure of the 33,000
member MAA. Activities include workshops to be held at regional section
meetings, the training of undergraduate students as counselors, and
dissemination of information through presentations at national meetings and a
newsletter. In addition, a handbook on how to start and conduct an intervention
project and a directory of existing projects are to be produced and widely
distributed. By the third year of the project the Consortium is expected to
include 90 or more projects and 7,000 newly recruited minority students with
their teachers as participants. The long range goal is to increase the number of
minority students reached by mathematics-based intervention projects in the year
2000 to more than 15,000.
