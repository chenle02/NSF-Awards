The purpose of the proposed research is to develop new concepts, methods, and
algorithms for the decentralized control of complex nonlinear systems. These
systems are characterized by high dimensions, uncertainty, and information
structure constraints. The main thrust of the research is directed toward the
development of new decomposition methods and algorithms for a "piece-by-piece"
design of control and estimation structures for complex plants. These algorithms
can be implemented by using the modern parallel multiprocessing architectures.
Of special interest are the graph- theoretical methods for tearing of dynamic
systems because of their inherent simplicity and numerical reliability. The
partitioning framework includes the overlapping decompositions of nonlinear
systems involving the unorthodox notion of subsystems that share common parts.
This type of decomposition can succeed where the standard disjoint compositions
fail.
