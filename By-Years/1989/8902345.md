The principal investigator will work on the representation theory of reductive
algebraic groups and related finite and infinitesimal groups. The particular
topics to be investigated are: constructions for the reduction mod p of
irreducible complex representations of the finite groups; determination of the
Loewy series of principal indecomposable modules for finite groups of Lie type;
support varieties of Weyl modules and simple modules; the adjoint representation
on the regular functions on nilpotent orbits and their closures. A group is an
algebraic structure with a multiplication defined on it. Finite groups may be
viewed as algebraic sets of transformations of vector spaces. Their properties
and structure can be determined through these representations.
