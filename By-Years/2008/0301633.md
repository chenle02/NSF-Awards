0301633&lt;br/&gt;Fridley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research
Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to
twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a fourteen month research
fellowship (within a duration of 36 months) by Dr. Jason D. Fridley to work with
Dr. J. P. Grimes at the University of Sheffield in the United
Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a suite of experiments
focused on identifying the key processes by which genetic diversity maintains
local species diversity. The research will address several questions: For which
traits is genetic variation most important for population persistence? How is
this genetic variation maintained locally; are there necessary tradeoffs between
selection pressures for protecting tissues (from grazing or pathogen attack)
versus those favoring rapid tissue proliferation? The results could indicate
that because of such adaptive tradeoffs, population persistence in heterogeneous
environments requires sufficient levels of genetic variation. The work will thus
help identify the processes through which genetic variation controls community
and ecosystem properties potentially affecting a wide variety of terrestrial
plant communities.&lt;br/&gt;
