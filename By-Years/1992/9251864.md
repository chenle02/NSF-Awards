An up-to-date undergraduate computer-aided electromagnetics and microwaves
laboratory, utilizing computer aided design (CAD) software, personal computers,
and microwave measurement equipment, is being used by students in the Electrical
and Computer Engineering department at this institution. The laboratory allows
instruction on design utilizing CAD, experimentation with automated
electromagnetics measurements and design, and construction of microstrip
components. Certain basic experiments, e.g., slotted line measurements, are not
automated on purpose to enhance the understanding of fundamentals for the
following CAD experience. This laboratory also supports student involvement with
practical and current design problems, similar to those faced by engineers in an
industrial environment.
