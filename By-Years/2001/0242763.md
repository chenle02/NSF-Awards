The Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC, 1991) and National Information
Assurance Training and Education Center (NIATEC, 1999), components of Idaho
State University's College of Business were established in response to the
overwhelming need for computer-related security education and research. In May
1999 the NSA designated the Idaho State University one of the initial seven
Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education. This project will
expand the Center's current role in relieving the shortage of qualified
information assurance personnel by providing financial support through NSF's
Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program for 30
graduate/undergraduate students as participants in a rigorous academic program.
The highlights of Idaho State University's program are: &lt;br/&gt;__ Faculty
committed to working with undergraduates in a training and education environment
to support an ongoing research program. &lt;br/&gt;__ Immediate integration of
students in existing research programs in information assurance &lt;br/&gt;__ A
Cyber Research Seminar emphasizing critical thinking, leadership, and
communication skills &lt;br/&gt;__ Expanding Horizons Seminars presented by
experts in the field of information assurance &lt;br/&gt;__ An ethics component,
in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and discussion. &lt;br/&gt;__
Development of professional skills through mentoring, training, and experience.
&lt;br/&gt;__ Service, as coordinated by the federal Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), to give students the opportunity to serve by solving specific
real problems in information assurance. &lt;br/&gt;
