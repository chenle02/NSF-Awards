This fellowship supports research and training in the area of neurobiology. The
project is entitled The Isolation of MASH1 Expressing Cells from Transgenic
Mice. The mammalian achaete-scute homologous gene 1 (MASH1) is a neuron-specific
transcription factor that identifies neural precursors in multiple lineages at
early stages of development and, in some cases, is required for development to
proceed. The aims are to isolate, characterize, and compare MASH1 expressing
precursors using MASH1/lacZ expressing transgenic mice.
