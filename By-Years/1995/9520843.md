9520843 PUTZ The objective of this proposal is to test hypotheses that relate
belowground plant traits to changes in soil fertility. Soil coring, root
decomposition bags, root observation windows and fertilization techniques will
be used to investigate root mortality, production, and turnover rates. The study
will span a natural gradient of soil fertility where other confounding factors,
such as temperature, rainfall, and elevation are held nearly constant. Results
will augment available information about belowground processes for tropical
forest stands, and will be applicable for incorporation into theories of forest
dynamics as well as for the restoration and management of forests and
plantations.
