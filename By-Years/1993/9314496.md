This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award supports travel expenses
and some expendable research supplies, related to the visit of Drs. S. Tabor and
J. Doring, Florida State University to Argentina. A graduate student of the FSU
group will accompany Dr. Tabor on his second trip. The Argentine co-P.I. is Dr.
Gerardo Garcia Bermudez, of the Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica. Dr. M. A.
Cardona, of the same institution ,will also participate in the work. The purpose
of the proposed research is to perform measurements of the lifetimes of isotopes
of the nuclei of Y and Se. These lifetimes are in the picosecond range. The
measurements will help to understand the transition between single particle and
collective motion, and the shape as well as alternating patterns in magnetic
dipole strength of the nuclei.
