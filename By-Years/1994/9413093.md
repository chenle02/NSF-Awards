DMR-9413093, PI-Kontnik: This project, supported under the Technology Deployment
activity area of the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), is designed to
identify, extract and transition biomedical technologies from a number of
sources. The goals include helping defense firms understand the opportunities
for diversification, and assisting a limited number of firms to actually embark
on a business course of diversification. Some of these firms will be
incorporated into an on-site incubator. This project will be coordinated closely
with the National Institutes of Health, the Colorado Advanced Technology
Institute, and the Colorado research universities. It will build on established
relationships with a number of target companies, including Martin Marietta.
***The objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a growing,
integrated, national industrial capability which provides the most advanced,
affordable, military systems and the most competitive commercial products. TRP
programs are structured to expand high quality employment opportunities in
commercial and dual-use US. industries and demonstrably enhance US.
competitiveness. This is accomplished through the application of defense and
commercial resources to develop dual-use technologies, manufacturing and
technology assistance to small firms, and education and training programs that
enhance US. manufacturing skills and target displaced defense industry workers.
This specific project will enable a number of defense-based companies in
Colorado to enter the biomedical product arena, thereby allowing them to
diversify their product base into the non-defense sector.***
