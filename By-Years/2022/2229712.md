The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of a novel tubular proton exchange fuel cell and potential
commercialization for applications ranging from portable electronics to
transport applications. Fuel cells are expected to play a significant role in
zero-emission power generation and in the expansion of the hydrogen industry and
clean energy, with the global market size projected to reach $25.5 billion by
2024. However, current planar fuel cell designs have challenges before they can
be compatible with the Department of Energy targets for specific power,
performance, cost, and durability. The proposed technology may address a number
of these challenges due to its novel tubular design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the potential development of a proposed tubular
proton exchange fuel cell, which due to its novel design, could offer reduced
weight and improved specific power as well as reduced complexity, and reduced
cost compared to the conventional planar fuel cell design. The technology may
also offer improved reactant mass transport, possibly improved efficient product
water removal, and may possess improved uniform reactant, current and
temperature distribution. In this technology, structure-property-performance-
degradation correlations for conventional, planar, agglomerate-type fuel cells,
as well as carbon nanofiber-based fuel cells, could also be established to help
guide the future rational design of efficient and stable components for zero-
emission systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
