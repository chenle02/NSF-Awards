The objective of the study is to test the validity of a mechanistic model of
magma generation under mid ocean ridges by trace element analyses of primitive
mid ocean ridge (MORB) glasses. This will be accomplished through the study of
MORB samples from the Carlsberg Ridge, the East Pacific Rise near the Siqueiros
Fracture Zone and the Southern Mid Atlantic Ridge. Isotopes study of MORB
glasses are also planned. At the conclusion of the analyses melt fractions at
advanced stage of the process.
