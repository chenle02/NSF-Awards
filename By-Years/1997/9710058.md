In this study precinct data for county, state, and federal elections between
1980 and 1996 are matched with data on the racial composition of precincts in
order to analyze racial polarization and realignment in the south. Racial
polarization is defined as the difference in support for the Democrats among
blacks and whites (or Latinos where appropriate). Using an ecological inference
program (EI) this study estimates, with confidence intervals, support for
Democrats and Republicans among blacks, whites, and Latinos in every county in
the south for virtually all county, state, and federal elections. Litigants and
judges in cases challenging or supporting the creation of majority-minority
districts are likely to rely heavily on these estimates. Unlike past studies
which have focused primarily on whether polarization prevents the election of
minority officials, this investigation gauges the size of the racial gap in
support for the Democrats. Contrary to the conventional wisdom often expressed
by the courts and the media, the principal investigator hypothesizes that racial
polarization has increased as blacks continue to vote nearly unanimously for
Democrats and greater numbers of whites cast ballots for Republicans. The
estimates of racial polarization make it possible to test competing theories for
why racial polarization varies across location, time, and office. The study
compares the strength of the white backlash theory with other nonracial
theories. The white backlash theory states that whites who live in areas with a
high percentage of blacks usually vote more conservatively than whites in areas
with few blacks, but some speculate that the economic gap between blacks and
whites explains racial polarization. The investigation tests several theories
about the nexus between racial redistricting and realignment. While several
studies examine the partisan impact of racial redistricting at the federal
level, this study is the first to explore whether racial redistricting resulted
in Republican state legislative or county council gains. The data set produced
by this investigation will be of immense value to other scholars interested in
exploring this important topic.
