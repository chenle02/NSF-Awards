The iDREAMS (Integrative Design-based Reform-oriented Educational Approach for
Motivating Students) project engages middle school students in computer science
curriculum through game design with the ultimate goal of helping them understand
and build interest in pursuing IT careers. The project builds on earlier work
with AgentSheets and successes with students at various ages. The teachers and
students are drawn from four Colorado diverse communities: Boulder Valley School
District (technology hub), Aurora Public Schools (inner city), South Central
Board of Cooperative Educational Services (rural), and the Southern Ute Indian
Tribe (remote/tribal). The project delivers one week of classroom instruction to
1120 students as part of a required course within the curriculum, a 4-week
follow up elective module, and a 1-week transition module to high school
computer education. Training for 28 teachers and 28 community and tribal college
students include annual intensive one and two week-long summer workshops, and
ongoing remote support throughout the school year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project results in an IT curriculum that is tested in middle schools, compliant
with the National Educational Technology Standards, and scalable.
