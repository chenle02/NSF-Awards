This proposal concerns several problems in geometry that are related to Dirac
operators and Atiyah-Singer index theory. One of the most important and
extensively studied areas of geometry is the study of canonical metrics.
Geometric variational problems and geometric flows have been two of the most
fruitful approaches to the study of canonical metrics. It is important to
understand the stability issue associated to variational problems. Stability
issue is also important in the study of geometric flows. One of the goals here
is to use the Dirac operator in the study of stability problems for Einstein
metrics and positive scalar curvature and scalar flat metrics on Calabi-Yau
manifolds and shed light on the so called positive mass problem for Ricci flat
manifolds. It will also develop local index theory technique in the study of
heat kernel and Bergman kernel and their connection with canonical metrics. In
particular, the investigator (with collaborators) would like to search for an
analogue, for orbifolds, of Donaldson's theorem relating the existence of Kahler
metrics with constant scalar curvature with algebro-geometric notions of
stability. Another focus of the proposal is the study of Ricci flow on a class
of noncompact manifolds, the ALE spaces, and explores the connection with the
famous Positive Mass Theorem. Finally the investigator will study the
significance and degeneration problems of geometric invariants such as eta
invariant and analytic torsion.

Recent development shows the extraordinary power of the geometric flows such as
the Ricci flow. Dirac operators and related geometric invariants, inspired by
Physics and coming out of the Atiyah-Singer index theory, are playing
significant and important role in diverse fields of mathematics and physics.
They reveal much about the topological, geometric and analytic structures of the
underlying space. This proposal aims for better understanding of the variational
structure of important geometric functionals and geometric flows, the use of
geometric invariants in studying moduli spaces of geometric structures and
special metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. It also explores the connection with
positive mass theorems. According to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is
the manifestation of curvature of the space. Gravity is one of the four
fundamental forces in nature and the dominating one in shaping our universe. The
understanding of mass and momentum is of crucial importance in our ultimate
understanding of the universe. Calabi-Yau manifolds and special metrics play
essential role in physics. The proposed activities would have impact on all
these directions. The proposal will also have educational impact as it involves
graduate students and post-doctors.
