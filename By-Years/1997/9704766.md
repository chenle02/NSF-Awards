This proposal will undertake the continued operation of the Magnetometer Array
for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS) and the data reduction, archival and
dissemination, and analysis of data from the array. The array is cooperatively
operated by Boston University and Augsburg College (Engebretson, PI). The
analysis of data will be undertaken in collaboration with various satellite and
other ground based measurements to study processes which couple energy from the
solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Particularly, investigations
will focus on transients and waves at the magnetospheric boundary,
magnetospheric convection, and the substorm process.
