The Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and
Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will purchase an eight node
(sixteen processor) Alpha Beowolf cluster which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
projects, including in particular:

1. What lessons from small neuronal networks apply to larger ones? Victoria
Booth, Amithaba Bose, and Farzan Nadim.

2. Numerical solutions of mixed functional differential equations Christopher
Elmer.

3. Time-dependent oxygen transport from microvascular networks Daniel Goldman.

4. Pattern formation in thin liquid film flows Lou Kondic.

5. Full numerical simulation of microwave-enhanced chemical vapor infiltration
processing Burt Tilley.
