This project will examine the Hox genes, which specify the fundamental
organization of body plans, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of
lophotrochozoans. As one of the three major lineages of bilateral animals, this
group contains the greatest diversity of body plan organization and are
purported to encompas at least 10 recognized phyla (including annelids,
mollusks, ectoprocts, brachipods, and platyhelminthes). Before the factors that
shaped metazoan macroevolution and diversification are understood, the
evolutionary relationships of the lophotrochozoans are critically needed. In
addition to constructing gene geneologies, this work will employ information on
organization and gene composition of the Hox cluster. To this end, four
bacterial artifical chromosome libraries will be produced, thus allowing the
entire Hox cluster to be sequenced. To augment this library, evolutionary
history will be reconstructed from 28S rDNA and COI genes for 49 lophotrochozoan
taxa. This study will provide data that can be used to address several long-
standing issues, including understanding the evolutionary and developmental
plasticity of segmentation and embryogenesis.
