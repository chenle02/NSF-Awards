This project will enhance undergraduate chemistry education at California State
University-Fullerton by incorporating computer- controlled gradient high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) capability into a vigorous
undergraduate research program and advanced laboratory courses. In Biochemistry
Laboratory and Integrated Chemistry Laboratory, all chemistry and biochemistry
majors will learn the theory and practice of HPLC as well as computer
interfacing and data storage, reduction, analysis, and interpretation. Students
will use a wide variety of columns, solvent systems, and detectors for many
different HPLC applications. The hands-on laboratory experience provided by this
instrumentation will prepare students for graduate and professional schools, and
for careers in chemistry and biochemistry.
