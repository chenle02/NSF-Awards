The principal investigator proposes to develop a task environment for a series
of experiments designed to investigate information processing in dynamic
decision tasks. These are tasks in which the responses to one decision influence
the information available at the time of a later decision. Two different studies
are planned. The first will use one or two response modes during an initial
session and will either the same or different responses in the second (transfer)
session. The second experiment will evaluate changes in strategies as a result
of changes in feedback about the system's outcomes.
