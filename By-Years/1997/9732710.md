Three classes of new mathematical problems related to micromechanics will be
studied analytically and numerically. The first problem is the investigation of
nonlinear fourth order partial differential equations describing the spreading
of liquid film along a solid surface under recently proposed boundary conditions
that represent the phenomenon more adequately than previously used ones. The
second class of problems is concerned with nonlinear parabolic equations
describing flows of chemically active fluids where a new mathematical
formulation was recently proposed. The third class of problems is related to the
numerical investigation of new free boundary problems for the equation of
elasticity related to fatigue crack propagation. Micromechanics takes into
account the transformation of material microscopic structure in the process of
flow or deformation of real fluids and deformable solids. It leads to new
mathematical models and problems. The mathematical models of three classes of
practically important problems will be constructed and investigated. They are:
flows of thin films along solid surfaces, important for chemical and petroleum
engineering; flows of reacting fluids near critical (pre-explosion) conditions,
important for chemical engineering and internal combustion engines; fatigue
crack propagation and damage extension, important for a wide class of mechanical
engineering problems. New mathematical models will be obtained and investigated.
Computational approaches will be combined with advanced analytic studies.
