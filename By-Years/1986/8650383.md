Seven multi-use digital/measurement and control system stations are now in place
through the recent acquisition of major system components including computers,
analog/digital and digital/analog boards, 20 amplifier boards, oscilloscopes,
printers and strip chart recorders. These stations are the main instrumentation
teaching tools in the sophomore mechanical engineering instrumentation course,
and are central to student instrumentation work in junior and senior mechanical
engineering laboratories and in a senior controls course. A versatile tool is
available for undergraduate students to gain experience with the intricacies of
data collection, analysis and reporting. With the improved undergraduate
laboratory curriculum, students are exposed to a wider variety of such
experiences than was previously possible.
