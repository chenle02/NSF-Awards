This proposal addresses ocean modeling from an inverse point of view. Ocean
data of varying types and quality have been collected for many years. In many
analyses, a subjective approach is taken to describe the distribution of
salinity and other tracers. This study will continue efforts to develop
quantitative methods to constrain the data analyses. In particular, models will
be made to conserve mass, momentum, and chemical constituents according to
prescribed rules which describe the data and the errors associated with it.
Specific attention will be focused on the North Atlantic, but other areas with
relevant data bases will also be included. This work is an important element in
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
