A major hurdle to having more women researchers and professors in computer
science is that many undergraduate women are simply not exposed to what computer
science research entails or provided opportunities to explore as a career path.
This project will design and run the Tech+Research workshop, an all-female
Computer Science research hackathon with the goal of highlighting the diversity
and opportunities in the field of computing research. The weekend event will be
hosted in collaboration with Technica (https://gotechnica.org), the largest all-
female hackathon. Computing faculty from institutions across the state of
Maryland will mentor groups of attendees on projects in their prospective
research areas. Along with providing hands-on research experience in a dynamic
hackathon setting, Tech+Research will include sessions introducing attendees to
the basics of computing research and highlight the exciting opportunities that
come with pursuing a graduate degree in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hackathon-centered approach to introducing
students to research has the potential to be a low-overhead step towards a more
equitable, inclusive field of computer science. To measure its impact, this
project will perform surveys and track the students' progress in their pursuit
of Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) funding and graduate school.
Finally, this project will share its findings and materials to help foster
similar workshops at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
