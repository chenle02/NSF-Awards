9315844 Carmichael The Jalisco Block has geological properties that are in stark
contrast to the neighboring regions of western Mexico, such as the geological
succession, volcanism, grade of metamorphism, faulting and relief; it is an
exciting but largely unknown area. We propose to: (1) document geologic and
tectonic aspects of the Jalisco Block that distinguish it from its surroundings
and define it as a tectonically- independent block. We will also determine
whether extensive eruptions of plateau basalt characterize extension along the
Block's northern margin and whether the sources of these voluminous basalts are
in the aesthenosphere or the lithosphere; (2) determine the uplift/exhumation
history of the Jalisco Block using the stratigraphy of the volcanic cover and
mineral assemblages of exposed plutons and their metamorphic envelopes; (3)
determine the direction of relative motion between the Jalisco Block and the
North American plate (for the last 10Ma), by examining datable faults that
frequent the bounding rift zones of the Block.
