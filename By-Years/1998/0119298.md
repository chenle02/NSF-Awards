0119298&lt;br/&gt;Ishman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas award will support a
planning visit by Dr. Scott E. Ishman of Southern Illinois University-Carbondale
to finalize a cooperative research project with Drs. Ruben E. Martinez of the
National Museum of Natural History, Rodolfo Martinez of San Pedro Nolasco
College and Luis A. Chirino of Museo Fonck, all in Chile, respectively. The
researchers will meet in Antofagasta and Santiago, Chile and will do site visits
to localities in the Mejillones region of Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
northern region of Chile provides a unique geographic setting to investigate the
oceanographic and climatic sensitivity of the eastern South Pacific to
significant changes in Antarctic ice volume change as interpreted from sea-level
records. The Mejillones Basin is ideal for this research. It represents a
shallow marine setting developed on an active margin with nearby volcanism and
other significant tectonic features. Results from this proposed project will
provide a better understanding of the interconnection between Antarctic ice
volume change, oceanographic and atmospheric circulation, and the impacts these
have on recurring oceanographic and meteorological events such as El Nino, which
have global and economic significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
