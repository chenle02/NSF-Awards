AST-0407305&lt;br/&gt;Bahcall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clusters of galaxies, the
most massive virialized objects in the universe, provide one of the most
powerful tools in the study of cosmology. Clusters provide efficient tracers of
the large-scale structure of the universe, and have placed some of the tightest
constraints on cosmological parameters. Systematic studies of clusters are
currently limited by the lack of large area, accurate, complete, and objectively
selected catalogs of optical clusters: this research will use the comprehensive
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to improve this situation. The resultant well-
calibrated catalog will be the largest of its kind by an order of magnitude, and
will be made generally available. It will then be used to study the cluster mass
function and its evolution, and the richness-dependent cluster correlation
function and its evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides
exceptional educational and outreach opportunities: not only will the work be
carried out mostly with graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, with a significant fraction being female, but the catalog will be made
easily available. It will be used by the astronomical community for years to
come, by planetaria and science museums, and by schools, the media, and the
general public.
