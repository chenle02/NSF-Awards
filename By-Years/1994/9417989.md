From 1990-1993, the Principal Investigator developed a theoretical framework
examining African American women's gender roles. This work was published and
will be used to guide the analysis of secondary data acquired from the Center
for Research on Women at Memphis State University, and from the Family Data
Archives The implications for the results of the data analyses are present for
furthering theories about the development of African American and European
American middle class managerial and professional women, adaptive strategies,
and techniques for success that have only been discussed briefly in the
literature. The Principal Investigator's work in progress currently examines the
gender role development among women in Latin America to determine the
relationship between societal expectations and orientation and the impact on
stress as it occurs within the work and family nexus.
