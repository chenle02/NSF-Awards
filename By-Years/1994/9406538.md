94-06538 Allred This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
addresses production technology for low-cost thermoplastic prepreg materials
tailored to object-fabrication requirements. Phase I showed the feasibility of
producing low-cost thermoplastic, powder-impregnated tows with a variety of
fibers and polymers. Cost reduction is achieved through processing at high
speeds with particle sizes larger than presently used with powder-impregnated
materials. In Phase II control parameters will be studied for the impregnation
process tailored to fabrication by filament winding, pultrusion, braiding,
weaving, and molding. Sizings to improve fiber adhesion to thermoplastic
polymers will also be examined. Results of these studies will be used in design
of a large-scale process Phase III demonstration under private sector support.
Commercial applications of low-cost thermoplastic composite materials are
expected in construction, transportation, sporting goods, aerospace, marine,
chemical, medical, and military industries.
