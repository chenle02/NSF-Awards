The Bellcore project, "Heightened Interest in Technical and Engineering Careers
(HI-TEC)," refines and replicates a project that has been underway in six New
Jersey school districts since 1989. Forty teachers from fourteen schools have
joined engineers, scientists, and administrators in planning and attending a
20-day summer math, science, computer and learning innovation institute. In the
fall, the scientists will join the teachers in the classroom. Computer links
will enable students to obtain answers to questions about science. The target
group is elementary and middle school teachers, with a focus on women and
minorities.
