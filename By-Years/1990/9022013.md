Research will focus on establishing the genetic basis of the between lake
morphological differences in Bluegill populations. Larvae from in vitro crosses
made with the Canadian study populations will be transported to "common garden"
ponds at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. These genetically marked
individuals (with mtDNA and isozyme markers) will be reared in vegetated and
open water habitats and their morphological development will be measured. This
study will demonstrate unambiguously whether the inter-lake components of
morphological divergence are due to underlying genetic variation or the result
of environmental induction of phenotype working on a common, plastic genotype.
