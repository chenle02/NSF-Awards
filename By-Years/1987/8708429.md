One of the central issues in developmental neurobiology concerns the
differentiation of orderly arrangements of cells and their connections. The
overall objective of Dr. Casagrande's research is to understand the mechanisms
for the development of cellular patterns and connections in the nervous system.
The development of layers and connections in the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) provides an opportune system for investigation of these mechanisms, since
this nucleus, which receives retinal inputs from the two eyes, is precisely
organized and many aspects of its organization and development are well-
documented. The principal investigator has argued that the development of
lamination, per se, in the LGN does not require binocular competition
(competition between retinal afferents arising from the two eyes), but that
specific functional types of afferents are specified to innervate particular
territories. These experiments, using prenatal tree shrews, will examine the
degree to which retinal afferents are specified to innervate specific LGN
territories by: (1) examining the morphology of individual retinogeniculate
axons during the course of early development within the LGN, and (2) examining
the morphological development of these axons following monocular enucleation
performed prior to retinal innervation of the LGN. The results of this research
will provide important and new information on developmental processes involved
in laminar formation in the nervous system.
