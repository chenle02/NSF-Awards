While recent studies have found that investors' common stock selling behavior is
heavily influenced by their reluctance to accept losses (which has been labeled
the disposition effect), little is known about what influences the buying
decisions of investors. We speculate that the buying behavior of individual
investors is largely determined by that which catches investors' attention. Thus
investors, unlike agents in most academic models, treat buying and selling
asymmetrically. This study is an empirical test of the proposition that buying
is driven by attention.

To test whether buying behavior is driven by attention, the research will use
four separate proprietary datasets. Combined, these datasets include month-end
common stock positions and trading records for over 100,000 households from 1987
to 1999. These data are compiled from three different brokerage firms: a large
discount broker, a large retail broker, and a smaller broker that attracts
primarily active traders.

To test whether buying behavior is driven by attention, the research will
analyze three types of information that are likely to catch the attention of the
average investor: large price movements, the announcement of quarterly earnings,
and news coverage. The research provides a simple prediction: that buying will
increase around these information events regardless of the value of the
information. Thus, we anticipate increased buying activity following large price
increases and decreases, good and bad earnings announcements, and good and bad
press coverage.

The research fits neatly into a stream of recent studies that analyze the
behavior of individual investors. In combination with current and planned
studies of investor behavior, this research serves to enhance our understanding
of investor behavior and financial markets, improve investor education, and
inform policy decisions.
