ABSTRACT DMS - 0204188.

The principal investigator will seek analytic realizations of "stringy"
cohomology of singular varieties with trivial canonical bundle. He will study
the implications of such analytic realizations (and their generalizations)
towards providing new explanations of gauge symmetry enhancement mechanisms in
string theory. In collaboration with S. Sethi, the PI will continue his program
to analyze the supersymmetric matrix model quantum mechanics which has been
conjectured to provide a definition of M theory. Graduate student G. Firestone,
will study the L2 index theory for the nonFredholm Dirac operators whose L2
kernels give the ground states for this theory. Sethi and the PI will examine
methods for computing gravitational anomalies of field theories arising from
string theories on singular spaces. S. Paban, S. Sethi, and the PI will examine
the constraints imposed by supersymmetry on deformations of the supersymmetry
algebra associated to an isolated five brane. The PI will investigate the
extension of Witten's spinor technique of proving the positive mass conjecture
by replacing the hypothesis of a smooth spin structure by the assumption of a
spin structure degenerating on a codimension 2 submanifold.

M theory gives a potential framework for providing a physical theory which
incorporates both gravitation and the quantum physics describing high energy
particles. The precise form of this theory is not yet fully developed. The
measurable consequences are even further from being fully worked out. This
project attempts to determine, for branches of this theory, fundamental
consequences, such as the number of particles of different types, when these
particles combine to make more complex matter, and the size and shape of these
particles and their combinations. In addition to developing the physical
consequences of M and string theory, such computations can be used to check for
potential errors in the underlying hypotheses of M theory. This project also
seeks a better understanding of a mathematical model for the physical
interactions between certain "particles" known as 5 branes, whose existence is
predicted by M theory.
