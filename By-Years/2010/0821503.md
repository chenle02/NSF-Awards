Objective: &lt;br/&gt;In this project, we requested instrumentation to setup a
UWB laboratory to support the research of intra-vehicle wireless networks and
wireless networked control system (wireless NCS). Related topics include in-
vehicle UWB channel measurement and modeling, an optimal high-speed UWB data
transmission scheme using multiple band orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM), a robust real-time control message delivery method using
time-hopping UWB radio under various vehicle setting and interferences, an
effective media access control protocol, and control system performance analysis
and design under unreliable data transmission
links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The project intends
to fully utilize an intelligent mechanism in the design of wireless NCS by
sensing, analyzing, and predicting channel conditions and network configuration
consequently adaptively adjusting network configurations and modifying schemes
to optimize system objectives. The outcomes of this project will advance the
state-of-the-art wireless communications, networks and control systems and the
mechanisms applied are extremely applicable to various fields of science and
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The application of
intra-vehicle wireless communications systems will enhance the transportation
environments, the quality of life and the efficiency of work. The adoption of
wireless NCS considerably facilitates a wide range of modern control systems to
achieve ground-breaking functions and attain high scalability and flexibility by
eliminating the wiring limit. The University of Michigan, Dearborn is located in
the heartland of the American automotive industry. The adoption of intra-vehicle
wireless networks and wireless NCS will have significant and long term impacts
on the competition between automobile manufacturers worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;
