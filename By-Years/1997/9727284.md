Glenn Evans is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his formal theoretical studies of elementary
models for complex fluids consisting of micelles and liquid crystals. He will
study both the static and dynamic properties of these complex systems. The
static behavior studies will be based on an extension of Stell's modification of
Wertheim's theory. The goal of this work is to understand how micelles and cell
membranes self assemble. The aim of the dynamical studies is to understand how
micelles coagulate or fracture when their dilute solutions are subjected to
shear flow. The dynamical studies will be based on an adaptation of the theory
of nuclear collisions for soft condensed matter. Results will be compared with
molecular dynamics simulations. Amphiphiles are complex molecules. They can
behave as anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and nonionic surfactants. At the
appropriate critical concentration, they can self assemble into micelles such as
those found in common detergents. When biologically significant amphiphiles such
as cholines self assemble to form monolayers, these layers constitute cell
walls. Evans' research seeks to find a molecular based theory that will
elucidate the complex properties of amphiphiles, and that will ultimately help
us to determine how to design amphiphiles with desired chemical and physical
properties.
