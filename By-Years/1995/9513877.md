HLAVIN 9513877 This conference, organised as a satellite to the annual meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, addresses a topic of rapidly growing importance
in the understanding of brain development. Adhesion molecules comprise a diverse
set of substances that regulate the development of the brain , and other
tissues, by means of intercellular signals which regulate the growth and
formation of appropriate connections. L1 is one such molecule. When it is
present in a mutant form, abnormal development results. the conference will
enable established and younger investigators form related disciplines to share
new insights on the significance and mode of action of L1.
