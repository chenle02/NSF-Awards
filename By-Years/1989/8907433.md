This research deals with two areas of polymer materials research (1) phase
transitions, morphology, and properties of block copolymers; and (2) high-
resolution electron microscopy (HREM) of crystalline polymers. The first area
involves the detailed study of neat linear and star diblock copolymers and block
copolymer/homopolymer blends as concerns order-disorder transitions and order-
order transitions. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the molecular
parameters which govern phase morphology and stability. Both small and
especially large-strain mechanical behavior of these model ordered
microcomposites will be examined and related to the evolution of domain
morphology with extent of deformation. The word in HREM will focus on
understanding the details of chain packing in flexible chain-folded crystals
particularly as regards regions where the chain arrangement reflects fundamental
information on crystal growth (primary nucleus, twin boundaries, reentrant
growth fronts). The main investigative techniques are transmission electron
microscopy diffraction, small-angle x-ray scattering, digital image analysis,
computer graphics of surfaces and mechanical testing. The goal of the research
is to contribute to the basic understanding of structure-property relationships
which can provide a basis for development of materials and improvement of their
properties.
