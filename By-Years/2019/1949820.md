This project deals with large random systems, which can be typically described
as collections of particles with certain prescribed rules of interactions.
Examples are given by random stepped surfaces in three-dimensional space, random
sorting networks, six-vertex model (also known as the square ice and used to
model a thin planar layer of molecules of water). A distinguishing feature of
the studied systems is the presence of numerous exact formulas, describing the
probabilistic characteristics of the systems. The central questions concern
asymptotic properties of the systems of growing sizes, and the research aims at
exact rather than qualitative answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at
two kinds of results. First, the new types of asymptotic behavior lead to
discoveries of connections between stochastic systems of different origins, such
as lattice models of two-dimensional statistical mechanics, random matrices,
stochastic partial differential equations, and probability measures of
asymptotic representation theory. Second, the development of robust methods
leads to the extensions of the results from the exactly solvable cases to much
wider universality classes, thus, justifying the use of these cases for the
extensive peculiar predictions, potentially reaching the real-world
applications. In particular, during the project the PI will investigate the
transition between Gaussian Free Field and Gaussian fields solving hyperbolic
SPDEs in the six-vertex model, connections between random sorting networks and
eigenvalue distributions of random matrices, and the link between matrix
elements of powers of random Hermitian matrices and the finite-time distribution
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang SPDE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
