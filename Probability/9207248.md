One of the basic results of probability is the so-called law of the iterated
logarithm (LIL), which provides a precise description of the asymptotic behavior
of sums of independent random variables. For many applications one needs a more
general framework than in the classical case which deals with real-valued random
variables. The main purpose of this research is to study LIL results and some
related problems such as strong approximation and certain weak convergence
results in general Banach spaces. This research will extend results in the
theory of probability. In many applications a more general framework is needed,
and this research will help provide it.
