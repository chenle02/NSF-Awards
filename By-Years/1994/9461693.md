This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development
of a rapid prototyping system addressing the needs of both designers and
manufactures. An effective rapid prototyping system is capable of producing
components suitable for the testing of both form and function. By testing
components early in the design phase dimensional errors as well as structural
deficiencies may be identified and corrected. The ability to transition rapidly
from prototyping to production can also dramatically reduce time it takes to
introduce new products to market. Research efforts to date have focused on
either the needs of the designers or manufactures. This novel proposal describes
an interactive rapid prototyping approach, called Direct Rapid Prototyping and
Process Generation, that allows for the rapid realization of prototype
components from their CAD descriptions with the simultaneous generation of a CNC
tool path program and process plan. Using a joy stick a machinist can direct a
CNC machine tool controller to accurate|y machine a prototype component. Process
data generated during this interactive machining cycle is then used to create an
idealize part program for use by a subsequent production cycle.
