This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to design and
deliver a low cost, MEMS- based wavefront correction device for use in
ophthalmic adaptive optics systems. The use of adaptive optics in ophthalmics
shows great promise, but the lack of suitable cost-effective solutions has
hindered the advance of research and the development of associated commercial
markets. MEMX will leverage the most sophisticated surface micromachining
technology available today to design and deliver, for the first time, a MEMS
wavefront correction chip that addresses all of the requirements specified by
the vision science community. In this project, a number of design concepts will
be created and fully analyzed, after which a baseline design will be fabricated
and tested against ophthalmic requirements.

The main commercial application of this project is in the area of ophthalmic
devices and instrumentation. Additional applications would include optical
coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, portable military imaging systems,
free space optical communication systems, and semiconductor lithography.
