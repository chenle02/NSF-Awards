This grant permits Dr. Eck and his international team of collaborators to
continue their paleoanthropological research at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. This
site is of extreme anthropological significance because its sediments, deposited
over an approximately 2 million year period contain a series of human physical
and cultural remains. Much of this material has been dated and allows
anthropologists to trace human development over most of the Ice Age. What also
makes the site important is its wealth of non.human faunal remains. These allow
one to reconstruct the shifting climates and environments in which humans
functioned. The goals of this project are to: 1. address geographical and
stratigraphic biases in previous faunal collections from the site; 2. augment
previously documented vertebrate taxa; 3. increase knowledge of human physical
development; 4. refine the stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the
Olduvai faunal and cultural sequences; 5. develop a strategy of
paleoanthropological resource management to ensure Olduvai's continued
contribution to science. To accomplish these goals a multidisciplinary group of
scientists will conduct two seasons of research at the site. This work is
important because it builds on a splendid data base ammassed over many years by
the Leakey family and their collaborators. It will help to increase our
understanding of human development and the factors which guided it. Because the
research team includes Tanzanian members, the project will help to improve the
scientific base in this country and strengthen ties between the U.S. and
Tanzania.
