&lt;br/&gt;0075295&lt;br/&gt;McAllister&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A morphologically
and functionally distinct pair of sex chromosomes provides a basis for gender
determination in many organisms. One chromosome (X) is shared between the two
genders, and contains a normal set of functional genes; the other (Y) is
restricted to one gender, and has few genes. These differences arise through a
repeatable evolutionary process, because pairs of sex chromosomes have arisen
multiple times from pairs of identical chromosomes (autosomes), a transition
that has been demonstrated for the X-Y pair in humans.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves molecular and genetic analyses of
Drosophila americana americana, a species with a chromosomal rearrangement that
has recently transformed a pair of its autosomes into neo-sex chromosomes. The
long-term objective of the study is to reveal the forces influencing loss of
gene function on the male-limited neo-Y chromosome of D. a. americana. Studies
will characterize the pattern of sequence variation in the region adjacent to
the centromere of these neo-sex chromosomes, because this region is subjected to
a gradient of restricted recombination. These data will lead to a better
understanding of the relationship between recombination and the forces of
mutation, selection and genetic drift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of Y
chromosomes provides a model system for demonstrating the consequences of
restricted recombination, which has implications for understanding factors
influencing asexual reproduction and evolution within closely-linked regions of
the genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
