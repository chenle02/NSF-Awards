This award will fund a new study to determine the masses of black holes in
binary systems. Using the new NSF-funded infrared FIRE (Folded-port InfraRed
Echellette) spectrograph at the Magellan Observatory in Chile, Dr. Remillard and
his team will measure the radial velocities and rotational line-broadening for
the companions to a number of black holes. Infrared observations are more useful
than those at visible wavelengths, since there is much less extinction from dust
and where the weakest companion stars radiate most strongly. The goals of the
project are (1) to obtain new measurements of black hole masses; (2) to make
mass measurements for accreting neutron stars; and (3) to conduct a long-term
study of GRS 1915+105, which is unique for its variability, high luminosity, and
productivity in producing jets.

Mass measurements anchor general efforts to infer black hole spin values via
X-ray observations. Values of mass and spin are primary inputs for theorists
working on stellar evolution of massive stars, supernovae, hypernovae, and
binary evolution. Inferences of BH mass and spin will energize the general
effort to develop quantitative applications of general relativity in the strong
gravity regime.
