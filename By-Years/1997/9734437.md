This research focuses on improving WWW proxy caching in order to sustain the
continued growth of the Web on the Internet. Caching is one of the most
important techniques that can be used to increase the salability of the Web. The
research targets four major problems that currently plague Web caching systems:
lack of strong cache consistency, no support for server control on cache
accesses, inflexible caching algorithms, and poor performance. In order to solve
these problems, this project will explore means to include strong cache
consistency maintenance in WWW via lease-based invalidation protocols, active
cache architecture that supports server-supplied processing upon cache access,
Web caching strategies that adapt to network conditions and utilize the unique
capabilities of large proxy caches to reduce network congestion, and high-
performance scalable proxy architectures and cache sharing protocols. Combined,
these efforts promise to qualitatively improve the scalability and availability
of the Web, and to support the increasingly important role that the Web plays in
our society. The educational activities include developing the mini-scale
Internet emulator, nurturing the "crash and burn" lab, and other initiatives
aimed at increasing the research involvement of undergraduate students.
