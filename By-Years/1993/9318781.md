9318781 Sirlin The proposed research includes a variety of topics in particle
physics and quantum field theory. These include: (1) studies of electroweak
physics to (a) verify the Standard Model at the level of its quantum
corrections; (b) constrain the masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson; (c)
search for deviations that may signal the presence of new physics; (2) work on
the critical limit of lattice gauge theory and non-perturbative effects in
quantum chromodynamics, including exploiting the calculational scheme developed
recently whereby the lattice Faddeev-Popov formula is modified to take into
account the Gribov horizon, while nevertheless maintaining perturbative
renormalizability; (3) work to (a) determine the constraints imposed on the
effective low-energy string lagrangians by supersymmetry and space-time duality;
(b) study examples of exactly solvable open strings in nontrival backgrounds,
and their relevance to low-energy physics; (c) find the effective lagrangians
for the higher-spin massive states present in string theory. ***
