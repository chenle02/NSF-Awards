This is a proposal to develop a neural network based algorithm for controlling
eye and limb movements. The algorithm will assume that different actuators (such
as the limb and the eye), in spite of their differences, share some basic
biological strategies in generating appropriate movements to motor commands. The
proposed strategies will be based on currently emerging knowledge in
neurophysiology, a novel approach to guide the design of artificial control
systems. If successful, the research will not only provide improved
understanding of natural motor control, but it may also provide anew methodology
for designing artificial control systems. Such methodology would be of great
potential utility in robotics and in the design of control systems to aid the
physically disabled.
