This project in scientific computation incorporates research in numerical
analysis, aspects of computer science, and solution of model problems in
mechanics. The principal investigator will focus on four research areas in the
proposal: free boundary problems in fluid dynamics; high.order discretizations
in three dimensions for incompressible continua; automated programming of
scientific algorithms on parallel computers; and multi.grid methods on
adaptively refined meshes.
