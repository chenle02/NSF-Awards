This research project is directed at basic problems of the theory of random
matrix models and their applications to statistical physics. The project
concerns with different conjectures of universality of the scaling limits of
eigenvalue correlation functions and with exactly solvable models of statistical
physics and hydrodynamics. This includes: (a) the development of the Riemann-
Hilbert approach to random normal matrix models with applications to Hele-Shaw
flows in hydrodynamics and Laplacian growth; (b) the development of the Riemann-
Hilbert approach to random matrix models with external source; (c) the exact
solution of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions in
ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases; (d) the study of the phase
separation in the six-vertex model, and others.

The project has an interdisciplinary character and it lies on the frontier
between physics and mathematics. The problems of scaling and universality are
central in many areas of modern science: theory of critical phenomena and phase
transitions, statistical physics and quantum field theory, theory of quantum
chaos, nonlinear dynamics, etc. This project develops powerful mathematical
methods to solve the problems of scaling and universality in the theory of
random matrices and their applications. It involves methods of different areas
of mathematics: analysis, theory of integrable systems, probability theory,
semiclassical asymptotics, complex analysis, etc. The research project has
direct applications to various physical problems: combinatorial asymptotics
related to quantum gravity, exactly solvable models of statistical physics, spin
systems on random surfaces, theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions,
quantum chaos. Possible further applications include the theory of knots and
links and related problems in molecular biology, growth models, statistical data
analysis, and others.
