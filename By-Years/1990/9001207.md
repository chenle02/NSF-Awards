The problems of human resource development are of high priority at this time for
Engineering. Efforts to encourage women, minorities and the handicapped to
choose careers in engineering are needed. This grant is to provide funds for a
reception for women in chemical engineering to be held at the 1989 annual
American Institute of Chemical Engineers meeting in San Francisco, CA. The
purpose is to give women a chance to meet and discuss issues of common concern.
The reception is open to all who are attending the meeting. A product of the
meeting is a list of all female faculty members in the US, a list that is
circulated and should help open lines of communication.
