This is a proposal to use maximum likelihood estimation for the reconstruction
of X-ray computed tomography images. The work involves theoretical developments,
computer simulations using phantom objects, and measurements on real X-ray data.
If successful, the new method of reconstruction will generate better images at
currently used X-ray intensities, or will allow the generation of the same
quality of images at a lower dose of X-ray exposure.
