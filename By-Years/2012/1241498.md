This research is a component of a broad community experiment named SOAS
(Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) designed to further investigate the
oxidation of the emissions (biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOCs) of
plants in the context of the atmospheric environment of the Southeast United
States. The project will investigate the effects of organic amines on secondary
organic aerosol (SOA) formation processes. Amines, along with ammonia, are the
dominant organic base compounds in the atmosphere. They are invariably present
in aerosol particles, and may contribute to SOA formation through condensation
of their oxidation products, or by the formation of salts with more acidic
aerosol particles.

Amines and their oxidation products may have adverse health effects and directly
impact air quality, and visibility. At present, measurements of gas-phase
amines, especially in biogenic environments in the southeastern United States,
are lacking. This project will make ground-based measurements of amines with a
fast-time response chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) during the 2013
SOAS campaign to better investigate the effects of amines on secondary aerosol
formation processes.
