The imaginal disks of insects are tissues that grow internally during larval
life and that will transform into the eyes, wings, legs, mouthparts and
genitalia of the adult insect during metamorphosis. The mechanisms that control
the growth and development of imaginal disks are the subject of extensive
investigation by developmental biologists. A new growth factor has been
discovered that regulates the growth of wing imaginal disks. Evidence has been
obtained that this factor is the neurohormone bombyxin, a member of the family
of insulin-like proteins. Bombyxin acts together with the steroid hormone
ecdysone, to induce normal growth in cultured wing imaginal disks. In normal
life, the level of this growth factor in the blood depends on the amount of food
intake, and it appears to be part of the mechanism by which the growth of
internal tissues is coordinated with overall body growth and nutrition. The
proposed work will clone and sequence the genes for bombyxin, and study the
relative roles of bombyxin and ecdysone in the regulation of cell growth and
cell division. In addition, studies will be done to elucidate the mechanisms by
which variation in nutrition causes changes in the blood-level of bombyxin and
ecdysone, and how variation in the level of these hormones in turn regulate
normal growth and development. Because bombyxin is a member of the insulin
family, this research will help shed light on the roles these important hormones
play in regulating the relative growth of different body parts, and will enhance
our understanding of how insulin regulates growth in response to variation in
nutrition. This research will also support the training and education of
graduate and undergraduates students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
