The National Bureau of Economic Research Conference on Research in Income and
Wealth (NBER-CRIW) schedules and organizes conferences on timely topics
emphasizing empirical issues. An important goal of the NBER-CRIW is to bring
together empirical researchers from government, academia and the private sector,
primarily from the U.S. The last conference on the service sector was organized
over twenty years ago. In the meantime, this sector has grown tremendously, and
so have public worries about its lagging productivity growth. The purpose of the
conference is to focus in particular on measurement, conceptual and definitional
issues in calibrating and interpreting output and productivity growth in various
service sector industries. The conference is to take place in May in Charleston,
South Carolina. During the two-day conference period, fifteen papers are to be
presented and discussed. Papers from this conference, as well as discussant's
remarks, will be published in the NBER- CRIW Conference Series.
