Corporations are responsible for a significant fraction of hedging volume on
futures and options markets, but there is as yet no satisfactory rigorous theory
that explains why financial hedging by corporations takes place. The
contribution from this project comes from developing a theory of corporate
financial hedging based on agency costs. This theory will provide insights into
the interrelations between information, managerial compensation schemes, the
selection of investment projects, and corporate financial hedging. The project
also addresses the foundations of financial economic theory. Asset pricing
theory depends on a restrictive model of intertemporal preferences for the
analysis of financial dynamics. Specifically, individual intertemporal
preferences are assumed to be additively separable. The investigator pioneered
in his previous work the use of Stochastic Differential Utility (SDU) as a model
of preferences for consumption processes in a continuous- time setting. This
project provides further elaboration of the SDU preference model, the
establishment of conditions for the existence of market equilibrium in settings
with heterogeneous agents, and applications to asset pricing theory.
