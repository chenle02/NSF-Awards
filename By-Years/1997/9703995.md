Thompson 9703995 This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Christopher J. Thompson at the
Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo,
Japan. Dr. Thompson will work with Dr. Shang-Ping Xie, Associate Professor in
the Division of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, on a research project
entitled, "Optimal Initial Conditions for Growth in an Intermediate Ocean-
Atmosphere Model of the Pacific that Generates the Annual Cycle and ENSO." This
proposed research emphasizes the construction and analysis of an intermediate-
sized model of the Equatorial Pacific that will reproduce both the annual cycle
and the inter-annual cycle of the atmospheric pattern known as El Nino/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is an irregular, three to seven year sea surface
temperature (SST) cycle, the most well known aspect of which is the periodic and
anomalous warming of the South America coast, a pattern referred to in the
scientific community as El Nino. ENSO also acts as a predictor for other
important seasonal weather patterns, one specific example being the Asian
Monsoon, which continues to cause either floods or droughts in South and East
Asia. A minimal degree of predictability for ENSO has been achieved through
previous research, but this research has been confined to the development of
models that reproduce either the ENSO cycle or the annual cycle. No existing
model has successfully reproduced both patterns or predicted their combined
effects. As such, the purpose of the proposed research is to develop this
complex model and apply optimal initial condition analysis to that model in
order to identify those structures which may lead to large transient growth in
the atmosphere. ***
