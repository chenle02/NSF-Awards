The broad goal of this research is to exploit the nature of both the future
communications traffic and the communications channel in the construction of
high performance receivers for multi-user Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA)
signals. Issues include bandwidth efficiency, receiver/transmitter complexity,
and quality of service (QoS). Two main research areas within CDMA receiver
design will be investigated: multi rate communications and channel equalization.
In order to accommodate a variety of potentially disparate sources (voice, data
and video signals), multi-rate communication schemes must be developed. Possible
sources such as voice, video, and data communications have inherently different
QoS requirements. QoS parameters include: bit-rate, allowable delay,
performance, and source priority. The constant bit-rate paradigm of the current
wireless network will not serve such multi-rate services of the future. The
focus of this research is to: (a) develop optimal detectors for the various
multi-rate access methods and compared, (b) create performance measures which
capture QoS needs will be constructed and (c) construct multi-user receivers to
explicitly exploit the redundancy in the mixture of narrowband and wideband user
signals. A major consideration is the distortion induced by the propagation
effects of the radio channel. Receivers to combat the effects of multipath and
fading will be developed and analyzed. While equalization in the context of
wireless systems is a well-explored problem, the novelty of this research lies
in the consideration of (a) parameter estimation methods necessary for the
accommodation of new users, (b) the specialization of existing blind
equalization techniques for CDMA signals which are achieved with moderate
complexity, and (c) the development of partially blind methods to fully exploit
any information present about the CDMA signals and the communication channel.
