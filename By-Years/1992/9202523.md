This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The research is a
combined experimental and theoretical effort to understand how the presence of a
surface influences the photochemistry of an adsorbed molecule. Specific
objectives are to use experimental measurements and theoretical simulations to
understand how the substrate affects the photodissociation of a bond in an
adsorbed molecule and to investigate how the branching among various reaction
pathways depends on this elementary step. Experiments will be carried out on
methyl iodide and iodine cyanide, whose gas-phase photodissociation dynamics are
well known, adsorbed on magnesia, titania and gold, representing an insulator, a
semiconductor, and a metal. Surface analysis, mass spectrometry, and gas phase
laser-based spectroscopicmeasurements will be employed to determine the
branching among reaction pathways and the energy content of photofragments
ejected from the surface. %%% The scientific issues addressed in the field of
surface photochemistry are broadly relevant to such materials issues as
photoassisted deposition, photoresists, surface photodegradation,
photolithography and laser- and plasma-assisted etching.
