Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on (1) The
phenomenological and cosmological implications of extra Higgs bosons, (2) The
implications for supersymmetry if a Higgs boson were to be discovered within the
next two years, (3) Study of whether a potential instability of the standard
model ground state is empirically acceptable, and (4) A proposal for a new class
of experiments searching for lepton number violation at the Continuous Electron
Beam Accelerator Facility. The Higgs bosons represent the one aspect of the weak
nuclear force about which essentially nothing is yet known. Yet, they are a very
central aspect of our understanding of this force. Thus, study of these bosons
is extremely important. Lepton number violation has never been seen, but its
existence is predicted by a number of intriguing models, so searching for it is
of considerable interest.
