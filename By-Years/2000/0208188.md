The proposed research project builds on the previously demonstrated capability
to retrieve O/N2 column density ratios from Far Ultraviolet (FUV) images
obtained from the DE 1 satellite and the resulting demonstration of the
correlation between large "clouds" of reduced O/N2 and reduced Nmax observed by
ground based ionosondes. The proposed research will carry this program forward
by making use of additional ionospheric data, specifically, topside soundings
obtained from the ISIS 1 and 2 satellites, incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data,
and satellite in situ data during 1981 and 1982. By providing topside electron
density profiles during negative ionospheric storms, these data will constrain
ionospheric and thermospheric models and allow the estimation of neutral density
profiles during these events. The ultimate goal of the research program is to
improve and enhance the ability to model thermospheric and ionospheric behavior
during geomagnetic storms, and to increase the understanding of the impact of
geomagnetic storms on the midlatitude thermosphere and ionosphere.
