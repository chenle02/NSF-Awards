K. Beard/Abstract 9505298 The effectiveness of evaporation ice nuclei (EIN) will
bestudied in laboratory simulations of cloud drop formation, charging,
evaporation and reentrainment in cumulus clouds developing through the freezing
level. Such nuclei are potentially effective ice nuclei because of organic and
inorganic materials in cloud drops. Charge accumulation at cloud top is a source
of ice nucleus enhancement by electrofreezing. For the proposed nuclei
continuous-flow experiment, cloud drops will be obtained from cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) using laboratory mixing and cloud chambers and the Illinois State
Water Survey continuous flow diffusion-chamber system, and from ultrasonic
nebulization of aloud water. Cloud drops will be charged using a corona device
and evaporated by mixing with dry air. The activation (threshold) temperature of
the resultant nuclei will be measured in the presence of condensing, supercooled
drops that act as condensation freezing nuclei as a function of temperature. The
EIN electrofreezing mode will be evaluated by measurements at several charge
levels, and the EIN evaporation-freezing mode will be deduced from measurements
using EIN particle generated both warmer and colder than freezing. A separate
set of nuclei activity measurements will be made to distinguish contact-freezing
from condensation-freezing by using an evaporating cloud in the freezing
chamber, so that contact of nuclei is enhanced by phoresis and condensation-
freezing is suppressed. A complete set of experiments is planned using nebulized
cloud water that has been collected during research flights. Another complete
set of experiments will be conducted with cloud-water formed on CCN using the
continuous flow diffusion system with corresponding chemical analysis. The
nuclei experiment and the diffusion system will be transportable so that
measurements can be made at various locations in the future.
