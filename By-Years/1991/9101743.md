This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
collaborative research in theoretical physics to be conducted by Dr. Richard H.
Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr.Jose E. Miraglia of the Instituto
de Astronomia y Fisica del Espacio (IAFE) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The focus
of the project will be the study of the theory of emission of continuum
radiation (bremsstrahlung) during electron- and ion-atom collisions. The work
will probe the relative roles of potential radiation and polarization radiation
mechanisms, and how they vary with projectile. The results will help to identify
situations for experimental investigation. The project allows the collaboration
of two internationally recognized investigators.
