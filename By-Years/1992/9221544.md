Le Moyne-Owen College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits
per second line through the SURANET mid-level network. The connection enables
the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
international scientific and educational community, and to access network
resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part
of the costs for two years.
