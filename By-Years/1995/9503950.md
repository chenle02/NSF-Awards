9503950 Vaughan This award supports a three-month postdoctoral fellowship for
Dr. Brian Vaughan of the California Institute of Technology. This fellowship
opportunity will enable Dr. Vaughan to begin a collaborative research effort
with Dr. Fumiyoshi Makino of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
(ISAS.) The investigators propose to perform spectral and timing analyses of
X-ray bursts using Japanese satellites. The proposed project provides a means to
"unlock" data collected from two Japanese satellites and the three-month visit
by Vaughan will help him to establish a personal and professional link with a
leading researcher in Japan. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Vaughan will have the
opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and equipment at ISAS
while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
