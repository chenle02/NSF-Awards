This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will address
problems health care professionals face when attempting to rapidly answer
clinical questions with current evidence. Most rapid clinical references are
neither updated frequently nor derived from the most valid research evidence,
while systems for identifying new research leave clinicians struggling with
multiple search result lists and no knowledge synthesis. The proposed product
uses an innovative design for rapid browsing and updates knowledge syntheses
daily from research surveillance. The technical objectives are to determine (1)
how clinicians seek information, (2) if the product provides answers to clinical
questions more efficiently than current sources, and (3) if the product provides
the most valid answers. Results of interviews and direct observations will be
used to improve organization of information for optimal browsing by clinicians.
Primary care physicians attempting to answer clinical questions during practice
will be randomized to use the proposed product or their usual sources, report
whether answers were found, and their speed will be recorded. Physicians trained
in research methodology will compare validity of answers from this and other
sources

The societal benefits will be improved health and health care utilization, as
decision-makers gain ready access to coherent medical knowledge. The product
will be especially useful in information-deprived areas (e.g. rural practices);
will advance understanding of how clinicians seek information in practice; and
how to facilitate the process. The lessons learned can be applied to any field
of knowledge requiring both the functions of quickly finding comprehensive
information (synthesis of new and old data) and continuously evaluating the
results of knowledge discovery. Failure to integrate these activities
contributes to a societal disconnect between what we know and what we do.
