Permafrost temperatures at depth represent a systematic running mean of the
temperature history of the permafrost surface. Global changes, such as climatic
warming associated with increasing CO2 content in the atmosphere, are reflected
in the permafrost temperature profiles. A host of serious environmental and
engineering problems that have a substantial impact on the use of polar lands
are associated with thawing permafrost. However, data on the thermal regime of
permafrost in Alaska are very sparse and mostly unusable because of surface
disturbances near the drill holes. This investigation will measure permafrost
temperatures at sixteen undisturbed sites along the trans-Alaska pipeline
corridor which includes Alaska's three major climate and permafrost zones and at
fifteen other widely distributed sites in Alaska. Measurements will include
temperatures in the air, at the ground surface, in the active layer, at the
permafrost table and in the permafrost to depths of 80 meters or more. This
project will also investigate changes in active layer thicknesses and any
thawing at the permafrost table or base.
