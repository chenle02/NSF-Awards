The theoretical study of how stars form from collapsing stellar gas clouds is
fraught with difficulties because of the array of physical processes that affect
the collapse. One such process is the interaction of rapidly infalling gas onto
the star and its surrounding circumstellar disk. The Principal Investigator (PI)
will compute hydrodynamic models of this infall, and the reaction of the disk to
it. The expected results are that the infall energy will be converted to
reradiation disk heating. Ultimately, this heating will stop the infall
entirely. These results will be used to determine how massive a collapsing star
can be. The PI also will determine the effects of the nuclear detonation of
deuterium (heavy hydrogen) within the proto-star, which will lead to revised
estimates of the luminosity distribution of protostars. Finally, the PI will
determine the distribution of masses of young stars, working backwards from the
observed distribution of luminosities of stars in young clusters. All these
computations will aid in the interpretation of the rapidly growing core of data
on young stars and will clarify the physical processes involved as young
"protostars" collapse into visible stars.
