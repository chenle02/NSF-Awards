9605179 Sander This award will support cooperative research between Professor
Leonard Snader of the Department of Physics of the University of Michigan and
Professor David Williams of the Department of Physics of the Australian National
University. They will conduct a series of studies of elastically driven kinetics
and instabilities in thin solid films and lamellar materials, including both
analytic and numerical investigations. The specific phenomena to be studied are:
1) island formation in heteroepitaxy, 2) elastically driven instabilities in
swelling/deswelling of lamellar membrane phases, and 3) strain effects in rod-
coil block copolymer materials.
