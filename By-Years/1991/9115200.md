The Sagehen Creek Field Station is located at an elevation of 2,000 meters in
the Tahoe National Forest on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in
California. Sagehen Creek Station is part of the University of California
Natural Reserve System and is operated by the Department of Forestry and
Resource Management of the University of California, Berkeley. Ecological
research is conducted on the stream and montane forest habitats at the Station,
and the facility has an especially strong record of supporting graduate student
research projects. Dr. Reginald Barrett, Director of the Station, proposes to
upgrade the meteorological monitoring station at Sagehen Creek Field Station.
The Station has operated a U.S. Weather Service recording station for 38 years,
and the requested upgrade would replace obsolete equipment and establish the
ability to transfer data from removable EPROM storage packs to a microcomputer.
The proposed meteorological station improvement would increase the reliability
and continuity of the weather data being recorded at the Station. Many research
projects would benefit directly from this improvement, as would the region's
weather database.//
