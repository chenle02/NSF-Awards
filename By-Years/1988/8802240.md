This award supports cooperative research on communication and information
theory by William Pearlman and John B. Anderson of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute and Weiler A. Finamore of the Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de
Janeiro. The proposed research will advance our knowledge in areas of data
compression and bandwidth-efficient modulation. The work will be divided between
efficient digital representation of information generated by analog sources and
the development of modems which use continuous-phase modulation. The latter is
one the latest innovations in digital information transmission. This work brings
together two leading research groups in the two countries. Dr. Pearlman is well-
known for his work on quantization and new structures for optimal source codes
and Dr. Finamore has contributed to the subjects of coded modulation and source
coding. The collaboration should benefit the scientific efforts of both
countries leading to advancements in theoretical knowledge and practical
applications as well.
