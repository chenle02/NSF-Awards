This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduate
Site in Archaeology through Kenyon College. The Site is designed to provide
eight highly motivated undergraduates with the opportunity to develop their
skills as archaeological field scientists while working within the context of
the Naco Valley Archaeological Project, NW Honduras. The project focuses on
student conduct of a significant independent investigation, from enunciation of
hypothesis to final write-up, supported by in-field class instruction and a
living and working situation between students and research leaders on
independent research projects. This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences.
