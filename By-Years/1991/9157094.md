The proposed research focuses on the use of laser-based diagnostic techniques
for studying spray dynamics and mixing in internal combustion engines. The
state-of-the-art of laser diffraction particle sizing and phase/doppler particle
anemometry for liquid phase characterization and infrared spectroscopy for fuel
vapor measurements will be advanced in this study. The goals of the research
include development of guidelines on manufacturing tolerances and design changes
to optimize injection strategies for enhanced performance and improved emission
control, detailed data required to verify engine combustion models, and the
correlation of detailed spray characteristics to engine-out emissions. This work
will involve detailed in-cylinder studies of emission formation mechanisms from
fuel injector sprays, many of which are poorly understood, and will begin to
help in designing combustion engines for emission control.
