The primary aim is the development of an economical synthesis of high
temperature refractory materials such as titanium, silicon and aluminum nitrides
through gas phase combustion processes that have sufficient energy release to
sustain the formation of the refractories without the need for external heating.
Thermodynamic calculations performed for a variety of initial temperature and
pressures have indicated that "thermite" types of reactions can generate high
yields of refractory product. An experiment in which a column of metallic sodium
would be burned in a flowing atmosphere of nitrogen and gaseous metallic
chloride will be used to verify if equilibrium thermodynamics do in fact
determine the product distribution of the reactions. This one year award is to
determine the overall process characterization as well as its potential for the
economical manufacturing of ceramics. If the preliminary experiments support the
efficacy of these types of reactions, two implementation steps will be submitted
for later NSF funding. First a sodium spray system would be built so that
droplets of sodium could be reacted more efficiently in the flowing nitrogen and
metallic chloride atmosphere. An additional experiment that uses the stirred
reactor conditions of a rocket engine to promote the heat feedback necessary for
sustaining the continuous chemical reaction of titanium and nitrogen alone and
for increasing as well the refractory product yield economically would be also
proposed.
