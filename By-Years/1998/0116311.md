0116311&lt;br/&gt;Bogue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant, made through the Major
Research Instrumentation Program, funds the acquisition of a 2-G Enterprises
755R superconducting rock magnetometer system (SRM) for the paleomagnetic
laboratory in the new Physics, Earth, and Environmental Science Center at
Occidental College. The SRM will replace an aging spinner fluxgate magnetometer
and allow rapid measurement of the remanence of both strongly- and weakly-
magnetized geological samples. It will primarily be used by the PIs and
undergraduate research assistants for projects concerning the tectonics of
western North America, the magnetostratigraphy of Pacific coast Cenozoic
sections, and the behavior of the geomagnetic field during polarity transitions.
The Occidental College paleomagnetic laboratory will also be available for use
by researchers and students from other institutions. In particular, the PIs
anticipate relieving some of the pressure on Dr. Joseph Kirschvink's heavily-
used lab at the California Institute of Technology. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
