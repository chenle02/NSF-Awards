Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) The goal of this project is to adapt the
work of other researchers to improve the delivery of electronics lecture and
laboratory content in the Electronics & Computer Technology (ECT) for students
enrolled in Industrial Technology.

The project is creating online lecture and laboratory materials for an upper
division electronics course in control systems. The project is (1) revising the
lecture and laboratory content to be in line with theories of effectiveness in
web-based instruction (Fisher & Nygren in 2000 and Shiratuddin, Hassan and
Landoni in 2003); (2) developing multimedia lecture materials using WebCT
(Sharer & Frisbee in 2003); (3) revising the laboratory activities to integrate
an electronics kit so that students can complete ten laboratory exercises
following the model established by Wang (2003); (4) adapting the curriculum
materials to be in line with research on learning styles of women and minority
students; (5) and integrating LabVIEW and Multisim into the class to provide the
students with realistic, industry-based simulation experiences.

The program is building upon a problem-based learning initiative at San Jose
State University, which uses mobile technologies to transform the learning
environment. Students' performance using this curriculum will be compared with
students who are enrolled in a traditional laboratory that uses electronic test
equipment. The project is developing methodologies that target the learning
styles of minority and women students because approximately two-thirds of
undergraduates in the Electronics and Computer Technology program are identified
as having non-White ethnicity.
