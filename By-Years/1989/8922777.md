This project studies the cyclic behavior of reinforced concrete walls coupled
with steel beams. Little information is available about such composite
constructions which have seen increased application in the nation's seismic
zones. The research undertaken in this project involves design, construction,
experimental testing, and analytical study of composite coupled walls, i.e.
reinforced concrete walls coupled by structural steel beams. Isolated
connections representing a subassemblage of one-half of a reinforced concrete
wall pier, one-half of a steel coupling beam,and part of floor slab will be
subjected to cyclic lateral loads simulating earthquake effects. Effects of
axial load on the boundary element, floor slab, and the lateral load intensity
will be the primary variables. The study will lead to the establishment of
design guidelines for this composite structural system.
