Abstract

Proposal: DMS 9803399 Principal Investigator: Jie Qing

The proposed project consists of two related research topics. The first is
focused in the investigations in developing and using nonlinear analysis of
partial differential equations to study formations of singularities in various
problems, arising from theoretical physics mostly in differential geometrical
settings, including harmonic maps, Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, harmonic map flows,
and curvature driven flows. The main approach is based on scaling methods. One
problem that I am working on now is to understand some finer structure of the
compactified spaces of solutions (harmonic maps). This is an essential problem
for one to understand the formation and nature of singularities. The second part
is the investigation of the interplay of geometry and analysis. The central
problems are to understand the best constants in sharp Sobolev type inequalities
in terms of the isoperimetric constants, and to understand how the local
analytic quantities are related to the global geometry even the topology. One of
the approach is to study the spectral theory of various natural differential
operators associated with the geometry, especially the conformally covariant
geometric differential operators.

The formation and nature of singularities in nature are of enormous interests to
human beings. The kind of singularities that will be studied in the proposed
project are particularly of great interests to the material sciences and
meteorology. For instance, the formation and nature of singularities in
Ginzburg-Landau problems as a particular case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory was
proposed to study super-conductivity and other super-fluids phenomena. The
effect of the scale that one uses to describe the system turns out to be very
important. This explains that to understand anything that survives under changes
of scales is very crucial. Therefore our main approach is based on the scaling
methods. The second research topics in the proposed project is basically aiming
at developing and understanding some mathematical tools that are expected to be
essential for the first topics. The proposed project is also closely tied with
the graduate program in the department of Mathematics at UCSC by a plan to
generate research activities to the benefit of graduate student interested in
this area.
