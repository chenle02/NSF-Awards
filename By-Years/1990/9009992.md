Production of pharmaceutical and fine chemicals ("secondary metabolites") from
plant tissue culture has been recognized as a worthwhile objective for many
years, but the potential of this technology has been limited. A major reason is
the genetic instability of cell culture for continuous production on a large
scale. A novel plant culture system is "hairy" root cultures. The PI has
established in her laboratory productive and stable "hairy" root cultures for
Catharanthus roseus (periwinkle). The proposed research involves investigating
the metabolism of hairy root cultures in order to understand the factors which
limit production of secondary metabolites. Growth kinetics and alkaloid
production will be monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
for different hairy root clones in flask cultures. The physiological state and
carbon flows of the cell culture will be monitored noninvasively in a perfusion
reactor by 31P and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This dual
approach will enhance fundamental understanding of the metabolic cellular
processes limiting alkaloid production.
