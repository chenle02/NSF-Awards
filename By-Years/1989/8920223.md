The University of Chicago in collaboration with Princeton University, AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories and other institutions, will establish a Science and
Technology Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica. The Center will be
directed by Professor D. A. Harper. Infrared and submillimeter astronomy have
the potential for unlocking some of the major questions concerning the formation
of the Universe, including inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background
radiation, the processes by which stars form from interstellar gas, the
formation of planets, the observation of primeval galaxies, and the
inhomogeneous distribution of matter and energy in the early Universe. The goal
of the Center is to establish an observatory at the South Pole with three major
instruments designed to probe the far reaches of the Universe at wavelengths
ranging from 2 to 3000 microns. Three experiments will be set up as follows:
ASTRO (Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory) will use a 1.7
meter diameter submillimeter telescope whis is already being built to make a
survey of the Galactic plane, the Galactic Center and the Magellanic Clouds
using the emission from the fine-structure line of carbon at 609 microns and the
line of carbon monoxide at 650 microns. SPIREX (South Pole Infrared Explorer)
will use an existing 60 centimeter diameter near-infrared telescope to explore
the potential of the South Pole as an infrared site and to make initial deep 2.4
micron continuum surveys for primeval galaxies and brown dwarf stars. This
spectral window is also located within a "hole" in the celestial background and
may afford the most sensitive view of light from galaxies forming in the early
universe. At this wavelength, a South Pole telescope will be more sensitive than
the Hubble telescope and 200 times more sensitive than a ground-based telescope
at a mid-latitude site. COBRA (Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy) is an
instrument to be built that will search for and map anisotropies in the Cosmic
Background Radiation on angular scales ranging from 15 arcminutes to 20 degrees
at sufficient sensitivity to definitively test current theories of the origin of
the Universe. The significance of this Center is that it will provide facilities
to enable measurements at wavelengths that are badly hampered by the absorption
and emission of the Earth's atmosphere. Nowhere on Earth are the infrared skies
clearer or darker than above the Antarctic Plateau mainly due to a lack of water
vapor in the air. It will overcome the diurnal variations in temperature that
lead to atmospheric noise and wind at higher latitudes, and much of the infrared
background radiation. (The decrease in environmental temperature from 300K to
210-230 K results in an enormous decrease in background radiation.) The
elevation of the Antarctic plateau will significantly reduce the atmospheric
path the light must traverse. The geographic singularity of a Polar site also
allows a unique opportunity to reduce systematic errors in searches for cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. All these factors should combine to improve
the observing conditions by a factor of 10 to 100.
