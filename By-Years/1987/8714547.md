Research is being carried out on the atmospheric corrosion of metals and
semiconductors. A Kelvin probe has been developed to determine the corrosion
potentials of metal surfaces in humid environments. Very fine Kelvin probes are
used to examine both homogenous and nonhomogeneous metals. Systematic variations
in the corrosion conditions allow determination of the conditions under which
the probes give accurate open-circuit potentials. Mathematical modeling of the
electrochemical process compares predictions with experiment. This creative
research should lead to a marked improvement in our understanding of atmospheric
corrosion, an area of critical importance to the longevity of structural and
electronic systems. The research will create a highly useful probe applicable to
research studies of thin film electrolyte corrosion.
