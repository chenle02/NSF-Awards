The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261-foot,
global class ice-capable, oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part
of the UNOLS fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose platform for
multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate latitudes. The ship
was delivered in 2014 and has completed three years of funded operations. UAF
requests funds to purchase and install shipboard scientific support equipment
that would be custom engineered to enhance the vessel's capability in support of
NSF-sponsored research to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, R/V Sikuliaq completed 271 days, 178 (66%)
of which were for NSF. In 2018, the vessel is scheduled to sail 249 days with
63% (157 days) of the schedule for NSF. With this proposal, UAF provides
technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underwire winch
capability $39,516 &lt;br/&gt;Re-engineering lebus shell $20,000 &lt;br/&gt;Re-
engineering storage drum $124,210 &lt;br/&gt;Dynamometer $5,985 &lt;br/&gt;
$189,711 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
