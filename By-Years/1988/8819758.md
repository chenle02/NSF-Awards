This proposal involves research on phase equilibria in ternary and higher-order
alloy systems. Phase diagrams are calculated employing the combined approach of
experimental research and thermodynamic computation. Stable and metastable phase
equilibria are considered in these studies which are concentrated on the
aluminum-rich corner of the aluminum-lithium- copper phase diagram and the
quaternary system that includes these elements along with magnesium. The
bismuth-lead-tin system is also examined in the program.
