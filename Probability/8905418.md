The principal investigator will be studying a certain class of cellular
automata known as cyclic cellular automata. These are deterministic models which
have qualitative similarities with their stochastic counterpart in interacting
particle systems. The later arise as models of interest to physicists and
biologists. One novel aspect of this study is its experimental use of the
computer to suggest appropriate questions for further study and understanding.
