9321057 Simchon This SBIR Phase II project addresses a modified, augmented
hydrostatic extrusion process for production of very fine wire. Such wire is
used as bonding wire in microchips. With the advent of modern micro-electronics,
the need for gold and aluminum wire of fine diameter has continuously increased.
In the fabrication of very fine wire, severe limits exist on the speed,
reduction per mass, and thinness of the emerging wire. In the Phase I study of
the processes of wire drawing and augmented hydrostatic extrusion (hydraw) of
very fine wire, root causes and the nature of these limitations were studied,
both analytically and experimentally. A modified process for Phase II was
designed according to criteria developed in this study. Wire of 0.5 mil (0.0125
mm) was produced, and experimental quantities of wire were made on laboratory
equipment and tested. The Phase II goal is a production prototype hydraw unit
for 0.5 mil gold and aluminum wire. The prototype machine will be used to study
the reliability and quality of the wire product and economic parameters of the
modified hydraw concept.
