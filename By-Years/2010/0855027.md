trapped in an optical lattice to explore thermopower in the Hubbard model.
Thermoelectric (TE) materials will play a key role in near- and long-term
reliable methods for efficient power generation and cooling in a wide variety of
applications. Material properties such as thermopower and total thermal
conductivity presently limit the efficiency of TE power generation and cooling.
The next revolution in TE power generation is therefore likely to come from
fundamentally new materials having increased thermopower. Extraordinary
thermopower has been observed in Mott-Hubbard (MH) systems, which are the same
materials that give rise to high-temperature superconductivity. Unfortunately,
no complete, predictive theory for thermopower in MH systems exists, and
optimizing these materials for TE applications is therefore a daunting
challenge. Ultra-cold 40K atoms trapped in an optical lattice will be used to
simulate thermopower in the Hubbard model, which is the paradigm for MH
materials. Techniques will be developed to enable measurements of the impact of
material parameters, temperature, doping, and nanoscale morphology on
thermopower. These studies will be used to advance understanding of thermopower
in the MH systems through comparisons with theory and experiments on
materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transferring knowledge gained using this system
to the design of new materials may enable more efficient vehicles requiring less
fuel, refrigeration competitive with conventional technology, and lighter
nuclear payloads for RTGs. The next generation of engineers and scientists will
be trained on cutting edge technologies in laser science; high frequency
microwave electronics; and high speed, computer-controlled signaling. Students
will also be engaged in developing the emerging interface between condensed
matter and atomic physics.
