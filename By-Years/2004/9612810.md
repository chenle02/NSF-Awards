The PIs will perform a full calibration of a high performance, solid state (CCD)
imaging system using a recently completed calibration laboratory at Utah State
University. They will also make extensive field tests at Bear Lake Observatory,
in conjunction with all-sky NIR imaging and narrow field Michelson
interferometer measurements of the zenith OH emission to characterize the
instrumental response under a range of geophysical conditions. Specialized
software for the automatic control of the camera and for the detailed two-
dimensional spectral analysis of the image data, including the derivation of
temperature maps, will be developed. Finally, the PI will conduct an
observational program for the entirety of the project, including measurements
with the MSX satellite, and culminating in a series of novel observations
investigating short period mesospheric gravity wave temperature and intensity
characteristics and their seasonal behavior at mid-latitudes.
