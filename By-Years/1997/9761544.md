*** 9761544 Park The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop core software modules for burr prediction in metal cutting, which
are part of an integrated suite of specialized software tools for design and
manufacturing. These tools are aimed at 1) predicting and minimizing buff
formation in machining and 2) selecting and planning deburring operations, based
upon these predicted buff characteristics. Buff prediction models and
corresponding model-driven burr prediction software modules will be developed.
These modules (one for milling and another for drilling) will serve as the basic
buff prediction engines of the "Edge Finishing Master", a comprehensive burr
minimization and deburring process planning software tool. This software will
support the design for manufacturability of mechanical components by introducing
burr minimization during design and process planning. Potential commercial
applications are expected in industries with burr problems. These manufacturing
industries include aerospace, automotive, computer components, biomedical,
chemical, heavy equipment, and optical. This software is will be integrated with
commercial computer-aided design (CAD) packages, commercial process planning
packages, and commercially available tooling and material databases. The burr
prediction and minimization capabilities of this software can be utilized in the
early design and process planning stages of a part, allowing the maximum
flexibility for adjustments to the part design and manufacturing plan before
major resources have been committed. ***
