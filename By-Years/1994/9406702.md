ABSTRACT The research deals with the development of a hybrid rotor for
continuous field-flow fractionation (FFF). By combining conventional
sedimentation with FFF in a two-dimensional system, a rotor whose selectivity is
proportional to the square of the centrifugal field can be designed in
principle. However, problems with flow instability have hindered the rotor
development. The primary objective of the research is to establish whether the
rotor can be operated without centrifugal instability. Linear stability theory
will be used to determine the conditions for the onset of instability in terms
of appropriate experimental parameters. If successful, large scale fractionation
of submicron particles to high purity will become practical using FFF. This
would then have a strong impact on separations technology for submicron
particles, especially for bioprocessing applications.
