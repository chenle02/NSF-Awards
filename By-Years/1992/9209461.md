ABSTRACT Acquiring the syntactic code that mediates between sound and meaning
is one of the primary tasks that children face in learning language. In inducing
such a code children must use information available in the speech that they hear
and the events that they witness in combination with preprogrammed constraints
on syntactic hypotheses. The process of induction has come to be called
"bootstrapping" in the acquisition literature. Previously, the speech streem has
been largely overlooked as a potential source of information about linguistic
structure. Recently, however, an increasing number of scholars in a range of
disciplines have begun to investigate the relationship between input speech and
the acquisition of syntax. These researchers include theoretical and
computational linguists, acousticians, speech pathologists, and psychologists
and cognitive scientists specializing in speech perception and language
acquisition. Unfortunately, most of these researchers work in relative
isolation, having little opportunity for contact with those from other
disciplines. It is time to bring them together, that they might share insights
and chart directions for future research in this vitally important new area of
research. PIs Morgan and Demuth are therefore organizing a working conference on
bootstrapping from speech to syntax. The proceedings of the conference will be
published.
