DMS9632726 Takesaki, Masamichi This proposal would provide participant support
costs only for US participants in the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar, an
ongoing and very successful yearly seminar. "Operator algebras" is a very
exciting area of research that accounts for about half of the funding in my part
of the analysis program. One of the organizers, Vaughan Jones, received a Fields
Medal in 1990 for his work in this area. This is a very cost effective way to
promote research in this important area and to encourage reciprocal
relationships with our Canadian colleagues.
