Abstract

Award: DMS 1604241, Principal Investigator: Michael Kapovich

Groups appear naturally as symmetries of geometric and physical objects, like
wall-patterns, minerals, snowflakes and, ultimately, the entire universe. This
project studies relation between algebraic properties of groups and geometry of
spaces for which groups appear as symmetries. Another part of the project deals
with geometry of mechanical devices such as bar-and-joint mechanisms and gear
trains. The project will involve rigorous mathematical definitions of such
devices and analysis of possible motion spaces (configuration spaces) of the
devices.

This project is a continuation of the principal investigator's research of
previous years in the areas of geometry, topology, geometric group theory and
theory of mechanical devices. The subjects of the planned research revolve
around geometry of group actions on various spaces, geometry of buildings,
interactions of algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and geometric group
theory. Another part of the project deals with geometry of mechanical devices
such as gear trains. The goal here is to give mathematical definition of such
devices, generalizing the definition of a mechanical linkage as a finite metric
graph and proving a universality theorem for configuration spaces of these
devices, namely that any algebraic partial differential relation can be realized
as the configuration space of some device.
