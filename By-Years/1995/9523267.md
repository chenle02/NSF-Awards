9523267 Karady Insulator contamination cases frequent flashovers near coastal
and industrial areas. This problem occurs in transmission lines as well as in
substations. Currently, there are no reliable methods available for monitoring
pollution build-up and predicting imminent flashover. The aim of this project is
to develop a sensor system that monitors pollution build-up and that would alert
operators when there is danger of flashover. Preliminary laboratory studies were
performed at ASU and discharge current signatures were analyzed using the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT). Visual manifestations were recorded simultaneously with
the current signature. It was found that surface discharges have distinct stages
of development. Although the amplitude of current changes continuously, the
harmonic content (signature) consistently indicated the status of discharge. It
was observed that approaching flashover modifies the harmonic content. These
findings suggest that flashover can be predicted by signature analysis of the
leakage current. The concept is to select an exposed insulator in each area and
monitor the leakage current through the insulator. The leakage current will be
digitized and signature analysis will be performed. A change in signature
indicates approaching flashover. First, different signature analysis methods
will be tested in a laboratory to determine which one produces reliable
flashover indication. After the method is identified and tested, a sensor system
will be built to perform this signature analysis continuously. It is foreseen
that the system will include a broad-band (20Hz-100kHz) currently sensor, a
microprocessor and a transmitter. Leakage current will be continuously digitized
and 50-100 cycles will be put in temporary storage. The stored data will be
analyzed and if no signature change occurs, the data will be discarded. A
signature change will trigger a transmitter that will alert an operator.
Different levels of ala rm will be used. ***
