8905878 Symes This project will address three questions in the area of inverse
problems for hyperbolic equations: The degree to which regularity propagates
according to bicharacteristic geometry for equations with nonsmooth
coefficients, the well-posedness and computability via Newton-type algorithms
for constrained optimization problems, and the characterization and computation
of solutions for weakly convex optimization problems. The mathematics developed
here will be used to determine the interior structure of the earth from
seismological data. This is very useful in determining the location of natural
resources without the expensive boring of wells.
