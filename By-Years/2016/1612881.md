The requested funding will be used to continue providing guidance on major
ocean-related science, engineering, and policy issues to the federal ocean
agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The Ocean Studies Board
(OSB) is the focal point within the NRC for ocean-related science, engineering,
and policy issues. The board explores the science, policies, and infrastructure
needed to understand, manage, protect, and restore coastal and marine
environments and resources. The board exercises leadership within the ocean
community by helping identify and communicate the needs of the field, responds
to specific requests from government agencies and Congress, and oversees a
variety a study projects related to ocean science and engineering and their
impacts on policy. The operations of OSB are funded by a number of federal
agencies, including the ONR, NOAA, USGS, and NASA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSB strives to increase public awareness of
ocean issues, to support ocean science education, and to enhance the
dissemination and impact of OSB reports. The OSB also supports the recruitment
of minorities into the earth sciences through participation in mentoring and
fellowship programs. To further outreach and dissemination, The OSB provides
report-in-briefs, a short summary (4-6 pages) of the key issues in reports;
booklets on ocean themes (Ocean Science Series; Ocean Acidification, Scientific
Ocean Drilling); and brief overviews of new reports and ongoing activities
through the production of a biennial report.
