Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
the University of Cincinnati and Cairo University is in the general area of
polymer chemistry. Project funding will enable Dr. Mohammed A. Sharaf, a highly
qualified researcher from Cairo University, Egypt, to spend approximately two
months in the laboratory of Dr. James E. Mark at the University of Cincinnati.
Dr. Mark and two of his research team will visit and work at Dr. Sharaf's
laboratory in Cairo for various periods of time. This collaborative research
project will investigate theoretical approaches in the area of rubberlike
elasticity in order to elucidate the reinforcing effects of fillers in
elastomers of commercial interest. This project in polymer chemistry fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
