Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit community based
program which encourages young minority and female students to pursue careers in
science, mathematics, and technology. At its current two sites, located in
Brooklyn, New York, approximately 400 students, ages six to eighteen, are
enrolled in programs where they take accelerated courses in biology, chemistry,
physical science, rocketry, oceanography, botany, and advanced mathematics.
Classes, which are presented within the cultural and linguistic understanding of
minority children, provide students with an opportunity to recognize the
relationship of science, mathematics, and technology to their everyday lives.
The SSC proposes to replicate its present programs, establishing three
additional sites in the New York City area in three years. The SSC also proposes
to establish a systematic replication program which would assist other
communities, both regional and national, to establish their own SSCs. This
project would require a resource person to guide communities in all aspects of
program development. To assist in that effort, SSC proposes development of
comprehensive educational and administrative manuals as well as the preparation
of accompanying training and profile videos. Finally, the SSC proposes to
develop a research module in software and manual form which would assess and
track student learning, school performance, performance on standardized exams,
career aspiration and selection, and student attitudes in a community based
science program targeting minority students.
