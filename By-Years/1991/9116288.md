Previous research has demonstrated the widespread occurrence of microbially
mediated aerobic and anaerobic diagenesis within marine carbonate frameworks
such as coral reefs. In these sedimentary systems, advective and turbulent water
flow, rather than diffusion, dominates the exchange of dissolved material
between the framework interstitial water and the overlying seawater.
Nevertheless, diagenesis is rapid enough to result in elevated concentrations of
end products such as inorganic nutrients and H2S. The overall fluxes of
diagenetic end products from a reef framework to the neighboring environment
will be determined. Work will be done to 1) extend the spatial scale of the
interstitial water sampling at Checker Reef, Oahu to examine in detail the upper
1 m of the reef framework; 2) directly measure the advective and diffusive
fluxes of diagenetic reactants and products between the reef framework and the
surrounding environment at several points across the reef; 3) collect data to
calibrate a hydrological model of the advection of interstitial water within the
reef; 4) continue measurements of the spatial and temporal distribution or
inorganic and organic diagenetic reactants/products within the reef, with
particular attention to short-chain organic nitrogen compounds; and 5) use the
concentration data from item 4) with the hydrological model to estimate the
rates of organic and inorganic diagenetic reactions occurring within the reef
framework.
