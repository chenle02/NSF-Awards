This award funded by the Chemistry Division renews support for the Laser
Research Facility (LRF) at the Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory at MIT directed
by Professor Michael S. Feld. The LRF is a shared research facility in which
physical scientists in chemistry, physics, biology and engineering pursue a
broad range of problems using lasers and state-of-the-art spectroscopic
techniques. The research is focussed in five areas: multidimensional infrared
spectroscopy, high sensitivity spectroscopy for combustion and environmental
science, spectroscopy of nanomaterials, proton-coupled electron transfer, and
biological spectroscopy.

The Laser Research Facility features training for undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students as well as outreach through dissemination of scientific
results, topical seminars, and links with local schools. The Laser Research
Facility, as a shared facility with state-of-the-art equipment and personnel
skilled in its use, enables new research opportunities to be seized upon and
carried out quickly, economically, and effectively. It leads to new
collaborations and research programs that would not exist in the absence of the
facility, sometimes resulting in significant discoveries that are unanticipated.
