***&lt;br/&gt;9722552&lt;br/&gt;Calaprice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detector of
solar neutrinos will be constructed for the purpose of measuring the flux of
neutrinos from the decay of beryllium-7 in the solar interior. This decay rate
is central to understanding the reactions thought to power the sun. The detector
is based on the use of approximately 100 tons of liquid scintillator to detect
recoil electrons following neutrino-electron interaction in the detector volume.
A large array of photomultiplier tubes will sense the light produced in the
liquid scintillator by the recoil electron. Because of the very low rate of
events, great attention will be paid to reducing backgrounds from cosmic rays
and naturally occurring radioisotopes in the detector proper and the surrounding
material. In order to reduce cosmic ray backgrounds, the detector will be
located underground. The site chosen is the Gran Sasso underground tunnel in
Italy. Construction of this detector, known as Borexino, is an international
project involving Italy, Germany, and the US. Results from this experiment will
test the standard solar model and help place constraints on the mass of the
neutrino. These topics are of great current scientific interest because of
earlier results which hint at a substantial reduction in the solar neutrino flux
due to neutrino mass and oscillations which are thought to take place in the sun
whereby neutrinos change from one so-called flavor into another, i.e. from an
electron neutrino into a muon or tau neutrino. The joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science
Advisory Committee highlighted this science in its 1996 Long Range Plan.
Education of students and postdocs is a strong component of this experimental
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Division
of Physics, Division of Astronomy and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
