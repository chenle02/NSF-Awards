This project seeks to organize a workshop to address the question of how Cloud
Computing is impacting, and potentially disrupting, academic research computing
on campuses all across the nation. The workshop will bring together campus
researchers, Chief Information Officers, Chief Research Officers, Chief Science
Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, and Chief Financial Officers from
campuses all across the country to discuss this important question. Through
exploration of the evolving nature of academic research computing over time, the
workshop will explore topics and challenges in academic research computing in a
variety of contexts, including applications, support, data movement,
administrative, legal, and financial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the
workshop will be a set of white papers which will inform the compilation of a
final report. This final report will elucidate key issues and recommendations
surrounding Cloud Computing and its research implications, while presenting
recommendations on how this activity could be supported by funding agencies
moving forward.
