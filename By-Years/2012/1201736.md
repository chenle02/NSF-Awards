Spectral Theory for Singular Integrals, Validated Numerics and Elliptic Problems
in non-Lipschitz Polyhedra: Research and Outreach.

Abstract of Proposed Research Irena Mitrea

This project is for research and education centering on the use of harmonic
analysis to study elliptic partial differential equations in non-Lipschitz
domains and related questions concerning singular integrals with rough kernels.
A particular interest is to use validated numerics and global optimization
techniques to help develop computer-aided proofs of basic results.

The results of this research may have many applications in science and
engineering as well as in the numerical analysis of these problems. The PI will
also develop a summer program for undergraduates that provides an introduction
to research in these areas and develop courses and seminars for graduate
students interested in these topics.
