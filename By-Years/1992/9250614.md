Engineering and industrial design students at the Rochester Institute of
Technology are developing their design projects using stereolithographic
techniques for rapid prototyping. With stereolithography, students build mock-
ups of their designs, evaluate their fit, style, and capabilities, and make
modifications and changes quickly and inexpensively. This allows the development
of a design project through its most critical phase - the transformation from a
concept to a three- dimensional CAD model, and then to a prototype for testing
and evaluation - enhancing the creative and productive capabilities of the
students. The three-dimensional model is obtained using existing computer-aided
design and drafting (CADD) systems. Students experiment with models they design
and build using the flow visualization equipment in a wind tunnel, in projects
in their fluid mechanics and aerospace courses. In other design courses,
stereolithography allows iterative modifications of designs. Industrial Design
students make complex physical parts for evaluation. With stereolithography,
they can explore unusual and creative designs with graceful, sweeping shapes,
smooth bends, and rounded corners.
