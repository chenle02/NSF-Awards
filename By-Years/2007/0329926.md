P.I. Chase (SUNY-SB) Proposal #: 0329926&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:
SENSORS: Autonomous Analyzers for Toxic Metals in the Marine Environment
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt; The PIs propose to design and
field-test in situ autonomous sensors for three marine pollutants: copper, zinc
and cadmium. Objectives for the sensors include the ability to accurately
measure concentrations in the range of 0.5-250 nM with a precision of at least
6%. These proposed sensors will be based on the well-tested DigiSCAN technology
developed in the Chemical Sensors lab at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute (MBARI) and currently being commercialized by YSI. This is a
versatile, compact sensor system for in situ wet chemistry that uses micro
solenoid pumps for sample uptake and reagent dispensing. To date, DigiSCAN has
been configured for colorimetric detection of nitrate and phosphate. The work
outlined in this proposal aims to adapt this instrumentation to utilize
published chemiluminescent (Cu) and fluorometric (Zn and Cd) detection methods
for copper, zinc and cadmium. Specifically, this will: (1) construct
chemiluminescent (PMT) and fluorometric detectors for DigiSCAN, (2) adapt
published flow injection analysis methods for Cu, Zn and Cd analysis to the
DigiSCAN hardware, and (3) deploy the instrument in anthropogenically impacted
and relatively pristine coastal environments. This development will also enable
the analysis of other metals such as iron and cobalt (chemiluminescence) as well
as other analytes of interest such as ammonia and aluminum
(fluorescence).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
