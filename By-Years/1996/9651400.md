The Biology Department has recently revised its Bachelor of Science degree
program in Biology to include a concentration in Environmental Biology and to
incorporate a field internship/research component. To support the new
concentration, the department is restructuring its course in Ecology developing
new upper-level courses in Environmental Biology, including a course on
Biomonitoring and Water Pollution. The revised Ecology course emphasizes the
principles of sampling, data collection, analysis, and presentation in a 6-week
investigation of Carver Pond in Bridgewater using continuous recording field
water quality probes. This presentation serves as the background database of the
dynamics of a local ecosystem that students use to study patterns of change in
biotic communities within and surrounding Carver Pond. The new course in
Biomonitoring and Water Pollution involves upper-level students in a semester-
long field and laboratory investigation of stress indicators in fish and
macroinvertebrate communities of a local river system. This project makes use of
new equipment to support the investigative undergraduate laboratory experience
in the revised Ecology course and the ecosystem stress investigation in the
Biomonitoring course. The major equipment items needed to support these
undergraduate research experiences include a single-channel Auto Analyzer II
Continuous Flow Autoanalyzer with a TAOS Operating System for data acquisition
and graphical analysis, Hydrolab recording environmental sondes to continuously
monitor water quality changes occurring in a local pond, and a Doppler flow
meter for improved discharge measurements for loading calculations.
