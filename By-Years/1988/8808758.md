Computational neuroscience is a subfield which is growing quickly at the
present time. Putting what we know about the functioning of the nervous system
into quantitative terms is becoming more appealing now that computers are
affordable, easy to work with and sufficient data has been gathered about the
systems in question. Mathematical models of various parts of the nervous system
are currently being pursued by physiologists well trained in engineering
methodology. But now engineers have taken an interest in modelling the various
systems of the brain using their perspective. This action is to provide partial
support for an international conference which will bring together
neurophysiologists and neuroengineers from various countries to discuss
important issues regarding modelling approaches in neuroscience.
