This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will provide
new methods for decision-support of healthcare operations in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Because the coronavirus is highly contagious and results in
severe disease in a relatively high percentage of those infected, healthcare
resources, particularly hospital beds and essential personnel, are expected to
be at or beyond capacity at the height of the epidemic. This project develops
quantitative methods to estimate how interventions such as screening and
surveillance via telemedicine and offsite testing and diagnosis can reduce the
load on hospital personnel. The models developed are expected to improve the
ability of hospital decision makers to predict equipment needs to ensure
critical hospital personnel are protected and able to provide effective in-
patient treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award supports fundamental
research in methods to integrate a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-
infected (SEIRI) virus transmission model with a risk-averse sequential
operational planning model for patient beds, staffing and personal protective
equipment (PPE) in hospitals. The operational planning model comprises a
stochastic optimization model that includes deployment of telemedicine for
initial screening and surveillance, drive-through testing for diagnosis, and in-
patient hospital care for those with severe disease. The project represents a
tight collaboration between the PIs and Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ). The
model parameters will be updated dynamically using MCJ data as part of a pilot
project, and once tested, the decision-support system will be made available
online for other hospitals in the nation and the world to
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
