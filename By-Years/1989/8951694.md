A six-axis industrial robot is being introduced into the manufacturing component
of the mechanical engineering curriculum. In addition to the robot, a personal
computer-based robot control software system and a high-speed personal computer
workstation are being integrated into required design-oriented courses. The
project complements the current Computer-Aided Engineering Laboratory and
provides an industrial-scale computer integrated manufacturing environment for
mechanical engineering students. This project is being matched by an amount
equal to the award.
