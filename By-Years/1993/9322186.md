9322186 Kunz This award provides funds to continue a successful REU SITE at
Boston University. Five cross-disciplinary, team-oriented projects will provide
each group of two students with opportunities to work closely with two
experienced faculty mentors on a collaborative project. The emphasis on this REU
Site project is to promote collaborative research among students and research
biologists whose disciplines have traditionally focused on different sub-
disciplines. Collaborative research topics include: expression of bacterial
proteins, mechanisms of gene induction in retinal cells, hormonal responses to
stress in bats, kinship and population processes in voles, and termite foraging
ecology and wood chemistry. Faculty mentors have been carefully selected on the
basis of their experience with undergraduates in the classroom, research
contacts with undergraduates, and their own scholarly contributions. Five
students will be selected from regional, four-year colleges that do not provide
significant opportunities for research and five will be selected from students
attending Boston University. Recruitment efforts will specifically target
minority, women, and physically-challenged students. Selection procedures will
be based on scholarly aptitude, research potential, and previous experience. An
ethics component with weekly seminars on topics such as ethical treatment of
animals, record keeping and data management, values and integrity in science,
responsibility of authorship, and reporting and investigating allegations of
misconduct. This ethics component will be shared with REU students from
Wellesley College and the University of Massachusetts (Boston Campus), and joint
seminars, activities, and field trips have been planned in collaboration with
REU programs at these regional institutions. ***
