This project provides support for two workshops at the National Science
Foundation in&lt;br/&gt;August 2003, a workshop August 5-6, 2003 addressing
problems of on-going placement issues for students in the Scholarships for
Service (SFS) program and a workshop August 7-8, 2003 addressing national
cybersecurity workforce needs and educational innovation. It includes pre-,
post-, and onsite support for travel and lodging planning and workshop logistics
and for post-workshop support in editing and disseminating workshop results.
This project is important because it will allow the experiences of current
institutional awardees to inform and improve the framework governing the future
awards in the SFS program. It will allow society to fully benefit from a more
secure computing infrastructure by ensuring that qualified graduates are more
properly and efficiently placed in government service.&lt;br/&gt;
