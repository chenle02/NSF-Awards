This is a proposal for a workshop on the emerging new area, Cloud Robotics. The
integration of&lt;br/&gt;robots into the Cloud holds the promise of giving
unprecedented computation and memory&lt;br/&gt;resources to the robots. In
parallel, robots can augment Cloud applications by giving them
the&lt;br/&gt;power to collect data on demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will bring together robotics, cloud computing and big-data researches to
explore&lt;br/&gt;the opportunities and challenges in Cloud Robotics.
