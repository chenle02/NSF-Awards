This CAREER project focuses on fundamental physics research at the interface of
quantum field theory, general relativity and string theory. A main theme in this
study is supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is one of the best motivated candidates
for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and it has many
important applications. The PI plans to use supersymmetry and other techniques
to address open problems in three main directions of research: (1) exploring
quantum gravity with black holes and the gauge-gravity correspondence; (2)
investigating scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity; and (3)
studying models of supersymmetry breaking and their phenomenological
consequences. The work is relevant because it addresses fundamental questions in
physics and because understanding supersymmetry breaking could be central for
the discovery of new elementary particles in collider
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact component of the project
involves the training of students, a women-in-physics program, and public
lectures. An exchange program between the University of Michigan and the women's
college Bryn Mawr will be initiated to encourage the involvement of women in
physics research. It will involve research seminars at both institutions and
possible new collaborations. The public lectures will be pedagogical lectures on
the PI's research and they will be presented as part of the Saturday Morning
Physics series hosted by the Department of Physics at the University of
Michigan.
