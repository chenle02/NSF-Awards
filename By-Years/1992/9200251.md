This workshop proposal will bring together US and Soviet experts for purposes of
comparing population and sociological data on rural northern settlements in the
Soviet Northeast and Alaska. These data are essential for understanding northern
community viability, and problems such as violence, suicide, life expectancy and
health care delivery. The workshop will be the first significant data exchange
of Arctic demographic and vital statistics between Russian and American
researchers, and will provide a basis for future joint research within this
critical area.
