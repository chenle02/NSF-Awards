funds for 25 U.S. scientists to attend the 21st Texas Symposium on Relativistic
Astrophysics in Florence, Italy, on December 9-13,
2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Symposia take place every other year and
serve as an international summary of recent developments in the main areas of
modern astrophysics, cosmology, and relativity. The biannual meetings are held
in different cities in the U.S., and every second or third meeting is held in a
foreign country. The event in 2002 will take place in Florence, Italy, and will
be sponsored by the newly established National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF),
in collaboration with the National Institute of Nuclear Physics
(INFN).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
