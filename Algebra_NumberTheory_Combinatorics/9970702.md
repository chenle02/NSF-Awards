It is proposed to study several problems related to tight closure, including the
long open question as to whether it commutes with localization, the relationship
of tight closure with Hilbert-Kunz functions, the problem of characterizing
tight closure in equal characteristic zero in new ways that will produce better
insight into the phenomenon, and the central problem of extending the underlying
idea to rings that do not necessarily contain a field, which would solve many
open questions, including the long standing conjecture that regular rings are
direct summands of their module-finite extension rings.

Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying
solutions of many equations in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is
not unique. The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one can
use instead encode all the pertinent information about the equations in abstract
algebraic objects called commutative rings. The two points of view interact in
beautiful and productive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative algebra that
has had explosive development in this decade is the theory of tight closure.
Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system of equations, after
suitable modification, or the ring, modulo many different prime integers. This
is a powerful technique that has solved many problems, while opening up vast new
areas for research.
