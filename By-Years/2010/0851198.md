Drs. Charles Liu (City University of New York (CUNY) - Staten Island) and James
Webster (American Museum of Natural History) will continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the American Museum of Natural
History. The Site will provide opportunities for undergraduates to conduct
experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational research activity in
earth science, planetary science, and astrophysics. Aside from their primary
research activities, students will also participate in Museum programs; attend
field trips and scientific colloquia and, as appropriate, conferences to present
research; and report on their work at the end of their summer experience, in
both a written scientific paper and a 15-minute oral presentation in a
multidisciplinary scientific symposium open to the general public.

The principal investigators will focus particular effort on the inclusion of
CUNY students as participants in this REU site in an effort to attract students
from populations which are currently underserved and underrepresented in the
sciences.
