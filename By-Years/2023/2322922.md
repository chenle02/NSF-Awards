This award supports participation in the Exchange of Mathematical Ideas
Conference which will take place August 11-13, 2023 at the University of
Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, IA. The conference will be the next offering in
the Annual Conference for the Exchange of Mathematical Ideas (EMI) series, which
started in 2012 and has run every year except in 2020 and 2021 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The topic of the this yearâ€™s conference will be Algebra and
related fields.

The 2023 EMI Conference will bring together participants drawn from expert and
seasoned mathematicians pushing the frontiers of research in algebra.
Particpants will have a unique opportunity to: (i) learn about open questions
and promising research directions in algebra and related fields, (ii) share
mathematical ideas, methods, and approaches, (iii) explore new research avenues
and possibilities for collaboration with mathematicians from geographically and
institutionally diverse colleges and universities, (iv) engage in networking
activities with diverse participants, including women, underrepresented
minority, and persons with disabilities, at the same or different levels along
the career ladder, and (v) disseminate research results through a conference
proceeding. In this way, the objectives of the conference align perfectly with
the larger national goal of developing and growing the STEM personnel base, and
mathematics acumen in particular, wherever the potential exists across the
nation. The conference website will be located at the following URL
