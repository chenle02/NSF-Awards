This award supports the convening of a workshop to develop a plan for
&lt;br/&gt;a more comprehensive, integrated approach to quality assurance of the
&lt;br/&gt;Digital Library for Earth System Education's resources. The work will
&lt;br/&gt;begin with a review of current quality assurance policies in DLESE
&lt;br/&gt;and other National STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and
&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics) Digital Library (NSDL) projects with a focus on their
&lt;br/&gt;design, cost, and effectiveness. The broad DLESE community will be
&lt;br/&gt;surveyed to construct a working definition of "a high quality
&lt;br/&gt;educational resource" and identify approaches to quality assurance
&lt;br/&gt;that would stimulate community participation. With this information
&lt;br/&gt;in hand, a group of community members be entrained in developing a
&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive strawman plan. A workshop to reach consensus on the
&lt;br/&gt;plan, which will include recommendations, policies, and specific
&lt;br/&gt;procedures for implementing those policies, will be convened and a
&lt;br/&gt;final report completed and submitted to the DLESE Steering Committee
&lt;br/&gt;for deliberation and ultimate approval. The result will be a
&lt;br/&gt;coherent set of policies and procedures governing quality control
&lt;br/&gt;that represents a consensus of the community.&lt;br/&gt;
