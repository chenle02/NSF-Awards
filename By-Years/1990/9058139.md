Dr. Emlet, working at the University of Southern California, will address the
question of how development and natural selection interact during evolution. He
plans to create the first integrated developmental and evolutionary model for a
marine organism, which could provide insights into why some organisms have
diversified while others have not, as well as how environmental changes effect
short and long term changes in organisms. Using a sea urchin species as a model
organism and techniques he developed to infer mode of larval development in
fossil urchins, Dr. Emlet will determine if the places and times that a
particular type of larval feeding evolved correspond with environmental
conditions that are expected to select for this type of development. He will
also analyze the functional consequences of changes in shape and patterns of
larval ciliation on swimming performance. This experimental work will be the
first to determine quantitatively the functional requirements for developmental
processes which are modified during evolutionary changes in mode of development.
Combining historical and functional approaches may show how and when natural
selection acts through environmental change or functional morphological
requirements to control developmental patterns. Historical analyses may also
show whether developmental patterns influence evolutionary success, measured as
diversification rate.
