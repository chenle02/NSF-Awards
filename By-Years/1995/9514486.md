This award supports Professor Erik Antonsson of California Institute of
Technology, Assistant Professor Kevin Otto of MIT and two graduate students of
Professor Antonsson's to collaborate in fundamental research in manufacturing
engineering with Professors Hans-Juergen Zimmerman and Hans-Juergen Sebastian of
the Department of Operations Research of the Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische
Hochschule Aachen (RWTH-Aachen.) Both groups are utilizing the new mathematics
of `fuzzy sets` to represent intrinsically imprecise information and to
formalize trade-offs between conflicting goals. The US participants will benefit
from joining their expertise in applying fuzzy set theory in Engineering Design
research with the German experience in representing and manipulating imprecision
in Configuration Design. After exploring the commonalities in their approaches,
they expect to integrate them and apply the combined approach to a realistic
industrial problem to test the robustness of the technique. The use of fuzzy set
theory instead of utility theory is a promising new approach to dealing with
decision-making under uncertainty. A unified formal method for configuration and
engineering design could be applied to virtually all engineering design
problems, and ought to reduce engineering design time and increase design
quality, particularly in the design of large, complex systems. Increasing
concurrency (the overlap of work normally done sequentially) in engineering
design has the potential to significantly decrease the time required to create a
successful design.
