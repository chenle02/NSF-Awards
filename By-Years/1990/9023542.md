This research is on models and tools for the design of board-level digital
systems. Research includes: (1) Developing a formal specification language for
board-level systems based on well defined building blocks, where some of the
building blocks are very complex, such as microprocessors. In building the
language, only a few critical component types, including programmable parts, are
being represented rather than representing all possible parts. (2) Finding
simplified models for the board specification and verification processes. The
use of hierarchy in the verification process is being explored through
specifying the actual behavior of an implementation as well as the desired
behavior of the system. Algorithms for timing relationships are being examined
also. (3) Algorithms for layout problems, particularly hierarchal compaction of
circuit layouts and the interaction of placement and detailed routing, are being
investigated. This grant is made under the Faculty Awards for Women Scientists
and Engineers Program.
