Abstract

DMS-0103829 Tanveer



The research focuses on new complex analytic methods exploiting Borel-Laplace
duality to investigate regular and singular properties of solutions to certain
classes of nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential
equations in the complex plane. Problems to be studied include equations arising
in physical applications that at some critical value of a parameter are either
ill-posed in the real domain or are structurally unstable. The methods enable
control over sensitive dependence close to a critical point in the parameter
space.

Many phenomena in nature are modeled by equations that depend sensitively on
parameters. Such equations arise in descriptions of fluid mechanics, crystal
growth and pattern formation. The underlying sensitivity can make such problems
difficult to tackle using computer simulations. It is important to develop
theoretical tools based on mathematical analysis to allow precise understanding
of such phenomena, and our research is geared towards this goal.
