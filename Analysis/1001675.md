This project is concerned with a variety of problems involving the long-time
behavior of solutions to linear and nonlinear wave equations. Such systems arise
in a variety of problems in mathematical physics, including the underlying
geometric field theories of special and general relativity. The basic concern of
this project is to understand the asymptotic behavior of such systems in a wide
range of contexts: from local phenomena such as the spontaneous formation of
singularities, to delicate dispersive properties which take place over infinite
space-time scales. Such questions are among the most central and difficult in
the theory of partial differential equations, and the work proposed here is a
continuation of recent investigations and advances of the principal investigator
on several of the most important problems in geometric wave equations, including
the blowup vs. global regularity question for energy critical wave-maps.

Linear and nonlinear wave equations arise as models in many different areas of
physics, from the underlying classical field theories of electro-magnetism,
elasticity, the equations of linearized gravitational radiation, and the full
Einstein field equations themselves, to many equations of quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. The mathematical issues to be studied by the principal
investigator are all related to the basic question of describing the dynamical
properties such physical systems. Progress on the mathematical understanding of
these systems should lead to better modeling, prediction, and control of the
physical phenomena they govern. The PI plans not only to continue his recent
work, but also to train several new graduate students in this exciting and fast
paced field of study.
