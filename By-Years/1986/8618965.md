This proposal is to further develop the novel backward tracing procedure for
designing preforms utilized as starting stock in the metal forming process. The
procedure uses capability of forward simulation and backward tracing of a
forming process by the finite element method. The investigator's current NSF
grant has laid the foundation for this work and has demonstrated that it is now
possible to investigate preform design and its optimization in the area of
complex thermo-viscoplastic deformation. Investigations are proposed on the
development of criteria and methodology, development of the finite element
method for three dimensional thermo- viscoplastic deformation and implementation
of the backward tracing procedure into the finite element scheme. Specific
applications of the method which will be investigated are preform design in
flashless axisymmetric forging and in three dimensional plate rolling. The
approach is novel. The method should reduce, or eliminate in some cases, the
need of the designer's experience in the designing of preforms. The proposed
approach should open a new avenue for design in future metal forming technology.
