This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science
and Engineering" (NSF 01-157), category NIRT. Novel electrodeposited
nanostructured multilayered alloys for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
will be developed. High sensitivity magnetic sensors and hard materials for
micro-cutting tools and molds will be fabricated. Compositionally modulated
multilayered alloys offer a variety of improved properties including enhanced
giant magnetoresistance for thin film magnetic sensors, and superior hardness
for high aspect ratio microdevice components, compared to their coarser
microstructural counterparts. It is expected that the nanometric feature of the
layers will contribute to a change in the physical properties and
microstructure. Electrochemical processing will be used to fabricate both thin
and thick nanomaterials with pulsed waveforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic,
electronic and mechanical properties will be examined, including electrical
resistivity, magnetoresistivity, DC/AC magnetization and susceptibility, and
hardness.&lt;br/&gt;Investigators at LSU/CAMD, Argonne and Brookhaven National
Labs will work&lt;br/&gt;together towards characterization of the
electrodeposited nanolayered alloys with student&lt;br/&gt;involvement at the
national labs. Student outreach will be conducted through PI participation in
the Society of Women Engineers and the National Organization for the
Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers. The proposed
electrodeposition techniques have the potential to significantly improve the
quality of multilayered nanostructures, especially those with curved and
recessed substrates.&lt;br/&gt;
