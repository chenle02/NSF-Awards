Cosmology is the big-picture study of the universe. One of the most important
means for research in this field is to make careful measurements of the very
faint radiation known as the “cosmic microwave background.” This radiation is
very faint. Also, there are other radiation signals from non-cosmological
sources that must be distinguished. The technology and instrumentation to allow
such experiments to make the needed measurements is a major challenge. Over the
years progress has been made studying ever fainter aspects of this background
radiation that are then used to test competing theoretical models. To enable
such scientific progress, the underlying technologies must be improved further
as will be undertaken in this project. The team will provide instrumentation
training for the next generation of scientists and will leverage this project to
enhance their public education efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks
to develop technology for an enhanced polarimeter to study reionization and
inflation cosmology on the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS). CLASS
is built to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization on
angular scales greater than 10 degrees (corresponding to spherical harmonic
multipole moments near 20). The survey looks to produce a high fidelity
polarization map over 70% of the sky at frequencies near the Galactic foreground
minimum. This project will develop enhanced larger format detector arrays and
silicon optics that will improve CLASS sensitivity to ultimately allow better
understanding of the early universe and fundamental
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
