EIA-0203872 Daniel Menasce George Mason University A Framework for the Dynamic
Composition and Reconfiguration of QoS-Aware Next Generation Software Systems

In large, dynamic, highly distributed, loosely coupled, component-based systems,
it is necessary to use a framework for software system composition and dynamic
reconfiguration that can support the evolution of functional and performance
requirements as well environmental changes (e.g., network, hardware and software
failures). The proposed method by which software systems in these environments
are composed of autonomous components. All components must have several
capabilities (e.g., QoS negotiation, registration, QoS monitoring, etc) that are
identical to all components. What makes a component unique is the set of
services it provides. QoS-based approach , proposed to distribute software
system composition and reconfiguration. Our method uses resource reservation
mechanisms at the component level to guarantee QoS requirements at the software
system level.
