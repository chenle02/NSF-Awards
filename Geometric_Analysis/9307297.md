The research entails applying methods of the Ricci flow to problems in Kaehler
geometry. Particular cases are complete Kaehler manifolds of positive
bisectional curvature and analysis of the Ricci flow method to establish the
existence of Kaehler- Einstein metrics. In addition to this, the investigator
wishes to study questions concerning the existence of Kaehler-Ricci solutions on
Hermitian manifolds.
