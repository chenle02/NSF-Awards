This award supports the research of Professor Yu to work in combinatorics.
Professor Yu proposes to study several fundamental topics in graph theory, some
of which have theoretical interest in other areas of mathematical sciences and
some of which have practical applications. More precisely, he will study the
Hamilton cycle problem and cycle cover problems, the problem of finding certain
types of subgraphs in a given graph, which has applications to network designs,
and the problem of characterizing certain planar graphs. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research. ***
