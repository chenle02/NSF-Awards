The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Iowa will host a
ten week summer REU site. Eight to ten REU students work on a variety of
theoretical and experimental projects in a range of subfields: medical physics,
high energy physics, plasma physics, materials and condensed matter physics,
space physics and astronomy. Students work with leaders in the field on problems
of current interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to involving students in
scientific research with faculty, a range of professional development activities
are scheduled. A major component is a Scientific Communications Program
emphasizing training and practice in written and oral communication.&lt;br/&gt;
