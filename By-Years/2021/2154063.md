The development of extremal and geometric combinatorics has been informed by
questions in a number of areas of mathematics, computer science and other
disciplines. The aim of the project is both to develop general combinatorial
tools of wide applicability and to solve specific combinatorial problems.
Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained during this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific problems to be tackled include
algebraic and geometric questions related to Turan problems and Ramsey theory.
Particular attention will be devoted to algebraic constructions. The aim here is
to understand the apparent rigidity of many known constructions in the area, and
develop more general techniques. It is expected that this will result in forging
the connections between finite geometry and extremal combinatorics closer,
enriching both areas. The project also considers several topics related to words
and subsequences, as well as discrepancy theory. The potential impact includes
better error-correcting codes and numerical
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
