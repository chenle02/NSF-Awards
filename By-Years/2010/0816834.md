Climate change impacts on the earth's ecosystems will affect the daily life of
all Americans. In the face of great uncertainty as to the details of those
effects, policymakers need credible scientific findings to make decisions about
how to respond to climate change. This project involves the continuation of an
eight-year experiment testing how two different predictions for altered rainfall
affect a northern California coastal prairie. An irrigation system adds water to
grassland plots either in the winter (during the current rainy season) or the
spring (extending the rainy season), allowing the researchers to document how
microbes, plants and insects respond to simulated climate change.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This experiment will yield critical information about how
best to manage grassland habitats for forage productivity, animal habitat, and
the survival of rare plant species in the face of ongoing climate change.
Furthermore, the project includes undergraduate researchers, helping to train
the next generation of climate change scientists. Finally, undergraduates headed
for a K-12 teaching career are involved in both the research and in developing
teaching materials based on the project they can use in their future classrooms,
further educating the public about climate change research.
