Standardized test results indicate gender differences in mathematics
achievement on the secondary level, with boys consistently outperforming their
female peers. This study will focus on the talented mathematics student,
enrolled in Advanced Placement BC Calculus. Its objective will be to examine, by
way of a true experiment, gender differences in classroom interaction patterns,
student perceptions of themselves as learners of mathematics, and achievement in
advanced high school mathematics. The uniqueness and import of the project lies
in the random assignment of subjects to single-sex and coeducational classes
following identical curriculum strategies and plans. From the investigation of
differential effects of classroom social environments on adolescent males and
females will come further elucidation of the aids and obstacles to successful
mathematics learning. As a final outcome of the study, those insights will be
translated into practical proposals for general use with students in advanced
mathematics courses on the secondary level.
