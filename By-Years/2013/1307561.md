Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to
elucidate the science underlying the optical properties of nanowires, and to
harness these properties for novel photonic devices. The approach is to develop
the science needed for nanowire-based photodetectors, for filter arrays for
multispectral and polarization imaging, and for plasmonic lasers. The
photodetector and filters will be based upon the recent discovery by the
Principal Investigator's group that vertical silicon nanowires can appear a wide
variety of colors that depend on their radii. The lasers will consist of
nanowires positioned in plasmonic waveguides. Intellectual merit: Due to their
unique attributes, much interest has been paid over the past decade to
semiconducting nanowires. It is somewhat surprising how little attention has
been paid to the dramatic effects that waveguiding and resonance phenomena can
have upon their optical properties. This work will reveal the science, and
demonstrate that these phenomena can be used advantageously for nanowire-based
photonics. Broader impacts: While the proposed program will investigate the
science, it is entirely possible that the devices studied in this work will find
their way, in some form, into commercial products. The work therefore could
contribute to the United States photonics industry. The project also creates not
only the science, but also the human infrastructure required for future
advances. The Principal Investigator will provide training to a diverse range of
undergraduate and graduate students, and will undertake a variety of outreach
efforts in the local community.
