The goal of the project is to study a new family of singular integrals, which
extend the classical commutators of Calderón and the Cauchy integral on
Lipschitz curves. They appear very naturally, when one tries to invent a
calculus that includes operators of multiplication with functions having
arbitrary polynomial growth. One interesting feature of these operators is that
the so called T1 and Tb theorems, so successful in the classical "linear growth
case," can no longer be applied this time, because the corresponding expressions
are far from being BMO functions. The new methods that the investigator plans to
develop in order to understand them, are related to his recent new approach on
Calderón commutators and also to the study of the so called flag paraproducts
that he introduced a few years ago.

The present project lies within the realms of classical analysis, but its
results and methods have potential applications to other mathematical areas as
well, including mathematical physics and partial differential equations. Recent
developments in the study of the water waves certify the existence of such
connections with phenomena in the physical world. As the work progresses, the
investigator intends to give courses to explain the ideas of the project
findings and to involve graduate students in the research.
