This project is the comprehension redesign of the neural simulation toll
referred to as GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System). GENESIS was developed
initially as part of the P.I.'s ongoing efforts to build realistic models of
nervous systems. GENESIS has been made available for use to laboratories outside
Caltech for research and education, and has become an important tool for the
computational neuroscience community. The overall design objective for the
GENESIS project is to provide neurobiologists with a powerful tool for
simulating neruobiological systems, while at the same time promoting the
interactions between different modeling efforts. We will concentrate on two
areas: first we will continue to provide ongoing user support. This includes on-
line services, continued development of documentation, bug fixes, and promotion
of collaborations between GENESIS users and between GENESIS developers. The
second major focus of our activities will be the redesign of GENESIS itself. The
basic software design of the project has not changed substantially since its
inception in 1986. It is now time to completely redesign GENESIS to provide far
more efficient portability across platforms free extensibility and exchange of
code, flexibility lump missing parameters and compartments, and provide
granularity along multiple axes. Achieving these goals should result in a move
useful, more easily federated system which is far less expensive to extend and
maintain. The redesign is beginning by first taking a parallel systems view
point, rather than starting with a sequential platform and later parting to
parallel. This work is supported by the Computational Neuroscience program, and
the neuroscience's cluster (all in Bio). This effort will focus on both support
for parallel architectures as well as new graphics languages.
