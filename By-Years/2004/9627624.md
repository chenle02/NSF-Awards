9627624 Hayden The proposed workshop will be held at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, from 18-20 July 1996. The workshop will 1) detail the
programmatic similarities and differences in Land-Margin Ecosystem Research
(LMER) and the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) programs, 2) evaluate the
scientific merits for a LTER and LMER merger, 3) evaluate the administrative
merits for an LTER and LMER merger, 4) evaluate the special needs of each
program, 5) assess the means and procedures for merger of the two programs, and
6) prepare a report to NSF with recommendations concerning the future management
of LMER with respect to the LTER program. It is anticipated that the results of
this workshop will serve as a means to guide to future directions in long-term
coastal research, and promote the synergism between LTER and LMER research
programs.
