This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site in nuclear physics at Texas A&amp;M University. The site will support
twelve undergraduates per year in ten weeks of research during the summer
months. Involvement in research at the undergraduate level is an important
component in increasing the numbers and preparation of students entering
graduate programs. This site primarily targets students who lack opportunities
to do research in the field of Nuclear Science at their home institutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student research projects are at the leading edge of
Nuclear Science, including sub-fields such as nuclear astrophysics, weak
interactions, nuclear dynamics and thermodynamics, nuclear structure, the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), atomic ionizations, and radiation
effects. There are proposed projects both in theoretical and experimental
Nuclear Science. The Cyclotron Institute is a Department of Energy (DOE) Nuclear
Physics Center of Excellence. The facilities include a K500 superconducting
cyclotron, a K150 cyclotron and associated state-of the art detector systems.
The Cyclotron Institute and the department of physics are also home base for
involvement in experiments at other facilities, and the faculty are leading
scientists in the field and have a history of working with undergraduates in
their research programs.
