The theoretical and computational treatment of the collisions of electrons with
complex atoms and ions is the focus of this research. A variety of numerical
techniques will be used to compute the excitation cross section for a number of
atomic and ionic systems. The major approach used is the R-matrix plus
pseudostates method but convergent close coupling, and distorted wave theories
are applied where appropriate. There will also be some exploration of the use of
non-orthognal expansions to reduce the proliferation of pseudo-resonances in the
ionization continuum.
