9629283 Billard ABSTRACT Support is provided for three Pathways to the Future
workshops to be held in conjunction with the annual Joint Statistical Meetings
in Anaheim in 1997, Dallas in 1998 and Baltimore in 1999. Since 1988 these
workshops have assisted young women researchers in Statistics and Probability,
providing a forum and a mentoring experience. A committee of alumnae and other
senior researchers will assist in locating and contacting potential award
recipients, with the goal being that every young woman researcher who wishes to
participate should have the opportunity to do so.
