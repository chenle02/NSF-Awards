9412475 Carey Grid refinement-solution is a key problem area and critical
"bottleneck" to semiconductor device and process simulation (e.g. see the
Semiconductor Industry Association Roadmap, 1993). The open issues range from he
basic questions of efficient generation of unstructured adaptive 2D and 3D
grids, to reliable error indicators and enhanced solution techniques that
exploit the grid. The present research builds on the investigators' previous
experience in adaptive grids to focus on the grid problem for semiconductor
technology CAD. There are five main thrusts to the grid research for
semiconductor problems: 1. Two and three-dimensional unstructured and moving
grids for semiconductor device and process applications: 2. Quadtree/octree data
structures and adaptive refinement/redistribution; 3. A posteriori error
analyses and error indicators for refinement and reliability calculation in the
device and process problems; 4. Refinement-Solution strategies to exploit the
evolving grid and enhance computational efficiency; 5. Benchmark studies and
application to representative device and process problems.
