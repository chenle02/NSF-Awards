Cosmic rays are charged particles that have been accelerated to high energies
throughout the universe. This project aims to explain a feature in the spectrum
of observed cosmic ray energies through a mechanism driven by passing stars or
supernova remnants in a nearby region of the Milky Way. The team will perform
computer simulations to test if this explanation can reproduce the observed
feature and predict other observable features. The team will also incorporate
their research into the UCSD STARS (Summer Training Academy for Research
Success) program. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe
Big Idea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a combination of analytical
and numerical simulations of the re-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks
in the Local Bubble. These simulations will model the injection, transport,
angular structure, and chemical composition of cosmic rays that have been re-
accelerated by the shocks and then transported to the earth through magnetic
flux tubes. The results will be compared with observations to determine whether
this scenario can successfully explain the properties of the bump in the cosmic
ray spectrum at intermediate energies. The work will be incorporated into a
summer program at UCSD STARS and will also support the mentorship of a student
from an underserved community in the San Diego area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
