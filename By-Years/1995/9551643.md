The chemistry department is purchasing a modem high-field nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enable its students to learn modern techniques
in structure determination. The instrument is being used at all levels of the
curriculum and leads students to a more sophisticated understanding of the power
of NMR techniques to unlock chemical secrets. Beginning with organic chemistry,
students learn to interpret coupling patterns and chemical shifts in 1H and 13C
spectra to identify molecular structure. At the next level, in Instrumental
Methods, the introduction to Fourier transform and quantitative measurements
provides a theoretical basis for better understanding FT-NMR. In upper-level
courseq students gain experience in a rich array of techniques available to a
multinuclear high-field NMR. For instance, biochemistry students study the
stereochemistry of an enzymatic reaction and observe structural variations in
protein structures, and in physical chemistry they determine the kinetics of an
exchange reaction and study the thermodynamics of an equilibrium reaction. The
presence of the FT-NMR spectrometer enhances the undergraduate research program
and is used for routine analysis of products prepared in inorganic synthesis.
