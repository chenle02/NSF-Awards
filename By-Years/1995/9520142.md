The focus of this research will be to expand the number and range of small
molecule libraries using the `libraries from libraries` concept. For example,
polyamine libraries generated by the exhaustive reduction of peptide libraries
can be readily converted to libraries of hydroxylamines, nitrosamines, peptide
ureas, and/or heterocyclic imidazolidones. These, in turn can be used to
generate other libraries. An ever-expanding combination of such different
chemical alterations permits the generation of a `toolbox` of chemical
transformations capable of producing immense diversities of compounds. With this
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Richard
A. Houghten of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies. Dr. Houghten
will focus his work on increasing the range and repertoire of soluble peptide,
peptidomimetic and organic synthetic combinatorial libraries and to improve the
methodologies used for their synthesis. Combinatorial libraries have broad
utility for the de novo identification of potent analgesics, novel and highly
active antimicrobials, enzyme inhibitors and highly specific antigenic
determinants.
