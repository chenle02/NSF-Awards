The ever-increasing demand for optimized large-scale computing systems puts
pressure on attaining significant improvements in automated design optimization
and synthesis tools. This project aims to overcome the limitations of prior
approaches through a tighter integration of optimization and synthesis
algorithms leveraging advances in modern automated reasoning systems. The
project demonstrates the power of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based
synthesis combined with emerging research in Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores advances in both theory and practice,
with research demonstrations integrated into CVC4, the only SMT solver today
providing synthesis features. In particular, CVC4 is being extended with
optimization capabilities, making it the first automated reasoning tool capable
of performing synthesis and optimization together. The resulting extensible
framework enables system design for emerging technologies which often require
reasoning over non Boolean (and mixed) primitives. The extensibility and
generality of the approach charts a new direction of research at the
intersection of synthesis and optimization, leads towards more scalable and
complex system design, and allows optimization over a broader class of
objectives including security and safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
