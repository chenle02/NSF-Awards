AST-0421087 -- McGraw, University of New Mexico

A compact, rugged, eye safe, low-cost lidar will be developed, specifically to
measure atmospheric extinction at the New Mexico sky survey site at McDonald
Observatory in West Texas to support the scientific programs of the CCD/Transit
Instrument (CTI). The observing program of the CTI will accomplish a precise
time-domain imaging photometric survey in multiple optical and near-infrared
bandpasses of approximately 1% of the sky per night. The lidar data will enable
more precise photometry by providing real-time measurements of the amount of
atmopsheric extinction as well as its cause, i.e. low-lying aerosols, dust or
smoke in the free troposphere, or high cirrus.
