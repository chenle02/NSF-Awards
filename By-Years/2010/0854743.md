Fundamental conceptual and mathematical issues in classical and quantum gravity
will be investigated to enrich our understanding of Einstein's general
relativity and to go beyond. Specifically, the physics of the early universe
will be explored, the quantum nature of the Big Bang will be analyzed, and
thermodynamic and quantum properties of black holes will be studied. Other
issues at the interface of gravitational physics and geometry will also be
investigated, including the fully non-linear regime of general relativity near
singularities at which matter density and curvature become infinite, and
classical physics comes to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the emphasis is
on issues at the forefront of gravitational physics, graduate students and post-
docs will continue to receive broad training that will have a long-term impact
on their careers. Results of this work will enrich other disciplines by: i)
providing novel inputs to cosmology; ii) making a new advance in non-commutative
geometry; iii) developing the area of computational quantum cosmology; and, iv)
disseminating frontier scientific research to the broader public.
