Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology

University of Central Florida; Yuan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the
proposed Center "Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) is to
pioneer the More than Moore" era by translating novel materials, devices, and
manufacturing processes into multi-functional integrated systems that yield rich
functional diversity compared to traditional integrated circuit platforms. The
University of Florida (UFL) and the University of Central Florida (UCF) are
collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UFL as the lead
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center aims at the innovation
beyond Moore's Law. Through iindustry-driven collaborative research initiatives,
interdisciplinary mixing and intersectional collisions will be promoted in order
to catalyze innovation opportunities such as combinations of computing, sensing,
actuation, and energy storage/generation on the same system on a chip (SoC) or
system in package (SiP). The MIST Center will lay the pavement on the roadmap to
next-generation integrated electronic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A result of
Moore's law is the transformation of the computing platform from the advent of
the solid-state mainframe computer to the desktop computer to the laptop
computer, and most recently to the tablet computer. Research at the MIST Center
will operate at the forefront of this transformation by connecting research
advances in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics,
microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies
with industry guidance. The proposed I/UCRC MIST Center will integrate a strong
team of complementary investigators, train the next generation of graduate
students who are versed in cutting edge research, actively recruit and introduce
participants from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and team
with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations. These
exchanges will broaden the perspectives of all involved participants.
