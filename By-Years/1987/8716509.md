This award is a combination of two projects, both involving the deployment of
surface current drifters in the central and western equatorial Pacific Ocean,
and the analysis of their trajectories and data collected from current and
temprature sensors mounted in them, Both projects involve US, French, and
Australian institutions. One project (reviewed under OCE- 8716509) is a
component of a joint field program to study the water mass distributions,
current structures and transport of the low-latitude western boundary currents
in the western Equatorial Pacific. Thirty-five drifters will be deployed in the
confluence of northern and southern hemisphere waters, which arrive at the
entrance to the Indonesian Seas via the South Equatorial Current, the New Guinea
Coastal Undercurrent, and the Mindanoa Current. The second study (OCE-8717243)
involves deployment of 350 surfce drifters over the entire equatorial Pacific
over a three-year period to determin the upper layer advection and heat content
and its evolution. In the western Pacific, Richardson will be responsible for
deployment and analysis, while in the pan-Pacific study, he will be primarily
involved in the data analysis. Both experiments are major process studies
contributing to the objectives of the US TOGA (Tropical and Global Atmosphere)
Program.
