The St. Louis Center for Inquiry in Science Teaching and Learning (CISTL)
combines a focus on research into science teaching and learning with a focus on
professional development and support needed to bring inquiry-based teaching and
learning into K-12 science education in both formal and informal settings.
Joining together in this effort are three informal science institutions, two
universities, five school districts, one community college system and the
Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC). CISTL will address the full
continuum of science educators -- those entering the field, those in the field
and those retooling from one area of expertise to another. Their research agenda
focuses on the effect of varying types of collaboration on professional
development and the interfaces among the collaborators (education and
scientific; formal and informal). A diagnostic tool for assessing strengths and
weaknesses in science and inquiry backgrounds will be developed for teachers and
other science educators. In addition, the project will create a synergy between
research and practice through research based in practice, practice based on
research and the translation of results into practical suggestions for
educators.
