0112612&lt;br/&gt;Fauchet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the overall performance of
a multichip computing system is dominated by the limitations of the
interconnections between chips and it is predicted that this problem will
migrate to the single chip level within this decade. Conventional interconnects
rely on metal lines which produce increasingly unmanageable problems with speed
and power dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;Optical interconnects provide a solution to
these problems. However, one key problem that needs to be solved is the lack of
a suitable laser that is fully compatible with silicon microelectronic
manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possibility of achieving lasing in
silicon will be investigated. The conditions under which optical gain can be
achieved in silicon nanocrystals will be established. In particular, the
nanocrystal size and surface passivation, especially with silicon-oxygen bonds,
will be studied. Then, an optically pumped laser will be designed and tested.
The demonstration of an optically pumped silicon laser is the main objective of
this work. Once the conditions required to achieve gain are established, the
conditions under which electrical pumping will be
examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will be of interest to
the scientific community, as a silicon laser is commonly thought to be
impossible, and to technologists, as the explosion in information technology
relies on continued progress in computing power.&lt;br/&gt;
