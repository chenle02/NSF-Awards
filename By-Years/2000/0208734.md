The InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) is envisioned to be the default communication
infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;future System Area Networks (SANs) or clusters. The
first release of the IBA specification outlines the importance of QoS
provisioning in IBA to support real-time applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research addresses five intertwined issues for designing QoS-capable
IBA fabrics.&lt;br/&gt;First, we will perform design and analysis of
switches/routers, network interface cards, and various network topologies to
provide high and predictable performance in SANs. Second, we will propose
efficient congestion avoidance techniques to handle network saturation. Next,
efficient multicasting mechanisms for IBA switches will be investigated. Fourth,
we will implement fault-tolerant techniques to make the QoS support robust to
link and switch failures. Finally, a comprehensive simulation testbed for IBA
SANs will be developed integrating these designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research, planned to be conducted in collaboration with Intel, will have the
following contributions:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Efficient switched network architectures
and NIC designs will be proposed to implement QoS-capable IBA fabrics; (ii)
Research in the above five areas will provide novel solutions to satisfy end-to-
end QoS requirements and will foster new ideas; and (iii) The simulation
platform can be used as an effective&lt;br/&gt;tool for conducting future
research on IBA. &lt;br/&gt;
