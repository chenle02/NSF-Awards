ABSTRACT This project studies one subsystem of human language, inflection (the
ability to derive walked from walk or wives from wife). The phenomenon is to be
studied in intensive detail from a variety of disciplines, aiming at a unified
theory and database of how the system works computationally, how it is learned,
how it varies represented in the brain. A key hypothesis is that regular
inflection (walk-walks) is computed by a very general mental rule ("add -ed")
whereas irregular inflection (come-came) involves memorization of two separate
words in an associative memory, allowing limited generalization only to similar-
sounding words. This hypothesis, which bears on current study of connectionist
and symbol-processing models of cognition, predicts that regular and irregular
inflection should dissociate in a variety of ways. The project include tests of
how speakers of English and other languages apply inflectional patterns to
existing and new words, experiments where subjects produce and recognize
inflected forms in real time, crosslinguistic surveys of universals and
variation in inflectional systems, and model construction.
