The purchase of a FTNMR spectrometer is being used in the laboratory so that
FTNMR can be an effective, personally experienced part of our students's
education. The FTNMR is available as a regional resource for other educational
institutions in the Puget Sound area. At PLU, students use 13C and 1H spectra
beginning with the Organic Chemistry sequence for the identification of unknowns
and reaction products. Two dimensional NMR are emphasized in subsequent
coursework (instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, biochemistry,polymer
chemistry and undergraduate research), and the integration of information
obtained from GC, MS and IR is applied to the separation and analysis of
mixtures.
