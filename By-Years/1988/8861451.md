This proposal seeks to develop new stabilization techniques for immobilized
enzymes used in bioreactors. These techniques, which have been demonstrated to
significantly stabilize an enzyme to storage at elevated temperatures, will be
further developed and applied to stabilization of functioning immobilized
enzymes as used in bioreactors. The rationale is to provide an environment for
optimal stability surrounding the enzyme, then to bind it together by
copolymerization to obtain a very large molecular weight but soluble enzyme
derivative. The crosslinked enzyme will then be immobilized and tested for
stability. The enzyme to be stabilized in the above manner during the Phase I
project is beta-galactosidase. This enzyme is used in bioreactors to hydrolyze
lactose in milk or whey to make dairy products usable by people with lactose
intolerance, or to make a waste product of the cheese industry into a useful
product.
