Yale University has been funded to have a workshop on biogeoreferencing in the
collections community. It will bring together an interdisciplinary group of 20 -
25 participants including curators, collection managers, application developers,
digital library scientists, geographical information system specialists, and
georeferencing project managers. The September, 2003 workshop will provide the
opportunity for discussion of specific biodiversity community needs for
georeferencing and analysis of functional requirements to meet those needs. This
will help establish an architectural framework for further development of
georeferencing services, and will address providing technology tools for a
number of national and international georeferencing projects. Topics of the
workshop include issues pertinent to providing automated and semi-automated
georeferencing solutions for natural history collections in a distributed
environment, formulation of strategies to promote interoperability between
georeferencing applications, digital library gazetteers, and distributed
biodiversity information retrieval protocols. Workshop products will be made
available to a broader community via a white paper of the proceedings and
recommendations which will be posted online.
