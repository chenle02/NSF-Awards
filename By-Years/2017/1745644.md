The 2017 Campus Cyberinfrastructure and Cybersecurity Innovation for
Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the previous Campus
Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all
active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure and Cybersecurity Innovation for
Cyberinfrastructure awards to meet in person, exchange project findings,
interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across
project areas and project regions. By again co-locating with the ESnet Site
Coordinators Committee (ESCC) meeting and the Quilt Fall Member Meeting, the
broader scope encourages relationships between campus cyberinfrastructure,
science driven applications, cybersecurity, and regional and national
cyberinfrastructure resources. Based on last year's experience, we have updated
the meeting schedule to provide additional opportunities for interaction between
PIs themselves as well as between the three groups participating in the
meetings. New to the 2017 PI Workshop is a half-day breakout session for the CC
program Campus Cyberinfrastructure Engineers and Cyber Team awards, bringing
together organizations at the leading edge of supporting campus
cyberinfrastructure facilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
this project is the exchange of project findings, interaction between national
cyberinfrastructure experts, collaboration across project areas and project
regions that will lead to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated
with an in person workshop. The half-day cyberinfrastructure engineering session
will provide timely insights into growing practice of cyberinfrastructure
facilitation in the campus environment that can be shared with the co-located
meeting attendees as well as the community in general. The broader impact
associated with the workshop includes the dissemination of workshop information,
including the workshop presentations. By co-locating with the ESCC and Quilt
meetings the workshop continues to bring together stakeholders with a vested
interest in leveraging campus cyberinfrastructure investments to provide the
opportunity to develop stronger ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science
driven applications and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources,
leading to a broader set of collaborations and lasting impact on national campus
cyberinfrastructure and science driven applications.
