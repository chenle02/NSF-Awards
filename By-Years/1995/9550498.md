9550498 Wright This three year project is Phase II of an Event-Based Science
(EBS) model with the outcome of nine curricular modules organized around events
in the life sciences and physical sciences for middle school students. Beginning
with a "hook" in the form of viewing a video based on real life events, the
students are led to the development of authentic tasks in the context of those
events; the tasks create the need to know more about the science involved. The
tasks lead to products such as written and oral recommendations, scientific
conferences, poster sessions, models, pamphlets, newspapers and television
shows. Based on group learning dynamics, the students apply their newly acquired
science knowledge to be evaluated on the quality of their work. Accompanying EBS
books supply information for the students to complete teh tasks, but they are
led to explore other resources. Science concepts are revealed by hands-on
activities. This project follows the successful development of nine units of
Event-Based Science focused on the earth sciences. The collaboration between the
Montgomery County Public Schools, the Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., CNN, USA
Today, Carolina Biological Supply Co. and agencies of the U.S. government is
continued in the preparation of these modules.
