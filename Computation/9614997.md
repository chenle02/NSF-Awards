McCormick 9614997 The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the
eighth Copper Mountain conference on multigrid methods, in cooperation with the
Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. This grant provides support for
students to participate in the conference. Numerical methods for solving a
differential equation usually begin by imposing a grid on the region where the
equation holds. From the differential equation, algebraic equations are then
developed; their solution represents the solution of the differential equation.
The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is measured by the fineness of
the grid. Multigrid methods are numerical methods for solving partial
differential equations that systematically exploit the relationship between
approximate solutions on different grids to arrive at a solution whose accuracy
is consistent with the finest grid but for considerably less work. The methods
are often dramatically more efficient than others. Research in the past dozen
years has extended the methods to a broad range of problems of considerable
practical import in engineering, manufacturing, materials, physics, and fluid
dynamics. This project supports student participants at the eighth Copper
Mountain conference on multigrid methods. The students present a talk on their
research in the regular sessions of the conference. The primary objective here
is to encourage student participation in this rapidly evolving field, and to
provide an excellent opportunity for these students to demonstrate their new
results, to learn more about the field from its experts, and to become a more
integral part of the discipline. Supporting student participation is critical
for improving the infrastructure of this important field and for advancing the
quality of its core contributors.
