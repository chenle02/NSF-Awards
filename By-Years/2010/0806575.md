This project seeks to document and revitalize the Weledeh dialect of Dogrib
(Tåîchô Yatiì; Northern Athabaskan), a previously undocumented dialect spoken by
the Yellowknives Dene, living in and around the communities of Dettah, Ndilô,
and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Due to the community's proximity
to the town of Yellowknife, language loss is more advanced among the
Yellowknives Dene, and there are few fully fluent speakers under the age of
40.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher, Alessandro Jaker, will be engaged in
two main activities:&lt;br/&gt;1) Developing beginners' level communicative
teaching materials in Weledeh Dogrib, suitable for classroom use;&lt;br/&gt;2)
Developing an intermediate level Dogrib language reader, consisting of stories
told by local elders. These stories will come with a glossary and footnotes, to
help students still learning the language. These stories will also provide
students with an opportunity to learn about traditional legends and local
history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alessandro Jaker has been working with the
Yellowknives Dene for several years; these materials will be produced in
collaboration with the Goyatikö Language Center in Dettah, and eventually used
for language classes in the community.
