Continuing research under a Presidential Young Investigator award concerns the
stability of wake flow past a sphere in the intermediate range of Reynolds
number. Both flow past a fixed sphere, as well as one free to move freely under
the unsteady forcing of wake oscillations, is being analysed. The methods are
numerical integrations of the governing equations of motion of both fluid and
sphere, as well as stability analysis.
