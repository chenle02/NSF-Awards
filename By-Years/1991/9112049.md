An engineering research equipment award will fund the purchase of a materials
testing controller and associated instrumentation. The equipment will be
installed as attachments to an existing materials testing machine. It will be
used in measurements of friction forces in the very small motions which are
typical of robots. The results will be used to modify and validate a model of
friction.
