04-52658&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed support for an REU Site at the
University of Maryland. The Site will support 12 students during a twelve-week
summer program each year. Students will be stationed at either the Chesapeake
Biological Laboratory or at the Horn Point Laboratory in Maryland. Students
conduct independent research during the internship on a wide variety of
estuarine processes. They also participate in a series of seminars designed to
provide them with an overview of important scientific topics, and informal
workshops on how to write scientific papers and scientific ethics. At the end of
the program, the students present results of their research in a mini-symposium.
