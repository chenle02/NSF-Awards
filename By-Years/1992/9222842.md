A major unresolved problem in fisheries oceanography is the mechanism by which
water column density stratification affects growth and survival of larval fish
populations. These initial US GLOBEC field and modeling studies will evaluate
the potential effects of climate change of larval survival due to changes in the
stratification process on Georges Bank. Water column density stratification has
been shown to have a significant influence on the feeding and survival of larval
cod and haddock on George Bank by providing a concentrating mechanism for their
prey organisms. Changes in wind, precipitation and temperature suggested by
climate change models could significantly alter the stratification process on
Georges Bank and affect the feeding and survival of larval fish. This project
will involve scientists from NOAA/NMFS, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Bigelow Labs, and the USGS. Cooperative funding is provided by NOAA, NSF and
USGS; the NSF contribution in FY1992 via this award.
