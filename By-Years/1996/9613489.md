ABSTRACT The project is an evaluation of a generic approach to integrate
chemical reactions with distillation. Current designs are generally based on
repeated simulations and cannot deal effectively with reactive azeotropes.
Geometric methods offer a more effective and systematic approach that preserves
essential information on the complex interrelations among operating conditions,
phase behavior, chemical reaction rates, and reaction equilibria. The project
will focus on the development of a theory and general methods that include the
effects of chemical kinetics. This will be pursued in parallel with experimental
validation of geometric methods for equilibrium reactive distillation. Reactive
distillation offers potential breakthroughs in productivity, yield and waste
reduction in chemical manufacturing.
