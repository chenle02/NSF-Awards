This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award. Solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to investigate the effects of common poison
and promotor species on heterogeneous catalysts. The effects of species such as
potassium or chlorine which are known to alter reaction behavior are being
studied. In addition to NMR, the project involves catalyst preparation and
characterization. Infrared, Raman, and microreactor studies are conducted. The
initial system being investigated is a model adsorbate/coadsorbate/catalyst
system consisting of carbon monoxide on potassium-doped rhodium on silica. The
objective is to determine how a coadsorbent (e.g. potassium) alters the
populations of the various types (bridged, linear, geminal) of adsorbed carbon
monoxide on the metal. This is relevant to adsorption and reaction behavior and
will be applicable to commercial processes such as methanation.
