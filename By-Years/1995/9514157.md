9514157 Balamuth A study of the structure of nuclei with unusual neutron to
proton ratios, "halo" nuclei, will be undertaken, Some of these nuclei are
thought to be important in stellar evolution but can be produced in high energy
heavy ion collisions at the Michigan State University National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory. Some neutron-rich light nuclei are produced at sufficient
excitation that they decay by particle emission. Their structure and lifetime
for dissociation can be inferred by using charged particle, neutron, and gamma
ray detectors to measure the break- up fragments. Another category of nucleus of
interest includes those nuclei with N=Z. Charged-particle, neutron and gamma ray
detectors at Gammasphere (LBL) will be used to provide structure and lifetime
information about these proton-rich nuclei. ***
