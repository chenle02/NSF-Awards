The Caltech shock-wave laboratory is the only US university-based laboratory
dedicated to studying deep Earth geophysical problems with shock waves. This
proposal is to maintain equipment for safe operation of the shock-wave
laboratory at Caltech. The data are applied to problems across a wide range of
disciplines in geophysics, materials science and planetary science. The
laboratory has trained numerous graduate and undergraduate students, and
visitors who have gone on to establish experimental geophysics programs around
the world. Outreach activities include hosting numerous Earth science and
astronomy-related television programs filming in the lab.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shock-wave facility is used to obtain equation-of-
state behavior of model melts at pressures and temperatures of the lower mantle
of the Earth. The ultimate goal is development of accurate models of phase
equilibria and physical properties of simplified mantle and core compositions
that can be compared to geophysical observables or inserted into dynamic models
of phenomena like magma evolution, plume ascent, dynamo generation, and inner
core growth.&lt;br/&gt;
