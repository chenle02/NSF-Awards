This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to the Department
of Chemistry at Northern Illinois University will help acquire a Differential
Titration Calorimeter. The acquisition will enhance chemical research involving
thermodynamic studies of protein stability and reactivity and ligand binding
properties of biological membrane systems, i.e., (a) complex formation between
cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase, (b) structure/function relationships
in heme(III) heme proteins, (c) the influence of Mg2+ on the conformation of
bacteriorhodopsin and (d) thermodynamics studies of the interactions between
biological membranes and nonpolar and amphipathic molecules. Calorimetry has
been extensively used for the study of physical transformations and for the
investigation of the kinetics of both homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical
reactions. Analysis of the heat changes of reactions is useful in studying
catalyst surfaces, polymers, micelle formation, and certain ligand binding
reactions of protein.
