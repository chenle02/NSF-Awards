The objective of this project is the development of a new method based on
carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts for determining
thermodynamic acidity functions for liquid and solid acids. Medium effects are
eliminated by using the difference in chemical shift between two carbon atoms in
the same molecule as the measurement parameter. The new method is applicable to
systems lacking the transparency to visible and ultraviolet light required for
use of traditional Hammett indicators, and is extendable to solids. To relate
solid acidity to solution acidity, the protonation equilibrium of indicator
bases in solution is studied at the stoichiometric acid-to-base ratio and the
same indicator bases are then studied on solid acids at equimolar ratios of base
to acid sites. Finally, the effects of solvents on acid strengths is examined.
Although the concept of acidity is often used to interpret the effects of solid
catalysts, there is, in fact, no sound technique to measure or quantify this
property for solids. This project addresses this problem directly; success would
provide a more rational framework for understanding of many catalytic systems,
and also of corrosion, composite stability, and chromophoric displays.
