This is an exploratory research to develop a rationally based mechanics
methodology to determine the influence of fiber morphology (microstructure) on
the strength of a fiber composite. The results have a potential to provide a
mechanics approach to control fiber morphology, improve the performance and
reduce the cost of manufacturing fiber composites.
