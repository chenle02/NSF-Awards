This research will investigate the use of using acoustic signals for quality
control in the manufacturing of composites. Recent efforts in acoustic
microscopy have been found to be very successful in studying near surface
defects in a material. The acoustic material signature of a specimen (obtained
using an acoustic microscope) is significantly affected by the surface roughness
and near surface defects of a material. However, acoustic microscopes still lack
the ability to correctly detect internal cracks or manufacturing defects within
a material if these defects are at a depth of a few millimeters or greater from
the surface. This is because the operating frequency (100 MHz. - 2 GHz.) of
acoustic microscopes is too high for penetration into a material. In this
research, an acoustic microscope operating at low frequency (0.1 to 3 MHz.) will
be tested in the detection of internal cracks in a composite plate. Several
modifications in the microscope design will be investigated to arrive at the
best possible design.
