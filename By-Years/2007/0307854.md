AST-0307854 Mac Low Galaxy collisions and mergers are the most spectacular
events in the hierarchical formation of galaxies. Two aspects of these
collisions will be studied here. Firstly, the observation of apparently young
globular cluster (GC) candidates in colliding galaxies suggests that GC
formation may occur in all galaxy collisions. High-resolution simulations will
be performed to study this formation, using up to a million particles to follow
dark matter, gas, and stars. Secondly, these high-resolution simulations will be
used to calibrate a larger parameter study at lower resolution to address the
origin of the astonishingly tight relationship between spheroid velocity
dispersion and the mass of the central super-massive black hole. The main focus
will be on factors determining the change of velocity dispersion during galaxy
collisions.

This research will inform the new Space Show currently under development at the
Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History, which will include
a segment on galaxy collisions. Some work will be carried out in an
international collaboration with Germany, and some will support the dissertation
of a female graduate student.
