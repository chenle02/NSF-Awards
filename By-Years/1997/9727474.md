This research project, under the direction of Professor Emile Schweikert of
Texas A&amp;M University, addresses the surface analysis of trace organics. The
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports these studies of secondary ion
mass spectrometry using massive incident probe ions to enhance the yield of
secondary ions, and thus increase the sensitivity of the method. Coincidence
detection methods developed by Professor Schweikert are used to push the limits
of detection in these measurements to the attomole level. Work is also underway
to develop methods to improve the detection of secondary neutrals formed in
these cluster ion surface collisions. The results of this work provide improved
tools for the analysis of materials in the electronics industry and in the
understanding of important environmental problems. The goal of this research
project is to improve the methods available for qualitatively and quantitatively
detecting organic materials at solid surfaces. These methods will be crucial to
the improvement of electronic materials processing and to the analysis of
environmentally and biologically important samples. Secondary ion mass
spectrometry using mega-projectile incident ions, coupled with coincidence
detection schemes promise a significant increase in sensitivity for these
analysis methods.
