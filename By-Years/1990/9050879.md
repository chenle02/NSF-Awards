This ILI project provides for the upgrade of existing Advanced Undergraduate
laboratory experiments which include light scattering and neutron scattering. In
addition, it will allow for new experiments to be developed in nuclear magnetic
resonance, electron spin resonance, and semiconductor physics. These experiments
will introduce advanced undergraduate students to valuable techniques that are
currently applied to materials in experimental laboratories in both universities
and industry.
