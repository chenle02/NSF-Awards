This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Nicholas E. Geacintov and colleague
Michael D. Ward from New York University will acquire a cyber-enabled X-ray
microdiffractometer with a 2-dimensional GADDS (General Area Detector
Diffraction System) detector. This instrument will be configured to deliver a
tightly collimated monochromatic beam with spot diameters ranging from 10 - 1000
micrometers to allow structural characterization of single-crystal and
polycrystalline compounds with a high degree of spatial resolution. This
instrument will support research in an array of areas such as epitaxial
crystallization, polymorphism, biomineral microcrystals, peptoid-based
materials, copolymers, metal-organic arrays, biomimetics, bioactive ceramics,
organic conductors, molecular magnets, and molecular arrays.

An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
