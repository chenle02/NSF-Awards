The PIs will study of hydrogen isotopic composition of the tissueof living
calcareous marine plants and animals, along with their oxygen and carbon
isotopic composition. The premise is that the hydrogen composition of lipids
very closely mirrors the hydrogen isotopic composition of water, and therefore
should yield information about oxygen isotopic composition, which are closely
related. The study hopes to arrive at a system suitable for fossil material -
the ultimate objective being the use of hydrogen isotopes in paleotemperature
estimates of the past, muchlike oxygen isotopes. Funds are provided for a one
year feasibility study on marine calcareous algae and lipids to determine
whether the relationship between hydrogen isotopic composition of these
organisms and seawater.
