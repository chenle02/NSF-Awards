Understanding the composition and chemistry of the oceanic crust has been a
long term goal of the marine geosciences. Such information provides important
constraints on the processes that transfer mantle material to the crust, that
lead to the formation of the igneous crust, and that subsequently modify the
chemistry of the crust and control the composition of seawater. Such an
understanding, however, requires a means to sample crustal rock and a way to
relate individual crustal layers to over- and underlying strata. Although deep
crustal drilling is one such technique, deep crustal holes are expensive and
provide limited areal sampling of crustal material. Recently there has been
renewed interest in studying faulted crustal exposures as a way to sample a
stratigraphic succession of crustal rocks by submersible/dredging or by a series
of shallow drill holes. The present award will undertake a side-scan sonar
survey of exposed crustal rocks in the Kane Transform Fault in the north
Atlantic. Objectives of the project are to map the continuity of crustal layers,
to sample the stratigraphic succession of igneous rocks exposed along the
transform, and to examine the faulting pattern exposed along major scarps. These
data will be used to determine both the history of crustal accretion and
subsequent deformation. Additionally, these data will provide the needed survey
for subsequent submersible research in the area. The project is a cooperative
study between scientists at the University of Washington, Duke University and
the University of Paris.
