Funds are requested for two years of operation of the Pinon Flat Observatory as
a research facility for the development and evaluation of seismic and crustal
deformation instruments and for using these sensors to monitor a tectonically
active region near the San Andreas and San Jacinto fault system in southern
California. One half of the cost of the facility will be furnished by the U.S.
Geological Survey and the other half is requested of NSF. Investigators form
many institutions have installed a wide range of geophysical instruments at the
observatory, including some extremely stable and precise strainmeters and
tiltmeters. Records from these high-quality instruments are essential for
measuring crustal deformation associated with earthquakes and other tectonic
processes and for providing reference standards against which to evaluate new
instruments.
