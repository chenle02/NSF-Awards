Plants are attacked by many kinds of insect pests, and quick detection is key to
successful defense. A newly discovered way that plants can detect insect attack
- sensing vibrations caused by insect chewing - is likely to be faster and more
reliable than other known detection systems. This project has four goals. First,
the new detection system will be studied in several kinds of plants and insect
pests. Second, rapid screening methods for its action will be developed. Third,
the features of the feeding vibration signal that are important to the detection
will be characterized. Fourth, the kind of plant receptor likely to be detecting
the feeding vibrations will be identified using mechanoreceptor mutants. This
knowledge will provide targets for breeders to enhance plant resistance to
insect pests.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will train students and
postdoctoral scholars for careers in science and communication with the public.
It will also train teachers to incorporate more science into their classrooms.
The world of plant-borne vibrations featured in this proposal is highly
appealing to children and the public at large. By providing acoustic ecology
kits and training to teachers, additional children will experience the
excitement and rewards of science.
