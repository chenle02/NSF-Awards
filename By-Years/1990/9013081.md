The University of Guam Marine Lab is a unique research facility in the central
Pacific Ocean. The Lab has an active research staff and hosts a steady stream of
international investigators working in diverse disciplines. The Lab also has an
excellent record of graduate and undergraduate training. Resident and visiting
scientists have access to an array of shared equipment and instrumentation, and
Dr. Ernest Matson proposes installation of a spectrophotometer and a diesel
generator to augment these facilities. The proposed multi-user equipment
acquisitions will have a significant impact on the quantity and quality of
research conducted at the Lab. The generator will provide backup electricity
during nighttime and weekend shutdowns, and the intermittent power failures
caused by tropical storms. The spectrophotometer will be an important addition
to a diverse array of projects in marine ecology, systematic biology,
biochemistry and physiology.
