This proposal deals with topological problems in a way that keeps track of sizes
of solutions to the problems. These include measurements of displacement
(bounded topology), of Lipschitz constants and distortions, and related metric
invariants. Applications of such ideas arise within pure topology, stratified
spaces, homology manifolds, Riemannian geometry, geometric group theory, and
theoretical computer science. The proposal involves a mix of problems from these
areas, some related to singularities and group actions which involve refining
and applying previously developed tools, while others are motivated by rigidity
theory, and conjectures of Gromov that seem to require new methods.

Topology is ordinarily thought of as an area of mathematics that is qualitative
in nature. Progress on a number of current central problems requires more
precise quantitative control of the solutions of related problems that were
solved in earlier generations by powerful but inexplicit algebraic methods. Such
control brings topology in closer interaction with applications in other fields
of mathematics as well as computer science and engineering. This proposal
suggests an attack on some of these problems.
