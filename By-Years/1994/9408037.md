Financial support is requested for a meeting covering various aspects of
developmental biology. The specific objectives are to assemble a group of
scientists with broad expertise in modern molecular analysis of development,
have a series of 54 talks on up-to-date research, and have about 100 other
attendees present posters describing their research. The meeting will be held on
the University of California - Santa Cruze campus from June 25 through June 30,
1994.
