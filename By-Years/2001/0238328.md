ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0238328&lt;br/&gt;David Walker&lt;br/&gt;Princeton
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops advanced program analysis
techniques that increase the security and reliability of component software
systems. In particular, the researchers design, implement and analyze
programming languages that contain both of the following complementary
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Effective Type Refinements (ETR) that
conservatively extend modern type systems. ETR allow programmers to specify
fine-grained invariants about contents of component data structures and the
ordering and effect of operations in a computation. ETR guarantee properties of
programs when they are written and as they evolve through the software
development cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Run-time Program Monitors (RPM). RPM
execute in parallel with an untrusted application, monitoring, auditing and
modifying the untrusted application's actions so that it obeys critical security
and resource usage policies. RPM complement ETR by enforcing those properties at
run-time that cannot be enforced at compile-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together
effective type refinements and run-time program monitors provide a cohesive
language-based framework for improving the reliability and security of large-
scale software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
