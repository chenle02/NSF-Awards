Evolution is the central explanatory theory of biology and a key organizational
framework for teaching and learning in the life sciences. Controversies
concerning this theory can inhibit studentsâ€™ abilities to understand the ways in
which evolution functions as is a scientific explanation for the unity and
diversity of life on Earth to address scientific challenges. This understanding
is critical for post-graduation careers. The proposed project is designed to
assess the effectiveness of teaching strategies that address student concerns
about evolution through the creation of a survey that would examine student
understanding, reasoning, and attitudes relating to evolution. The project aims
to help educators develop more effective pedagogical strategies and resources
for helping college students better understand the concepts relating to
evolution.

The goals of this project are to (1) characterize the landscape of evolution
acceptance among undergraduate students and identify the reasoning students
provide for their views, (2) develop a new survey tool for measuring student
acceptance of the theory of evolution, and (3) identify trends and reasoning
patterns. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a diverse sample of
students and inductive coding will be used to identify relevant patterns. The
results of this analysis will inform the creation of a survey that be piloted in
biology courses at multiple universities and assessed for validity and
reliability.

This project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
(STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and
practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related
disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied
research that advances knowledge within the field.
