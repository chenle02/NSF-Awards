this is a demonstration project of the block displacement technique. The
objective is to prove that this is an appropriate method for constructing a
bottom barrier in chemical waste-disposal sites that can isolate the wastes and
control seepage. The technique injects low permeability material in a slurry
state into notched injection wells, propagating horizontally-oriented
separations and lifting the block of overlaying ground in the process. Phase II
will undertake a full scale field demonstration where the application of
chemical grouts, as an alternate to bentonite, will be tested.
