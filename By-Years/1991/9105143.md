Most bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, and higher plants use inorganic sulfate as
their sole sulfur source for the biosynthesis of cysteine, methionine, all
reduced organic sulfur-containing coenzymes (biotin, thiamin, coenzyme A,
lipoate, etc.), and a variety of structural components (plant sulfolipid,
sulfated polysaccharides, etc.). The overall objective of the research is to
establish the catalytic mechanism, regulatory properties, and structure-function
relationships of the enzymes which catalyze the earliest steps of inorganic
sulfate assimilation by fungi. Thus, a study of the enzymes (a) ATP sulfurylase,
(b) APS kinase, and (c) "PAPS reductase" which catalzye, in order, (a) the
formation of adenosine-5'- phosphosulfate (APS) from SO42- and ATP, (b) the
formation of 3'-phosphoadenosine- 5'- phosphosulfate (PAPS) from APS and ATP,
and (c) the NADPH and thioredoxin-dependent reduction of PAPS to free or bound
sulfite. "PAPS reductase" is actually a multicomponent system which has never
been purified to homogeneity of kinetically characterized. Most of the
experiments will be performed with enzymes purified from the mesophilic fungus,
Penicillium chrysogenum. Parallel studies will be performed on the enzymes from
the thermophile, Penicillium duponti with the objective of identifying the
structural features responsible for the remarkable heat stability of proteins
from this organism. Enzyme kinetics, equilibrium binding, protein chemistry, and
molecular biology methods will be used.
