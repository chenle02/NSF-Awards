Marvel, Kevin&lt;br/&gt;American Astronomical
Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the American Astronomical
Society will be used to provide financial awards to three high school students
who present astronomical research projects that are judged to be outstanding at
the annual Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). The American
Astronomical Society (AAS) administers the awards on the behalf of all
participating institutions: the National Science Foundation, the Astronomical
Society of the Pacific (ASP), the International Amateur-Professional
Photoelectric Photometry (IAPPP), and the American Astronomical Society. The
Priscilla and Bart Bok Awards, awarded jointly by the AAS and the ASP, and the
Richard D. Lines Special Award in Astronomy, sponsored by the IAPPP, are used by
students to further their education and research efforts. Each student's school
also receives a modest amount that can be used by their science departments to
enhance their science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ISEF is the
culmination of a series of local, county, regional, state and national science
fairs conducted in over 40 countries and involves several million students
annually. Originally sponsored by the Westinghouse Corp, which also sponsored
the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, these two competitions are now jointly
sponsored by the Intel Corporation. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
