9318784 Milton The role of food (and its distribution) as a basic determinant
of group size and grouping patterns in primates is a much discussed topic.
Despite the debate over the causes of sociality, it has been widely accepted
that the size of a social group is limited by intragroup competition over access
to feeding sites. In this regard, the size, abundance and dispersion patterns of
resource patches on which a species feeds are believed to set a limit on the
number of animals able to feed as a group due to intra group feeding
competition. This project will study the relationship of food distribution and
group size in an extreme situation - this animal, the black uakari monkey,
reportedly lives in groups of about 100 in a very remote part of Amazonia. It
will undoubtedly result in very interesting findings, especially as the species
has never been studied before, and is considered endangered. The project will
result in expert training of a new scientist. *** p:\anthro\jfried\9318784.abs
