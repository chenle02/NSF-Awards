PMSA-9453869 Denver Public Schools Denver, CO Stein, Fredrick, Leroy Lopez, John
Rael, Elizabeth Biggs and Rod Cornish "Minority Initiative for Denver Schools
(MINDS)" The Denver Public Schools, in partnership with Colorado State
University, and CMEA/MESA (Colorado Minority Engineering Association/Mathematics
Engineering Science Achievement), proposes a five-year program of academic-year
and summer enrichment activities which will improve minority student achievement
in grades 7-12 in the Denver Public Schools. The overall goal of the Minority
Initiative for Denver Schools (MINDS) is to significantly increase the number of
Denver minority underrepresented students who enter science, engineering, and
mathematics (SEM) careers. The goals of this project will be achieved through a
four-component strategy consisting of: (1) recruitment of minority students into
the MINDS program beginning in the seventh grade and continuing through high
school graduation; (2) the retention of students in the MINDS program through
newly-designed academic-year and summer courses based on the Small-Scale
approach in science and the Interactive approach in mathematics which show shy
SEM is useful to them as individuals; (3) the expansion of existing district-
wide, school-site MESA/DEEP activities consisting of motivational, project-
centered, thematic, hands-on and mentoring activities (MINDS will prepare
increasing numbers of minority students for the MESA/DEEP program); and (4) a
concurrent staff development program to create MINDS science and mathematics
teacher-leaders to deliver the above courses and activities and to explore the
unexplored roles of minorities in science, engineering and mathematics.
