9505363 Saunders East Coast Computer Algebra Day, will be held at the University
of Delaware in Newark, Delaware on Saturday, April 8, l995, will have invited
speakers who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computer
algebra. These speakers will anchor the meeting and will help attract
participants from the computer algebra or computational scientific/engineering
communities from the eastern half of the US. The invited talks and poster
sessions contributed by the community will cover the breadth of computer
algebra: algorithms, software, and applications. The principle theme of this
l995 meeting is applications. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate
interest in and to enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer
algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or interested
in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an
inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting will be more informal than
the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction.
Participation by the region's graduate students will be encouraged through
special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel
support. ***
