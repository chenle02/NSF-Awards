The proposed research pertains to the understanding and modelling of integrated
circuit discontinuities (such as coax to microstrip) and printed circuit
antennas for microwave and millimeter wave applications. Recent advances by the
PI in studies of integrated circuit antennas, for example, have shown that a two
layer substrate-superstrate configuration can yield advantages in higher gain,
efficiency, pattern omnidirectionality, and bandwidth. Most materials in use as
substrates have anisotropy which if neglected in modeling contributes to errors
that increase with frequency. It is important to obtain accurate frequency
dependent modelling of these effects in order to provide the efficient computer-
aided-design (CAD) algorithms needed in the development of very high frequency
monolithic device.
