This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The research activities to be supported
include: (1) development of stereoselective synthetic methods and sequential
reactions schemes; (2) investigations of adriamycin-mediated DNA cross-links;
(3) the development of stereoselective and catalytic asymmetric methods for
organic synthesis; (4) synthetic and bioorganic studies of DNA and RNA; (5)
structure determination of proteins; (6) the total synthesis and bioorganic
studies of natural products and complex carbohydrates. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
