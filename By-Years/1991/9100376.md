Professor Alfred A. Scala and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-92,
nine undergraduate students will spend eight weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. The focus of the research projects will be
photochemistry and spectroscopy, but these techniques will be used in a variety
of areas including catalysis, biochemistry, dynamics, molecular modeling,
organic synthesis, and polymer chemistry. Students will present their results in
informal and formal seminars during the program.
