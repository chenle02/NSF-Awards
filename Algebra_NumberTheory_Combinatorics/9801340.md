Professor Goldberg will work on four related questions in the local Langlands
program. He continue his work on Langlands conjecture about Plancherd measures
for certain non-generic representations of some classical groups. He will also
attempt to determine the poles of standard intertwining operators attached to
arbitrary parabolic subgroups of quasisplit unitary groups. In addition,
Professor Goldberg will study semisimple types of the special linear group of a
p-adic field. Finally he will test another conjecture of Langlands through the
systematic study of R-groups.

One of the most important mathematical ideas of the second half of this century,
is that analytic formula often encodes discrete information. For example, one
might want to count the number of solutions of a particular equation, but
discover that the solutions are very hard to find. On the other hand, you might
want to count the number of solutions to a sequence of equations and consider
the answers as a sequence. Mathematicians call these kind of problems
'discrete'. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which calculus works
so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic.' Amazingly, the right kind of
analytic function can contain the answer or answers to the discrete examples
above. Actually the first examples of this were discovered a couple hundred
years ago, but in the past thirty years, the subject has been systematized. The
Langlands program is a 25 year old project involving this systematization. This
project is an important part of the Langlands program.
