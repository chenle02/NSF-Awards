This project is jointly funded by the Combinatorics program, the Established
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Algebra and Number
Theory program. In this project, the PI aims to study certain problems in
groups. A group is a mathematical structure in which we can add and subtract two
elements, just like in the integers. Groups are fundamental objects in
mathematics and ubiquitous in real life; for example, the numbers on a 12-hour
clock form a group of 12 elements. The addressed problems are of combinatorial
nature; for example, if we take any subset of a group, then as long as the
subset is ''large'' in some sense (without any assumption on its structure), we
predict that some pattern will emerge. Graduate students will be trained as part
of this proposal. The PI will also be involved in K-12
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups studied in this project are: (1) The
integers and their polynomial ring analogs, for which techniques from number
theory apply, (2) finite groups, including vector spaces over finite fields, for
which techniques from algebra apply, and (3) more general amenable groups, for
which techniques from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory apply. Problems
studied in this proposal include the following: If a subset A of a group G is
large in some sense (e.g. A has positive density, or comes from a finite
partition of G), then can one find structures in sumsets such as A-A and A+A-A?
This question is intimately related to various notions of recurrence in ergodic
theory and topological dynamics. If A is a sparse set, e.g. a subset of the
primes, then this question will lead to patterns hitherto unexplored in the
primes. The PI will also study other additive problems such as additive bases,
essential components, and exponential sums using various
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
