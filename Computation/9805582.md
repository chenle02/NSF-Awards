Ta'asan 9805582 The investigator and his colleagues develop multiscale numerical
techniques for dealing with phenomena on a wide range of scales. The main aspect
of the research is the numerical construction of macroscopic equations in the
form of partial differential equations from microscopic models such as molecular
dynamics models. The numerical techniques focus on fluids modeling starting from
molecular models. Special emphasize is given to models involving mixtures of
several types of atoms/molecules that may be governed by different interactions.
Such molecular models give rise to complicated physical phenomena including
multiphase flows. A sequence of models is constructed numerically in an
hierarchical manner starting from molecular dynamics. Each level in this
hierarchy represent a larger scale dynamics (in time or space or both) of the
previous level, and is constructed using statistical tools (regression analysis)
applied to the data resulting from a simulation of the previous level. The
finest level of modeling is given by Hamiltonian dynamics and is deterministic.
Stochastic particle dynamics models are constructed from the finest level model,
and represent the physical phenomenon on time scale of the order of the
relaxation time. Further coarsening (averaging) in space-time results in
deterministic density evolution models, which can be identified as finite
difference approximations to some partial differential equation that is the
macroscopic limit. Numerical techniques have been used extensively for several
decades to obtain approximate solutions of partial differential equations in
different fields, and have improved significantly scientific insights and
engineering tasks. The derivation of those equations, which describe physical
phenomena in different areas, was done by analytical techniques whose use is
limited to relatively simple cases. The treatment of more complex models cannot,
in general, be done analytically and it calls for another approach. This is the
subject of this work: the use of numerical techniques for 'deriving' macroscopic
dynamics equations from more basic principles given at microscopic levels. This
task is carried out by large scale simulation of the detailed microscopic models
and appropriate statistics. The problems treated in this work are limited to
multiphase fluid flows, which are crucial in many areas of applications,
including medical inhalation devices, auto and aerospace industries (engines),
computer industries (printers), and more. The techniques developed here,
however, are quite general and apply to other areas in chemistry, physics and
economics, from fundamental questions to real world applications.
