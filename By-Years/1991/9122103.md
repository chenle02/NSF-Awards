This project investigates the geometric structure and develops efficient
geometric algorithms for the following areas: (1) Arrangements and
configurations, including the complexity of a single cell, zones and envelopes,
space partitions, and of lines in space; (2) Geometric algorithms for robot
motion planning, including motion planning for various systems with 3 degrees of
freedom, planning based on generalized voronoi diagrams in 3 space, extremal
placements and high-clearance motion; (3) Visibility problems in three
dimensions, including output-sensitive hidden surface removal, and ray shooting
and tracing; (4) Randomized techniques in geometry, including design and of
randomized geometric algorithms, epsilon-nets, and of geometric algorithms; and
(5) Applications and related problems, including k-sets in arrangements, union
of geometric objects, geometric optimization, layout of graphs in the plane,
incidence and distance problems, and transversal problems. A theme in many of
the investigated research areas is the study of problems in higher dimensional
space and involving curved (rather than flat objects in 2 or 3 dimensions). Such
problems are much harder to tackle than problems traditionally studied in
computational geometry, but are essential for many applications (such as those
mentioned above). Another theme is the rich cross-fertilization between basic in
computational geometry and the various application areas, problems in one area
motivate the study of new basic problems solution in turn finds applications in
many other areas. As the algorithms and techniques become more refined and
efficient, they are implemented to test their pragmatic feasibility.
