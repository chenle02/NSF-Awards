This collaboration between the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL), the
American Meteorological Society (AMS), James Madison University (JMU), and Los
Angeles Valley College (LAVC) is convening a four-day planning workshop to
explore novel approaches to broadening participation in the geosciences (and
climate science in particular), through leveraging of paleoclimate data obtained
by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). The workshop will engage 25
faculty from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), education and assessment
professionals, and subject matter experts. The ultimate goal of the workshop is
to plan additional programs that use hands-on approaches to educate MSI faculty
about ocean drilling-based paleoclimate research and guide integration of this
research into curricula used at such institutions at a large scale. The project
seeks to integrate effective educational strategies developed through the COL
Deep Earth Academy School of Rock program, the JMU Building Core Knowledge
curriculum, and MSI faculty networks developed by the AMS during implementation
of their professional development course on climate science.
