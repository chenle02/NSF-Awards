The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program addresses the most critical
problems in magnetospheric physics. It is focused research where the topics are
selected by the scientific community based on their importance and timeliness.
An understanding of dynamics of the magnetosphere requires a quantitative
understanding of the sources of the plasma. There are two main sources of plasma
for the magnetosphere: the solar wind and the ionosphere. In order to understand
the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere system it is important that both
sources of plasma be included in models of the overall all system. Most emphasis
over the years has been on the solar wind source. This proposal will quantify
the outflow from the ionosphere. The approach in this study will be to use the
Coupled Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere (CMIT) simulation system including
a new, flexible polar wind outflow module (IPW). The resulting simulation code
will be made available to the entire space physics community through the
Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). This study will address two
questions: 1) which classes of ion outflow have the most significant effects on
the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system and 2) to what
extent do the effects of ion outflow on the coupled MIT dynamics depend on the
mechanism producing the outflow? Three versions of the polar wind module will be
developed: 1) a classical polar wind model, 2) a configuration where the upper
boundary conditions on the polar wind are set by the magnetospheric model,
thereby allowing centrifugal forces and pressure gradients to provide the
outflow, and 3) a configuration which includes a heuristic model of transversely
accelerated ions regulated by inputs like the Alfvenic Poynting flux. The three
types of outflow will be evaluated by calculating their influences on the polar
cap potential, Dst, hemispheric outflow rates and hemispheric power, and
qualitative changes in the magnetospheric convection.
