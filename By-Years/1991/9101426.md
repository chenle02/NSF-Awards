This award will support Professors Sperry Darden and Sudhir Sen of Notre Dame
University in collaboration with researchers Ghirardo Murillo, Marco Fernandez,
Jesus Ramirez and Olga Avila of the Mexican National Institute for Nuclear
Research (ININ). The purpose of the research is to study the elastic scattering
of protons using the tandem accelerators available at Notre Dame and ININ.
Measurements of elastic scattering will allow the determination of various
energy-characterizing parameters and also help to gauge the success of model
calculations that describe in detail nuclear structure. Preliminary tests reveal
the existence of interesting structures in the data. The investigators intend to
explore these structures by refining their experimental frame work, using
smaller energy steps, increasing the number of angular measures, and measuring
at energy levels not tried before. Measurements utilizing a polarized proton
beam will be carried out at the University of Notre Dame, and exploratory cross-
section excitation function measurements, as well as some cross-section
measurements, will be carried out at the Mexican Nuclear Center.
