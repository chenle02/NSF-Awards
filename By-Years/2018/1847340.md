Self-assembled intermolecular structure in organic liquid mixtures is of
critical importance to a diverse array of applications, including liquid
crystals, advanced electronics, and oil spill remediation. The lack of
experimental information on the molecular organization of even simple organic
mixtures inhibits the development of predictive models that can be used for
rapid investigation of new self-assembly strategies. The goal of this CAREER
project is to develop simulation methodologies that can predict the geometry of
self-assembled structures in organic mixtures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will combine simulation and experimental methods spanning the atomistic to the
macro scale to understand and predict fluid structure in organic mixtures. On
the atomistic scale, liquid phase neutron diffraction and molecular simulations
will provide experimentally consistent insight into the intermolecular structure
of organic mixtures. A method called Structurally-Optimized Potential Refinement
(SOPR) will be created that can reliably tune force field parameters and coarse-
grained molecular geometry to ensure an accurate match to experimental
measurements of structure. On the macro scale, the predictive capabilities of
newly benchmarked atomistic and coarse-grained simulations will be compared to
and informed by continuum properties. The education goals of this CAREER project
are integrated with the proposed research to support graduate and undergraduate
student mentoring and course development. A distance learning and mentoring
platform will also be developed and used in outreach activities targeting under-
served rural and Native American communities to promote STEM outreach and
education in K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
