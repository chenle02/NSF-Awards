The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves generation of a new class of
therapeutics to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, while also laying the foundation
for a new way to treat respiratory infection and pulmonary illness. This
approach relies on precise delivery of a treatment that impairs the ability of
the COVID-19 virus to form infectious particles. In the future, this approach
could be rapidly modified for use against other respiratory viruses or to
deliver other pulmonary medicines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to generate a novel SARS-CoV-2
therapeutic through precise delivery of a genomic medicine and direct
competition with the SARS-CoV-2 virus for access to at-risk or infected
pulmonary epithelial cells. This project will use an in silico approach to
design and prioritize the product, followed by in vitro testing and validation.
This project aims to prioritize a novel delivery vehicle and genomic medicine
candidate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
