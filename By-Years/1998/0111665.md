0111665&lt;br/&gt;Dunbar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, provided by the
Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs,
supports US scientific participation in a workshop of the international
Antarctic Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) program. ANTOSTRAT is
sponsored by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and it
represents an important community-based group for discussing emerging research
issues related to the long-term history of the Antarctic and its ice sheets. The
program focuses on coordinated efforts to understand Antarctic paleoenvironments
and paleoclimates of the last 130 million years (late Mesozoic and Cenozoic) as
recorded in sediments and structures on the continental margin and in the
surrounding ocean basins. The ANTOSTRAT activity has been instrumental in
achieving several successful Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling legs. This
workshop will facilitate integration of results from ODP Legs 178 and 188 with
results from the Cape Roberts Project and other related projects. In addition,
the program aspires to delineate scientific target areas for potential drilling
and to define the drilling technologies that will be required to further advance
our understanding of this important time in Earth's history. This workshop will
be held in Erice (Sicily), Italy, in September 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
