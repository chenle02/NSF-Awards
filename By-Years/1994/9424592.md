Waltman The investigator develops and analyzes a class of biological models
generally described as chemostat-like models. While ordinary differential
equations techniques have been effective for the basic models, effects such as
diffusion and transport require system of reaction diffusion equations. The
basic techniques are those of monotone dynamical systems on infinite dimensional
spaces. The effect of delays (for example the cell cycle) can also be described
in such a context. General techniques for competitive systems on products of
ordered Banach spaces, developed in previous work, seem to be applicable.
Plasmids are often used in the manufacture of products by genetically altered
organisms. Because the plasmid can be lost in reproduction and because the
plasmid-free organism is often a better competitor, coding for antibiotic
resistance is often included on the plasmid and an antibiotic used in the feed
bottle. The differential equation models describing chemostats with inhibitors
and plasmids are no longer monotone. The project undertakes the mathematical
analysis of such models. The chemostat is a basic piece of laboratory apparatus
that models a bio-reactor. The mathematical description of such models takes the
form of systems of ordinary differential equations. If the basic assumption of
well mixing is removed from the model (there is evidence that it is not
satisfied in general) more complicated equations result. The project undertakes
the analysis of such model equations using the modern techniques of dynamical
systems. The general view is to use the mathematics to point the way to
biological (or chemical engineering) experiments with the hope of building
better bio-reactors.
