9406823 Kulkarni Emerging high-speed networks are expected to provide a wide
variety of services, for example, file transfers, telephone calls, video
conferencing, interactive TV, cable TV, and multimedia services. These networks
will be expected to carry a mix of traffic with differing service requirements.
This research project addresses important operational problems arising in such
an environment. Specifically, the research project will investigate efficient
operating policies for multi-media conferencing across existing networks; access
control and bandwidth allocation in B-ISDN with ATM switching; and routing in
high-speed data networks. The project will establish properties of optimal
control policies, develop efficient numerical methods to compute optimal control
policies, and use these results to synthesize simple, implementable and
efficient operating policies that exhibit near-optimal performance. Stochastic
fluid-flow models of high-speed communication systems are useful tools in
achieving the above goals. An understanding of how to control a fluid-flow
system operating in a random environment in order to optimize a given system
performance measure (such as delay, loss, throughput, etc.) is critically
important for proper design and operation of these systems. The proposed
research will develop and analyze appropriate fluid-flow control models
motivated by the above problems. A new methodology, based upon reduction to
deterministic control problems, will be developed to compute the optimal
operating policies. ***
