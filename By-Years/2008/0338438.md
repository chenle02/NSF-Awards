Pipes abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award supports the modeling,
synthesis and testing of non-contact microsensors consisting of single walled
carbon nanotubes suspended in hollow polyimide microspheres. Micro polarized
Raman spectroscopy will be used to detect strain along the longitudinal axes of
the single walled carbon nanotubes suspended within the wall of the microsphere
and thereby determine overall microsphere deformation state. Correlation between
Raman spectral results and microsphere deformation will be determined
analytically as well as experimentally. Unique methods for synthesis of the of
the polyimide microsphere developed earlier for high performance polyimide foams
will be adapted to produce the microspheres in the range of 100 microns in
diameter and containing single walled carbon nanotubes. Given the elevated
temperature properties of the polyimide, the microspheres should withstand
temperatures of 350 degrees Celsius. The material should have applications as a
sensor material for pressure and temperature which can be interrogated
optically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
