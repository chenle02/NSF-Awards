This research aims to create innovative software to broaden access to free
online programming education. As computing continues to be increasingly
important in the 21st century, more people are turning to discretionary online
resources to learn related skills such as computer programming. These resources
are great tools to teach the public in large numbers, which is important for
economic development and innovation. However, many of these resources struggle
to keep their users engaged, which is a critical component for learning.
Building interactive systems that can detect users' disengagement and adapt to
their needs will become increasingly important in teaching the next generation
of learners. Access to these types of free, customized learning experiences will
benefit everyone, but especially those in underrepresented groups and/or those
living in rural or low income areas, who might not have quality computing
education resources available to them otherwise.

This project builds on Gidget, an online educational learning tool designed to
teach novices introductory computer programming concepts through debugging
puzzles. This project aims to integrate predictors into the tool that can detect
struggling and disengaged learners, so that appropriate action(s) can be taken
to help them. The curriculum generator component will produce and deliver
customized levels to provide struggling learners more practice with concepts
they are having difficulty with. The reengage component will produce and display
just in time feedback to help reengage disengaged learners. This research will
shed new insights into the effectiveness of these techniques on learners'
engagement (operationalized as total time spent using the tool and total number
of concepts completed) and learning outcomes (determined by a pre-post test of
knowledge) in an online educational programming tool, and inform the design of
other interactive educational tools. This work contributes to the fields of
computing education, interactive educational tools, human-computer interaction,
intelligent tutoring systems, and learning science.
