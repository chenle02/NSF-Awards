The objective of this research is to investigate the factors controlling the
magnitudes of the lateral earth pressures induced by compacting soil. The
project will include laboratory tests to investigate the effects of compaction
method, compactive effort, dry density, and water content on the magnitudes of
compaction induced earth pressures. Tests will be conducted in a model test bin
and in compacting soils in layers; the induced lateral pressures will be
measured. These tests will provide a means of studying variations in pressures
depending on the direction of roller travel and will provide a basis for
assessing the effectiveness of available analytical techniques under carefully
controlled conditions. This effort will take a fundamental approach to a basic
geotechnical engineering process and will extensively use a new type of
instrumentation, the temperature compensated mercury oedometer.
