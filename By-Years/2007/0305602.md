This action funds the third annual meeting of the National Postdoc Network to be
held at the University of California at Berkeley from March 15 through March 17,
2003.

Several national reports, among them the CPST Postdocs and Career Prospects
Status Report in 1997, AAU Committee on Postdoctoral Education Report (1998),
the National Academies' COSEPUP Guide for Postdocs (2000), and the NRC National
Needs Report (2000), have clearly elucidated the dire circumstances of many
postdoctoral scientists in the U.S. research enterprise. Many studies have also
offered suggestions for policies and programs aimed at improving the
postdoctoral experience. However, a number of questions remain unaddressed: Are
conditions improving? What are institutions doing to address the issues? How can
the best approaches be recognized and implemented at other institutions?

With this in mind, the Postdoc Network has organized its third national meeting
to discuss postdoctoral policies and programs. Invitees include postdocs,
principal investigators, mentors, research administrators, and representatives
from scientific societies and funding agencies. Speakers represent a cross
section of the postdoc policy stakeholder arena.

National efforts at postdoc policy reform will be the focus of the first day of
the meeting. On the second day, the University of California system will serve
as a case study for examining ongoing efforts to improve institutional policies
affecting postdocs. Also offered is a two-part workshop on leadership and
teambuilding skills.
