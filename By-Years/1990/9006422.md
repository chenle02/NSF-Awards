The principal investigators will work in the area of time series analysis and
stochastic modeling. The work is divided into two parts. The first part is
concerned with problems of estimation and prediction for time series models
whose theory is not yet fully understood. These include non-linear, heavy tailed
and non-Gaussian processes, all of which play a role in the modelling of real
time series data. Efficient estimation and prediction procedures for such series
will be sought and their properties will be investigated. Some relatively
unexplored models will be considered and some new techniques for state-space
modelling of multivariate time series will be investigated. The second part
deals with extreme value theory, particularly the interplay between extreme
value methods, point processes, asymptotic theory and the application of these
ideas to linear, bilinear and general stationary processes.
