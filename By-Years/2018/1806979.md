From June 18-22, 2018 the Korean Institute of Advanced Study in Seoul, South
Korea, will host a conference on Random Conformal Geometry and Related Fields.
The purpose of the conference is to bring together leading researchers from
around the world to strengthen our understanding of random processes in the two-
dimensional plane that exhibit conformal symmetries. It will focus on recent
developments in Schramm-Loewner evolution and its connections to random Gaussian
fields and classical conformal field theory from theoretical physics. Together,
these subjects have been one of the most active areas in statistical mechanics
in the last fifteen years. The mathematical theory behind random conformal
geometry is rich and intimately intertwined with theoretical physics,
combinatorics, operator theory, spectral theory, and many other disciplines
where new connections are regularly emerging. The intellectual merit of the
conference lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas
within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical
physics and other fields of science. Potential applications of the theory are in
materials science, condensed matter physics, and quantum computing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important component of the conference will be to
introduce graduate students and other junior researchers to this exciting new
field. Broader impact will be realized through the training of a new generation
of students to carry on the work in this important field. Funds from this award
will enable the participation of United States based students and junior
researchers in this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
