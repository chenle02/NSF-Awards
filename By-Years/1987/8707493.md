Despite its importance to paleomagnetism, the properties of magnetic remanence
carried by authigenic minerals is perhaps the least understood of the various
processes of magnetization. Theoretical consideration of this so-called
"chemical remanent magnetization" or CRM makes several testable predictions.
Many of the predictions have not been adequately tested with well controlled
experimental data; hence the theory has not changed substantially since its
first formulation. A series of experiments, primarily using hematite, address
the following specific problems: 1) what controls the direction of CRM?; 2) what
is the relationship of CRM intensity to the applied field?; 3) what control, if
any, does the applied magnetic field have on crystal growth?; 4) what influence
does variability of composition and defect structure have on the remanent and
bulk characteristics of our synthesis products?; and 5) can experimental
analogues be reconciled with observed behavior of natural samples? This is an
ideal ROW Career Advancement Award which will help a very promising young PI to
carry out this important body of research and further develop an excellent
laboratory.
