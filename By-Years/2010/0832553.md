Planning Grant for an I/UCRC in Sustainable Engineering Systems
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832553 Santa Clara University; Jorge Gonzalez-Cruz
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal integrates the activities from three
institutions (Santa Clara University, San Jose State University, and California
College of the Arts to plan the formation of a multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on sustainable
engineering systems with a focus on quantifiable sustainability. The proposed
"Center for Sustainable Engineering Systems" (CSES) will focus on quantifiable
sustainability and reducing market barriers by improving performance, by
installation of systems driven by overall energy efficiencies, and by promoting
incentives that rely on measured benefits obtained using advanced building
information systems. The proposed research will revolve around sustainable
materials, building integrated technologies, building information systems,
sustainable built environments, and sustainable transportation, focusing on
relationships between energy efficiency and weather/climate, construction
material and location, and human behavior and living spaces.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest benefits that would be derived from this work
largely descend from wider public understanding about sustainability and the
development of a more robust way to measure it. The several products discussed
for development (building products and integrated solar panels) will provide for
wider usage of more sustainable products. The ability of the center to harness
interest of entities in California is promising. The proposed center plans to
recruit students from under-represented groups, including minorities and women
to broaden their participation in engineering.
