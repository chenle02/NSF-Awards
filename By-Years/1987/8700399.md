The investigation objectives are: (1) the optimization of reaction parameters
for the condensation of allylic sulfide anions with epoxides and subsequent
conversion of the products into E,E-2,4-pentadienols; (2) Michael addition of
malonates to an enone derived from D-glucose and subsequent transformations
thereof; (3) the preparation of an electrophilic chiron and a nucleophilic
chiron from D-arabinose; and (4) the eventual integration of these methodologies
into a modular approach to the enantioselective synthesis of
15-oxomaytansinoids. A key element of this study is the training of talented
undergraduate students for science, as well as, better preparing them for
graduate studies in chemistry. This project will develop new synthetic methods
directed at the preparation of very complex alkaloids that are of potential
theoretical and medical value.
