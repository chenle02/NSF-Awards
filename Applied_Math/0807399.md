The mathematical description of redundant linear representations of analog
signals is called frame theory, and it is central to open problems in many
fields of applied mathematics such as approximation theory and numerical as well
as statistical analysis. In short, a frame is an (over)complete set of vectors
that gives stable expansions. Previous works have measured the error correction
capabilities of frames with means derived from geometric or functional analytic
formulations. However, for purposes of signal communication and statistical
analysis, information theory should provide the guiding principles for optimal
design. The goal of the project is to close this gap by combining frame and
information theory. Applying information-theoretic optimality criteria to frame
design is expected to have a significant impact on all tasks that involve analog
signals being transmitted or interpreted in the presence of noise. The
investigator seeks to characterize and construct linear signal encoding and
decoding maps for two specific areas of applications: Find frames with
associated encoding and decoding maps that achieve the information-theoretic
optimum for (1) error correction of digital streaming media and (2)
classification of signals in noisy microscopy images.

Digital signal transmissions have revolutionized our daily lives, from cellular
phones and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol telephony to high-definition television
and other streaming media. The use of digitization helps suppress distortions
typical for analog devices and allows seemingly faultless communication by
incorporating redundancy, that is, repetetive information. However, at times the
digital nature of error suppression leads to artifacts that do not resemble the
graceful degradation we recall from analog transmissions. The reason for this
deficiency is that the general-purpose digital communication protocols are not
well-adapted to the properties of the encoded analog signal. The investigator
aims to restore the possibility of graceful degradation to streaming media sent
across the internet, or to wireless communications in unreliable environments.
The optimal design of analog-digital encoding has similar implications for the
decoding of analog signals, such as the extraction of information from
microscopy images in biology. The reliable monitoring and classification of cell
constituents in microscopy images is essential for measuring physiologic
responses in cells (such as the stages in the cell cycle) and for detecting
anomalous behavior that occurs as a result of disease. Classifying cell behavior
is relevant for the evaluation of drugs with high-throughput assays, including
the development of cancer-cell growth inhibitors.
