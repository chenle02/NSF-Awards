This award supports a workshop on Transduction in Biological Systems to be held
in Chile hosted by ten Chilean participants from the University of Chile, Centro
de Estudios Cientificos de Santiago (C.E.C.S.), where the workshop will be held,
and the Catholic University. The Chilean co-organizers are J. Bacigalupo, C.
Hidalgo, E. Jaimovich and C. Vergara. The workshop will bring together people
from several countries working on intracellular messengers, coupling in skeletal
muscle and gland cells, visual, olfactory and auditory systems. The Chilean
biophysicists represent an area of research strength and have produced excellent
students, some now in the U.S. so the interactions should be considerable and of
benefit to both sides. Three other Latin American countries: Argentina, Mexico
and Venezuela will be represented as well as the U.K. and France. Experts from
all the fields to be covered in the workshop will attend from the U.S. so
personal connections will be made or reinforced, information will be freely
exchanged and opportunities for future collaborations will be explored.
