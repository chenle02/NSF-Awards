9301667 Haley Darwin offered "sexual selection" as an explanation for a wide
variety of traits having in common the paradoxical quality of being apparently
detrimental to survival. He proposed that such traits have evolved because they
give an advantage to the bearer in competing for or attracting mates. Sexual
selection is now widely regarded to be a major mechanism for the evolution of
differences between the sexes and a potentially important factor in the
evolution of new species. Yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying
sexual selection, the factors constraining it, or the nature of variation in
sexually-selected traits. A prerequisite to studying sexual selection is to
demonstrate that it operates in the present. Dr. Haley will attempt to obtain
such evidence for the long tail feathers of the male streamertail hummingbird
(Trochilus polytmus), an endemic Jamaican species. The males of this species
have two strikingly long tail feathers (the "streamers"), which are featured
prominently in courtship display. Male tail length varies considerably, and the
males shed and regrow their tail feathers regularly. To test whether or not
females discriminate between males on the basis of tail length, Dr. Haley will
perform tests in specially constructed aviaries. Each female will be presented a
unique pair of males in an aviary where she can move freely, but each male is
confined to a separate adjoining cage. Females will be offered choices between
males with experimentally shortened, lengthened, or unaltered tail feathers. If
females regularly prefer males with longer streamers, it would seem appropriate
to characterize male streamertail tail feathers as sexually-selected traits. If
not, future work would include testing male tail length for its effect on
competition among males.
