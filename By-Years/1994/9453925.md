9453925 Benner This three year project will provide internship experiences for
300 teachers of grades 9-12 in the eleven counties and their school districts
surrounding the Wright Laboratory. The teachers will be engaged in research over
two summers and will have additional courses and other enhancement workshops to
transfer new content and pedagogical knowledge to their classrooms. This will
include 'real world' applications to discovery based approaches in their
classrooms. The project will start with a smaller number of teachers in the
summer of 1995 (57) ramping up to 93 in year two and 155 in year three or 1997.
Application is limited to teachers in the Ohio West Region of the Ohio State
Systemic Initiative. The cost share represents 56% of the funds requested from
the Foundation.
