Scientific communities continually struggle to overcoming the challenges arising
from interdisciplinary interaction. At this time, interdisciplinarity is at an
important juncture: scientists and funding agencies are recognizing and
promoting more interdisciplinary collaboration; technologies are enabling far
greater and dispersed interdisciplinary interactions; and many are convinced
that interdisciplinarity is a key to scientific breakthroughs in a number of
arenas. This workshop will provide a forum for discussion of interdisciplinary
research in the context of team science.

Beginning from what is known from research on teams of all sorts, the workshop
will lay the foundation for exploring the team-based processes required for
innovative solutions to highly complex scientific problems that cross
disciplinary boundaries. The outcomes will include an assessment of the current
state of the art for team science and assessments about what are the most
promising and important directions for social scientists to pursue in order to
advance the state of the art. Further, the products of the workshop will be
useful to those who currently seek to mine social science knowledge in order to
practice evidence-based management of team science.
