The PI plans to investigate the paleomagnetic and mineral magnetic character of
sediments from a series of lakes in the Venezuelan Andes. This research is being
undertaken to further define paleoclimatic variation in the region. The lakes,
ranging in altitude from 1000 to 3,500 m, have been sampled and studied by
colleagues from U. Mass who have produced a geochemical based paleoclimatic
record for the past 18,000 years. Secular variation of the lake sediments will
be studied using inclination and relative declination measurements of the
magnetic field. The carriers of the magnetic signature, as well as their grain
size will be investigated in detail on subsamples from preexisting lake cores.
The magnetic data, in conjunction with detailed geochemical and palynological
data on the same cores, will provide a correlation of techniques in
paleoclimatology studies, provide for corroboration of previous interpretations,
and present new information on the paleoclimitalogy and paleoenvironment of the
northern Andes.
