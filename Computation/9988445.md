The Interface Foundation of North America (IFNA), a non-profit educational
corporation, sponsors a yearly meeting on the Interface of Computing Science and
Statistics. This proposal seeks funding for Interface 2000, to be held April
5-8, 2000, at the Hotel Monteleon, in New Orleans. The 2000 Symposium is
organized around the theme of 'Modeling the Earth's Systems: Physical to
Infrastructural,' and is intended to bring together subject area scientists and
statisticians to discuss large, complex, multidisciplinary, computationally
demanding modeling problems. The keynote speaker is Grace Wahba (University of
Wisconsin) with short courses presented by Wahba, Lorraine Denby and William S.
Cleveland. Among other invited presentators are David Hand (Imperial College),
Douglas Nychka (NCAR), Sally Morton (RAND), Lorraine Denby (Bell Labs), Sallie
Keller-McNulty (Los Alamos), Paul Black (Neptune) and Cathy Dippo (Labor
Statistics). This forum, a smaller focused meeting with a less formal
atmosphere, will allow graduate students and young researchers to interact
strongly with experienced researchers.
