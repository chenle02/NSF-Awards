Neuroglian, a molecule identified in the fruit fly, is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily which consists of a large number of proteins that
share a common repeated structure/functional domain: the immunoglobulin-like
domain. Members of this family play important roles in cell recognition and cell
adhesion in the developing brain and nervous system. Although a large number of
immunoglobulin-like molecules have been characterized, the mechanisms of action
of these molecules is not fully understood. Molecular genetics, tissue culture,
protein purification and X-ray crystallography will by applied to define
specific functional domains in the neuroglian molecule and to describe the
structure of these domains. A complete analysis of the structure and function of
fruit fly neuroglian will advance our general understanding of the mechanism of
action of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules. These studies relate not
only to mechanisms underlying nervous system development, but also to more
general mechanisms involved in cell adhesion and cell recognition in other
tissues.
