Algebraic geometry is the study of shapes defined by polynomial equations. The
field of algebraic geometry is central to modern mathematics, describing spaces
that play important roles in physics, computer science, and certain subfields of
biology. The most important feature of a shape is its curvature -- how much it
deviates locally from a flat plane. An active topic of current research is how
the curvature affects the other properties of a shape. For example, it seems to
influence the number of integer solutions to the defining polynomial equations.
This research project aims to deepen the study of curvature and its implications
in algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of the project is to
study the geometry of subvarieties from a numerical perspective. More precisely,
the project addresses how the position of a numerical class in the pseudo-
effective cone relates to the asymptotic geometry of representatives of
multiples of this class. This is a well-established story for divisors, and
recent work suggests a similar beautiful theory for all subvarieties. Second,
the project will study Manin's conjecture predicting the growth rate of rational
points of a bounded height. Using recently developed geometric techniques (known
as the minimal model program), the investigator will analyze the geometric
underpinnings of Manin's conjecture. This work is anticipated to provide
positive evidence for the conjecture and to identify new examples that lie on
the boundary of known techniques.
