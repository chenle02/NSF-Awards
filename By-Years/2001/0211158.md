This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Russell P Hughes, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth
College, in fluorocarbon bond activation by transition metals. Hughes is
developing novel catalytic routes to convert chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Aliphatic C-F bonds in
fluoroalkyl groups bonded to a cationic iridium center undergo facile reaction
with hydrogen gas under ambient conditions, resulting in the substitution of a
C-H bond for the C-F bond. The fluoroalkyl groups may also react with methane to
make a new carbon-carbon bond. By further study, the scope of these important
reactions will be expanded to new substrates and catalysts.

Perfluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons are industrially important chemicals
used as refrigerants, foaming agents and solvents. However these compounds also
are implicated in ozone depletion and global warming. Hydrofluorocarbons have
many of the same useful properties, yet are more environmentally friendly. This
research may lead to new useful HFCs as well as provide a new way to deactivate
and recycle PFCs and CFCs.
