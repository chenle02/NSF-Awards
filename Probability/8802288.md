The three general areas of research are Brownian motion on manifolds, measure
valued processes, and the range of a random walk. The unifying theme among them
is the study of intersection local times. The research is generalization to
manifolds of the results previously obtained by the investigator. Various forms
of intersection local times are used. Study of the local times for Levy
processes is prompted due to the relatively recent discovery of the necessary
and sufficient condition for sample continuity of a stationary Gaussian process.
The isolation of the regular part of the intersection local times of higher
orders lead in a normal way to the study of anticipative integrands. Various new
methods developed for these integrands will contribute towards the study of the
higher order intersection local times.
