The purpose is this project is to study the existence and nonexistence of
positive solutions to superlinear elliptic boundary value problems; the typical
case is where the nonlinearity is of polynomial type. Particular emphasis will
be placed on domains such as balls, annuli, punctured balls, and exterior
domains. Existence of positive solutions will be mainly addressed though fixed
point theorems and degree theory. Nonexistence problems will be mainly studied
through oscillation theory and Pohozaev identities. The proposed problems are
motivated by a variety of situations arising in gas dynamics, nonlinear heat
generation, quantum field theory, and Riemannian geometry among others. An
integral part of this project will be a number of courses and seminars leading
to familiarizing undergraduate and masters degree students with current
mathematical research.
