Atmospheric science researchers from US and international universities,
government laboratories, and private research institutes, will meet at the 7th
International GEOS-Chem Meeting (IGC7), May 2015, Cambridge MA. NSF conference
support is focused on promoting the attendance of U.S. participants including
postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and early career scientists. Other
federal agencies and private companies are providing additional support.

GEOS-Chem is an open-source global 3-D model of atmospheric composition used
actively by 65 research groups around the world, including 38 in the US of which
30 are at US universities. GEOS-Chem meetings are held at Harvard every two
years and are open to the global atmospheric chemistry modeling community, with
about 200 attendees across a very broad range of topics. Oral presentations by
young scientists are prioritized, providing for many young scientists a first
opportunity to present their work in front of an international audience. Topics
include modeling of atmospheric composition with links to climate dynamics,
biogeochemistry, and air quality. High-performance computing and model
development will also be major themes.
