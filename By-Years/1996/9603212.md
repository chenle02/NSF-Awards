This research combines the PI's expertise in metal ion coordination chemistry
with that of his collaborator in organic supramolecular structures based on
coordination chemistry. The foreign PI's group has been a leader in Europe in
this field. Raymond is at the forefront of supramolecular chemistry, and is
known worldwide for his work in siderophore chemistry. This particular area of
self-assembly and rational design based on symmetry considerations will
undoubtedly provide new chemistry for the future. The collaboration involves
several graduate and postdoctoral students, all of whom will benefit from the
collaboration.
