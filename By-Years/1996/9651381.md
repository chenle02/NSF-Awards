Imaging is fueling research and revolutionizing industry. This area of
research, traditionally viewed as highly specialized, is becoming mainstream.
Laboratories have been developed that teach college freshmen how to create
filters that manipulate images. The early introduction of imaging technology
creates an opportunity to address important questions about imaging and allows
students to participate in interesting computer science learning as freshmen.
Students learn about programming, using arrays and modifying classes. The use of
object-oriented techniques has made it possible for students to easily enhance
the functionality of an imaging system by adding filter member functions to
preexisting classes. This project provides funding for several digital cameras
and a color printer. These tools provide students with a more comprehensive view
of the imaging process.
