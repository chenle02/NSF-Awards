This research project will complete a grammar and dictionary for Proto Utian
(Miwok-Costanoan), a family of Central California Indian languages. The Proto
Utian Grammar and Dictionary with Notes on Yokuts will be an authoritative
compendium of information on this wide-ranging language family. This work
represents the culmination of 50 years of scholarship; it will gather and
synthesize a wide range of information on the Utian languages that is currently
scattered in various dictionaries and journal articles, some of them obscure, or
buried in field notes. In the case of Costanoan languages, very little published
material is now available.

The Proto Utian Grammar and Dictionary with Notes on Yokuts will demonstrate how
the languages of the Miwok and Costanoan families are related to one another and
how they descended from Proto Utian. This volume will serve as a much-needed
reference for: (1) people of Miwok and Costanoan descent who are interested in
reviving or revitalizing their languages and cultures; (2) linguists studying
Native American languages; (3) anthropologists studying prehistoric cultures,
migrations, and intercultural contact; (4) historical linguists interested in
language change; and (5) linguistic theoreticians and typologists interested in
particular features of Utian languages.
