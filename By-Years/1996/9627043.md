9627043 Anderson The Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science (CMNHS) is
producing a large format film on caves. The film will be a multidisciplinary
introduction to the little-understood world of caves and cave science. Caves
will introduce viewers to the alien beauty and wonder of caves and the
scientists and explorers who study them. It will explore the formation of caves
and speleothems, the highly adapted life-forms found in caves and the varied use
of caves by people, past and present. A comprehensive educational package of
ancillary materials will be available to schools and to the general audience.
The PI for the project will be Kit Anderson, Director of Film Projects for
CMNHS. The principal science content specialist will be Jacqueline Janine
Belwood, a researcher in vertebrate zoology at CMNHS. She will work closely with
an advisory committee of eighteen experts in caves, in the various science
disciplines relevant to the cave environment, and in large format films. She
also will have access to the expertise found among the staff of the CMNHS. The
film will be produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films, the company that produced
the large format film, "To Fly".
