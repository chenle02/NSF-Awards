Significant advances resulting from the previous year's support have been made
in 1) persistent photocurrent mechanisms in gallium arsenide heterostructures,
2) identifying dominant electron scattering mechanisms in two inverted
interfaces (gallium arsenide grown on aluminum gallium arsenide), 3) application
of the dissipationless nature of the quantum Hall effect, and 4) electron
transport in nanometer-scale lateral superlattice structures. Continued support
for this grant which is being transferred from the University of Oregon to
Georgia Tech University is strongly recommended.
