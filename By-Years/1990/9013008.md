A continuing problem in the demographics of the U.S. astronomical community is
the scarcity of high-quality young solar physicists. The average age of solar
astronomers is among the highest of any astronomical discipline, and this
problem is aggravated by the dearth of U.S. academic institutions that actively
support solar research. The Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to alleviate this
problem through a two-week, NATO Advanced Study Institute summer course in
Scotland. This course would bring together experts in various subdisciplines of
solar physics to teach graduate students the important advances in techniques in
concepts in their fields. Detailed notes from the course would be written by the
astronomers, and would be made available to the students and other interested
parties. Some 80% of the expenses for this course will be paid by the NATO ASI.
However, owing to certain restrictions on the international distribution of
students in ASI courses, the PI is requesting additional support for travel from
the NSF. It is hoped that this summer course will alleviate the scarcity of
young solar astronomers in the U.S. and will help highlight the demographic
problem in this discipline that has existed for at least two decades.
