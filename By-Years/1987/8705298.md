This project will establish a sophisticated analytical instrumentation facility
based on x-ray bombardment and analyses for the study of material properties.
This facility will support a number of research programs (of a highly
interdisciplinary nature) ranging from design of polymeric membranes and
structure of polymer matrix materials to heterogeneous catalysis and
gasification of coal.
