This proposal has three main objectives which are: 1) To explore the functional
integral form of general systems using coherent states and any canonical
transformations which might simplify the dynamical equations; 2) To examine the
relationships with broken local gauge symmetries; 3) To connect macroscopic
phenomenology with microscopic behavior of these systems, in particular near the
transition from quantum to normal systems. The PI will spend two weeks at the
University of California collaborating with a Professor Morrison who is an
expert on condensed matter physics.
