This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the Department of
Biochemistry of the Michigan State University. Students, most of whom will be
recruited from other institutions in the midwest, will pursue research related
to ongoing research programs of 23 faculty members. Students will also attend
weekly faculty research seminars and participate in weekly presentations by
students and postdocs. Students will be expected to present the results of their
12 projects in written and oral communications.
