A neutron reflectometer (POSY-II) has been recently constructed at the Intense
Pulsed Neutron Source at Argonne National Laboratory which will be dedicated to
the investigation of various problems involving polymers and other materials at
surfaces and interfaces. The instrument needs a scientist to operate the
reflectometer as a user instrument, which means it will be available for basic
research to the entire scientific community based on a proposal system. There is
a great deal of research that awaits to be performed on POSY-II, including the
determination of the concentration profiles at surfaces in polymer blends, at
interfaces between incompatible polymer phases, the concentration profile of
partially deuterated block copolymers segregated at interfaces between the
homopolymers, polymer-polymer interdiffusion over very small length scales,
block copolymer ordering at surfaces, and the segment distribution of polymers
tethered to surfaces and interfaces. Although not an exhaustive list of the
research that will be performed on the reflectometer, these examples give a
sense of the power of this technique when applied to questions in materials
research. The NSF contribution will be limited to the salary of the scientist in
charge of this user-oriented facility.
