This research project concerns a structured class of vector quantizers (VQ) with
applications in image and speech source coding. They are called geometric VQ's
because they use the geometry in N-dimensional space resulting from
equipotentials of the N-th order probability density function. These structured
VQ's have greatly reduced implementation complexity compared to general or
unstructured VQ's, yet their performance can be comparable in practical image
coding applications. As a result the principal investigator can reasonably look
at adaptive geometric VQ's with manageable complexity. It is believed that this
advancement can be crucial to substantial further improvements in VQ and its
application to speech and image coding for the purpose of reduced transmission
and storage requirements.
