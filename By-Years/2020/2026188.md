The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to eliminate the medical communityâ€™s dependence on heparin derived
from animal sources. Heparin is an essential anticoagulant drug currently
produced from pig intestines, primarily sourced in China. Over 300,000 doses of
heparin are administered daily in the US and the global heparin market is valued
at $6.5 B. Over the past 12 years, swine diseases that reduced the pig
population and limited the amount of heparin available led to economically
motivated adulteration and rationing of heparin. Use of heparin derived from pig
intestines also results in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in some patients,
which can be reduced via bioengineered heparin. This project advances technology
to produce heparin from genetically engineered cells to eliminate the need to
source the drug from animals, securing its domestic production.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project pursues increasing the production of
bioengineered heparin from cell lines. Previous work has resulted in cell lines
that produce material with anticoagulant potency that equals pharmaceutical
heparin. The current challenge is to increase yield to meet patient needs at a
competitive price. Cells will be genetically engineered to increase their
production capacity by overexpressing the enzymes responsible for heparin
production. Additionally, the cell culture medium and feeds used to grow the
cells, which have been optimized for protein production, will be reformulated to
optimize production of heparin in mammalian cells. The objective is to increase
the productivity of cells about 100-fold, which will make bioengineered heparin
affordable at scale, paving the way for the development of polysaccharide drugs
produced from mammalian cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
