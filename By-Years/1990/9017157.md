The power and utility of pleomagnetic analyses stem from the ability to
quantify such parameters as the degree of rotation of a rock body, or the
orientation of an anisotropy axis. However estimates for uncertainty in these
paleomagnetic data have been difficult to measure due to possibly inappropriate
assumptions about how the data and naturally distributed. In many geologically
important situations the commonly used parametric distribution functions fail to
adequately model the data, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimate. This
project will use several resampling techniques that are relatively free of
restrictive assumptions to attempt to better detail the best estimate for the
true direction for paleomagnetic directional data sets in a variety of
geological applications. Results are potentially applicable to error estimates
in a wide range of geological applications in addition to paleomagnetically
determined orientation data.
