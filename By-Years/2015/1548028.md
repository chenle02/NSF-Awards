The commercialization of academic research begins with the invention report made
to the university Technology Licensing Office (TLO). Not all reported inventions
are commercialized, raising questions about the reasons behind the decision and
the potential impact on science. This research exploits the information provided
in invention disclosure forms (IDFs) submitted by faculty members to university
technology transfer offices (TTOs). These are rich and under exploited data that
provide a means to study commercialization in advance of patenting. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;To estimate the potential impact of orphaned inventions the project
creates two matched samples. The first compares orphaned IDFs to similar
inventions that were chosen for commercialization at the same university as the
orphaned project. This intra-university comparison allows a control for TTO
organizational capacity and budget constraints. The second matches the sample
IDFs to similar inventions commercialized at other universities or outside the
university system. These comparisons permit an estimate of the potential impacts
in terms of licensing revenues and firm creation of the orphaned inventions.
