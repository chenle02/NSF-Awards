9521412 Hennage This proposal is in support of the OSA Quantum Optoelectronics
topical group meeting. This meeting will cover advances in quantum-confined
structures as in the past meetings, but the emphasis for the 1995 meeting will
be on new materials and new approaches for quantum confinement, and novel light
emitters. Further new themes for 1995 will be photon confinement in microcavity
and related structures, and new measurement techniques combing ultra-high
spatial resolution wit ultrashort time resolution. Topic Areas Include:
*Fundamental and device aspects of lower dimensional material structures *New
materials for quantum confinement *Physics of novel light emitting structures
such as QED effects in microcavities, detectors and modulators. *Optical and
optoelectronic phenomena derived from quantum confinement *Techniques for
synthesis and nanofabriation of ultrasmall structures *New measurement
techniques based on STM, NSOM an dAFM for studying quantum-scale phenomena
Funding for this meeting is requested to ensure an international and domestic
representation by the best people in this specific community. In order to
accomplish this goal, we feel there is a need to offer students, junior
university faculty and other faculty partial travel support.
