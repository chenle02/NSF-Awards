An expert system is designed to solve hard problems usually requiring
considerable expertise. Users are more likely to accept such a system if they
can ask for and receive explanations of the system's conclusion. Our contention
is that improved explanations can be generated by a knowledge-based explanation
system (loosely coupled to the expert system) that actively searches for support
of the expert system's conclusion. Current methods of explanation derive their
informtion almost entirely from a trace of the rules used during the expert
system's problem-solving process. Additional information, when present at all,
is introduced through justifications of these rules. We propose to build a
system that treats the generation of explanations as a problem-solving activity
largely distinct from the processes initially used to solve a problem. This
system will move expert system explanation from a passive (unintelligent) task
of presenting rule traces to an active (intelligent) task of searching for
explanations in support of the conclusion of the problem-solving expert system.
At the center of our knowledge-based explanation techniques (the knowledge of
how to explain). This knowledge will influence not only the way information is
presented to the user, but also what information is presented tothe user. With
this ability to determine both the content and form of the explanation, our
system will have increased flexibility over previous explanation systems. This
increased flexibility will be used to support the creation of explanations that
more naturally support the expert system's conclusion.
