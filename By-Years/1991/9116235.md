The major goal of this investigation is to determine the interactive effects of
oxygen from overlaying water, microbially produced sulfide and sedimentary
organic carbon on food sources, growth, and metabolic pathways in marine
invertebrates living in the benthos. The investigators will determine the
factors controlling acquisition of oxygen and organic carbon, and then test the
hypotheses that (1) growth is controlled more by the interactions between
oxygen, sulfide and organic carbon rather than any one factor, (2) that sulfide
is not required for growth, that Heteromastus will absorb more organic matter
from deep sediment than from surface sediment, and that (3) tail-nipping
increases ventilation. We will also determine whether symbiotic sulfide
oxidation occurs in a deposit feeding polychaete. Preliminary investigations
will be made on the effects of oxygen and sulfide on metabolic heat production
and state of the heme protein, cytochromes and hemoglobin.
