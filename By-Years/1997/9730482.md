This is a planning grant to assist in the preparation of multidisciplinary
research on information technology, culture and social institutions. The aim of
the project is to determine the social context and impacts of communications and
spatial information technologies on the formation, strategies and effectiveness
of a global coalition of non-governmental and grass-roots organizations
resisting the expansion of the shrimp farming industry in tropical coastal zones
of the developing world. A parallel examination will be done of the industry's
efforts to counter the activities of the global resistance network. The planning
conference will bring together social and natural scientists involved in
research on information technologies, society, acquaculture, and representatives
of activist NGOs. The lead researcher will conduct pilot research in Latin
America on shrimp acquaculture to complement research in Asia. The workshop, to
be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara, will allow project
collaborators and investigators to design a program of research on how new
information technologies affect the formation and maintenance of resistance as
well as industry networks in this one case-study industry. The resulting
research should be valuable in advancing our understanding of how global
coalitions of interest groups use new technology to influence policy and social
practice.
