NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden
participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The
fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the
future. This fellowship to Tim Mitchell supports research on the influence of
the social environment on strategies for survival and reproduction in lizards.
Training goals include techniques from ecology, evolution and genetics. The host
institution is the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the sponsoring
scientist is Daniel Warner. The plans to broaden participation of groups under-
represented in science are twofold: to develop a hands-on evolutionary ecology
unit at a Birmingham City public high school that exposes students to scientific
research and to communicate cutting-edge science and stories from a diverse
range of high-quality scientists to 6-12 grade audiences through the creation of
a website and collaboration with Youngzine, an online youth magazine.

The primary research objective is experimentally to evaluate the influence of
population age structure on plasticity in life-history traits in wild island
populations of brown anole lizards. Closely related focal hatchling lizards are
being released onto replicate small islands with manipulated age structures.
These populations either lack an adult population entirely or have a typical
density of adult lizards. Accurate measurements of key life-history traits,
which are predicted to vary in response to age structure, are being obtained
with mark-recapture on molecular methods. This research tests fundamental
predictions of life history theory and explores the role of life-history
plasticity in the adaptation of a free-ranging vertebrate.
