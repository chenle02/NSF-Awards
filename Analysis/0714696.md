This project focuses on the study of systems of linear first-order partial
differential equations and nonlinear problems that exploit the results and
methods of analysis on CR-manifolds. The systems of equations under
investigation arise from locally integrable structures, a good model for which
is a CR-manifold. The tools that are of potential use include the Baouendi-
Treves approximation scheme, ideas from microlocal analysis (e.g., the FBI
transform), analytic discs, the geometry of Sussmann's orbits, and the
techniques developed in the theory of holomorphic extendability of CR-functions
on semirigid CR-manifolds.

Potential application areas for the research in this project include partial
differential equations and geometry. Some of the nonlinear partial differential
equations under consideration surface in meteorology, in attempts to model and
explain atmospheric phenomena. The same equations describe the evolution of the
amplitudes of nonlinear waves in elastic solids. Understanding the propagation
and interaction of nonlinear waves is a very important and challenging problem
in physics. In geometry and physics, these equations arise in the study of the
shapes of surfaces in space that turn up as limit shapes in a class of random
surface models, limit shapes that minimize surface tension. The research
activity is also expected to generate interesting problems for graduate
students.
