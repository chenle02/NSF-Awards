Range arithmetic is a variety of interval arithmetic, so simplified that the
computation for each one of the four rational arithmetic operations requires a
minimal number of extra steps beyond those needed by conventional floating point
arithmetic. The numerical answers produced by range arithmetic are accurate to a
prescribed number of decimal places. This investigation is directed towards new
problem solution areas for range arithmetic, and the generation of a description
of range arithmetic in a form that makes for easy construction of a range
arithmetic module.
