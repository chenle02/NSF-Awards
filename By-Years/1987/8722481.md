This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry program involves using the the most modern and innovative
computer simulation and modeling techniques to investigate problems of current
interest to chemical physicists, namely structural and dynamical phenomena in
molecular solids and liquids and the behavior of quantum solutes in polar
fluids. Specifically, the constant-pressure molecular dynamics technique is used
to develop appropriate potential models, to characterize disordered phases and
study phase transitions in molecular systems. In addition, quantum Monte Carlo
calculations are used to evaluate both the free energy change and volume change
that accompany electron solvation in a polar fluid. Further, the method is used
to compare and contrast the ionization of Li and Cs atoms in liquid ammonia and
clusters. Finally, an adaptive distributed Gaussian basis set will be utilized
in conjunction with the technique of simulated annealing to obtain the energy
eigenvalues and eigenstates of an electron in liquid ammonia with the eventual
goal of following the adiabatic dynamics of the coupled electron-solvent system.
