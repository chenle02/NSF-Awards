Professor Kottwitz will work on several problems connected with automorphic
forms. In particular, he will study endoscopy and its applications to Shimura
varieties. He will also work on the stable version of Arthur's trace formula,
problems of bad reduction of Shimura varieties and connections between the
stable trace formula and the Lefschetz fixed point formula. Automorphic forms
arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century.
Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is
principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of
geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to
problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding
theory in information theory.
