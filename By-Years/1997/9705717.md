9705717 Elimelech This is an award to support research on colloid-facilitated
transport of contaminants in groundwater aquifers. Objectives of the project are
to develop a theoretical model for release of colloidal particles from porous
media of groundwater aquifers and to conduct experiments to evaluate the model's
constituent hypothesis that colloid release from chemically heterogeneous porous
media surfaces following reductions in ionic strength is controlled by colloid
to colloid interactions rather than by interactions between colloids and grain
mineral. The experiments will be conducted using laboratory columns packed with
porous media having varied ratios of clean and surface modified grains using
well-defined colloidal suspensions. Results of this project are expected to
improve our basic understanding of the mechanisms that control the transport and
mobility of colloids in groundwater. This knowledge can be directly applied to
engineering design of systems for decontamination of groundwater and may have
broader significance in improving design and operation of filtration processes,
chromatographic separations and other processes that involve separation of
particles from fluids in which they are suspended. ***
