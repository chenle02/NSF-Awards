Change point detection is broadly defined as the problem of identifying
instances within a sequence of observations, where changes in the underlying
data structure occur. Such changes may be a result of various intentional
attacks and other adversaries or may be associated with random failures of the
system. The change point detection problem naturally arises in the context of
many applications such as crime detection, target tracking, speech recognition,
human activity analysis, cybersecurity, financial and environmental monitoring.
In turn, understanding hidden data shape and associated shape dynamics is an
important step towards more accurate, robust and reliable threat detection and
risk analysis under uncertainty and adversarial evasion. One graduate student
will be supported each year of this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
proposes novel approaches in this important direction by introducing concepts of
topological data analysis and, in particular, persistent homology to
characterize, track and test for changes in the data generating process. The
proposed formulation at the interface of persistent homology, functional data
analysis, and machine learning, offers a broad platform for new data-driven
statistical and machine learning methods for automatic detection of attacks,
threats, and other anomalies. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop
novel geometrically and topologically enhanced procedures for detecting threats
in large spatiotemporal data from a variety of sources, and to study their
theoretical properties, finite-sample performance, and utility in a broad range
of real-world scenarios. The project will offer a number of unique opportunities
to facilitate interdisciplinary research training in mathematical sciences, with
a particular focus on involving and broadening participation of traditionally
underrepresented groups at all educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
