9221206 Gutowski This award provides travel support for graduate students and
the invited speakers to allow their participation in a Stanstead Seminar devoted
to the subject of the role of extratropical dynamics in maintaining the climate.
The seminar will be held at Bishop's University in Quebec in June 1993. Among
the topics to be covered are extratropical energy and water cycles, the role of
eddy dynamics in zonally symmetric climate change, the contribution of local
dynamics associated with phenomena such as storm tracks to non-zonal climate
change, land-surface and tropical influences on extratropical transports and
general circulation model predictability of the extratropical atmosphere
handling of climate change. Funds for this award are being provided by three
agencies - NOAA, DOE, and NSF. ***
