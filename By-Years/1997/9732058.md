We propose to engage 12 undergraduates in research during the three summers
98-00. The research will be focused in the areas of differential geometry and
geometric topology. There will also be a component of some parts of mathematical
physics, especially general relatively, related to differential geometry. There
will be five Tulane University faculty members involved with the project: Morris
Kalka (Coordinator), Slawomir Kwasik, James Rogers, Frank Tipler and Dagang
Yang. Each faculty will supervise the research of 2 undergraduates, who will
work on a joint project. The undergraduate participants will be chosen from a
pool which will be gathered from nationwide advertising.
