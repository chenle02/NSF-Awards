Lay summary for proposal number 0315937 Egg competition and cryptic male choice
in a pipefish:

The growing synergy between molecular biology and animal behavior has opened
new doors in the study of behavioral ecology. In particular, genetic markers
have great potential to provide insights into sperm competition and cryptic
female choice, a process by which females affect the fate of sperm within their
reproductive tracts. These processes are important, because our interpretation
of patterns of mating depends upon the details of events that happen at the
level of sperm and eggs after mating. This project is designed to contribute to
our knowledge of the important phenomenon of cryptic gamete choice. A system in
which gametes are large and easily observable eliminates many of the barriers to
progress in the study of gamete competition, and the broad-nosed pipefish,
Syngnathus typhle, in which males become pregnant, provides such a system. This
project will address two major questions. First, is egg competition or choice a
major source of variation in success during mating in pipefish? Second, is the
outcome of egg competition determined primarily by males or females? These
studies, facilitated by well-tested genetic markers and laboratory-based
breeding experiments, will definitively resolve whether or not cryptic male
choice appears to be an important mechanism in this species.
