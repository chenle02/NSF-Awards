Remote Plasma Assisted Materials Processing (RPAMP) is a method whereby etchings
and depositions may be performed with the substrate located out of the plasma
zone. This enables processing to be performed without significant damage by ion
bombardment and with highly selective chemical reaction pathways. Selectivity in
RPAMP results from the ability to initiate a selected subset of reactions
compared to conventional plasma processing. In this project we propose to
continue studies of the electron kinetics and chemistry of processing plasmas
with emphasis on electron transport and selective chemistries in remote plasma
devices. A new algorithm called Combination Kinetics is introduced for
simultaneously obtaining electron energy distributions and excited state
densities in multiple dimensions.
