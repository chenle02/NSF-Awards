Kushner This conference is the second held devoted to RNA processing and mRNA
decay in prokaryotic cells. The objectives this time focus more on the processes
of RNA decay and processing. Because of the rapid progress in the area of
eukaryotic mRNA (messenger) decay, one session is being held as well on that
topic. Other topics discussed include biological systems affected by RNA decay,
properties of cis-acting elements that affect mRNA decay, mechanistic features
of protein and protein complexes involved in mRNA processing and decay, and mRNA
decay in organisms other than E. coli. Because of its importance in mRNA decay
and the apparent existence of eukaryotic cDNAs that can complement its activity,
an entire session is being devoted to the enzyme RNase E. %%% There have been no
other meetings devoted to this subject since 1991. The field is making rapid
progress in understanding this important aspect of the regulation of gene
expression. Understanding this process will contribute to maximizing gene
expression in a number of areas of biotechnology. ***
