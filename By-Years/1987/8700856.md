This research is concerned with a number of closely related questions about the
cohomology and representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups and finite
groups of Lie type. One major focus is the cohomology of line bundles on flag
varieties, where the study of module structure would illuminate the vanishing
behavior. This research is in the general area of algebraic groups. The proposed
research falls under two broad headings: cohomology of line bundles on flag
varieties, and injective modules. Advances along these lines would both shed
light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as, point the way beyond it.
