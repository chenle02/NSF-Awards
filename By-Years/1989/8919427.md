Achieving a successful career in science requires more than the creative
process of planning important experiments and the expertise to execute them
precisely. Traditionally, the training of scientists is an apprenticeship
process; thesis-advisors and postdoctoral mentors are guides and role models for
the young scientist. For women and minorities this process, which depends so
heavily on a personal "friendship", often fails. The culture and process of
science must be made available to all scientists so that they may take positive
steps to advance in their careers. The proposed workshop is designed for women
and minorities who are just establishing their independence as scientists, i.e.
who are holding their first research grants. This early stage in a career is
especially precarious; departmental and teaching demands are an absolute
requirement. Despite the large investment in education and training made, this
stage in the scientific careers of women and minorities often is their last.
This workshop will address the following aspects of careers in biological
sciences: 1) tenure and promotion; 2) grants and publications; 3) the culture of
science; 4) effective communication. In addition, a critique of the workshop
will be conducted so that it may serve as a prototype for future workshops
directed toward the greater participation of women and minorities at higher
levels of science and engineering careers. The goal of this workshop is to
present women and minority scientists with some of the tools required to advance
scientific careers. This is expected to be a prototype conference to help
establish tested formats for the dissemination of professional advancement
skills to these groups which have been traditionally under-represented in the
upper levels of scientific careers, but who will constitute the greater part of
the future workforce in the United States.
