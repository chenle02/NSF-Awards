In many areas of science and engineering, including signal processing, data
mining, neuroscience, and chemometrics, data often appear in multidimensional
arrays. Such multidimensional arrays are known as tensors. To understand the
internal structure of the data at hand, it is useful to decompose a given tensor
as a sum of simpler tensors. However, the classical method for such
decompositions has flaws, such as numerical instability. One of the main goals
of this research project is to develop the theoretical underpinning of a new
method for tensor decomposition that will perform better in applications,
particularly in biomedical signal processing. The project involves graduate and
undergraduate students in the research.

This research project studies tensors and invariant theory. The project aims to
develop methods for lower and upper bounds for the rank of a tensor. The theory
of convex decompositions of tensors will be developed and generalized. This new
theoretical framework for tensor decompositions is an alternative to the low
rank (PARAFAC) decomposition and is expected to behave better numerically. The
investigator will study rings of (semi-)invariants for quivers and quivers with
potentials. He will also explore tensor invariants and their relations to
twisted commutative algebras.
