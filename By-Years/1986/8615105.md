This study outlines a multi-disciplinary and collaborative program in
researching automated pipe construction. The prime research objective is the
development of an automated pipe construction system involving a single operator
and integrating the pipe bending, fabrication, erection, and connecting
activities. Phase I activities address both system-wide issues and pipe
manipulator prototype development and testing. Phase I system-wide research will
be focused on component integration, database management, constructability for
automation, and sysem economics. Manipulator development activities will address
kinematic studies, instrumentation/controls, CAD integration, and the man-
machine interface.
