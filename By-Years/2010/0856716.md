The project is applying NASCAR racing as an intellectual engagement strategy in
a broad array of approaches to enroll better and brighter students and then
capture their imagination in the key freshman year. It involves a collection of
face to face presentations, flyers and guidance counselor posters, and a summer
fellowship program. It is using the networking resources of an existing center
of mathematics, science, and technology education (CMSTE) to reach the large
numbers of under-represented minorities in the regional high schools and,
through another existing program, gifted and talented students across the state.
By applying hands-on learning modules with a NASCAR theme in first-year
engineering courses, the investigators are introducing the students to exciting
engineering activities. A key resource is the University of North Carolina
Charlotte Race Shop, which has a number of powerful, useful, and available
resources. Project evaluation, under the direction of two experts, is using
surveys, interviews, observations, and focus groups to track how the project is
being implemented and achieving its objectives. Dissemination efforts involve
conference presentations, journal publications, and a comprehensive web site.
Broader impacts include the K-12 outreach with a focus on underrepresented
groups, networking and partnerships between the university and regional high
schools, and the dissemination of project approaches and results.
