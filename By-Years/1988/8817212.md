This project will study the behavior of granular soils in static and cyclic
processes by means of a computer simulation. In the computer simulations the
soil is represented by a random array of quartz spheres. The proposed numerical
experiments will investigate behavior under drained and undrained conditions and
the accumulation of pore pressure and densification during cyclic loading.
