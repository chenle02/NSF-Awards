9509174 REGIER This project will continue the efforts of the investigators to
sequence protein encoding nuclear genes that will be informative about higher
level relationships primarily among members of the superfamily Bombycoidea
(Insecta: Lepidoptera), the silkmoths and their relatives. For their own
purposes they are utilizing the sequence information to elucidate subfamily
relationships in the large family Sphingidae (hawk moths and hornworms, such as
the tobacco hornworm) and to resolve generic relationships within two tribes of
Saturniinae (the giant silkmoths, such as the luna moth, cercropia moth, etc.),
the Attacini and the Saturniini. In the process they are cloning Lepidoptera
sequence for new genes that should be of utility to a broad community of
researchers concerned with molecular phylogenetic analysis. %%% The insect order
Lepidoptera, includes the butterflies, skippers, and moths. While adults of
these insects include many aesthetically pleasing members sought after by
collectors, the larvae or immature forms are much less desirable creatures. Many
serious pests of crops, timber, stored products and even our clothing are
Lepidoptera larvae. This project will provide information on relationships of
major groups of Lepidoptera. Such information can be of value in testing
hypotheses about changes in host plant use or associations, in efforts to
explain how pests originate. It will enhance other research areas by allowing
hypothesis testing about origins of model and mimic systems, host plant
specificity, etc.. ***
