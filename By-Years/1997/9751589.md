This project incorporates field-flow fractionation (FFF) into the physical
chemistry laboratory. This relatively new technique is rapidly gaining
acceptance as a method for separating and characterizing macromolecules and
particles with diameters ranging from 0.002 to 100 micrometers in diameter. The
method is superficially similar to chromatography, but the basis of separation
in FFF is the interaction of particle flow down a channel with an external field
applied perpendicular to the direction of flow. Separation occurs because
particles differ in their tendency to be forced into slow carrier streamlines
adjacent to the channel wall. Besides being a new and promising technique, FFF
is an ideal vehicle for introducing students to an experimental investigation of
transport properties. For example, in normal mode flow FFF, the retention time
of an eluted particle depends on the diffusion constant of that particle.
Diffusion measurements have been made for macromolecules and other particles
over the wide range of 0.002 to 1 micrometer. This project adopts FFF diffusion
constant measurement as the primary nonequilibrium component of the junior-level
physical chemistry laboratory. It joins experiments that characterize porous
solids, measure activity coefficients electrochemically, ascertain enthalpies of
combustion or solution, and establish rate constants of chemical reactions.
Addition of the proposed FFF experiment also complements these exercises with
one that is computer controlled. *
