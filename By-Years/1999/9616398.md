Abstract EEC-9616398 Garrison This award provides funding for a "TIE" grant
involving three NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers: the
University of Washington's Center for Analytical Chemistry; New Jersey Institute
of Technology's Center for Emission Reduction; and the University of Tennessee's
Center for Measurement and Control. The goal is to develop improved methods for
the design and operation of batch chemical processes. Such processes are
becoming increasingly important as the U.S. chemical industry gears up for more
new pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. The specific aims are: Allow
systematic synthesis of process flowsheets as sequences of operating steps in a
way that minimizes or eliminates waste production. Provide computer simulation
tools for control/operability analysis of a given flowsheet. This will allow
detection of potential hazards and inefficiencies so they can be eliminated
during the design phase rather than after the plant has been put into operation.
Develop process monitoring methods to allow fault detection and feedback control
operating units. The three centers will work cooperatively to advance the above
goals, sharing software and information by electronic transfer over the
Internet, and by other means. Industrial sponsors of the Centers will also
participate (in technical meetings) to ensure that the project activities are
relevant to their needs.
