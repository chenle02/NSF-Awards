The most recent advances in nonlinear optics include the generation and
applications of ultrashort optical pulses, whose time duration is typically of
the order of femtoseconds (one quadrillionth of a second). Duration of these
pulses is approaching the timescales of fundamental atomic and molecular
processes. They deliver energy so quickly that it allows them to probe living
structures without damage and to make material modifications on the micron scale
with minimal heat effects. Femtoscale lasers are used, for example, in
microsurgery or materials processing. For ultrashort pulses, the traditional
mathematical models used for longer optical pulses, the Nonlinear Schrödinger
(NLS) and Coupled Nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations, lose their predictive
capabilities. This research project is concerned with two novel mathematical
models: the Complex Short Pulse (CSP) equation and the Coupled Complex Short
Pulse (CCSP) equation. The project is devoted to analysis and computation of
solutions of these equations for the description of ultrashort optical
pulses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models to be investigated are integrable; the
project concerns the investigation of the CSP equation, the CCSP equation and
their integrable semi-discrete analogues, where the spatial variable takes
values in a lattice, while the integrability of the resulting equations is
preserved. In particular, the investigator plans to: (1) construct the semi-
discrete CSP equation and derive exact solutions including bright and dark
solitons and rogue-wave-like solutions; (2) construct bright-bright, dark-dark
and bright-dark (mixed) soliton solutions, as well as rogue wave solutions, of
the CCSP equation; (3) utilize the semi-discrete CSP equation as a novel self-
adaptive moving mesh numerical method for simulating solutions of the continuous
CSP model. Being at the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the
country, the investigator strives to motivate and encourage undergraduate and
graduate students to engage in cutting-edge research in applied mathematics.
