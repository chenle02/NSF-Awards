With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Hopkins will study the
chemical structures of two DNA interstrand crosslinks, i.e., those that result
from reaction of DNA (i) with a nitrogen mustard and (ii) with an analog of
reductively activated mitomycin C. An investigation of the mechanism by which
mitomycin analogs preferentially crosslink 5'-CG sequences in DNA will be
performed along with studies of the sequence preferences of several other
interstrand DNA crosslinking agents. %%% DNA interstrand covalent crosslinking
reactions involve addition of a nucleophilic center on DNA to an electrophilic
center of the crosslinking agent. These are fundamentally simple chemical
reactions that take place on a structurally and dynamically complex
macromolecule. Dr. Hopkins' study is designed to provide information regarding
the covalent structures of crosslinked DNAs at the nucleotide level and in some
cases will provide information regarding atomic connectivities. Information that
Dr. Hopkins obtained from these studies is likely to lead to simplification and
improvement in the design of new DNA crosslinking agents.
