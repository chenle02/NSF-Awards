This grant provides funding for the development of a framework for performing
multi-part planning and generating shared-setups. In this research, rather then
generating process plans by considering one part at a time, multiple parts will
be considered simultaneously and opportunities for sharing manufacturing
resources will be exploited. A given set of parts will be broken into sets of
setup-compatible parts and shared-setups will be generated for every set of
setup-compatible parts. This research will help in creating process plans that
will be optimized over the entire set of parts. Shared-setups will be generated
by using a two-step planning approach. In the first step, the setup planning
algorithm will identify the constraints imposed by a part feature on tooling and
setups that will be used to create that feature. In the second step, all the
constraints imposed by various features in various parts will be gathered
together and a constraint-driven setup planning algorithm will be used to
identify the shared-setup that works for multiple parts. Shared-setups will also
allow procurement of new tools and fixtures that work for multiple parts.
Increasing emphasis on more personalized products and shrinking product lives is
resulting in major changes in manufacturing practices. As companies move towards
mass customization, they will need ways to handle a wider variety of product mix
on shop floors. Setup changes constitute a major portion of the production time
in the batch production environment. The planned approach presents a significant
improvement over the current part-centric setup planning approaches and can be
used to significantly cut down the total number of setups and increase the
overall throughput. If successful, the results of this research will
significantly reduce the required number of setup changes and will allow
companies to handle considerably smaller batch sizes with very little increase
in per part cost.
