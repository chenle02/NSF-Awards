This REU site will provide 9 undergraduate students with research opportunities
in the area of Sensor Technologies. The main purpose is the study of sensor-
related phenomena in order to generate scientific knowledge and to apply this
knowledge to sensor development. The REU site ill be part of the Center for
Sensor Technologies. The Center provide the infrastructure for faculty and
students to collaborate, exchange ideas, co-supervise students, and share
resources. The undergraduate students will become actively involved in one of
the research projects of a participating faculty. Special emphasis is put on the
broader interaction of the undergraduates with graduate students and other
faculty member associated with the Center. Four or five students will be
recruited from Penn and the rest from on of 25 smaller colleges in the
Philadelphia area. Special attention is made to recruit minorities. Students
will be selected by a committee according to the students academic potential,
research interest, attitude towards graduate studies and research opportunities
in the mother institution. Each selected student will work under the close
supervision of one or two faculty members. The projects are chosen based on
their educational value, the scientific merit, and the prospects for continued
involvement after the summer. Project topics include optical, mechanical,
microstructure and micromachining, packaging, neural network based sensors and
sensor interfacing.
