The investigation and application of techniques for obtaining macroscopic
approximations for communication networks is studied. These approximations are
deterministic, described by ordinary differential equations, and stochastic
(diffusion), described by stochastic differential equations. The former yield
approximations for the time dependent behavior, while the latter quantify the
statistical deviations. The techniques consist of a combination of weak
convergence and martingale methods. The proposed methods allow for the
investigation of networks with service times having not only exponential but
also general service time distributions. The transmission rates can be taken to
depend on the buffer occupancies, which is important in congestion control
applications. The importance of those approximations becomes clear given the
non-existence of flexible analytical tools that can give estimates of queue
lengths and other performance measures for such (non-product-form) networks. The
approximate models, arising via certain limiting procedures, will be used to
further study stability issues, settling times and rates of convergence to the
steady state. The methods and estimates will be established mathematically and
also validated numerically and by simulations.
