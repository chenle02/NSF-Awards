Information resides in many different locations and in many different formats,
but there is a need to collect an aggregate this information. An important
unsolved problem remains: How to aggregate the information when the query rules
are poorly understood, informally state, changing quickly, or when there is a
need for selective revelation of sensitive information. This project will
explore the possibility of using ideas and algorithms from the immune system to
address database issues such as this adaptive query problem. A framework for
anomaly-detection has been developed and anew connection found that demonstrates
the formal equivalence of the computations in this framework to lossless joins
in relational databases. This offers the possibility that a database query
system can be built to have immune-based properties of distributivity,
adaptability and flexibility. The approach proposed here is radical and somewhat
speculative, but if successful, could help database technology meet the
challenges of distributed system. It will also extend the bridge between biology
and computation. The work will involve a designated minority institution.
