This award supports research at Augustana College (a small, undergraduate-only,
liberal arts institution) to understand the structure of radioactive nuclei that
have many excess neutrons. The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
(NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) produces radioactive beams with these
excess neutrons. The beams are incident upon a target and the products of the
nuclear reactions are measured in a variety of subatomic particle detectors. An
important part of the project is the involvement of undergraduate students in
these experiments and in development of the necessary detector instrumentation.
Undergraduate research experience is important for many future technical careers
as well as for graduate school. The funds for this award support the work of the
undergraduates and the principle investigator to design and run experiments at
NSCL, to analyze data, and to give talks and write papers on the
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments on exotic nuclear systems are
necessary to place constraints on modern theoretical models. The nuclei studied
as part of this project are neutron-unbound, which means that a neutron is
emitted from a nucleus shortly after formation. Since the nuclei are so
unstable, the radioactive nuclear ion beam at NSCL is utilized for these
experiments. The charged particle left over after neutron emission is bent by
the Sweeper Magnet into a suite of charged particle detectors. The emitted
neutron is detected by the MoNA-LISA (Modular Neutron Array and the Large-area
multi-Institutional Scintillator Array). The research in this proposal involves
data analysis of neutron-unbound nuclear systems and on-going equipment
development. New data on the 24O(d,p) reaction will be taken to study negative
parity states in 25O. The Augustana-MSU hodoscope, assembled, tested and
installed by the Augustana nuclear group, is a key device for this experiment.
In addition, the PI will work on the design, construction, and use of a new
segmented target system for future experiments.
