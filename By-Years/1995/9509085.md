A solution to an over determined linear system, where there may be errors in
both the data matrix and the target vector, is required in many important
applications in sciences and engineering. Recently, a new technique called
Structured Total Least Norm (STLN) has been developed for obtaining the solution
that preserves any affine structure, after the data are perturbed to account for
the errors. It also permits the error to be minimized in various norms. The STLN
algorithm is being investigated and developed into an efficient and practical
solution method for many applications. Its computational performance is being
studied and a more complete convergence theory is under development. Significant
algorithmic and improvements are being made in order to efficiently handle
large-scale problems and special structures. A particular study is being
conducted to apply the STLN method to the model reduction by Hankel norm
approximation problem. The effect of different norms are being explored. The
STLN algorithm is being extended to solve more general problems where the
structured matrix is a differentiable function of parameters to be estimated,
and its performance is to be compared to other parameter estimation methods such
as Prony's method.
