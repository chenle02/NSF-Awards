This is the second year continuation of a cooperative project in techniques to
strengthen ceramic materials. Fundamental studies of hafnia-containing materials
will be performed to understand the ceramic martensitic transformations, under
very high chemical driving forces. Two contrasting matrix materials--a
refractory bcc metal containing a dispersion of hafnia particles, and an all-
ceramic material containing similar particales--will be studied. This is a new
ceramic material systems and will allow a wider variation in physical parameters
believed to be important in transformation toughening. Specifically, there are
higher parameters than for zirconia alloys, the only other system researched. By
studying this second ceramic system (HfO2), insight into transformation
toughening for both hafnia and zirconia ceramics will be gained.
