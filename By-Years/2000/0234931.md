With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University will
acquire a Solid-State 400 MHz Multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out research on a) surface-grafted gels and
encapsulated catalysts; b) metal phosphonate chemistry; c) copolymerization of
CO2 and epoxides to provide polycarbonates; d) extended arrays with phosphine
ligands based on tetrathiafulvalene; e) chemistry of polyfunctional Lewis acids;
and f) guest-host interactions and local structure in porous solids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in fundamental synthetic
organic chemistry and the development of novel polymers. &lt;br/&gt;
