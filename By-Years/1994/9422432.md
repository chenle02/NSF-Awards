ABSTRACT CTS-9422432 ROCKWELL LEHIGH The encounter of vortices with airfoils,
blades and cylinders produces transient loading, flow-induced vibration, and
noise generation. Basic types of vortices include: trailing (aircraft) vortices;
microburst (wind shear) vortices; vortices from turbomachinery, wind turbine and
helicopter blades; and vortices from heat exchanger tubes and raisers of ocean
structures. The aim of this investigation is to determine the generic features
of vortex-body interactions, when there is a defined motion of the body relative
to the arrival of the incident vortex. Recently developed techniques of high-
image-density particle image velocimetry will provide highly-resolved images of
the instantaneous flow structure. These images will be interpreted using
theoretical concepts that allow classification of the key physics of the
instantaneous flow patterns. In turn, this knowledge of the flow patterns will
provide insight into the loading on the body surface, which serves as the source
of vibration of the body and noise radiation from it. With this understanding of
vortex-body encounters, it should be possible to formulate new types of control
techniques or maneuver schedules that alter the physics of the vortex encounter
and minimize undesirable loading.
