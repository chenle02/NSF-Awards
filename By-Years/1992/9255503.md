The two five-day, regional workshops will each provide 30 faculty teaching
introductory analytical chemistry courses at two- and four-year colleges with
information on recent advances in the separations sciences, and with hands-on
experiences with state-of-the-art separations techniques that have been or are
becoming widely used in analytical and bioanalytical chemistry. Experiments
emphasizing biological applications will include the separation of enantiomeric
mixtures of pharmaceuticals; peptide mapping; separations of serum ions by
capillary electrophoresis; and the detection of DNA adducts. The final day will
include a round-table discussion of how the information presented during the
workshops can be transferred to the classrooms of the participants.
