The use of computers in modern chemistry departments is becoming more and more
needed to allow these departments to carry out meaningful research at the
cutting edge of the field. The acquistion of a microcomputer facility for the
Chemistry Department at Northeastern University will enhance studies in the
following areas of chemistry: 1) The NMR Isotope as a Structural Probe 2)
Excited State Structure and Reactivity 3) Nonlinear Dynamic of Molecules 4)
Metal Chelates of Hydrazinecarbodithioate Schiff Bases and Thiosemicarbazones 5)
Models for Bridged Binuclear Complexes 6) Structural and Magnetic Phase
Transformations of Some Transition Metal Compounds 7) Analysis of Inelastic
Light Scattering Spectra of Photodissociative Systems
