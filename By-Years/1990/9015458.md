Research on submicron particles and related technologies is one of the areas in
which the PMP program will be focused in the next two years. Despite its
importance in several new industrial processes and in nature, several basic
phenomena are not yet well understood and modeled. Dr. D.T. Shaw (SUNY/Buffalo),
in collaboration with D.Y.H. Pui (University of Minnesota) and R.C. Flagan
(Caltech), will organize a workshop on the state of the art and research needs
in submicron particle study. The meeting will be held at NSF, for two days. The
workshop will provide a forum to establish future research trends. The written
report will be distributed to universities and research centers involved in
submicron studies.
