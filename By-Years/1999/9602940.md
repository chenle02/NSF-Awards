Funding is requested for the purchase of a floor-model, refrigerated high speed
centrifuge and four rotors. The centrifuge would replace the one preparative
centrifuge currently owned by Louisiana State University at Shreveport, a
sixteen-year old Beckman J2-21 centrifuge. A high speed centrifuge is required
for the routine preparation of proteins, nucleic acids and organelles for
research experiments by six faculty members in the Departments of Biological
Sciences and Chemistry and Physics. The centrifuge is also necessary for the
preparation of materials for graduate and undergraduate student research and for
laboratory courses. The specific instrument requested is the Beckman Avanti
J-25I High Performance Centrifuge. Four rotors are desired to permit necessary
centrifugation procedures: a large volume rotor (to hold six 500 ml bottles), a
high speed rotor for 50 ml tubes (to 75,600 x g), a low-speed swinging bucket
rotor that accommodates interchangeable buckets and adapters for multiple
purposes and a swinging bucket rotor capable of forces to 26,500 x g.
