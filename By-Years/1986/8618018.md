The primary objective of this U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research project between
Vojko Antoncic of the University of Ljubljana's Institute of Sociology and
Thomas Smith of the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center is
to create a social indicators and regulators data set comparable to the General
Social Survey (GSS) carried out in the United States by the University of
Chicago. The GSS has been supported by NSF since 1972. Two surveys will be
conducted in Yugoslavia: one on social microstructures social networks and
support groups and a second in social equalities and inequalities. At first,
Yugoslav respondents will be limited to the Republic of Slovenia, but it is
expected that the survey will be extended to all of Yugoslavia. This is a
significant project since collaboration with Yugoslavia will enable researchers
to perform cross-national analyses and to test the same theoretical models in
varying social contexts. West Germany and United Kingdom are participants as
well, but Yugoslavia is the only socialist country in the survey. This project
has been approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is funded through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State and no NSF funds are involved. The
grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal
Yugoslav institute. Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a
modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
