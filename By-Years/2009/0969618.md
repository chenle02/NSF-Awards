A comprehensive effort to improve the mathematics abilities of science and
engineering students is being undertaken. Included in the effort is the reform
of precalculus and calculus courses, incorporation of active learning into
mathematics courses, implementation of a uniform mathematics placement policy,
and cooperation with school districts sending large numbers of students to the
institution to modify high school mathematics courses to meet the expectations
of the university. All the planned activities are grounded in a detailed
investigation of the current reasons for the lower rate of retention of majors
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;The project is the result of a synergistic approach amongst
faculty from the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the
College of Engineering that utilizes best practices in STEM education to
increase the number of STEM graduates. The project is both advancing knowledge
in mathematics and the associated comfort level of STEM majors by removing
barriers linked to poor performance in STEM math classes and the associated
lower retention to graduation in a STEM major. Addressing the issue at the pre-
college level through articulation with regional feeder high-schools, at the
math placement level, and inside and outside the initial mathematics classroom
is a holistic and potentially transformative approach.
