The goal of this research project is the development of stochastic models and
statistically optimal segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images.
Specific objectives include: further development of hierarchical Gibbs
distribution or Markov random field models to represent real images; development
of models for speckle corrupted synthetic aperture radar images; investigation
of the relationships between Markov-type models and connections between Markov
random field models and robust processing; development of estimators for the
parameters in hierarchical image models; and development of statistically
optimal segmentation algorithms for images modelled with hierarchical Gibbs
distribution models. For parameter estimation and segmentation, relaxation
methods will be used. The objective of this research is to develop algorithms
for segmenting real world images. Results of this research could be important in
fields of synthetic aperture radar and image interpretation.
