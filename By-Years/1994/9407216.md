Hardisky Rooted macrophytes are key mediators of methane efflux from wetland
sediments to the atmosphere. Reduced carbon compounds released upon senescence
of plant roots provide carbon substrates for a series of anoxic degradation's
culminating in the production of methane within the sediment. Diffusion of
methane into the apoplastic pathways within the plant, facilitate the movement
of methane via aerenchyma tissues, through the plant and ultimately to the
atmosphere. The critical boundary controlling both the release of carbon
compounds to the sediment and diffusion of methane into the vascular plant is
the root surface / sediment interface. This research will address the effects of
various quantities and types of root biomass upon the efflux of methane from
Typha marshes. To this end, we have proposed to plant natural mesocosms of Typha
at four different densities and determine resulting differences in pore water
methane and methane flux. The oxidizing/reducing nature of the edaphic
environment is a second critical factor in controlling the rate of methane flux.
We are proposing to investigate an existing hydrologic gradient where water
table depth and Typha canopies vary from an open pool to the upland.
Superimposed upon this gradient will be planned alterations in the water
available to the marsh, creating the opportunity to investigate short term
effects of water table fluctuations upon methane flux. Crucial to our
understanding of the impacts of global climatic change is an ability to assess
the impacts of change at the ecosystem level. Our most viable option for such
study is through the use of remote sensing data. Our proposed research will
relate canopy biophysical properties to canopy reflectance measures with ground-
based instrumentation. We will in turn relate root biomass, pore water methane
concentrations and methane flux to canopy reflectance. These ground-based models
will then be used to quantitatively assess satellite (TM or XS) data and provide
a methodolo gy capable of large area methane flux estimation.
