Work on two kinds of nonclassical states is proposed. The first are states
whose phase is correlated with their ampli- tude. States of this kind can be
detected by measuring their noise after they have passed through a Kerr medium.
The objective is to develop a formalism for describing the phase/amplitude
correlations for such states. The second set of states to be studied are the so
called squeezed states. In particular, those states which are squeezed in the
mode ampli- tudes (quadratic squeezing). Three basic forms of quadratic
squeezing have already been examined and it is proposed to study the nature of
mixed forms of these states. Here, non-linear interactions can transform
different types of quadratically squeezed states among themselves. These trans-
formations will be studied in some detail in the proposal.
