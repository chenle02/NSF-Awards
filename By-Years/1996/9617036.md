Hogan, Craig AST 96-17036 Dr. Hogan will conduct research on two projects in
observational cosmology. The first project will measure the abundance of
deuterium in QSO absorbers as a test of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and a
measurement of the cosmic baryon density, in particular, to resolve the present
dichotomy between high and low abundances. The second project will test
cosmologies using Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. A large sample of
Abell clusters will be observed to discover a much larger sample of supernovae
than presently available on which to base a study of the `flow' reported by
Lauer and Postman, as well as to fill in the linear part of the Hubble diagram.
