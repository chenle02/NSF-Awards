9300866 Newell This is a project to study the coupling of the solar wind to the
magnetosphere and ionosphere. The study relies on particle and driftmeter data
from the DMSP satellite and includes collaborative efforts with ground-based
instrumentation. The distribution of electrical potential across the low
latitude boundary layer will be determined, as well as the local time dependence
of the cross polar cap potential. This project continues the vigorous program of
national and international collaborations which have been so successful in
studying these complex coupling processes. ***
