This award is aimed at the elucidation of the structure and function of CuZn
superoxide dismutase (SOD) found in bacteria. The bacterial CuZnSODs are
periplasmic and thus adapted for defense against extra cytoplasmic oxidative
stress. The research will study the CuZnSOD in two bacteria, Caulobacter
crescentus and Legionella pneumophilia. Their genes, which had been previously
cloned and sequenced, will be mutagenized and reintroduced into the bacteria.
Characterization of the mutant strains will yield general insights into the role
of periplasmic protein in defense against oxygen toxicity. The enzymes will be
over-expressed and crystallized. Collaborative efforts will be made to obtain
their 3-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography. The results will enhance
our understanding of how living cells protect themselves against the toxic
effects of superoxides which are produced in wide variety of metabolic reactions
and which may be the cause of myriads of human diseases.
