This REU site project involves a mix of theoretical and experimental problems in
parallel processing. The program is based on discovery through problem solving,
examples, and generalizations. The roles of intuition and formalism in the
research process will be fully integrated. The particular problems to be studied
involve: graph embedding, benchmarking of broadcast algorithms on a hypercube,
randomizing algorithms, and the development of portable parallel software.
