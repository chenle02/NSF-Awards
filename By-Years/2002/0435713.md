This project involves the continued maintenance and development of an
aerosol/cloud model and its application to describing the behavior and impacts
of tropospheric aerosols. The model will numerically simulate sea salt aerosols,
marine sulfate aerosols, as well as smoke. Results will be compared with data to
better determine the sources of these aerosols, their impact on the climate
system and on atmospheric chemistry, and the requirements for models to
adequately treat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the
sources and distribution of smoke. Detailed regional simulations driven by real
winds from the NCAR MATCH model will be performed and direct comparisons made
with observations from several field campaigns and satellites. The product of
this work will be smoke source functions that relate optical properties, optical
depth, and plume height to the fire intensity, fuel type, and meteorological
circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also apply the model to sea
salt aerosols. Detailed regional simulations driven by real winds from the NCAR
MATCH model will be performed making direct comparisons with observations. Sea
salt has the greatest mass flux of any aerosol, and currently used sea salt
source functions differ widely. The results should be improved source functions,
and a better appreciation for the global distribution and climatologically
importance of sea salt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project will
investigate the origins and evolution of marine sulfate aerosols and set the
ground-work for a model in which both clouds and aerosols are investigated in
the marine boundary layer. Marine sulfate aerosols are of great interest due to
their production from biologically generated gases, and due to their influence
on clouds. The details of the aerosol evolution in marine cloud fields will be
treated. In order to fully understand how clouds respond to and influence
aerosols, a fully coupled model needs to be developed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will contribute to graduate education
and the training of postdoctoral researchers. The modeling will contribute to
on-going efforts to better understand the direct effects of aerosols on climate.
The study of marine sulfate aerosols and of sea salt will help better understand
the indirect effect of aerosols on clouds. The results should be new source
functions for use in global climate models, better definitions of optical
properties, improved understand of processes and evaluations of the needs for
model realism.
