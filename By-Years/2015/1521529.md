Terabytes of data are collected by companies and individuals every day. These
data possess no value unless one can efficiently process them and use them to
make decisions. The scale and the streaming nature of data pose both
computational and statistical challenges. The objective of this research project
is to develop novel approaches to making online, real-time decisions when data
are constantly evolving and highly structured. In particular, this project
focuses on online prediction problems involving multiple users in dynamic
networks. The project also aims to tackle the privacy issues arising in such
multi-user scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, it was shown that a
majority of online machine learning algorithms can be viewed as solutions to
approximate dynamic programming (ADP) problems that incorporate one additional
datum per step. Along with directly addressing the computational concerns, the
ADP framework also provides guaranteed performance on prediction problems. This
project is to use and extend the ADP framework to develop prediction algorithms
that simultaneously address the issues of computation, robustness, non-
stationarity, privacy, and multiplicity of users.
