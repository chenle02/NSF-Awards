This award is in support of the first Gordon Research Conference (GRC) meeting
on Photosensory Receptors and Signal Transduction to be held May 19-24, 2002 at
the GRC site in Barga, Italy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new conference was
developed and approved in view of the recent breakthrough discoveries of new
photosensory receptors and current rapid progress on their activation and
signaling mechanisms. The focus is on molecular mechanisms of receptor
phototransduction, and the conference brings together investigators of
structure/function of archaeal, eubacterial, eukaryotic microbial, plant, and
animal photoreceptors. The meeting will provide a very much-needed opportunity
to exchange information and ideas and for investigators to become aware of the
diverse and incisive molecular tools available in this fast-moving area of
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the conference will
stimulate exciting discussion of emerging insights on photoreceptor evolution,
molecular mechanisms, photosignal transduction principles, and the most engaging
mysteries on the cutting edge of photosensory reception in biology.&lt;br/&gt;
