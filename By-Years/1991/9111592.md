There are two priceless neuroanatomical collections of a range of mammalian
brains, representing more than 120 species and all the major groups of mammals,
including some now rare or endangered species. This project is the first step in
making an electronically available catalog of all this material on video discs.
Tests will be used to decide which is the best means of producing and storing
quality images of the thousands of prepared tissue slides, with adequate visual
resolution for anatomical work. The potential impact of a new accessibility of
this irreplaceable tissue for research and teaching is enormous, providing
excellent anatomical information on rare or endangered species already preserved
without sacrificing any more specimens, wide distribution of data to any
interested researcher, and illustrations for instructional programs. This work
also may provide a model for helping other collections move into electronically
accessible formats.
