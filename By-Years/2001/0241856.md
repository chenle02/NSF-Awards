Faculty members at Syracuse University will offer 30 scholarships in
Multidisciplinary Systems Assurance Education for graduate students. Systems
assurance comprises the related areas of information assurance, computer
security, and infrastructure protection. With the continuing growth of computing
and communication technology, and its increasing integration into almost all
aspects of our society, systems assurance will play a vital role in the future
of our nation. As this integration takes place, many issues not related to the
core technology arise, issues of management, public policy, law, education, and
ethics. For this reason, systems assurance is truly a multidisciplinary area of
intellectual inquiry, and we are therefore providing a multidisciplinary, pan-
University education program in systems assurance. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
Center for Systems Assurance (CSA) at Syracuse is an NSA designated Center of
Excellence in Information Assurance Education. We are expanding the CSA beyond
the L. C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) to include
faculty from Information Studies (IST) and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs (Maxwell). This expansion will be followed in later years by
inclusion of additional IA-related areas, including law, philosophy, and
education. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science (EECS) department, within ECS, currently offers Masters degrees in
Computer Science or Computer Engineering with a concentration in Systems
Assurance. Students in these courses take the core courses their major (three or
four courses), a five-course concentration in a Systems Assurance technology
core, and at least one elective from an allied area. We propose to implement
similar tracks in IST and Maxwell. We will support students in ECS for the first
year of the grant, and then support students from all three schools when their
programs are on-line. &lt;br/&gt;
