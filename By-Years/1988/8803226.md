The PI will do a comprehensive study of coupling between double and multiple
quantum wells using electromodulation as well as other modulation methods such
as temperature modulation (thermomodulation). In addition, we plan to use these
coupling effects to more accurately determine band offsets in these
semiconductor structures. Our main focus will be on the GaAs/GaA1As system
although other systems such as strained layer InGaAs/GaAs will be examined if
time allows.
