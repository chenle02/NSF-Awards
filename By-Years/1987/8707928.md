Narrative: The control of biological reactors is complicated by the fact that
microbial or tissue cells are extremely sensitive to small changes in their
growth environment. In addition, there is little detailed knowledge about
biological system process dynamics thus making the design and implementation of
effective control strategies a difficult if not impossible task. Another
frustrating problem is the lack of appropriate sensors to monitor important
process variables, such as pH, temperature, nutrient concentration, and by-
product concentration. To help overcome these inherent problems this research
proposes to use a hybrid control scheme; incorporating one level of conventional
control and a second superimposed "expert system" with factual, as well as
intuitive, uncertain, and judgemental knowledge for extended control action. It
is proposed that both a model-based and a model- free expert system be
investigated. The butanol/acetone fermentation has been chosen as the model
system because of a strong data base in the literature; the system can produce
various products with variable yields and selectivities under different
environmental conditions, and the investigators have had previous experience
with this system. It is intended that results from this study will enhance the
control of bioprocesses and therefore, increase their reliability and
productivity.
