The research will suppose that R is a commutative two- dimensional Noetherian
ring. The primary projects in this proposal are: (1) characterize the partially
ordered set of prime ideals for various examples of such rings; and (2) suppose
that the ring R has the additional property that there exist only finitely many
finitely generated indecomposable R-modules up to local isomorphism. Describe
the indecomposable modules of R. This work in commutative algebra and algebraic
geometry will examine the lattice structure of the set of prime ideals in the
Noetherian ring. The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or engineering
through research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas
through the investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host
campus. The proposed activities which contribute to the second objective
include: short visits by other prominent women mathematicians; meetings with
women graduate students in mathematics; teaching courses and participating in
seminars.
