9553579 Borasi The University of Rochester (NY) targets all 48 middle school
mathematics teachers in four area schools in an experimental model for Local
Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics. The four-year
project has a concomitant "research in practice" component involving the
ethnographic study of the reform efforts undertaken by the four schools and a
comprehensive evaluation of the outcomes of such efforts. The research is
expected to yield both basic and applied findings about "best practices" for
systemic reform in mathematics, especially at the middle school level. The
teacher enhancement component includes introductory and advanced summer
institutes and academic year inservice activities that support teachers and
school administrators as they build a shared vision for school mathematics and
that enable teachers to implement four of the NSF-funded middle school
curriculum projects (Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, Mathematics in Context,
Connected Mathematics, and MMAP). Each of the 48 teachers receives at least 140
hours of professional development. Of these 48, 8 lead teachers receive a
minimum of 220 hours of professional development. Project evaluation addresses
(1) the quality and effectiveness of the teacher enhancement component, (2)
outcomes of the systemic reform efforts promoted in the four target schools, (3)
the rigor and significance of the associated research. Estimated cost-sharing
from the University of Rochester, SUNY/Geneseo, Twelve Corners Middle School,
Merton Williams Middle School, Honeoye Falls-Lima Middle School, Ada Cosgrove
Middle School, and individual partners represents 165% of the NSF award amount.
