Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: NIRT: Dendrimer-
stabilized Nanoparticles for Next-generation Catalysts&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
Number: CTS-0103135&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:Harry
Ploehn&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted in response
to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 00-119). The
objective of this proposal is to design dendrimer-stabilized nanoparticles of
transition metals, bimetallic alloys, and transition metal oxides for use in
heterogeneous catalysis. Dendrimers, used as chemical templates and nanoparticle
stabilizers, provide an opportunity for precise control of the size,
composition, and arrangement of atoms in catalytic nanoparticles, as well as a
means for self-assembly and immobilization of nanoparticles in ordered two-
dimensional and three-dimensional arrays on surfaces. Catalyst activity,
selectivity, and lifetime will be improved by exploiting phenomena unique to
catalytic structures designed and fabricated on the nanoscale. Research and
educational activities include theoretical design, molecular modeling,
nanoparticle synthesis, catalyst preparation and evaluation. Through this
multidisciplinary activity, an overall goal is to design the next generation of
catalysts based on a rational atom-up approach. Additional support will be
provided to students through the three NSF-REU sites and through Sloan
Foundation Fellowships, aimed at increasing minority participation. This work
has the potential to improve the rational design of catalysts through molecular
modeling and synthesis of nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
