Professor Tate will work on refined conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
type. In particular, he will study a geometric analogue of this conjecture and
its possible connections with two dimensional class field theory. He will also
study regular graded associative algebras in dimensions greater than three. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
