The 1991 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental biology will be held at
the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA on the weekend of April 19-21.
This proposal requests funds to support graduate student attendance and
participation at the meeting. As a general goal, the Conference is organized
with the intent of bringing together a broad range of developmental biologists,
at various stages of their careers, to present and discuss their research in
formal and informal settings. further, we will continue to integrate research in
both plant and animal developmental biology in an effort to enhance the
communication between groups that have traditionally been separated. The
Conference will include four formal platform sessions, two poster presentation
sessions, and a keynote address; a format that proved quite successful at last
year's meeting. Additionally, the Conference will have a video microscopy
session and an informal workshop on the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction
technology. There will also be ample time for informal discussions.
Consequently, the revised format at this year's meeting will afford ample
opportunity for young investigators to present their research to an interested
audience.
