This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged in basic research in
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, and biochemistry under the direction
of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. A unique feature of this REU
program is that only women and minorities will be recruited.
