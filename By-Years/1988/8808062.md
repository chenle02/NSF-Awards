This workshop will bring together scientists actively working in conservation
biology, NSF administrators, and NPS managers to discuss the problems associated
with preserving biological diversity in the US national park system. The
objectives are to facilitate interactions, including cooperative research
programs, between scientists, a principal funding agency, and resource managers
and to encourage a programmatic focus on biological diversity by the NPS. The
product will be a series of short reports on specific problems concerning
biological diversity and the national park system jointly prepared by the
scientists and managers.
