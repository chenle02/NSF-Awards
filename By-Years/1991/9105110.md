The principal investigators will study phase equilibria as a function of
pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, and water fugacity for silicate magmas
ranging in composition from basaltic to dacitic and coexisting with a carbon-
oxygen-hydrogen system fluid. The results will give geologists information about
the origin and evolution of magmas in the Earth's lithosphere.
