The objective of this research project is to advance knowledge of developer
activity by conducting empirical studies on large software systems using an eye
tracker. Most eye tracking studies done in software engineering use small
snippets of software artifacts such as source code that are shown as images or
text. With software artifacts being hundreds of lines long, doing realistic
studies using a variety of software artifacts is not practical. To address this
problem, this research will develop a robust infrastructure that enables
implicit eye tracking within the working environment of the developer thereby
supporting inherent scrolling on large files and automating the linking of eye
gaze to artifact elements looked at. This infrastructure will advance the state
of the art in conducting eye tracking studies in software
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to inventing,
evaluating, and applying innovative methods and tools that use developer eye
gaze to support the developer in software engineering tasks such as code
summarization, code recommendations, and software traceability. Additional
activities that crosscut these three main directions are related to using eye
tracking as a benchmark and standardizing visual effort metrics. The broader
impacts of this work include developing educational course content, increased
mentoring of underrepresented undergraduate student groups, developing open
source software, producing large eye tracking datasets, and collaborating with
industry for assessment and validation of the proposed research. Educational
activities also include a strong K-12 outreach program to encourage students to
pursue a career in computing.
