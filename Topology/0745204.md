Abstract

Award: DMS-0745204 Principal Investigator: Mieczyslaw K. Dabkowski, Jozef H.
Przytycki, Viswanath Ramakrishna

The Workshop on Knots and Quantum Computing to be held at the University of
Texas at Dallas in November 2007 is the first of a planned series of conferences
devoted to the relationship between knot theory and other fields of science.
Plenary talks at this conference are expected to survey the state of existing
connections between knots and quantum computation, exemplified by Khovanov
homology, which is presently understood as a generalization of the Jones
polynomial or a similar invariant of a knot to a novel chain complex whose Euler
characteristic recovers the original polynomial invariant.

This conference is intended to provide a place for knot theorists and
researchers in quantum computing to communicate and to develop new connections
between their subjects. PhD students and recent PhDs are particularly encouraged
to attend and to apply for travel support from this award.
