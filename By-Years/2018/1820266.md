The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the agriculture market a long-term
solution to the problem of premature wear on components from oil leaks by
digitally monitoring oil levels in combines. The proposed product could be
adapted to many industries including agriculture, mining, construction, marine
water craft, chemical storage, military vehicles, and water storage. The
proposed product will preemptively warn equipment operators of low lubrication
levels thereby saving customers money from repairs or replacement of new
systems.

The proposed project will address the need of digitally monitoring oil
lubrication levels while producing a highly accurate measurement in real-time.
The solution will be non-contacting unlike current solutions that provide a
single low-level alarm or rely on manual checks. The prototype will be put in a
simulated as well as real-time environment to investigate endurance, accuracy,
stability, longevity, reliability and ease of installation. Objectives include:
(1) Find a solution/configuration to accurately monitor rapid level changes; (2)
Verify the hardware can withstand harsh conditions (extreme temperatures, high
vibration); (3) Software testing; and (4) Analyze different reservoirs to see
how the product can be easily mounted.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
