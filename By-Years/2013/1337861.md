Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The ice dynamics and tectonic history of Ice-
covered regions are poorly understood. Scientific investigations of these
regions are hindered by extreme weather and complex logistical support. The PIs
propose development of a new, rapid deployment, dense footprint, seismic
observatory for ice-covered regions, the Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice-
Covered Environments (GEOICE). This seismic array will provide increased
observational capabilities and logistical efficiencies needed to seismically
image the structures and dynamic behavior of both the solid Earth and overlying
ice in remote ice-covered regions. Instruments developed for GEOICE will be
designed to withstand icy and/or wet environments and require minimal logistics.
Research enabled by GEOICE includes: ice mass and sea level changes, solid earth
structure, tectonics and ice sheet stability, and deep Earth structure and
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;GEOICE will provide
a community tool for achieving a better understanding of the Earth's rapidly
changing polar and ice-covered regions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change's 2007 report concluded that poor understanding of glacial dynamics
prohibits robust estimates of future sea-level. GEOICE will enable research that
helps address this societally relevant issue. Simplified logistics enabled by
GEOICE could lower the technical and logistical barriers that hinder young
investigators in the polar regions.
