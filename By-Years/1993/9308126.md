9308126 Griffel The tunable semiconductor laser (SCL) is a key component in the
most advanced lightwave communication systems, which are based on frequency
tuning and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques. In these systems,
the tunable SCL is used as the light source for optical fiber links. Due to its
unique properties it is capable of efficiently delivering the high data rate of
information required in telecommunication and computer networks, CATV, LAN, etc.
Other important applications for the tunable SCL include frequency domain
optical memory (FDOM), optical pumping of Erbium doped fiber amplifiers and
solid state lasers, laser spectroscopy, as well as direct source for space
communication. In this project, we propose to carry out both theoretical and
experimental studies of a new class of composite-cavity semiconductor lasers
that consist of multi-active-section structures. Such semiconductor lasers have
been the subject of extensive research and development effort in the recent
years 1-5,9,10 , which was driven by their improved operation and finer
characteristic. As a result, single longitudinal mode, higher side-mode
suppression ratio, improved modulation efficiency, wider tuning range, and, in
the case of coupled cavities, high output power were obtained. However
understanding of many of these structures is incomplete, and comprehensive
design criteria have not yet been established. In a recent study we have
outlined the basis for modelling these devices, and used it for the specific
case of two-section gain-levered distributed-feedback SCL. The preliminary
results obtained so far, as well as other studies are extremely encouraging
3,5,8 and stress the necessity to acquire a better understanding to optimize
their operation. The study program is projected to include the theoretical and
experimental investigation of parameters such as modulation efficiency, optical
linewidth, tuning range, field patterns, as well as other pertinent
characteristics. ***
