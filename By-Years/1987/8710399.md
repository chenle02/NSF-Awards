The research explores the relationship of inertial properties to the dynamics of
human motion. The forces that determine motion can be divided into three
categories; reactionary, internal, and inertial. The emphasis is on the relative
contribution of the inertial forces of the motion. A method is devised to
determine the parameters for individuals. The investigation involves theoretical
and mathematical types of analysis as well as experimental. To predict
individual motion use is made of computer graphics simulation. This project is
one supported under Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
