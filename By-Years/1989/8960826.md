Polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors have been successfully applied to
liquid crystal displays on hard (softening point above 600 degrees c) glass
substrate, demonstrating the adequacy of their electrical characteristics for
such applications. Hard glass substrate were used because of the high processing
temperatures needed for the polysilicon transistors. Significant cost savings
could be realized, especially for large displays, if a borosilicate glass
(Corning 7059) could be used as the substrate. However, borosilicate glass is
limited to 575 degrees C processing temperature. This restriction affects the
electrical properties of thin-film transistors. We have developed a low
temperature (550 degrees C) process for fabricating polycrystal silicon TFT's.
In order to commercialize it for display applications, we need to further
investigate effects from the substrate, plasma doping, and channel etching as
well as select the best insulator. There are numerous patented applications of
this technique such as in Large-area displays, Imagers, Scanners, and Integrated
thin-film electronics.
