9634707 Moosbrugger This project is to study the effect of a changing
crystallographic texture in the case of cyclic material deformations. For
monotonic loadings these effects have been studied extensively, but for cyclic
deformations the understanding is poor. This lack of understanding affects crack
initiation models as well as crack growth and failure evaluations in general.
Grain size and texture play important roles in the dislocation substructures and
their interactions determine the residual stresses in metals. In this project a
combined modeling and experimental program will be studied in nickel single
crystals. With this data base, explicit polycrystalline models including
heterogeneous grain substructure will be built to study the influence of grain
size and texture on back stress in cyclic plasticity and ratchetting type
loading histories. ***
