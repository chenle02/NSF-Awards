Description: This project supports a U.S. guest scientist on sabbatical leave at
the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta for four months between January and
May of 1988. He is scheduled to lecture on the theory of hypergeometric series
and orthogonal polynomials and to conduct research into orthagonal polynomials
in several variables associated with intertwining operators for certain induced
representatives of the symmetric groups and the general linear groups over a
finite field. Scope: The P.I. is an active researcher who has visited India
before and spent one year at the prestigious Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research. His project now takes him to an excellent research institute in
Calcutta where significant research and graduate teaching is being done on
various aspects of mathematics, and statistics and their applications to various
science fields. His proposed visit will include, in addition to teaching,
research in an area where he hopes to develop computable theory of certain
polynomials, with large potential applications. His work at the ISI, calcutta is
likely to benefit his research, to benefit his Indian hosts and to lead to
future collaboration.
