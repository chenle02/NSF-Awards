This project will develop, field-test, evaluate, and disseminate a three-year
mathematics curriculum for middle school grades. The project is a joint
undertaking of teams at Michigan State University (the host institution), the
University of Maryland, and the University of North Carolina. The working title
of the proposed program, Connected Mathematics, has been chosen to suggest our
interest in developing student knowledge of mathematics that is rich in
connections--connections among the various topic strands of the subject,
connections between mathematics and its applications in other disciplines,
connections between the planned teaching/learning activities and the special
aptitudes and interests of middle school students and connections between the
preparation laid by elementary school mathematics and the goals of secondary
school mathematics.
