This grant supports the annual workshop for Women in Machine Learning (WiML).
This one-day workshop brings together female researchers in industry and
academia, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from the machine learning
community to exchange research ideas and build mentoring and networking
relationships. It will foster collaboration within the machine learning
community, featuring not only cutting-edge ideas from established researchers
but also from students, who will present their own research and receive valuable
feedback from both senior researchers and their peers. We expect that new
connections and research collaborations will be established, and will help to
advance the state-of-the-art of the field.

This workshop will provide a forum for female graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, junior and senior faculty, and industry and government research
scientists to exchange research ideas and establish networking and mentoring
relationships. Undergraduates, particularly those who are interested in pursuing
graduate school or industry positions in machine learning, are also welcome to
attend. Bringing together women from different stages of their careers gives
established researchers the opportunity to act as mentors, and enables junior
women to find female role models working in the field of machine learning. The
workshop will also benefit the wider machine learning community: The WiML
website includes a directory of over 400 women for organizations looking for
female invited speakers. Co-locating with a major machine learning conference
(a) enhances the visibility of the participants in the broader community and (b)
facilitates travel for WiML attendees to stay on for the main conference.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
