Sheridan 9709033 RESEARCH SUMMARY Communities of cyanobacterial species are
important in diverse ecosystems because they have the capacity to convert the
inert atmospheric gas nitrogen into ammonia fertilizer. These cyanobacterial
communities colonize habitats in which they are exposed to high intensity
ultraviolet light which is increasing in intensity due to depletion of the
ultraviolet absorbing ozone layer. Studies proposed include the strategies by
which these cyanobacteria adapt to ultraviolet light. The PI has presented the
results of preliminary experiments that they employ ultraviolet absorbing
pigments which confer protection to cell proteins from UV damage, and that
communities of cyanobacteria arrange the component species such that the UV
resistant species intercept UV with W sensitive species positioned in strata
beneath the upper screening species. When the stressor W is removed, the
community becomes disrupted resulting in severe UV damage to the enzymes
responsible for nitrogen fixation. 1
