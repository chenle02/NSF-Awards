This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the
genetics of species using biological informatics: interactions of gene flow,
selection, and dispersal." This simulation model uses parameters compiled from
biological databases to evaluate the role of gene flow, selection coefficients
and dispersal on the rate of allelic spread across subdivided populations. The
research provides information on how species may remain cohesive at only a
handful of major loci while simultaneously diverging at many minor loci, and has
implications for explaining the relationship between macro- and microevolution.
