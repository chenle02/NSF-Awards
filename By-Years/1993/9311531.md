This proposal will add a component to a research project in Central Asia that
is currently supported by the Division of Atmospheric Sciences. The PI will
determine the spatial and temporal variation of the chemical content of snow and
ice in central Asia in order to improve our understanding of the distribution of
chemical species in the atmosphere of this region. He plans to collect snow and
ice samples within the accumulation areas of ten different central Asian
glaciers. The glacierized regions in the Nepalese Himalayas which are extensive
and relatively free from the chemical influence of desert dust are an ideal
location from which to recover high resolution, regional scale glaciochemical
records detailing the annual variation in the strength of the Asian monsoon.
This research will be performed in cooperation with the Department of Hydrology
and Meteorology, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of Nepal. This proposal
seeks supplementary funds to support field work in Nepal and to support the
visit of a Nepalese hydrologist to the University of New Hampshire, Glacier
Research Group.
