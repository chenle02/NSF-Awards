Drs. Thaddeus and Gottlieb at Harvard University will continue a program of
laboratory investigation of molecules which are of astrophysical interest. With
prior NSF support they have developed equipment for studying the emission
characteristics of a number of molecules which may be present in interstellar
space. The development phase is essentially complete, and the major emphasis
with this grant will be on measurements which can be applied to astronomical
observations. Laboratory research on molecules which may be present in
interstellar gas and in circumstellar shells has played a crucial role in the
identification of a significant fraction of the exotic molecules which are now
known to exist in space. This effort is quickening because of new millimeter-
wave and submillimeter-wave observatories which are just beginning operation.
Drs. Thaddeus and Gottlieb will continue to direct one of the leading laboratory
astrophysics research efforts in the United States.
