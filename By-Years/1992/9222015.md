Foraging honey bees learn the locations of dozens of flower patches within a
10-kilometer radius of their nest, and perform a series of body movements
referred to as a "dance language" to communicate to nestmates the locations of
these sites. Memory of landmarks, and of the relationship between the landscape
and the sun's course, plays a prominent role in these behavioral feats. Dr.
Dyer's previous studies have clarified what bees learn about the relationships
among landmarks seen in different parts of their foraging range, and about the
course of the sun relative to the landscape. The present project will further
investigate the contents of spatial memory in experienced honey bees, and will
also attempt to uncover the processes whereby naive bees acquire information
about important spatial relationships in the environment. Honey bees are
extremely attractive subjects for such studies because their behavior poses some
intriguing problems, given the enormous scale and flexibility of the bees'
movements and the small size of their brain. At the same time, the behavior is
highly amenable to experimental exploration of the underlying processes. To the
extent that many other animals face navigational problems parallel to those
faced by honey bees, these studies can contribute to the development of general
theories about how nervous systems may be equipped to make use of inevitably
limited processing capacity.
