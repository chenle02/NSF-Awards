The Physics Department at Mount Holyoke is expanding and upgrading experiments
for two upper-level physics courses and one advanced laboratory course, with
emphasis on the dramatic effects of fundamental quantum mechanics. The new
experiments are: The Mossbauer Effect and Angular Polarization Correlation of
Two Photon Annihilation Radiation (the Einstein, Podolsky Rosen paradox). The
experiments being upgraded are: Double Slit Photon Interference and Accelerator-
Based Rutherford Scattering. These experiments blend well with existing
instrumentation and faculty expertise in the department, and with the modern
physics course structure. With these experiments students have opportunities to
experimentally investigate and become intrigued by some of the most fundamental
and counter-intuitive aspects of quantum theory.The major pieces of equipment
provided by the grant that are needed to carry out these upgrades include: 1) a
high vacuum turbo pumping system and a PC-based multichannel analyzer, both of
which find many other uses within the Physics Department; 2) two radioactive
sources Na-22 and Co-58; and 3) some NIM electronics, the remainder to be
supplied by the department. The turbo pump is being used to improve the
Rutherford Scattering experiment. The data analysis capability of the PC is
being used in the Mossbauer experiment and in the double slit photon
interference experiment.
