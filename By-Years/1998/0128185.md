This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
demonstrate the feasibility of using an agitation device based on a resonating
elastic member for dispersing and coalescing immiscible liquids. This will have
a significant impact in the liquid processing for solvent extraction of metals.
The proposed technology offers a mixing regime that promotes high mass transfer,
yet easy disengagement between immiscible liquids by forming uniform droplet
dispersions and creating interfacial activity that increases mass transport. The
post-contact phase disengagement can be further enhanced by applying higher
frequency energy.

The near term commercial application would be presented by the changing
technological landscape of the international mining and metals industries. The
shift to leaching technology has created a need for advanced solvent extraction
equipment. Applications also exist in the pharmaceutical industry, where solvent
extraction is an entrenched and accepted approach to recovering products from
microbial fermentation broths.
