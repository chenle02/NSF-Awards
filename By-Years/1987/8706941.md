This research involves an integrated experimental and theoretical study of the
elastic behavior and equation of state of important Earth-forming minerals at
high pressure and temperature. Material of specific interest include MgO, NaC1,
SiO2, olivine (fayalite), (Mg,Fe,Cr)-spinels, and iron oxide (fexO) and sulfide
(FexS). Particular emphasis is being placed on an evaluation of higher-order
elastic properties and their use and significance in defining more accurate
expressions for the equation of state in the very high pressure-temperature
regime. A large cubic-anvil press system incorporating a solid-liquid pressure.
