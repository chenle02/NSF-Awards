There is a strong need to develop the knowledge base that will enable the
rational design of improved crop species. Towards this objective, the 2019 Plant
Cell Dynamics meeting, which will be held from June 18th - 21st at the
Pennsylvania State University, provides a forum for the North American plant
cell biology community to come together to develop a better understanding of
plant cell organelle and cell dynamics. It will also provide the opportunity for
plant cell biologists to develop collaborative efforts, build a larger, stronger
community and exchange knowledge in the pursuit of quantitative, theory driven
cell biology. One of the meeting major goals is to understand how plant cells
integrate metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, and vesicle trafficking during
growth and in response to environmental challenges. By encouraging and
supporting attendance of trainees from underrepresented groups, the conference
will broaden participation in this developing field, which employs techniques of
quantitative, predictive, and theory-driven biology, and encourages
multidisciplinary approaches. By encouraging and supporting attendance of
trainees from underrepresented groups, the conference will broaden participation
in this developing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include
keynote talks from experts in the field of plant cell biology as well as
workshops on organelle tracking, scientific reproducibility and career
development. There will be opportunities for oral and poster presentations by
trainees as well as participation in the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
