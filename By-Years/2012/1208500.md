To enable natural and productive human-robot interaction (HRI), a co-robot must
both understand and control "proxemics" -- the social use of space -- in order
to communicate in ways commonly used and understood by humans. This project
focuses on answering the question: How do social (speech and gesture),
environmental (loud noises and low lighting), and personal (hearing and visual
impairments) factors influence positioning and communication between humans and
co-robots, and how should a co-robot adjust its social behaviors to maximize
human perception of its social signals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
develop principled computational models for the recognition and control of
proxemic co-robot behavior in HRI using both telepresence and autonomous co-
robots. The research will establish a foundational component of HRI for co-
robotics, with specific impact on special needs users in socially assistive
contexts -- particularly the elderly, both aging in place and in institutions --
with the goal of mitigating isolation and depression, and encouraging exercise
and socialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The work will inform
robot design and control, and provide software and a corpus of public HRI data
for use by researchers worldwide. Beyond robotics, the project promises to
inform, validate, and extend longstanding research in the social sciences. This
project also includes a strong public and K-12 outreach component consisting of
weaving the HRI themes being developed into annual regional and international
outreach events. The events feature large-scale open houses and educational
workshops with interactive demonstrations and hands-on activities that highlight
human factors in computational systems as an effective means of increasing
interest in STEM-related activities.
