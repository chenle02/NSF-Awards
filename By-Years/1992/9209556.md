This project proposes to study the taxonomic relationships among the species of
a group of passion flowers. Although the genus Passiflora comprises about 450
New World species, this study will focus on 70 species in the group with a
common haploid chromosome number of n = 9. This group contains the majority of
the showy- flowered and cultivated species which have edible fruit. The method
proposed for this taxonomic study is the comparative analysis of the chlorpolast
DNA using restriction site enzymes. Chloroplast DNA is usually inherited only
through the female plant, but chloroplasts have been reported to be present in
the pollen tubes of one species, so artificial hybrids will be analysed with
their known female and pollen parents to test the inheritance pattern of the
chloroplast DNA in Passiflora. Nuclear ribosomal DNA will also be used to test
field collected species for possible hybrid origin. The data obtained in this
study should be of use, not only to shed light on the relationships of this
group of passion flowers, but also to elucidate the relationships among a group
of Neotropical butterflies in the genus Heliconius whose larvae feed exclusively
on the leaves of Passiflora species.
