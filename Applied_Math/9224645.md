This project will support travel by the principal investigator to two
international conferences: (1) a conference on corner singularities for elliptic
boundary value problems to be held in Luminy, France and (2) a conference on
numerical analysis, to be held at the Nankai Institute, in Tianjin, China. The
principal investigator will actively participate in both programs by giving
lectures on the topics of the conferences.
