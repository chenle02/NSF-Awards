This Connecting Researchers and Public Audiences project will engage the public
in understanding how species are born. The project builds on the PI's NSF-funded
research on speciation and signal diversification in Monarcha Flycatchers of the
Solomon Islands (NSF CAREER, #1137624). Project deliverables include a one-hour
television program, website, and the use of social media. The team proposes to
film an engaging tale that weaves historical research with modern molecular
techniques to communicate to the public how new species are born. It will also
illustrate the process of science and the people behind the research.

The potential national audience is large, with a particular effort to reach
18-49 year olds. The program will be nationally distributed by one of the major
television or cable channels. The website will provide a video gallery of short
videos and photos, a blog from the field, and an in-depth learning section with
new research about speciation.

Evaluation of the project, conducted by Education Northwest, will focus on
changes in audience knowledge and interest about speciation. The findings of the
summative evaluation will be made available online at InformalScience.org.
