Understanding why and how the deep continental crust flows at high temperature
and pressure is central to understanding a broad range of geologic processes.
There is however, uncertainty about how to quantify the influence of many
factorsÂ¬-including rock composition, temperature, grain size, strain, fluid
activity, and/or degree of melting. This research uses the ages and compositions
of the minerals titanite, rutile and zircon to test which factors permitted or
inhibited the flow of continental crust at high pressure and temperature in a
well-understood part of Norway. The impact of this research should be
considerable and broad because of the archetypal nature of the Norwegian
terrane. Although this proposal is targeted toward understanding why the deep
continental crust flows, it will also help pinpoint why mineral reactions in
Earth are sometimes very slow. Answers to these questions address why Earth?s
tectonic plates move, why earthquakes occur, how long mountain ranges exist, and
the composition of Earth's crust. This project provides training and research
for U.S. students and brings together scientists and students from the U.S.,
Norway, and France, providing cross-cultural experiences that ensure that the
collaborative impact of this project will be long lasting. The laboratory
approach in this project is relatively new and its continued development will
enable further expansion into other fields, such as biology.
