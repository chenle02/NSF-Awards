The objective of this proposal is to better understand the physics of the
current sheet in the Earth's magnetotail. The PIs will clarify the role, as
current carriers, of charged particles that do not obey the guiding center
approximations. The study will concentrate on the detailed modeling of mesoscale
structures rather than on an attempt to generate less exact models of the entire
tail. A series of magnetic field models and corresponding model current sheets
will also be developed. Finally, a specific magnetic field model will test the
suggestion that variations in ion orbit types in the tail can be important to
the generation of auroral field-aligned or Birkeland currents. ***
