The PIs will conduct a comprehensive study of the mesospheric metal layers in
the Arctic. This will employ two field-proven laser systems to carry out
simultaneous common volume observations of at least two species in each
observation period. A resonance lidar already operating at Poker Flat will
perform the daytime observations. The PI will extend current observations by
installing a second lidar system to sound other mesospheric metal species
against a continuous set of sodium observations. This will provide a set of
comprehensive high-resolution, long-duration benchmark observations for studying
a variety of aeronomy issues in the mesopause region. These observations will be
supported by ongoing OH interferometer, all-sky camera, and photometer and
magnetometer observations. In addition, collaborators at the University of
Pennsylvania will analyze the results with time-resolved models.
