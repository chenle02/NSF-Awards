The U.S.-Mexico Border region has unique problems related to water resources.
The Rio Grande/Rio Bravo is the major watershed of the bi-national region. The
river serves as an important natural resource for industry, agriculture,
domestic water supply, recreation, and wildlife habitat fro both countries.
Unfortunately, the Rio Grande is also a conduit for infectious microorganisms
and toxic pollutants. A variety of activities contributing to the chemical and
microbial contamination of source water have been identified and include
improperly installed and maintained septic systems, landfill, injection wells,
land application of waste, irrigation, runoff, and animal feed lots. This
project is a collaborative effort between El Paso County Community College and
the Water Quality Center at Arizona State University. The objective of this
project is to conduct a comprehensive and comparative study to determine the
source of fecal contamination at four sites of the Rio Grande river using 1)
Antibiotic Resistance Analysis of fecal streptococci, 2) Antibiotic Resistance
Analysis of E coli, 3) Ribotyping of selected E. coli isolates, and 4)
Genotyping of E. coli and F-RNA bacteriophages.
