This research will involve collaboration between Prof. J. T. Stuart of Imperial
College, London and Applied Mathematicians at Brown University. The work will
focus on a mathematical study of stability and transition in fluid flows.
Problems to be examined include turbulent slugs and turbulent-laminar interfaces
in the flow of a fluid in a pipe or channel. The vortex breakdown problem will
also be investigated. The visit by Prof. Stuart should enhance interaction
between U.S. and English Applied Mathematicians. The research should enhance our
understanding of the transition process from laminar to turbulent flows.
Transition is an important issue in many practical contexts in aerodynamics and
other applied areas.
