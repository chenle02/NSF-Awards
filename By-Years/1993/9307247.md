9307247 Cook The goal of this research is to understand how animals, including
humans, rapidly see and recognize visual objects. Dr. Cook's new research
elaborates on his prior NSF-supported research looking at the perception and
processing of textured stimuli by pigeons. These birds are ideal for comparative
visual studies because the demands for accurate and rapid perception during
flight, in conjunction with the need to minimize body weight, have caused them
to evolve very small, but powerful, visual systems. This makes them a rich
source of comparative information about how small nervous systems solve the very
complex problems of perception. In conjunction with research investigating
humans and other animals, the results will help to identify those general rules
and mechanisms shared by many species and those that are unique. One implication
of the prior work was that the early stages of visual processing in pigeons and
humans share many common characteristics. The new research continues to examine
this issue by investigating the contributions of stimulus-driven and subject-
driven processes in the discrimination of multi-element stimuli by pigeons, and
by humans when appropriate. Besides its psychological implications, information
from this research will have potential practical applications in the engineering
of small, self- sufficient, intelligent robots and the development of compact
visual prostheses for the visually impaired.
