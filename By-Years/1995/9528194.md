This is a research planning grant developing modeling and simulation aigorithms
to assess system performance and to recreate events so as to interpret cause-
effect relationships. The research planning activities focus on investigating
the potential for developing accurate, general purpose modeling techniques that
include compressing multiple experiments (variations of effects on the model)
while allowing internal observation to expose the perturbations that caused the
outcome. The grant resources are being used to contact other researchers
involved in related efforts; and to investigate issures involved in expanding
existing concurrent algorithms to areas beyond digital logic modeling and
experimentation.
