We are encouraging the spread of VLSI design education to a wider range of
institutions. The increased availability of VLSI design courses and fabrication
through MOSIS is important not only because of educational relevance, but also
because of the industrial need for designers with VLSI skills. We plan to help
with the entry of VLSI design into curricula at institutions that are otherwise
not able to cope with the relatively costly initial steps, which are teacher
preparation and installation of computer hardware and software appropriate for
computer-aided design. The proposed educators conference and exposition are
efficient means for spreading know-how needed for informed entry into VLSI
education. The technical leadership for this event will come from Mr. Paul
Losleben. He is one of the pioneers in VLSI fabrication service and particularly
well qualified to lead the proposed effort. He has delineated a sound plan. The
requested funds, which are modest, are adroitly leveraged. The proposed
conference and exposition are promising, practical and cost-effective steps for
helping the expansion of VLSI design education in U.S. institutions.
