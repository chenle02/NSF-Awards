Studies of the systematics and evolution of polyploid mosses (those with
duplicated sets of chromosomes) will be continued by researchers at the
University of Georgia, making use of protein electrophoresis and other molecular
techniques. Earlier work by the group has discovered at least four cases of
allopolyploidy in the moss family Mniaceae (chromosome doubling following
hybridization between genetically different populations). This important mode of
speciation in other land plants had not been documented previously in any
bryophyte. Work will focus on five complementary projects: 1. New studies of
haploid-polyploid species pairs in the moss genera Cinclidium, Plagiomnium
section Plagiomnium, Plagiomnium section Rostrata, and Mnium section
Laevinervia; 2. Detailed studies of the taxonomic distribution of isozyme (gene)
duplications to assess phylogenetic relationships within the family; 3.
Comparisons of genetic variation in selected species that show
intercontinentally disjunct distributions; 4. Analyses using DNA markers to
clarify further the progenitors of certain allopolyploids; and 5. Cladistic
analyses of species-level phylogenies based on morphological and isozyme data.
The research will provide new insights into phylogenetic relationships in the
moss family Mniaceae, and will also provide taxonomic updating for work toward
the moss component of the Flora of North America enterprise.
