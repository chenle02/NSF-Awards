9402246 Duda This is the first year award of a three-year project to
investigate the creation and evaluation of a process model of how humans locate
sounds in three dimensions. Emphasis is placed in understanding well-
established but yet incompletely understood psycho-acoustical phenomena. An
example of such phenomena is the human perception capability of determining
whether sounds come from above or below without binaural differentiation of the
sounds reaching the ears; another example is the ability to locate sounds in
reverberant environments with multiple sound sources where echoes and
reflections become virtual sound sources. Another one yet is the ability to
judge distance to a sound source since loudness alone is not an adequate cue.
This model is based not only on physical sound propagation effects but also on
neurophysiological studies tracing the auditory pathways from the cochlea to the
auditory cortex. The model extends current computational cochlea models by
incorporating mono- and binaural, temporally-based, correlation methods for
source-locality information extraction. The ability to understand these
mechanisms allows the recognition of sounds and speech by computers in everyday
environments, thereby improving the effectiveness of speech recognition in
human-computer interaction.
