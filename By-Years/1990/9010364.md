Andreou Analog VLSI is a promising approach to the design of systems for machine
vision since it leads to distributed, data driven architectures, that map the
light stimuli directly to the crux of computing hardware, the silicon substrate.
This emerging class of signal processing systems is based on relatively simple
computational primitives such as logarithmic photodetectors, aggregating
resistive networks and coupled non-linear resistive networks. Furthermore, there
are power and area efficient features that make them attractive for wafer scale
integration. However, manufacturing of such systems at the wafer scale will
strongly depend on establishing design methodologies that make them robust to
defects in the fabrication process. Equally important, these must be augmented
with yield estimation models as well as testing and failure analysis procedures.
The above issues are addressed in this research in a comprehensive program that
involves both analytical calculations and experimental studies.
