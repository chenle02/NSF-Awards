A project is to be undertaken to further our understanding of linear stochastic
wave fields, waves which have suffered sufficient randomizing scatterings or
reflections as to lose most coherence. Such fields are present in applications
of ultrasonics in many modern materials, and on sufficiently long time scales in
most finite elastic bodies, in reverberation rooms for which the application is
conventional acoustics, and in complex irregular structures for which accurate
acoustics and vibrational descriptions have long been sought. The proposed
project consists of two main thrusts. Laboratory and analytic work will be
conducted on ultrasonic fields in strongly heterogeneous but statistically
homogeneous media, which special emphasis on applications in ultrasonic
nondestructive evaluation and on seeking the effects of residual coherence in
such fields by demonstration the long-sought phenomenon of classical wave
Anderson Localization. A second thrust consisting of large scale computational
work on the responses of model reverberation rooms will also be conducted, with
a view towards better understanding of eigenmode statistics with consequent
potential impact on improved statistical models of the structural acoustics of
complex systems.
