This project provides travel support for graduate students and early career
scientists to attend the Chapman conference on Volcanism and the Earth's
Atmosphere. The Chapman conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the
American Geophysical Union that are designed to promote opportunities not
normally available through the format of larger scientific meetings. This year's
Chapman Conference will focus on the effects of volcanic eruptions on the
Earth's atmosphere and environment and marks the 10th anniversary of these
conferences. The meeting will be held on the island of Thera in Greece, the site
of the Santorini eruption in the Late Bronze Age and one of the most important
volcanic eruptions that profoundly affected civilization. It will draw together
experts from the climatology, volcanology, glaciology, and petrology communities
to review recent work and plan for joint efforts to further progress in this
field.
