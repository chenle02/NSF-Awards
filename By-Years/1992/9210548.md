This project will develop and analyze algorithms for multipoint routing in
communication networks. A multipoint connection, instead of joining just two
hosts by a path, joins a set of two or more hosts; and instead of a single path,
a multipoint connection consists of a set of links and switches creating
multiple paths, usually in the form of a tree. The underlying model used here is
a connection oriented communication network represented by an undirected graph
with edge costs. In addition, bandwidth is reserved for each connection, so that
communication delay is not the main consideration, but, instead, the main
criteria for route selection is the minimal usage of network resources. Finally,
since a practical multipoint routing algorithm must be able to deal with a set
of hosts that changes over time, the dynamic Steiner tree problem is the
appropriate graph theoretic model for this problem. This investigation will
include empirical studies of routing algorithms through the use of a routing
simulator along with the more theoretical analysis. The primary objective is to
develop more efficient multipoint routing algorithms that will allow future
networks to effectively support a wide range of applications such as conference
calls and video broadcasts.
