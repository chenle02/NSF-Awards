Problem: Probability and statistics are vital tools in a wide variety of fields
and professions, from astronomy to zoology, and its teaching can be improved
substantially with resampling. Next to calculus, statistics is probably the most
taught course on college campuses. It also may be one of the least successful--
students strain to remember or crib from formulae that distract them from the
key tasks of problem formulation and data analysis. Computer-intensive
resampling (an innovative technique now widely accepted among statisticians but
not yet widely taught) allows students to determine sampling distributions and
solve problems empirically with simulations based on sample data, rather than
memorizing formulae. Objectives: This project will provide workshops to assist
instructors in teaching introductory statistics using a resampling approach.
Resampling is the repeated drawing of simulated samples, often from the given
data, to observe the behavior of some statistic or estimate of interest.
Bootstrap, Monte Carlo, and resampling counterparts to permutation
(randomization) methods also are included. Sometimes the term "computer-
intensive methods" is used to refer to these methods generally. Activities:
There will be an initial series of meetings with instructors who already teach
resampling, or order to learn the issues that arise during resampling education.
Next, workshops for interested statistics instructors will be held. Participants
will be provided with the materials they need to return to their institutions
and teach resampling. Follow-up questionnaires will be sent to participants to
assess their experience. A web site will offer some of the same materials. Two
follow-up workshops will be held in order to have in-person meetings with
participants to discuss their experiences in teaching resampling methods--an
"innovate, assess, adjust" cycle.
