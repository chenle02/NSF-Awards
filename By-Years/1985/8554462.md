This research will analyze the factors that influence how long math and science
teachers stay in teaching. These factors include personal demographic
characteristics, subject area specializations, salaries, and school district
characteristics. The investigators will use methodologies, known as waiting time
models, that have not been used previously in studying teachers' career paths.
They will apply these powerful methodologies to three longitudinal data sets,
from rich data on individual teachers in Colorado, Michigan, and North Carolina.
The research will emphasize comparisons between math and science teachers and
other teachers, between teachers trained to teach particular sciences, between
time periods (early 1970's versus early 1980's), and between regions of the
country. The results should be valuable for two reasons. First, they will inform
policy discussions about how to increase the attractiveness of the teaching
profession to college graduates with math and science training. Second, they
should provide information useful in improving the teacher demand and supply
models used to predict teacher shortages and surpluses.
