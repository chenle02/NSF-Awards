Pillage The research is on developing simulation capabilities at the system
level, which are as powerful as those at the chip level. To this end, tools
which are applicable at the integrated circuit, packaging, module, and board
levels without loss of generality are being developed. Specific areas being
investigated are: fast extraction techniques which trade off some accuracy for
efficiency; and simulation models and techniques to enable topdown design.
Timing analysis of boards or multi-chip modules requires development of tools
for the extraction, characterization and simulation of transmission lines at the
system simulation level. Toward this end interconnect macro- models, similar to
those for on-chip RC interconnect circuits, which are compatible with system-
level design automation tools, are being explored.
