The over-arching goal of this project is to increase science literacy of general
education learners who may not become scientists. The specific goal of this
project is to create a well-researched oceanography course, live and online,
widely disseminated, with a modern inquiry based pedagogy. The design focuses on
science literacy using real earth data, collaboration between learners, and a
strong connection to societal issues. The project is based on a successful NSF
CCLI pilot project that supported the creation of software and course materials
that enables online auto-graded homework assignments, scientific writing
activities, on demand grade calculation, and peer interaction, with powerful
instructor assessment capability. It has been tested, refined, and evaluated in
two live oceanography classes at the University of California, Santa Barbara
(UCSB). New capability is being created to support the fully online course with
collaborative projects with strong peer to peer interactions. An instructor team
consists of faculty from four California community colleges, two California
state colleges, two large state universities (not including UCSB), and a small
private college. Yearly workshops support team collaboration and dissemination
of technology and pedagogy. Major themes include the integration of technology
in education and faculty development. This project is having an impact on
teacher education and diversity through the composition of the project team,
some of whom have been active in teacher preparation and/or teach at campuses
with a diverse student population.
