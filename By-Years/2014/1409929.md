This award by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program to Professor Kara L. Bren
of the University of Rochester will support the development of biomolecular
catalysts for the production of hydrogen fuel from water. Hydrogen is an
attractive, clean fuel because it is energy dense and when burned, produces only
water as a byproduct. In this project, Professor Bren will prepare and optimize
inexpensive, nontoxic hydrogen evolution catalysts consisting of peptides bound
to metal ions. Successful catalysts will be interfaced with light-absorbing
molecules to create an artificial photosynthetic system that allows sunlight to
drive hydrogen production. This award will support the training of graduate
students in state-of-the art biochemical, electrochemical, and photochemical
techniques. To enhance the diversity of the scientific workforce, this award
also will support the participation of hearing-impaired students from the
National Technical Institute for the Deaf in research seminars and summer
research at the University of Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop a new class of hydrogen evolution catalysts consisting of small
metallopeptides. Metallopeptides are attractive catalysts because they are easy
to synthesize, soluble in water, modular, and genetically encodable. These
properties facilitate the preparation, modification, and incorporation of
catalysts into functional assemblies. Modifications to the catalysts will be
made by altering the charge, hydrogen-donor ability, coordinating groups, and
flexibility of the peptide ligands. The hydrogen evolution activity will be
tested electrochemically. Variants of the catalysts will be prepared to optimize
their stability, turnover frequency, and overpotential. Catalysts that perform
well by these measures will be incorporated into biosynthetic assemblies for
light-driven hydrogen evolution. Success in this project will provide
environmentally friendly, water-soluble systems for the storage of solar energy
in the form of hydrogen fuel.
