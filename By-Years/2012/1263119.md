This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation
supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site led by Professors
David Paul and Julie Stenken both at the University of Arkansas. The REU Program
entitled "Encouraging Students in Science" will motivate a diverse group of
students to pursue careers in scientific research. The nine participants will be
integrated into different research groups and activities are planned to promote
student independence and to develop professional skills and judgment during the
ten week summer program. Each participant will be given the opportunity to
present his/her research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a
summary of their work in a journal format that will be compiled for distribution
to their home institution. The participants will be provided an experience which
will not only enable them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical
research, but will also expose them to an environment indicative of what they
can expect in graduate school.

The program will help to prepare young scientists for global competition in
science and innovation. The nine participants will be sophomore or junior
undergraduate students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry. Special efforts
will be made to recruit women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented
among professional chemists. The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, Department
of Chemistry and Biochemistry has established procedures that will assure
success in the recruitment of students from these groups. This aspect of the
recruitment plan will utilize the University's infrastructure in minority
recruiting. Previously, these methods have been successful by recruiting into
the program 54% women and 33% underrepresented minorities (African American or
Native American). The majority of the previous REU participants have continued
their studies post baccalaureate in chemistry or biochemistry, with many of the
participants attaining positions of responsibility in the chemical industry, or
as graduate students at Ph.D.-granting academic institutions.
