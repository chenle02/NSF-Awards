The funding will support the attendance of eight graduate students at the 9th
Winter Conference on Nuclear Dynamics to be held in Fort Myers, Florida, in
January 1993. This series of workshops brings together experts representing the
full spectrum of nuclear dynamics, ranging from low-energy reactions at ATLAS,
Holifield, and Daresbury through medium- energy collisions at many laboratories
to high-energy interactions at AGS, CERN, and RHIC. The workshop proceedings
will be published.
