The Fellow plans to develop and evaluate a series of mathematical models of
global biogeochemical cycles with particular attention to the carbon cycle.
These models will help clarify an understanding of global climate change and, in
particular, elucidate the role and function of the carbonate- silicate cycle in
effecting long-term climate change. The Fellow has chosen the Pennsylvania State
University as his tenure institution.
