This project is integrating a portable planetarium into a preservice teacher-
preparation program. The three objectives for this project are: (1) to improve
the astronomy knowledge of preservice teachers; (2) to improve the instructional
skills of preservice teachers; and (3) to develop effective curriculum materials
to augment the planetarium environment as an effective laboratory setting for
observation. The unit is being integrated into a physics course, specifically
designed for elementary education majors, and in an elementary science teaching
methods course.
