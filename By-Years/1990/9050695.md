Instrumentation is being used to equip a new biochemistry laboratory to provide
students with a thorough understanding of fundamental principles and techniques.
Instruments include a microcentrifuge for sample preparation; gel
electrophoresis units for the application of both vertical and horizontal
techniques; a shaker for gel treatments; a transilluminator system for
visualization of DNA; scanning UV-visible spectrophotometers with a modular
temperature controller and densitometer unit for characterization of biological
molecules, assays of enzymatic reactions, and quantitation of gels and
autoradiograms; a table top ultracentrifuge with rotors for demonstrations of
the theory and applications of centrifugation; refrigerator units; and a water
bath. Establishment of this laboratory increases the number of students able to
receive a comprehensive laboratory experience from zero to twenty-four per year.
The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
