This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on developing
Visual Performance Instruments (VPIs) that will enable the Deaf and hard of
hearing both to appreciate music and to perform in a medium that serves as a
visual analog of music. Object-oriented control software for these devices will
be capable of processing musical data in a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital
Interface) format, and generate choreography based on this music for a 3-D
visual display. The displays will be choreographable sculptural media designed
to be as emotionally evocative and flexible as possible. The VPIs will be visual
analogies of musical instruments, in that they are equipped with control
interfaces such that they can be played directly in real time. The instruments
can be extended or combined to produce visual orchestras, accessible to Deaf,
hard of hearing, and hearing individuals. The controlling software will allow
direct programming of the VPIs by the non-technician, thus enabling composers to
score pieces to be played by VPIs without a musical intermediary. Proposed Phase
I research on visual performance instruments is viewed as a natural extension of
TechnoFrolic's research into interactive, choreographable, 3-D display media.
TechnoFrolics' patented technology is emotionally-engaging and highly
expressive, but is currently unable to respond automatically to music. They feel
that by adding this capability, they would have an exciting medium capable of
translating music into a visual performance, much like dance or theater. Such a
medium would enable the Deaf and hard of hearing to appreciate music on a new
level of understanding. In addition, by refining the user interfaces on the
displays, they can create visual instruments which can be played directly.
