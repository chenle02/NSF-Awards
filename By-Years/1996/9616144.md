9716144 Randall This is an award to support research the objective of which is
to provide a more rational basis than now exists for design of biologically
based wastewater treatment processes that have the capability for reducing the
phosphorus content of their effluents. The research involves determination of
conditions that necessitate the need for a prefermentation phase to produce
nonvolatile fatty acids in comparison with conditions where the
anaerobic/reaction phase of the treatment process precludes need for a
prefermentation phase. Results of this research are expected to be used in
determination of conditions under which prefermentation is a necessary step in
enhanced removal of phosphorus from wastewater by use of biological processes.
This knowledge is expected to be used in improving the engineering design of
biologically-based, phosphorus removal processes and systems. Biologically-based
processes have the advantage over physical-chemical processes in reducing the
amounts of process residuals, improved dewatering characteristics of the
residuals and capability of being integrated with biologically-based
denitrification processes. ***
