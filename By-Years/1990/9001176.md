This proposed work aims to measure the low temperature and high pressure
properties of beta- and beta"-alumina, and beta"-alumina containing various
divalent and trivalent ions. The high purity materials to be investigated will
be prepared in-house. Information on the transport properties and internal
structure and mechanisms of these materials are of great technological interest
both as fast ion conductors and optical materials and laser hosts.
