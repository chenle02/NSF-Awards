The project's purpose is to obtain instrumentation to enhance the economics
curriculum in the areas of quantitative analysis and macroeconomic modeling. The
equipment will provide students the opportunity for "hands on" research
experience in upper level departmental courses. The workshop will concentrate on
macroeconomic model building with an emphasis on the HOWS II model, an
econometric model of the U.S. economy developed in a macro policy workshop over
the past few years. The workshop will be located in a specific space on campus
and used exclusively by students and faculty involved in upper level economics
courses with an emphasis on research oriented and/or model building efforts. The
project will support the acquisition of computer equipment for use in the
macroeconomic workshop that will continue through the entire academic year and
extend through the summer months with a student/faculty research emphasis.
