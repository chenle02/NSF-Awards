This engineering education research project will support a workshop for high
level decision makers across the government, industry, and academia to explore
how to align the interests of various groups to help veterans transition from
military service into careers in engineering. The workshop will widely
communicate the outcomes to policy makers across organizations and produce
several archival position papers that can help guide future
policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arises from the potential impact on the engineering and STEM workforce.
By seeking alignment between military service and academic course work, there
may be ways to boost the nation's STEM workforce while drawing on the talent
pool represented by veterans. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals
of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce
with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society
by informing educational policy and practices.
