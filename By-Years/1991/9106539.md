In this project, the PI will deploy about 50 RAFOS floats and an associated
tracking network in the western North Pacific to study the subsurface
circulation during 1992-1995. The majority of these floats will be deployed at a
depth of 1000 meters, with the remainder at a depth of 3000 meters. Most of
these floats will fulfil, in part, the requirements for the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) in the western North Pacific, while all will be in
collaboration with a Navy (Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research
Laboratory) effort in the same region to study western boundary currents in
addition to the general circulation in the region.
