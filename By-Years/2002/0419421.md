This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to enhance the
efficacy of a new anti-cancer drug, based on a novel lead molecule, through
combinatorial chemistry. Preliminary data have shown that this drug, in higher
doses, has the ability to kill cancerous cells while leaving non-cancerous cells
unaffected.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of anti-cancer
therapeutics for treatment of breast cancer.
