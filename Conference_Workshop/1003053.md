This award supports travel for participants in the conference "Frontiers in
Nonlinear Waves," held at the University of Arizona on 26-29 March 2010. The
conference centers on: 1. Soliton theory and applications 2. Coherent structures
and wave collapse 3. Wave and hydrodynamic turbulence, atmosphere and ocean
dynamics 4. Pattern formation in materials, fluids, and biology 5. Nonlinear
optics, laser physics, and optical communications 6. Waves in random media

The meeting features plenary lectures from twelve leaders in the field, and over
thirty invited lectures by other leading researchers. An afternoon session is
scheduled for talks by young scientists, and there is an evening poster session
for contributed papers.

The conference brings together experts from a variety of fields in which methods
of nonlinear wave theory are making important contributions. The meeting will
attract a diverse audience, expose junior researchers to state of the art
research and to important future challenges, and establish connections between
researchers working on singularity formation in different areas of applied
mathematics. Results of the meeting will be disseminated via publication and
video recording. The conference encourages and supports participation by members
of groups under-represented in mathematics, junior researchers, and graduate
students without other sources of support.
