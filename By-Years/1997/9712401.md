The "computational geometry to mathematical programming" (CGtoMP) reduction
strategy has three parts. 1) Formulate a task involving complex interactions
between non-convex geometric objects as an optimization problem. 2) Develop
algorithms of computational geometry that reduce the geometric problem to a non-
geometric optimization problem. 3) Solve the optimization problem using
techniques from mathematical programming: linear, quadratic, convex, and integer
programming. Using the CGtoMP strategy, this project will develop theory,
algorithms, and software directed towards several related application domains:
layout and packing on isotropic materials, glass, metal, etc.; stereo-
lithography; molecular modeling, computer vision, and curve/surface fitting;
entertainment and scientific visualization; robust computational geometry.
Accordingly, the work has the following specific goals. Packing and Animation:
develop algorithms to pack and animate rotating and/or three dimensional
objects. Geometric Conditioning: by solving an optimization problem, "condition"
coordinates whose values are causing numerical/geometric inconsistencies and
thereby achieve robust set operations on curved and/or multidimensional
geometric objects. Realism in Animation/Visualization: formulate laws of motion
as an optimization problem (such as Hamilton's "principle of least action") in a
way that can be solved rapidly by a CGtoMP algorithm. Theory and Experiment:
examine both theoretical complexity and practically achievable running times of
packing and animation algorithms. Service to Research Community: organize
available packing problems, make new industrial contacts, gather new data, and
obtain the necessary permissions to make this set of problems available to the
research community. Industry Involvement: attract money from industry to help
fund application of algorithms to specific domains.
