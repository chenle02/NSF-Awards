9258004 Chalmers Research activities are to be divided into three areas. The
first of these is on: The effect of Fluid Dynamic Forces on Cells. A significant
challenge in the large scale production of products from animal and insect cells
is the prevention of cell damage from hydrodynamic forces. The knowledge
generated by this research activity is to allow for the rational criteria for
the design, operation, and scale-up of bioreactors. The second area is on:
Bioremediation of Solid Organics. Initial research in this ares involves the
application of chemical and biochemical engineering principals to evaluate
processes for the biodegradation of wastes. The third area is on: Magnetically
Facilitated Cell Separations. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a
continuous, magnetically-based cell sorter (CMCS) analogous to the fluorescence-
based flow cytometer (FACS). The basis of the CMCS technique is the ability to
label a unique immunological protein on the cell of interest with an antibody
linked to a compound which is paramagnetic.
