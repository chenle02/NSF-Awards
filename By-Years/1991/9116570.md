This research has three principal focal areas connected with the theme of
dynamic stress application and high rate chemical reactions, as follows: (1)
shock-induced chemical reactions (with controlled recovery experiments,
mechanistic modeling, and time- resolved reaction-rate measurements) and
synthesis of novel and metastable materials; (2) dynamic compaction of powders
to form metal-, intermetallic-, and ceramic-matrix composites; controlled shock-
induced and post-shock thermally-induced reactions to tailor and optimize
matrix-reinforcement interface characteristics; (3) combustion processing by
self-propagating chemical reactions in powder mixtures, followed by high energy
rate densification and reaction sintering. The research is performed at New
Mexico Tech. (shock-induced chemical reactions and synthesis), Los Alamos
(modeling), Sandia (shock-wave facilities, modeling), Cal. Inst. of Tech.
(shock-tailoring of interfacial reactions in composites), and UC-San Diego
(combustion synthesis, dynamic densification and post- shock processing) . %%%
This is an excellent area of research, where the research has potentially high
pay-off with the capability to produce new materials. Modeling of the process
variables is needed to permit the scaling up of the process to larger sizes and
more complex shapes.
