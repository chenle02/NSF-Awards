In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Andrew Harned is developing new synthetic methodologies
based on the unusual reactivity displayed by a family of unique small molecules.
In addition to exploring the reactivity of these small-molecule cyclopropanes,
new catalysts are being developed to synthesize these materials as single
stereoisomers. Several biologically active natural products are being
synthesized using this methodology. In addition to these laboratory efforts,
selected data from this work are being used to populate a web-based NMR FID
database that is also under development in the PI's laboratory. This unique
educational resource is being made available to instructors around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical focus of the project concerns the
development of new methodology for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules.
The main goal is to harness the unusual reactivity patterns inherent to a family
of highly functionalized, tricyclic cyclopropanes. Reacting these compounds with
either nucleophiles or electrophiles affords highly functionalized, ring-opened
products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. The requisite starting
materials for the cyclopropanes, enantioenriched para-quinols, are synthesized
with new chiral aryl iodide catalysts. Concurrent with these methodology
studies, the unique cyclopropanes are being used as key intermediates for the
construction of several natural products, specifically azaphilone lactones and
briarane diterpenoids.
