A sound pattern can be the result either of the distribution of targets
(phonology), or context-sensitive realization of targets (phonetic
implementation). Linguists have been aware of this dichotomy for some time, but
as yet there has been relatively little work explicitly exploring the properties
distinguishing the two kinds of sound pattern. This project will explore the two
kinds of pattern as they are displayed in fundamental frequency (fO) in the
Bantu language Chichewa, the national language of Malawi. Extensive data on the
language were collected by the P.I. in 1992-1993 in Malawi, including lexical
paradigms, intonational paradigms, and natural discourse (in the form of
traditional oral narratives). Pitch tracks of the recorded data will be produced
using computer sound analysis equipment. Measurements will be entered into a
spreadsheet and the significant factors and trends extracted. The end result
will be explicit quantitative models of fO contours. The project will include
the collection of new data for Chichewa, in particular: (1) An experiment will
be conducted with Chichewa speakers in the U.S. in which alternating tone
sequences are produced as statements and as questions with systematic variation
of (a) pitch range and (b) speech rate. This will make clear the effect of these
two variables on fO, as well as clarifying the form of downtrends in Chichewa.
(2) The researchers will collaborate with Dr. Sam Mchombo, a linguist and
Chichewa speaker, on a description of the function of intonation in Chichewa
discourse. (3) The Chichewa natural discourse material will be analyzed and
compared to the patterns found in the experimental paradigms. This will provide
a test of the experimental findings, and reveal other factors not included in
the experimental set-up. The project will contribute to our understanding of
intonation and its interaction with lexical tone. It will clarify the
distinction between pho nology and phonetic implementation. It will represent
the first instrumental study of intonation in a Bantu language.
