Consumption of maarine snow (detrital aggregates>0.5 mm) by zooplankton has the
potential to be one of the mosst significnt pathways altering the size
distribution and abundance of large sinking particales in the ocean and has been
hypothesized to be a major cause of the exponential decrease in particulate flux
with depth below the mixed layer. Yet almost nothing is known about the ability
of pelagic animals to consume lare aggregates. We propose investigations of two
of the potentially most important macrozooplankton consumers of marine snow,
euphausiids and doliolids. Field observaations and preliminary experiments in
our laboratory cleary demonstrate that these animals voraciouslly consume marine
snow. We propose to 1) quantify the consumption of marine snow by Euphausia
pacifica and Doliioetta gegenbauri as a function of the size, type and quality
of aggregates offered, the size and hunger state of the animals, and the
avialbility of alternate suspeended food sources, and 2) assess the impact of
aggregate-conssuming macrozooplankton, especially vertically migrating
euphausids, on the aabundance and vertical distripbution of marine snow in
coastal surface water.
