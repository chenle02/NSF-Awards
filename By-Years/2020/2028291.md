This project will support coordination efforts that bring together participants
in large- and small group formats to foster the necessary dialog to develop
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data solutions and
practices. The project will include a Consensus Building Workshop and METS Data
Working Group to develop reference implementations of a data model for adoption
by the METS community; formation of regional METS user networks and a Broadening
Users Workshop to identify the needs of a broader range of data end users and
associated data interfaces and tools to meet those needs; and a Data Hackathon
to build capacity to ingest, analyze, and integrate METS data with other
disciplinary and cross-disciplinary data to accelerate scientific
discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop community consensus
for a FAIR METS data model. The METS RCN will leverage the wealth of
oceanographic coordination and community building experience and staff capacity
of the Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry (OCB) Project Office and the
infrastructure, expertise, and extensive METS data handling experience of the
Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO), along
with an RCN Steering Committee that comprises expertise in the fields of
oceanography, data science, earth system models, statistics, and data
synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
