This project provides scholarships to enable 16 academically talented and
financially needy engineering students at Elizabethtown College to obtain
baccalaureate degrees and enter the STEM workforce. It builds on partnerships
with Project Forward Leap, a non-profit organization that supports educational
achievement for students in inner city or underperforming school districts, with
STEM-UP PA, an NSF-funded program that promotes advancement of women in STEM
disciplines, and with local industries to create a comprehensive program for
recruitment and academic enhancement of scholars, along with mentoring support
for transition to the workforce. Scholars are supported through such high-impact
practices as a living-learning community, focused mentoring, and participation
in undergraduate research. The project is having a positive impact in an area of
national need, both through direct support of scholars and by creating a pathway
model that can be sustained into the future.
