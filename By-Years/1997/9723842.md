9723842 French Among mammals, infant care is commonly limited to maternal care.
However, in a small proportion of species, fathers and other group members
contribute to the care and provisioning of dependent infants (paternal and
alloparental care, respectively). Although we know much about the patterning of
this care, little attention has been directed toward the underlying mechanisms
that regulate the delivery of parental care by individuals other than the
mother. The studies proposed will examine the physiological and experiential
determinants of parental care in the black tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix
kuhli). In the marmoset, maternal effort is limited essentially to nursing, and
adult males and older offspring provide the majority of care to dependent
infants. Initial observations indicate that older sons and fathers living in
family groups undergo breast elaboration in the presence of infants, suggesting
an endocrine involvement in infant care by males. Through the use of unobtrusive
behavioral observations and noninvasive urine sample collection, French will
test the degree to which responsiveness to infants and levels of parental
behavior are affected by gonadal steroids (estrogen, progesterone, and
testosterone) and pituitary peptides (prolactin). The generality or specificity
of the physiological responses to infants will be tested by comparing the
endocrine responses of both marmosets and squirrel monkeys (a non-paternal
species) to infant-associated stimuli. Further, the strength of the social
attachment between male and female partners, assumed to be critical for the
evolution of male parental care, will be tested by providing pairs with a
variety of threats to the integrity of the pair (e.g., temporary separations,
encounters with strangers). Together, these projects will provide insights into
the mechanisms that control responsiveness to infants and adult social partners
in a species characterized by high levels of male parenta l care and strong
heterosexual relationships.
