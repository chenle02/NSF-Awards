Competitiveness in the manufacture of computers and computer chips depends on
many capabilities including the ability to design, analyze and manufacture the
uniquely structured thin films that make up electronic devices. Transport
phenomenon such as heat and mass transfer and ion diffusion and scattering are
critical in the control of chip quality and cost. This research will enhance
industry-university collaboration on the modeling and solution methods of
transport mechanisms for discretely inhomogeneous, multi-dimensional media
(electronic thin-film devices). A unique modeling and analysis approach called
discrete element analysis will be developed with the potential to enhance
present efforts to integrate geometry, analysis, design and manufacturing to
improve engineering efficiency and effectiveness. The important role played by
transport processes in manufacturing will be highlighted throughout with active
knowledge transfer mechanisms between the university and industrial
collaborators.
