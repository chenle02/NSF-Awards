This award will provide continued funding for the scientific analysis of data
taken with the IceCube neutrino detector. Extensive efforts by the University of
Wisconsin - Madison group towards improving the calibrations and the analysis
software for the final detector configuration, including implementing
significant refinements of the understanding of the optical properties of the
ice, have resulted in an improved instrument. IceCube has detected more than
300,000 atmospheric neutrinos during construction, some with energies that
exceed by more than three orders of magnitude the energies of those produced
with accelerator beams. The construction of DeepCore, an infill of the IceCube
array over a significant instrumented volume of very clear ice in the bottom
half of the detector, has lowered the threshold to 10 Gigaelectronvolts (GeV).
This immediately resulted in the observation of atmospheric neutrino
oscillations at energies previously inaccessible with statistical significance
greater than five standard deviations. On the other end of the energy spectrum,
with IceCube's improved effective area, measurements have reached sensitivity to
the flux of neutrinos produced in the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays
with cosmic microwave photons, thus creating a new opportunity to reveal their
sources. IceCube's sensitivity has reached a level where, from general
arguments, they must observe supernova remnants and gamma-ray bursts if these
are indeed the sources of the galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays,
respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: IceCube results will enhance
scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad
dissemination of the results and experiences. IceCube is in a unique class of
projects that inspire the innovative capacity of a new generation of American
scientists and engineers. The group's approach has been to make IceCube science
and resources available to existing education and outreach programs with a
proven record of success.
