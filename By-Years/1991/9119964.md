This research comprises the careful preparation, characterization and
investigation of artificially-structured materials and systems with dimensions
at the nanometer level, with particular emphasis on surface, interface and thin
film magnetism. These new materials are expected to possess specifically
tailored electric and magnetic properties. They provide a sound basis for
systematic studies to explore basic concepts in fundamental physics such as
phase transitions in two dimensions, enhanced ferromagnetism, altered critical
phenomena, magnetic coupling, proximity and interfacial effects, magnetic
surface and interface anisotropies. Electron capture spectroscopy and spin-
polarized method will probe long range and short range magnetic order. These new
materials, which; are also studied using scanning tunneling microscopy, will
include magnetic heterostructures with elements such as iron, colbalt, chromium,
vanadium, palladium, terbium, and gadolinium that exhibit unusual physical
properties if deposited in selected substrates and/or interfaced with suitable
elements.These materials have potential application in technological areas such
as thin film magnetic recording media and heads.
