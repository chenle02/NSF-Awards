An experiment to study threshold pion production in proton-proton collisions
will be conducted at the IUCF Cooler. The equipment required for this experiment
(including a new ring magnet and a new two-arm detector system) has been built
and tested at the University of Pittsburgh and IUCF. The new magnet will become
a permanent part of the Cooler ring. The experiment measuring differential cross
sections and analyzing powers will run during 1991. A followup experiment
measuring the complete scattering matrix using a polarized beam and target is
proposed here. Development work for an approved CEBAF experiment in eta
electroproduction from the proton will be carried out. The Pittsburgh effort is
in building the drift chamber array that surrounds the target within the CEBAF
Large Acceptance Spectrometer, an effort requiring significant planning and
testing.
