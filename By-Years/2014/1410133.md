The goal of this work is to address several timely questions about the analysis
and interpretation of observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation, with particular emphasis on observations of CMB polarization. CMB
observations provide a snapshot of the Universe at an age of a few hundred
thousand years, and the spectrum of CMB temperature variations (anisotropy)
contains a wealth of information, e.g., providing strong evidence that the
Universe is flat, giving measurements of the amounts of dark matter and dark
energy, and supporting the theory of inflation. Broader impacts of the work
include training of undergraduate graduate students. This is an RUI (Research at
Undergraduate Institutions) proposal in which a number of undergraduate students
will be introduced to and trained in developing simulations of CMB polarization
telescopes for the future. Dr. Bunn also leads regular observing nights for the
public using the campus telescope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of the
activities will be undertaken, ranging from mathematical analyses, to
simulations, to pedagogical expositions,and will include studies of CMB
anomalies and E/B mode decomposition.
