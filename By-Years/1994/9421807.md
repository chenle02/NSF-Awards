9421807 Kamil A major challenge confronting biology today is to understand the
evolution and adaptive significance of cognitive abilities. In order to meet
this challenge, biologists have begun to investigate how cognitive abilities are
actually used by animals in confronting the problems they face in nature. This
information, in turn, leads to hypotheses about how different species may
possess differing suites of cognitive abilities. In the proposed research, Drs.
Kamil and Balda will use a comparative approach, studying closely related
species whose natural histories are different. Because the natural histories
differ, the species confront somewhat different challenges in nature and
therefore, they hypothesize, possess differing cognitive abilities. In one set
of experiments, they will investigate difference in spatial memory that are
associated with species differences in dependence on stored food whose locations
are remembered by food-caching animals. In another set of experiments, they will
test for differences in cognitive ability among species who differ in sociality.
These two sets of experiments will further our understanding of the evolution of
cognition and of the role of cognitive abilities in the natural world.
