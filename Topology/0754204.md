Abstract

Award: DMS-0504539 Principal Investigator: Nora Ganter

The project investigates the interaction of elliptic cohomology with other areas
of mathematics and physics, with a focus on equivariant phenomena and power
operations. Subjects treated range from orbifold models in string theory over
representation and character theory in 2-categories to generalized Moonshine and
stable homotopy theory. Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory arose in the
context of homotopy theory and exposes many formal similarities between the
above fields. The goal of the project is to better understand the mechanisms
underlying these observations. Power operations in elliptic cohomology were
already linked to product formulas in string theory and to the twisted Hecke
operators of generalized Moonshine. This project will further pursue these
connections, aiming to clarify the links between the literature in these three
subjects.

In less technical terms: Elliptic cohomology is a rich mix of areas of
mathematics and physics, which on the surface do not appear to have much to do
with each other. Especially in the presence of an action by a group of
symmetries, one can observe many analogies between seemingly unrelated research
areas. With collaborators from various fields of mathematics, this project seeks
to find an explanation for the deeper mechanisms underlying these phenomena.
