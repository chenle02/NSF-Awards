AST-0420920/Merritt, Rochester Inst of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Beowulf
cluster of computers, with each node connected to a special-purpose computer for
simulating gravitational interactions, will be expanded from 8 to 32 nodes. The
final system will be the largest of its kind in the world and will be capable of
simulating N-body systems with particle numbers up to approximately 50,000,000
at speeds of approximately 4 terraflops. Simulations will cover the dynamics of
galactic nuclei, in particular the interactions of single and binary
supermassive black holes with stars and compact objects. Undergraduate and
graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the construction, use, and
maintenance of the cluster through a users group at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, and the cluster will be made available to collaborators outside of
the Rochester Institute of Technology through a collaborative consortium.
