One of the most interesting aspects of cell biology -- and the main subject of
the Workshop discussed in this proposal -- is the study of how external or
internal signals modify gene expression and affect the commitment to different
cellular fates. Recent progress in experimental methods in biology, combined
with computational tools developed by physical/mathematical scientists, provides
a new way of analyzing the underlying complex signaling and genetic networks.

The workshop will take place during the period August 18 - September 7, 2003, at
the Aspen Center for Physics in Aspen, Colorado, and has two principal aims: (a)
to bring together physicists already working on biology-motivated research with
key biologists in order to strengthen existing collaborations and foster new
ones; and (b) to introduce interested physicists to problems at the forefront of
biological research. The Aspen Center for Physics provides an informal and
stimulating environment ideal for such interactions. Moreover, the Center has
played a leading role in promoting interdisciplinary Biology research and is
currently planning to dedicate one week each winter and three-to-six weeks each
summer to biology-motivated conferences and programs.
