The advent of microcomputer and electronic displays is changing the nature of
everyday tasks. Many types of display make higher demands on switching back and
forth between displays than on sustained inspection of a single display. There
is evidence that temporal acuity describes a capability advantage for the new
task demands. The availability of portable microcomputers, particularly battery-
operated versions with rapid onset visual elements, may permit the assessment of
these abilities. This research will determine whether a trait exists involving
temporal acuity factors in perception. To do this, the research will implement
paradigms dealing with theoretically disparate aspects of temporal as opposed to
spatial factors, from various domains and conceptual models (viz., information
processing, perception, and cognition) on such a portable microcomputer. The
research will use for empirical studies methodologies that follow from mental
test theory. The research will involve administration of a number of tasks to
groups of individuals over several replications to determine: (1) the degree of
stability and reliability of each test, (2) the number of unique factors
evaluated by such tests, and (3) the relationship of any "new" factors to other
"old" capabilities presently measurable and predictive of operational
performance (e.g., scores on intelligence tests or tests of spatial perception).
Phase II research will validate the factors which surfaced in Phase I against
real-world performances of military persons, to determine predictive validity
and variance accounted for, and permit generalization and unequivocal evaluation
of the test properties. An off-the-shelf portable battery of temporal factors
which stabilize rapidly will have important applications to selection. The
results would further specify constructs which appear in theory to be related to
a myriad of jobs. The traditional methods of testing can be improved to take
into account abilities in speed of processing.
