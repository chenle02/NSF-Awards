Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMS-0342103&lt;br/&gt;In response to the increased
awareness of terrorism as it could affect our critical infrastructure, the
Department of Civil Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
proposes to conduct full-scale experimental blast tests in a conventional
structure. This research will simulate a terrorist attack using a hand-carried
satchel charge placed at a strategic location inside the structure. The charge
weight will be between 10 and 50 pounds of TNT-equivalent. Incident and
reflected pressures and structural response quantities such as accelerations and
displacements will be measured with a high-speed data acquisition system. The
resulting data will be analyzed and the data and the findings will be
disseminated to the appropriate parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
