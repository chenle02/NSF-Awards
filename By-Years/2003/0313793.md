This program provides opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds to
become Computer Security and Information Assurance (CSIA) professionals and to
help protect the safety and security of our nation's information infrastructure.
Professors who are internationally recognized specialists in CSIA, some of whom
have over thirty years experience teaching this material and producing graduates
trained in the CSIA, educate students in this program. Using traditional
computing lab resources along with newly developed resources such as a battle
lab, students will be exposed to hands-on demonstrations and experience that are
on the cutting edge of CSIA education, as befits an NSA-designated Center of
Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) such as The
George Washington University (GW). In this proposal, GW is partnering with
Gallaudet University and Marymount University to expand CSIA education
opportunities to citizens of the Washington DC area and to capitalize on the
strength and accessibility of courses available to students through the eleven-
member Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area. This
partnership also broadens the participation of traditionally underrepresented
groups in CSIA. Gallaudet is the world's only university that brings together
deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing students and faculty in the common pursuit of
education. Marymount, until 1986 a women's college, is now a coeducational
liberal arts institution with women making up 70% of its students.
