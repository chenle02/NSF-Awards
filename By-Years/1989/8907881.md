It has been known for many years that a phenomenon known as the "dryline" is a
preferred zone for thunderstorm development. The dryline represents the boundary
between maritime tropical air form the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the
desert Southwest. Using a numerical model coupled with previously collected
data, the Principal Investigator will study the formation/evolution of the
dryline, its interactions with severe weather and the merger of synoptic fronts
and drylines. Results will be beneficial for improved predictions of timing and
location of thunderstorm initiation.//
