This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
a novel technique for producing freestanding GaN wafers and substrates. High-
quality freestanding GaN substrates are important for fabrication of high-
performance light emitters, such as blue laser diodes, UV LEDs, and UV detectors
that have many indispensable applications from data storage/data communication,
to water/air purification, to detection/analysis of chemical and biological
agents for homeland security applications. Despite the research efforts in the
last decade, affordable freestanding GaN wafers and substrates of large
diameters (2inches) have not been available commercially. This project will
demonstrate a novel approach to growth of GaN thick films and fabrication of
freestanding GaN wafers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project will be commercially available freestanding GaN wafers
and substrates of large diameters; at an affordable price, the commercialization
potential will be great. This project will enable development and
commercialization of high performance III-nitride-based light emitters and
detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American
