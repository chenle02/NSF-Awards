This work will investigate the details of how the plasma transported by the
solar wind interacts with the plasma inside the magnetosphere near the dayside
magnetopause. The study will use semi-global, three-dimensional hybrid
simulations in which the electrons are treated using a fluid approximation, but
the ions are treated using a kinetic particle description. The 3-D simulations
will provide a study of the magnetopause with more realistic boundaries than
have been studied in the past. Shear flow, curvature of the boundary, and
coupling of boundaries and the motion of boundaries will all be included. The
regions of study will include the bow shock, the magnetosheath and the
magnetopause.
