The Department of Chemistry will purchase a Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer for use in undergraduate education. A Fourier
Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility will be established for use in
undergraduate instrumental analysis courses and by research students enrolled in
the four colleges in the City of Memphis. The center will be located at Memphis
State University, which will provide the matching funds and provide for
maintenance of the facility (and will, therefore, retain title to the facility
and arrange a schedule for its use). However the center will also provide for
the instructional and research needs at three smaller colleges: LeMoyne Owen
College, Christian Brothers College and Rhodes College. The integration of C-13
FT NMR (along with the possibility of running coupled, decoupled, off-resonance
decoupled, 2-D experiments, etc.) into the undergraduate curriculum will fill a
glaring need in molecular spectroscopy in all of the Memphis area institutions
and also provide for routine spectral characterization of compounds generated in
undergraduate research projects. The inclusion of LeMoyne-Owen College, a
historically Black liberal arts college, in the project, as well as the sizable
percentage of minorities at the other institutions, ensures that the facility
will provide for enhanced educational opportunities for minority students.
