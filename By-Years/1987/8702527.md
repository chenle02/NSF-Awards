The objective of this work is to estimate the risk of transporting hazardous
materials and to develop a comprehensive method by which to evaluate risks in
routing this type of cargo. The work will address some of the deficiencies
encountered in previous attempts where estimation procedures were poorly
defined, biases intrinsic to individual approaches were not considered, the
problem of aggregating risk estimates from alternative procedures were given
little attention, and the impacts of these inadequacies on optimal route
assignment were not examined. These concerns will be examined by using
statistical inference, analytical models, Bayesian analysis, fault and event
trees, extreme value theory, network optimization, and information theoretic
models. Results from this research will contribute to design, plan, implement
and operate an inter- and intra-state transportation system able to transport
safely shipments of hazardous materials.
