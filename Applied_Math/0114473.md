Jackson 0114473 The investigator uses mechanical models to investigate the
mechanisms involved in tumor encapsulation, multiple lobe formation, and
transcapsular spread. Mass and momentum balance equations are written for the
normal cells, neoplastic cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM) on which they are
anchored, and the interstitial fluid in which they are bathed. This system is
closed by suitable constitutive relations for the mass supply, the partial
stress tensor, and the momentum supply of each constituent. The former is
defined on the basis of phenomenological observations of tumor cell growth and
the latter is based on the mechanical properties of each phase. The model
equations, consisting of a set nonlinear conservation and evolution equations,
are analyzed using asymptotic analysis, bifurcation analysis, and perturbation
theory in order to quantify the relative importance of chemical processes (such
as ECM production and degradation) and mechanical properties of the tissue (such
as ECM density and stiffness) in influencing capsule formation. A further
objective is to characterize the bifurcation that leads to multiple lobe
formation. Through analysis and simulation of the model, the investigator aims
to discover which factors (mechanical and chemical) determine successful capsule
formation and to quantify their influence. The mechanisms by which a tumor
becomes encapsulated as a continuum of cells or as several lobes of different
sizes, separated by connective tissue, is an interesting, important, and
unsolved phenomenon in tumor biology. In fact, the presence (or absence) of a
dense capsule surrounding a neoplastic mass is a major determinant of prognosis
and the ultimate survival of the host. Despite the importance of capsule
formation, little is known about the process by which capsules arise. The
incestigator develops a mathematical modeling framework that describes tumor
growth, encapsulation, multiple lobe formation, and transcapsular spread based
on the physical forces and cellular interactions involved. The specific aims are
to use mechanical models to assist in understanding i) the role tumor cell,
normal cell, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in capsule formation,
ii) the effects of tumor induced ECM production and degradation on the formation
of tumor capsules, iii) the role of tissue properties such as ECM density and
stiffness in slowing or impeding the process of tumor encapsulation, and iv) the
bifurcation that allows a simple encapsulated continuum of cells to make the
transition to a multi-nodular form. There are implications for clinical
diagnosis as well as for prognosis.
