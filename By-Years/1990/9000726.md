Professor Lon B. Knight and other members of the Chemistry Department of Furman
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from transition metal
photochemistry and molecular orbital calculations to laser vaporization
reactions and peptide synthesis. Two visiting faculty members from regional
colleges will also serve as research directors. Funds are provided for six (6)
students to attend and present papers at the annual Southeastern Regional
Meeting of the American Chemical Society.
