The project is developing, deploying, evaluating, and disseminating interactive
learning modules (ILMs) and web-based educational technologies to help student
learn the fundamentals of electrical engineering. Investigators from three other
universities, representing a minority institution, a four-year school, and an
urban university, are participating in the project. The ILMs, which build on a
prior prototype development project, support the "key concepts" of electrical
engineering (i.e., areas associated with the PE and FE exams). These ILMs
provide illustrative supporting materials for engineering students that can be
further used to stimulate interest in K-12 students to consider STEM careers.
Deployment also involves a faculty exchange program, allowing faculty partners
to "swap" classrooms for a particular topic, and experience diverse
teaching/learning environments. Evaluation experts at a separate university will
organize and carry out the evaluation. The materials will be available on the
Internet and on CDs and a major publisher has indicated interest in the product.
The project team plans a series of workshops.
