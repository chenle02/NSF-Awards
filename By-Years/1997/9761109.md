*** 9761109 Young This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
directed towards the study and evaluation of a new non-explosive rock excavation
and concrete demolition method. The process involves injecting foam at high
pressure into pre-drilled holes in the rock or concrete to be broken through a
barrel incorporating a new hole bottom sealing method. The high viscosity of the
foam (as compared to a gas) combined with its stored energy characteristics (as
compared to a liquid) result in very controlled breakage. The pressures to break
the rock or concrete are significantly less than required in methods based upon
the use of small explosive or propellant charges. Consequently, airblast and
flyrock are reduced to very benign levels allowing the method to be applied in a
continuous manner and to be used in urban and other sensitive environments. The
incremental breakage of the method combined with the mobility and simplicity of
the requisite hardware give the method considerable potential to be highly
automated. The Phase I project will quantify the breakage that might be achieved
in rock and concrete, investigate the foam viscosities and pressures required
for efficient breakage and identify aspects of the process with a potential for
automation. The controlled foam injection method for rock breakage could be used
to develop utility tunnels under existing streets and buildings, to provide
access tunnels or shafts to existing subway systems, to modify or enlarge
excavation carried out with tunnel boring machines or to excavate or enlarge
underground space for buildings. In the area of concrete breakage and stripping
the method would be useful for demolishing concrete structures when explosive
methods were precluded or where salvage and recycling of building or structure
components was desirable. ***
