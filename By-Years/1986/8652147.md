The AAAS Project on Science, Technology and Disability will prepare, publish,
and disseminate a revised and updated Resource Directory of Scientists and
Engineers with Disabilities. A new edition is needed as a resource for the
entire scientific and engineering community. The major uses of the print version
of the updated Directory will be as a source of: orole models for disabled
youth, their families and teachers; and of specific coping strategies for
scientists and engineers disabled in mid-career to learn how to continue in
their careers. oexperienced consultants for persons who are inexperienced in
teaching or working with a disabled person; and qualified peer reviewers.
oexperienced personnel to increase the expertise of individuals and groups which
provide technologies for disabled persons. The goal of AAAS is to print 10,000
copies of the Directory by December 31, 1986. The publication will be bound and
three-holed punched for easy update every year or so.
