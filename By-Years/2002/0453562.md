Fisk University continues operation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site. The REU Site has been in operation since 1994. The theme of the
proposed REU Site is Materials Characterization. Students participate in
research that involves crystal growth, glasses, nonlinear optical materials,
surface science, and ceramics. Ten undergraduate students are recruited
nationwide every year for a nine-week summer research experience. In addition to
participating in individual research projects, students attend seminars on
current major research topics, a mini-course on experimental error analysis and
on ethics in research, and visit nearby research facilities. Students also have
the opportunity to present the results of their research at a professional
conference.&lt;br/&gt;
