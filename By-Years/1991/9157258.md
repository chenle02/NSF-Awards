When the leaves of a plant are eaten by an herbivore, both defensive and
physiological responses are observed in the remaining leaves. These responses
contribute to a plant's resistance and resilience to herbivory, respectively.
The metabolic integration of these responses has gone largely unexplored and
will be examined in a species where leaf damage results in large (4-fold)
increases in leaf alkaloids and large (2-fold) increases in the photosynthetic
capacity. Specifically, the metabolic integration of the nitrogen-intensive
responses to herbivory will be investigated using 15N and 14C-labeled alkaloid
to follow the movement of nitrogen and carbon between root and shoot and between
alkaloid and protein metabolism. The movement of nitrogen from alkaloid to leaf
photosynthetic proteins will be correlated with changes in the photosynthetic
capacity of leaves after damage. Examining chemical defenses as an integral part
of the physiological processes by which plants regrow those tissues lost to
herbivores, will strengthen our understanding of the evolution of chemical
defenses in plants.
