This is a research planning grant for a minority investigator, Luis Colon, who
is a new faculty member of analytical chemistry at the State University of New
York at Buffalo. In this work, Professor Colon will develop a research proposal
on the synthesis of modified chromatographic stationary phases using sol-gel
chemistry. Here, the alkyl moieties normally used to modify chromatographic
supports are introduced during the formation of the glass or silica support.
These materials are expected to have better hydrolytic stability than
conventional chromatographic stationary phases. This research planning grant
supports the efforts of Luis Colon to develop new materials to serve as the
basis for separation of a wide range of chemical species. The materials
developed here may be resistant to a broader range of harsh solution conditions
than the traditional materials. Potential applications include separations of
biotechnological, pharmaceutical and environmental importance.
