The research of this proposal is in functional analysis and operator theory
related to engineering system theory. Many linear control problems can be
phrased and studied in terms of matrix inequalities. These are formulated by a
consideration of polynomials in noncommutative variables x. A basic result, due
to the PI and obtained as part of his previous grant, is that every matrix
positive noncommutative polynomial can be written as a sum of squares of
noncommutative polynomials. In this proposal Helton will work on extending this
theory, developing computer algorithms based on this theory, the analysis of
such algorithms, and connections with other branches of mathematics. These are
key optimization problems arising in designs of linear systems.

The biggest advance in linear systems engineering during the 1990's is the
realization that most linear control problems convert directly to matrix
inequalities, abbreviated MIs. Many of these are badly behaved but a classical
core of problems convert to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are nicely
behaved. Many different types of matrix inequalities have come up in the
mathematics of the previous century, but the ones that dominate in engineering
systems usually take the form of a polynomial or rational function of matrices
being positive semidefinite. It is algebraic formulas like these that are
programmed into modern computer packages in engineering. The goal of this
project is to understand how one converts bad MIs to nice MIs. When is this
possible?
