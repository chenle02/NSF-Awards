0418088&lt;br/&gt;Harlow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray diffraction is one of the
fundamental analytical techniques for identifying and characterizing crystalline
phases and is critical to research on crystalline solids. However, with
increasing frequency the samples that need analysis with diffraction are small.
Camera techniques, which have been a mainstay, are time consuming, require
significant conversion to obtain digital data, and are becoming obsolete.
Moreover, they and other traditional methods cannot perform in situ powder
diffraction from microscopic areas on surfaces of diverse objects. Recently, the
development of laboratory diffraction instruments combining a finely collimated
point X-ray beam, sample holders with automated motion, and large two
dimensional detectors permit solving the sample, film and time problems. This
project involves acquiring such a new microdiffraction system for use by
scientists and conservators at the American Museum of Natural History, Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory/Columbia University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and other potential users in the region. Numerous projects by more than ten
investigators are planned initially for the new microdiffraction instrument,
ranging from fundamental mineralogical and materials research to detailed
conservation studies of artifacts and art from the collaborating museums.
Routinely the microdiffraction system will be used to identify samples from the
mineral, rock and meteorite collections to improve their characterization and
value to the scientific community and general public. The broader impacts of
this study include the interaction and collaboration of researchers at a major
university and two research museums, involvement and training of students,
interns and visiting scholars, enhanced understanding of objects of all kinds
including specimens, artifacts, and art objects in two world-class museums, and
advancement of conservation science and techniques for the preservation of art
and natural history objects for posterity.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
