The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique becomes even more powerful. The acquisition of X-ray diffraction
instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemistrs to carry out frontier
research. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama will acquire
a single crystal X-ray diffractometer and upgrade an existing diffractometer
with support from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program. The
instrumentation will enhance research in the following areas of chemistry: 1)
Inclusion Chemistry 2) Synthetic Organic Chemistry 3) Solid State Chemistry 4)
Synthetic Inorganic Fluorine Chemistry 5) Radical Cation Chemistry
