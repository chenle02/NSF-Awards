The objective of the proposed research is to explore two central and related
topics in monetary economics. First, how is our view of the transmission
mechanism between monetary policy and real economic activity affected by the
monetary policy rule that is presumed to be in place? Second, how do alternative
monetary policy rules affect the behavior of the private economy? To conduct
this line of inquiry, the principal investigator will use a set of recently
developed tools that make it straightforward to study alternative monetary
policy rules in dynamic models with rational expectations and forward-looking
consumption, investment, labor supply and price-setting decisions. The
analytical framework is a singular linear difference system under rational
expectations; theoretical characterization of this system and computational
methods for its solution have been developed by the principal investigator in
recent collaborative research. Specific rules to be studied include interest
rate and money stock rules for monetary policy, with particular attention
devoted to how these alternative specifications influence the evaluation of
models of the transmission mechanism between monetary policy and the real
economy. Particular attention will be devoted to conditions under which pure
interest rate rules can actually be implemented. In addition, the research will
also undertake evaluation of an inflation targeting regime.
