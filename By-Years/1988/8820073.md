This grant, funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in Chemistry,provides support
for the research of Dr. Jerome Berson at Yale University. The objective of the
research is the preparation, isolation and characterization of often unstable
intermediates formed in chemical reactions. The chemical and physical behaviour
of the reactive intermediates will be correlated with theoretical calculations.
The principal intermediates to be studied are biradicals, which Berson makes by
innovative synthetic routes. He will isolate them using techniques such as low
temperature matrix isolation and then measures their spectral properties. On
warming he can observe the regiospecific dimerization and cyclization behaviour
of the biradicals and correlate the results with theory. These studies enhance
our fundamental understanding of how chemical reactions occur and should be
useful along a broad front of chemical syntheses.
