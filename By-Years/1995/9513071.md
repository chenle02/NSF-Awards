9513071 Tufillaro A program of research is described whose goal is to enhance
the modeling and control of low dimensional nonlinear systems that exhibit
chaotic behavior. In order to achieve this goal the first objective is to
develop a series of procedures for building models that accurately describe the
time evolution of these systems. The models are global discrete mappings and
ordinary differential equations constructed only from experimental time series
data. The second major objective is to exploit synchronization between the
fitted models and measured time series as a means of carrying out model
verification and control. The third objective is to explore the use of
topological procedures to constrain and fine tune these models. The proposed
research will significantly enhance the ability to detect, model, and control
the dynamics of chaotic systems using observed time series data. This project is
a collaborative effort involving the close interaction of several research
groups in nonlinear science (UCSD, GIT). ***
