This work will study the dynamics and structure of energetic intermediate time
scale (several day to several week) variations of the Florida Current. Recent
current meter and "Pegasus" profiler measurements collected as part of the
Subtropical Atlantic Climate Studies (STACS) program will be used. These data
provide a unique means of addressing these problems directly. Topics to be
explored include: 1. Dynamics and modes of variation of the large amplitude
intermediate time-scale fluctuations: 2. Seasonal variations in the struture of
intermediate time-scale fluctuation, and their relation to local wind forcing;
and 3. The energetics of the fluctuations and their contribution to the mean
energy balance of the Florida Current.
