Abstract Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a major cause of concrete
deterioration. The overall goal of this research project is to combine chemical
and mechanical approaches to substantially advance fundamental understanding of
ASR and to provide a basis for development of more effective accelerated tests
and for prevention of damage. The objectives are: 1) to understand the molecular
and nanometer- scale structure of ASR gels and how the structure is affected by
conditions of formation, 2) to understand the molecular and nanostructural
processes that produce the gel, the chemical and structural controls on gel
composition, and the kinetics of gel formation and subsequent transformations,
3) to understand the effects of aggregate type on the composition and structure
of ASR gel and on the kinetics of gel formation, 4) to understand the chemical
and structural aspects of gel that control swelling behavior, and 5) to
understand the relationships between the macroscopic structural expansion of
concrete undergoing ASR and the details of gel formation and swelling by
developing a finite element model of concrete expansion that can be used to more
effectively predict and evaluate the engineering effects of ASR. The proposed
research will have intellectual impact in civil engineering, geological science,
and materials science. It will provide a detailed understanding of the chemistry
of an important concrete deterioration mechanism, knowledge of the molecular
structure of a class of hydrous silicates, ASR gel and establish a link between
molecular structure and swelling behavior. It will establish a microstructural-
based model that links ASR chemistry and concrete expansion. Knowledge gained
through this research will be incorporated into education in both civil
engineering and geology. The project will enhance interactions between
engineering and geology. And the proposed research will enhance minority
education through participation Jackson State University, a historically black
institution.
