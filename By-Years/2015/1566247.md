This project studies the coordination of diverse robotic sensors by focusing on
the task of observing all points in a given environment. The robots are required
to visit viewpoints, such that all the viewpoints collectively observe the
environment. When the number of potential viewpoints exceeds the number of
robots, some robots will be required to visit and cover multiple viewpoints. Not
all viewpoints are reachable from all the robots. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project introduces a novel combination of assignment and routing problems with
diversity constraints. These investigations lay the foundations to achieve the
overarching goal of understanding the role of diversity in robot swarms. The PI
works with the Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity at Virginia
Tech to ensure broad outreach, in particular, to K-12 students and for promoting
diversity in STEM recruitment.
