The award is for the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program. The
proposed work will examine the structural variations that occur in amorphous
silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride films with varying levels of electrical
and/or thermal stimulation. Such structural changes change the physical,
chemical and electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices, including the
electrical and chemical stability, threshold voltage and radiation hardness. If
techniques can be developed for reducing the structural changes in silicon
nitride and oxynitride films, the reliability and life of semiconductor devices
may be significantly improved. In addition, the proposed research will provide
opportunities for undergraduate students to develop critical skills in problem
solving in the area of solid state technology and to encourage them to pursue
graduate degrees. Superplastic forming is used to shape high performance alloys
in aerospace applications and will find increased use in its application to the
forming of titanium aluminides and other, "next generation" aerospace materials.
Better understanding of the behavior of materials during superplastic forming
will allow the fabrication of high performance parts at lower cost and with
higher reliability.
