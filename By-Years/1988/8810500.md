In this project the principal investigator will continue his fundamental studies
on physical oceanography, with emphasis on double diffusion and general ocean
circulation. Salt finger processes will be modeled in collaboration with a Navy
scientist; an inverse model of tracer circulation will be developed; and an
attempt will be made to model western boundary currents with a three layer
analytical model.
