This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop an entirely new class of biochips, with a particular focus on biochips
designed to track the expression, activation and post-translational modification
of proteins involved in cell signaling processes. The technology is based on the
use of liquid crystals to image biomolecular interactions at structured
surfaces. The goal of this Phase II Project is to demonstrate the substrates for
liquid crystal-based biochips that detect activated states of proteins and that
can be prepared from mechanically rubbed films of protein (that are) covalently
attached to glass substrates. Important issues of non-specific binding, binding
of activated states of specific target proteins, sample delivery, sensitivity
and quantitation will be addressed. These results, when combined with the
results of the Phase I research, will make possible the determination of the
extent to which cell signaling proteins are activated within biological samples
(eg. in cell lysates).

The commercial applications of this project will be in the areas of proteomics
and in vitro diagnostics. The development of the proposed technology will allow
for rapid, inexpensive, multi-target, high-throughput analysis of proteins and
their modification states.
