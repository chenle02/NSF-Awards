Methods are being developed to help engineering faculty members apply "Writing
Across the Curriculum" techniques in engineering courses. The features of
"Writing Across the Curriculum" are: 1) writing should be integrated into all
course activities, 2) frequent writing enhances learning, 3) writing is a
complex process requiring multiple revisions and feedback from others. The
specific approach proposed involves a general template or course plan that will
enable instructors responsible for design courses to focus on developing written
and oral communication skills. The methods and materials developed are
distributed to all engineering departments by a newsletter published three times
a year, by an electronic mail bulletin board and by a conference for faculty.
The grantee provides funds for this project that are greater than the NSF award.
