Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 0312558&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Octavia
Camps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on problems of distributed
active vision - a confluence of computer vision, ad-hoc networking and control.
The objectives are to develop a paradigm for systematically designing provably
robust distributed active vision systems and to characterized the performance of
the resulting systems. Progress in this area offers significant benefits to a
variety of application areas, such as intelligent activity monitoring systems
and smart environments, aware of user activities. While prototype systems have
been developed in several laboratories, these suffer from shortcomings that
limit their application and testing outside of research environments. This
project will build on some of that work to achieve robust systems built on sound
system theoretic concepts, a common mathematical language and usable set of
tools.
