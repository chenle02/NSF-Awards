9706519 Reid Large, highly explosive eruptions reflect the accumulation of magma
at shallow crustal levels, which in turn, requires a heat input significantly in
excess of output. The duration of magma accumulation and compositional
modification is therefore a record of the thermal history of a volcano which,
for voluminous rhyolitic magmas, may operate over timescales of tens of
thousands to millions of years. To delimit the dynamics of magma accumulation,
three new methods for dating the crystallization of minerals from rhyolitic
magmas will be refined and employed. Two of these methods will utilize a high
resolution ion microprobe which will enable individual zircon and allanite
crystals to be dated and a detailed record of crystal growth to be obtained. The
third method will determine the timing of quartz crystallization from age of the
glass inclusions they contain. Major centers of rhyolitic volcanism, including
Long Valley (California), Yellowstone (Wyoming), and Toba (Sumatra) calderas,
will be investigated. The insights gathered from these studies will be used in
conjunction with the temperature-dependence of crystallization to develop models
for the thermal evolution of rhyolitic magmas associated with large-volume
silicic systems.
