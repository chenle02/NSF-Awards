The Computer Science Department of Morehouse College is committed to developing
a program in High Performance Computing (HPC) that will soon be fully integrated
into the department's curricular structure as a part of the on-going effort to
expand its academic offerings. The purpose of the program is four-fold: a) to
give the department an ample exposure to the available techniques and tools of
HPC as alternative computational resources, b) to support the colleges proposed
interdisciplinary programs in Neuroscience and Materials Science by introducing
Scientific Computing into science education, c) to make available to the entire
science community of the college the computational resources, and d) to expose
the most talented students in that community to the fundamental concepts and
practices of High Performance Computing. The HPC program includes the recent
acquisition of two MIMD shared-memory multiprocessors, the GP1000 and TC2000.
