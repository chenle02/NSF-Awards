9523055 Tierman This research is to develop a miniature, cost-effective,
analytical chemistry device capable of identification of a wide range of low
level, airborne chemical products. The identification of these chemicals will be
achieved using surface acoustic wave devices, innovative self-assembled
monolayer surface chemistry, neural networks, and multichip module circuitry
techniques. The device will be able to analyze an air sample based on the
response pattern of the sensor array, and the neural network software will allow
the system to detect a variety of vapors in different environments. This
chemical identification device will have a wide range of applications and will
provide a competitive alternate to the massive and expensive detection devices
currently on the market.
