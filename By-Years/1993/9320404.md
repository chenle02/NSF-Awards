ABSTRACT CTS-9320404 Jiang The proposed research focuses on the investigation of
natural convection in silicone oils contained in shallow rotating cylinders. To
evaluate the phenomena involved, a scaling analysis will be performed to study
the interaction of buoyancy, centrifugal, Coriolis, and viscous forces, in an
effort to obtain a transport correlation for the range of parameters to be
studied. To evaluate the accuracy of the work, an experimental investigation
will also be conducted. The heat transfer rate and temperature distributions
will be measured to determine the thermal boundary layers and transport
correlation. Visualization of the flow field will be achieved by using a
photochromic technique associated with ultraviolet optical fiber probes to
reveal the nature of the convective flow. Based upon the combined experimental
and scaling results, a heat transport correlation will be developed for use in
applications involving rotating Ni-Zn batteries.
