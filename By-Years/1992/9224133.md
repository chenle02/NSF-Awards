Skidaway Institute of Oceanography requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. Skidaway owns and operates
the R/V BLUE FIN, a 64 foot vessel. The PI is requesting funding to purchase a
transmissometer, a flowmeter, and upgrades to a shipboard data acquisition
system. The instrumentation requested will be used aboard the BLUE FIN in
support of 101 days of NSF-funded scientific research in 1993. The requested
instrumentation is necessary to adequately support NSF- funded research at
Skidaway, and the PI is full capable of managing the acquisition and
installation of the instruments.
