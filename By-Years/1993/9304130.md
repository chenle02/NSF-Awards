9304130 Busby PI and co-workers will map and study an oceanic arc of Cretaceous
age in Baja California, Mexico. They will build facies models for oceanic arcs
that evaluate the response of sedimentary systems to explosive eruptions, to
effusive eruption and shallow level intrusion, and to sector collapse of
volcanoes. Based on these studies, they will also evaluate means for
distinguishing subaqueous from subaerial eruptive deposits. They will then
relate facies to and test models for phases of arc and basin formation.
