The project is on the development of efficient numerical algorithms and high
quality software to solve systems of polynomials. A basic problem is to
decompose the positive dimensional subsets of solutions into irreducible
components. The numerical approach of Sommese, Verschelde, and Wampler is based
on generic slicing with linear spaces, generic projections into lower
dimensional linear spaces, and use of classical interpolation techniques to
numerically do what elimination theory does in symbolic programs. Given a
polynomial system with parameters, a goal of the project is to find equations on
the parameters that need to be satisfied for the system to have a positive
dimensional component of solutions. Two applications targeted by this project
are factoring multivariate polynomials and finding overconstrained mechanisms.

A major outcome of this work will be publicly available software to solve
polynomial systems that arise in science and engineering. This work is carried
out in the research fields of numerical analysis and computer algebra whose
mission is to provide the scientific community with software to solve
mathematical problems. Since polynomial systems are used as models in
application areas as far apart as chemical reaction systems, the design of
mechanisms, or economic equilibria to name but a few areas, the focus of the
project on such basic models as polynomial systems is appropriate. Besides the
technology transfer of advanced mathematical tools into science and engineering,
an important aspect of this project is to introduce students in the design and
use of the developed software.
