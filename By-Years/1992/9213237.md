This research project involves a planning meeting for an international group of
scholars in the field of legal socialization. The purpose of the meeting is to
develop a research design for a collaborative, transnational data collection
project on the subject of the relationship between legal socialization and
legal/political change. The impetus for developing a research design was a
conference on legal socialization held in March, 1991, in Paris, France.
Preliminary discussions about a research design were held at the Law and Society
Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, but the schedule did not provide sufficient time to
develop a full fledged research design. It is still necessary to review and
reach agreement on a number of theoretical and methodological issues. This
planning meeting will include presentations, intensive discussion time, and
provision for specific drafting tasks. The project meets all of the objectives
of the special competition on "Global Perspectives on Sociolegal Studies."
