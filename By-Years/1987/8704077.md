Mechanisms of Bacterial Toxin Plant Membrane Interactions: Studies on the mode
of action of the Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae phytotoxin, syringomycin, on
plant cell membranes are proposed. Previous studies have shown that syringomycin
has a primary effect on the plasma membrane of susceptible cells. Experiments
are described for determining the role of protein phosphorylation in the
syringomycin stimulation of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase, for determining
if plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol turnover is involved in toxin action,
and for identifying the syringomycin molecular binding site. This project is
significant because it will elucidate how a ubiquitous and important bacterial
phytotoxin causes plant disease and also because it will provide basic
information about the function, structure and regulation of the plant cell
plasma membrane.
