Multi-million line systems are being developed in Java for avionics, shipboard
computing and simulation. A key attraction of the Real-Time Speci&#64257;cation
for Java for such systems is that it makes it possible to develop applications
that mix hard-, soft-, and non-real-time tasks in the same environment in a
memory-safe way. Unfortunately these advantages come at the expense of
predictability of the real-time subsystems. One of the main culprits for such
unpredictability in Java is garbage collection, which often requires
applications to be interrupted for hundreds of milliseconds. Such pauses are not
acceptable in real-time systems. One way to address this critical problem is to
develop real-time garbage collectors (RTGC) with worst-case bounds on pause
times and minimum mutator utilization. RTGC research is still in its infancy.
There are limits to the applicability of current algorithms in terms of the
strength of the timing guarantees that they offer. Furthermore, one serious
limitation to the use of RTGC in safety- and mission- critical settings is the
issue of certi&#64257;cation of the software. In the current state of the art,
no garbage collector has been formally veri&#64257;ed. Without these guarantees
there is little hope of adoption.

This research comprises work on two crucial issues in real-time virtual
machines for high-level languages. First, it is exploring new approaches to RTGC
based on probabilistic lock-free synchronization that provide strong timing
guarantees that have a vanishingly small probability of being violated. Second,
it uses theorem proving to generate a provably correct garbage collection
algorithm. This step is critical for certi&#64257;cation of advanced runtime
environments and, as best is known, has never been attempted before. RTGC
prototypes are being implemented in the context of a high-performance open
source real-time Java virtual machine. This experimental platform is an
industrial strength implementation of Java which is the only Java virtual
machine to have been &#64258;ight tested (in a collaboration with Boeing).
Outcomes include empirical results for a suite of large real-time Java programs.
All results are being released as open source.
