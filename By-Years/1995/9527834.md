9527834 KOHN The use of a novel molecular approach will provide detailed
information on the self-incompatibility (S) locus, which controls the rejection
of self pollen and acceptance of cross pollen in members of the tomato family
(Solanaceae). This genetic locus controls a cellular system of self-recognition
and rejection that is only partially understood at present. DNA sequence
information at this locus has so far been limited to rather few, highly
divergent, alleles from widely separated species. The S-locus has been little
studied at the population level because current technology for determining the
genotype of individual plants requires the use of cumbersome crossing methods.
Our molecular approach decreases the time needed to sample S-allele diversity
within and between populations and provides detailed molecular information from
closely related alleles for studying the relationship between DNA sequence
change and rejection specificity. Information on allele number will be used to
relate species ecological characteristics to effective population size, a
quantity of concern to conservation biologists. Genealogical structure of
S-alleles will be used to measure the frequency of historical bottlenecks and
test the frequency of one possible mechanism for species formation. Test crosses
among plants carrying S-alleles with very similar molecular sequences will help
resolve the relationship between sequence variation and the ability to recognize
self from non-self pollen. Understanding how sequences control rejection
specificity will provide information useful in plant breeding where self-
incompatibility limits the breeder's ability to create homozygous inbred lines.
