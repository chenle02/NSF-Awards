In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Bruce Hudson will study the UV resonance Raman spectra of a broad range of
conjugated and non-conjugated polyenes and selected triatomics. Information
about vibrational and electronic ground and excited states to be gathered will
be related to the mechanism of nuclear/electron coupling in molecules in
processes such as photodissociation, photoisomerization, and unimolecular
reaction. Experimental methods involving the determination of absolute Raman
intensities, depolarization ratio dispersion, tunable excitation, and
photochemical generation of subject species in vapor and with matrix isolation
will be developed. A new UV spectrograph will be constructed and a Ti:sapphire
laser will be developed to produce tunable far-uv radiation. %%% Professor
Hudson's research group has developed unique spectroscopic capabilities that
allow the study of the initial motion of a molecule which has been excited by a
vacuum- ultraviolet photon from its ground electronic energy state. Experiments
using these techniques can make important contributions to the understanding of
energy flow and intramolecular dynamics in the highly excited states of
polyatomic molecules.
