This award is to purchase two Transputer networks, a force- controlled Zebra
Zero robot and two Silicon Graphics Personal Iris workstations. This is a
collaborative research effort between the University of Illinois and Yale
University in the areas of parallel numerical curve tracing and cell
decomposition, planning force-closure grasps, trajectory planning for visual
servo control, and model-based vision. A Transputer network will be installed at
the University of Illinois and at Yale University. A Zero Zebra robot and a
Silicon Graphics Person Iris workstation will also be acquired to support
collaborative experimental work in parallel numerical curve tracing and cell
decomposition, planning force-closure grasps, trajectory planning for visual
servo control, and model-based vision.
