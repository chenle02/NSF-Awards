EEC-0354102 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides support for a three-year REU Site at the University of Illinois Urbana-
Champaign. Ten students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-
week summer experience in research related to contemporary mechanics. Students
will have an opportunity to do research in broad areas of contemporary
mechanics, from problems related to some of the newest materials such as self-
healing polymer composites and nanoscale semiconductors to more common materials
such as sand and powders. Research projects will be theoretical, computational,
and experimental. The program will provide opportunities for student
participants to learn how to give technical presentations and will provide
opportunities for discussions on ethical issues related to scientific research
and public policy. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader
Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent
residents engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government
agencies, and in private-sector organizations.
