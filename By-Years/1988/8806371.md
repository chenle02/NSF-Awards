This project involves many different areas in algebra and number theory. One of
the problems concerned is the long-standing one of realizing all finite groups
as galois groups over specified fields. Methods involved range from Riemann
surfaces to the study of central extensions of sporadic simple groups. Work will
also be done on p-adic curves and on hyperbolic geometry which have important
connections with number theory, both directly and through analogies involving
Arakelov theory. A large portion of this project concerns representation theory
of groups, algebras, quivers and Lie algebras of infinite and finite dimensions.
Topics in Jordan theory that have arisen in linear algebra will also be studied.
The research supported by this award spans a variety of topics in algebra and
number theory. The results have implications for many different areas of
mathematics and physics.
