Molecular Science, fundamental to all of science and engineering (S&amp;E) is
viewed as: the University of Idaho's strongest research area; an area that can
be gradually strengthened at other Idaho institutions; and an important
discipline in Idaho's future. The goals of Idaho's Implementation Plan for the
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) are to: a)
improve the quality of basic molecular science research at the University of
Idaho; b) enhance the ability of molecular science faculty in Idaho to compete
successfully and consistently for Federal research funds. Specifically, Idaho
EPSCoR objectives are to: a) support targeted S&amp;E faculty in molecular
science to advance Idaho's national competitive position; b) improve the
research environment in Idaho; c) raise public awareness of the importance of
S&amp;E research; d) develop self-sustained involvement in S&amp;E in Idaho; and
e) build strong ties between faculty researchers in Idaho universities and
nationally competitive academic and industrial researchers. In keeping with
NSF's EPSCoR Program goals, significant progress will continue to be made in
meeting these broad objectives by the action of Idaho's legislature, industry
and universities, and by the implementation of this proposal. The proposal
includes three exciting aspects including a national mentor system promoting
active participation of researchers at other Idaho universities, and a mini-
grant program to identify and support new faculty and ideas for Idaho's
development program.
