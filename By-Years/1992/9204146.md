The objective of this research is the assessment of electromagnetic scattering
from spherical aerosol particles possessing internal inhomogeneities. A
theoretical study entailing an exact solution of the electromagnetic boundary
value problem, along with an investigation of various approximation schemes,
will be conducted. In order to corroborate the theory, laboratory tests of the
model will also be made. An aerosol model based on a survey of the physical and
atmospheric chemistry associated with the formation of sulfate and carbonaceous
aerosols and their composites will be developed. The optical properties of
composite particles provided by that model will be used in a sensitivity study
of the radiative properties of the aerosol and of the droplets for which the
aerosol particles serve as condensation nuclei. As a final exercise, a model
albedo of cirrus clouds that are made up of particles possessing internal
structure will be contrasted with cirrus models that employ spheres, sphere
aggregates, and small crystals as cloud particles.
