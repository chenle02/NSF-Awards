Genetics is a fundamental unifying theme of biology. The Human Genome Project
and&lt;br/&gt;advances in genetics and biotechnology are revolutionizing
biology, medicine and industry.&lt;br/&gt;However, genetics is an intimidating
challenge for college students across the full range of
post-&lt;br/&gt;secondary institutions and the growing demand for genetics
education outstrips the supply of&lt;br/&gt;qualified teachers.&lt;br/&gt;We are
developing a genetics cognitive tutor to support active problem-
based&lt;br/&gt;learning in undergraduate genetics courses and make genetics
accessible to more students.&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive tutors are an educational
technology that speeds learning and yields large achievement&lt;br/&gt;gains
compared to conventional instruction by providing students "just-in-time"
problem-solving&lt;br/&gt;help. Cognitive Tutor mathematics courses are
currently in use by more than 125,000 students in&lt;br/&gt;over 700 middle and
high schools. The genetics cognitive tutor is building on past successes
in&lt;br/&gt;tutoring quantitative reasoning and using the cognitive tutoring
technology in novel realms of&lt;br/&gt;scientific inference and experimental
design.&lt;br/&gt;We are pilot testing and evaluating cognitive tutor lessons in
six universities representing a&lt;br/&gt;diverse student population, and
including large public universities, private research universities,
a&lt;br/&gt;small liberal arts university and an historically black university.
Pilot testing includes formative&lt;br/&gt;evaluations of tutor effectiveness
and student learning rates. Summative evaluations of&lt;br/&gt;achievement
outcomes are being conducted by Carnegie Mellon's Office of Technology
for&lt;br/&gt;Education and Eberly Teaching Center. Cognitive tutor
dissemination activities are focusing on&lt;br/&gt;summer workshops and
conference workshops, and are facilitated by a project advisory&lt;br/&gt;board
and Carnegie Mellon's Office of Innovation Transfer.
