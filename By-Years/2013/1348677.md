Our understanding of how humans interpret sentences must accommodate not just
the content that finds explicit expression in sentences, but also that content
that is omitted, as is seen in instances of ellipsis. This research project
investigates how people mentally process elliptical sentences, sentences in
which some element of the sentence's meaning is not overtly represented in the
spoken or written form of the sentence. Specifically, this project focuses upon
the real-time comprehension of one particular elliptical construction called
Gapping. Gapping is the kind of ellipsis illustrated in "Joan ordered coleslaw,
and Peter, potato salad," where a verb has gone missing, leaving something
behind both before and after it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a language user
encounters a Gapping construction, she must refer back to already processed
words from the preceding clause and identify those with which to fill the blank
in the Gapped clause. Under the direction of Dr. Masaya Yoshida, Michael Frazier
will carry out a series of experiments to examines how this process of retrieval
occurs: what clues it makes reference to in the overt form of the sentence, and
how the listener or reader of such a construction uses different aspects of
grammatical knowledge to retrieve already-processed words to "fill the blank" at
the ellipsis site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because elliptical sentences rely for
their interpretation on listeners' ability to deduce an interpretation for parts
of the sentence that have been omitted, they are an ideal testing ground for the
role of the grammar in comprehension. How people understand them can be used as
a probe for investigating the relation between different aspects of the language
system, the static knowledge system of a language's grammar, and the real-time
processes used to put words together into phrases and clauses as they are
encountered.
