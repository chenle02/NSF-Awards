This award provides funding for the conference "Summer School and Workshop:
Mathematical Analysis of Water Waves and Related Models" that will be held June
5-9, 2017 at the Bodega Marine Laboratory.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of mathematical fluid dynamics. A number of distinguished mathematicians
have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early
career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded
by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.
The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~shkoller/WWSC
