This project includes field observations, laboratory experiments, and modeling
tasks designed to investigate the chemistry associated with halogens, such as
bromine and iodine, in the atmosphere. Measurements will be made at two mountain
top observatories (Maido in the Southern Hemisphere tropical Indian Ocean and
Mauna Loa in the Northern Hemisphere tropical Pacific Ocean) to assess the
seasonal variability of halogen concentrations. This research will provide
critical new information for assessing the extent to which tropospheric halogens
modify the lifetime of tropospheric ozone, a potent greenhouse gas, and serve as
a precursor for the formation of hydroxyl radicals, that influence the lifetime
of atmospheric methane. Thus the results will be directly relevant for modeling
future climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments will be
conducted to investigate the reaction mechanism of bromine radicals with
unsaturated oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) that can form from
aliphatic acids in marine air and the potential for product yields of glyoxal
and aliphatic aldehydes. Modeling efforts will compare field measurements with
the results of global models to assess the impacts of the BrOx sink from OVOC
for halogen impacts on tropospheric ozone, methane, and atmospheric mercury.
