This small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the feasibility of a new optical sensing paradigm complete with field-
deployable, non-invasive, automated, sensors for routine assessment of lobster
vitality. The instrument incorporates a fiber optic probe that is interfaced
with the lobster ventral sinus membrane and interrogates lobster health through
absorbance and fluorescent spectroscopy of the lobster hemolymph. The specific
research objectives: (i) analyze lobster hemolymph in vivo using non-invasive,
optical sensor. (ii) compare these measurements to those obtained with extracted
hemolymph from the same lobsters (iii) determine the feasibility of the proposed
method and the design specifications for a portable, non-invasive, lobster
vitality sensor.

The broader impacts of this research are that the development of this sensor
will enable the transition of sensor research current research at Mainely
Sensors and The Lobster Institute, at the University of Maine, to a fully
commercialized product in the lobster markets while promoting teaching and
learning for University undergraduate and graduate students. Currently funded,
NSF educational grants, GK-12, Research Experience for Undergraduates,
Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, and Research Experience
for Teachers sensor programs, integrate sensor science and technology into the
University and secondary school curricula, and offer research, educational, and
job opportunities for the participants. It will benefit the national and
international American lobster industry, including lobstermen, lobster dealers,
holding facilities, and shippers, and research community. It is also anticipated
that the proposed sensor will be applicable to other lobster and crustacean
species.
