Dr. Warren S. Warren is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to develop new laser pulse shaping and pulse sequencing techniques for
spectroscopic studies of molecular species in both gas and condensed phases. The
novel aspect of this work comes from the use of enhanced control over the laser
radiation field to produce simple and interpretable molecular states in a wide
variety of applications. Warren has demonstrated both theoretically and
experimentally that it is possible to produce shaped pulses and pulse sequences
with picosecond resolution, high powers, and complete phase control. He has also
demonstrated which characteristic shapes would be required to solve specific
molecular problems such as selective excitation of vibrational states,
compensation for optical density and relaxation effects in both gases and
molecular crystals, and velocity selection without the use of molecular beams.
These techniques are being used in a variety of studies. For example, two shaped
pulses of different colors are being used to selectively and completely pump
high vibrational states in iodine, thus permitting study of both velocity
changing collisions and the evolution of the reaction which powers the oxygen-
iodine laser. Shaped deep-UV pulses plus visible pulses are being used to
characterize the bending potential and photochemistry of HCP. Localized
molecular excitations of 1,4-dibromonaphthalene are being pumped in order to
study soliton propagation in fibers. Finally, photon echo sequences are being
studied to give undistorted decays independent of optical density effects and
molecular interactions in mixed organic crystals.
