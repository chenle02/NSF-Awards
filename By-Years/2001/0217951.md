The majority of biological databases today are broad, but shallow, covering
large amounts of material but in a relatively cursory way. These are essential
resources as scientists use molecular biological techniques to develop a catalog
of the molecules founds in living cell. Now, it is time to move beyond simply
cataloguing the molecules of a cell toward the time for understanding the
dynamic interactions between molecules within a cell. This level of
understanding requires a different kind of database, one that links together
sequence, genetics, structure and function to create a deeper resource. The
existing Protein Kinase Resource (PKR, http://pkr.sdsc.edu) will be extended to
create a resource from which both novices and experts can learn about protein
kinases, an important family of enzymes that play roles in processes as diverse
as human disease and crop production. From a technical standpoint, the resource
will integrate data from a variety of existing resources in ways not previously
achieved. The integration at UCSD provides a location for developing detailed
and well defined application program interfaces (APIs) that will allow these
resources to interoperate. It will deliver both content and technological
advances in the field of biological databases. All data, software and
specifications will be publicly available. Beyond students involved in the
research, workshops will provide instruction in community annotation of kinases
using the PKR and ways to adapt the database for other uses. Modules of the
database and APIs will enable the utilization of this work by other groups
interested in other enzyme families.
