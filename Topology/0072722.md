Abstract:

This project is centered around the classification theory of topological
4-dimensional manifolds. One goal is to find sufficient algebraic conditions for
splitting of a 4-manifold as a connected sum, up to an s-cobordism, in terms of
the fundamental group and the intersection pairing. The main techniques for
classification of manifolds, surgery and s-cobordism conjectures, remain open
for 4-manifolds with large fundamental groups. This project will focus on a new
approach to the problem, searching for involutions on certain canonical
examples, and for possible obstructions from gauge theory.

The classification of possible large-scale structures in dimension 4, which
locally look like the 4-dimensional space-time, turned out to be a much more
subtle problem than in higher dimensions. This area of research lies at the
intersection of topology, geometry, analysis and physics. This project is aimed
at a better understanding of 4-dimensional objects with large fundamental
groups, which contain many loops that cannot be contracted. In particular, one
goal is to analyze when a given object may be decomposed into more elementary
building blocks.
