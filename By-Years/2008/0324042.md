This CSEMS (Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics) Program is providing
scholarship support for a new cohort group of 19-20 students in years one, two
and three with continuing support in years two through four in computer science,
computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. The
project is focusing on the recruitment, retention, and graduation of scholars
from underrepresented groups who are academically talented and financially
needy. It is projected that at least 90% of participating scholars will graduate
with a CSEM A.A. or A.S. degree and either enter a CSEM occupation or enroll in
a CSEM baccalaureate degree program. The overall goals of the CSEMS Program are
to: (1) increase the numbers of employees in CSEM areas of local, state, and
national need; (2) improve educational outcomes for academically talented,
financially needy students in CSEM disciplines; (3) ensure the ongoing
academic/career success of CSEMS scholars; (4) continuously improve the
quality/scope of student support services available to students; and (5) build
meaningful partnerships with education and industry partners that will enhance
and improve the quality of professionals entering the high-technology workforce.
The strategic objectives of the CSEMS Program at St Petersburg College are to:
(1) establish/maintain exemplary high-technology scholarship and degree
programs; (2) recruit and retain a superb faculty in CSEM disciplines that is
fully engaged in the academic success of all students; (3) recruit, educate, and
graduate ever increasing numbers of academically talented, financially needy
students in CSEM disciplines; and (4) create and maintain a student support
infrastructure that significantly increases the rate of academic success for
students entering CSEM degree programs.
