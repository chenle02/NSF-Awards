This project focuses on elliptic variational problems, parabolic variational
inequalities, equimeasurable convex symmetrization, variational integrals
involving mappings of bounded variation, and nonlinear potential theory. Much of
the proposer's recent work in the area of elliptic variational problems has
concentrated on problems involving the regularity of solutions to variational
inequalities that arise from both irregular and smooth obstacles and that
involve degenerate elliptic operators. An approach has been developed that may
yield more information about the free boundary in the case of smooth obstacles
and it may lead also to another treatment in the case of elliptic systems. These
questions and techniques lead to their parabolic counterparts in parabolic
variational inequalities where less is known and the difficulties are greater.
Many of the questions and techniques in elliptic variational problems, and
parabolic variational inequalities have considerable overlap with those in
nonlinear potential theory. The proposer finds the problems of equimeasurable
convex symmetrization and variational integrals involving mappings of bounded
variation especially compelling because of their interaction with geometric
analysis and the promise of going further in the direction of applied areas.
