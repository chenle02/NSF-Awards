The chemistry and physics of metal clusters are studied, especially as they
relate to heterogeneous catalysis, synthesis of ceramic powders, and genesis of
metal- semiconductor interfaces. Three areas are addressed. The catalytic
activity of organotungsten complexes toward hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is
studied as a function of support and promoter. Chemisorption of hydrogen and of
carbon monoxide on very small (5-50 atoms) clusters of Group VIII metals is
investigated as a function of cluster size and shape. The reactions of reactive
organometallic complexes on clean surfaces of indium phosphide will be
investigated as a route to low-defect interfaces for microelectronic
applications. A variety of techniques are used including temperature-programmed
reaction (TPR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). This
research is relevant to the production of high-technology ceramics, the
development of new catalytic processes, and the production of high-quality
microelectronic devices. It is also pertinent to the more general problem of the
production and application of very small organized clusters, sometimes called
nanostructures.
