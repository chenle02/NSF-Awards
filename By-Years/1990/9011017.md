Neurotransmitters and neurohormones are released from a neuron or endocrine
cell primarily through the process of exocytosis. Central to this process is the
calcium-dependent fusion of a small, membrane-limited vesicle with the outer
membrane of the cell. Two immediate consequences of this fusion are the release
of the vesicle contents (transmitter or hormone) into the extra- cellular space
and an increase in the surface area of the cell. This project will provide basic
information about the mechanism of transmitter release by exploiting recent
technical advances to measure these minute changes in cell surface area. Using
the adrenal chromaffin cell as a model system and triggering release by brief
changes in the electrical potential across the cell membrane, this project will
provide new information about the quantitative relationship between calcium and
transmitter release.
