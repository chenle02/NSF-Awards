Alluvial fan formation in desert environments is still a debated subject, and
application of conceptual models developed for fan formation in specific regions
to areas with different climate settings generally lacks robust quantitative
support. This international collaborative project aims to input data into these
conceptual models by testing alternate hypotheses on the formation of Late
Quaternary alluvial fans in the southern Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The central hypothesis is that tropical cyclones have performed most of the
geomorphic work during this period and that seasonal high intensity
precipitation has been coupled to rapid weathering of bedrock to generate cyclic
alluvial fan aggradation in response to millennial-scale climate variability.
Combined cosmogenic nuclide depth profile age determination and optically
stimulated luminescence depth profile dating will be supported with detailed
analyses of sedimentology and soil development of the sedimentary units in the
Late Pleistocene-Holocene. These techniques are aimed to determine
simultaneously sediment production on the hillslopes and delivery and
accumulation rates in the alluvial units. The results will yield a clear picture
of when the alluvial units were built, when the alluvial surfaces stabilized,
how fast sediment was deposited, and how long the sediment was stored in the
hillslopes before transport and deposition. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project
(supported by NSF's programs in Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics, P2C2, and
EPSCoR, and Office of International Science and Engineering) will produce
datasets and knowledge that are of interest to a larger scientific audience and
to the broader public. First, we will test a widely used model of alluvial fan
aggradation for the deserts of southwestern North America. Second, we will test
how the relevance of tropical cyclones has evolved over millennial timescales in
this area and help to analyze tropical cyclone effects in other arid and semi-
arid regions of the world (in particular, we will link with studies that assess
activity of Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones over the last centuries and their
effects on ecosystems and human population in the rapidly growing areas of
southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico to improve hazard characterization of
these storms). Third, our more precise correlation of alluvial fans surfaces
normally used as paleoseismological markers will improve determination of
earthquake recurrence intervals and of local and regional fault slip rates,
increasing our understanding of fault kinematics not only in neighboring areas
in Baja California but also in all arid southwestern North America and other
regions where alluvial surfaces are used to infer earthquake recurrence rates.
