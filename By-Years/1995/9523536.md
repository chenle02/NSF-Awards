9523536 Nogues-Paegle The latent heat release associated with convective
activity is an important source of atmospheric heating which drives atmospheric
circulations. Because clouds greatly reduce the earth's outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), satellite-derived OLR fields can be used, at least in tropical
regions, to identify regions of vigorous convective activity, and atmospheric
heating. While the relationship between tropical convection and global
circulation patterns has been established in observational studies, an
assessment of the effectiveness of global models to simulate this connection has
been hampered by the lack of model derived OLR fields that could be compared
with observations. As part of the reanalysis project underway at the National
Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), OLR fields for the top of the
atmosphere are being produced both as part of the data assimilation and for the
forecast (to eight days) products. Dr. Nogues-Paegle will examine the reanalysis
products for 1985-1993, comparing the model simulations of OLR to satellite
measured fields for the same periods. She also will assess the NCEP model
forecast skill by assessing the effect of uncertainties in initial tropical
convection field on forecasts for the mid-latitudes. These studies should
provide for the broader atmospheric sciences community important insights into
quality of the reanalysis products and the effectiveness of the NCEP model
parameterizations. ***
