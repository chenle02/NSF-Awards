This research attempts to gain a better understanding of the intrinsic
properties of complete sets for many natural complexity classes. The research
will explore how the complexity-theoretic properties of complete sets are
affected by the strength of the reducibilities defining them, and the
relationships between these properties and the central problems in complexity
theory. One such property is immunity, which examines whether all complete
problems have larger subproblems which are easier to solve than the full
problem. This research bears upon the existence of certain types of
approximations to these intractable sets. Another area of study is the strength
of efficient reductions between pairs of complete sets and the possibility of
reductions from complete sets to sparse sets or other sets with a particular
structure. The relationships between the complexity-theoretic results in these
areas and other current research problems such as the isomorphism problem and
the existence of certain types of one-way functions are a central focus of this
work.
