In this project funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Barbara Wyslouzil of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute will pursue a
program of research on nanodroplet aerosols. The formation of liquid droplets in
aerosols will be studied with a view to measuring and understanding nucleation
from a phase transition perspective. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) will
be used to experimentally monitor particle size and composition and structure,
and infrared (IR) measurements will be used to aid in the compositional analysis
during nucleation and droplet formation. The research program is two pronged.
First, a deeper understanding of phase transitions under conditions that are far
from equilibrium will be obtained. Very high cooling rates insure that nuleation
and condensation (phase transition) occur under highly supersaturated
conditions. Intrinsic size distribution data from SANS measurements are expected
to provide the first direct experimental measurements of nucleation rates in
nozzles. Second, the internal structure of multi-component droplets will be
discerned. The compositional and structural data will be used to test various
models for the droplet structure. Key among the compositional factors to be
examined is the degree to which immiscible phases mix and the clarity with which
phase boundaries develop between immiscible liquids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will lead to a deeper understanding of how multicomponent droplets form.
The results of the work will benefit society in helping to understand the
physical chemistry of droplet nucleation, and this knowledge will benefit
weather and climate studies and industrial processes based upon aerosol droplet
formation. The work also will have a high impact on teaching undergradute and
graduate students advanced materials science experimental and analysis
techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&l
