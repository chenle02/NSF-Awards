Students can participate in modern plant ecology and physiology with the use of
new equipment including growth chambers, a portable photosynthesis measuring
system, a portable leaf area meter, a datalogger, a portable chamber for
measuring plant water stress, an analytical balance, and electrophoresis
equipment. A series of laboratory exercises have been developed to examine the
effects of environmental stress on plants. Exercises using the new equipment
include 1. laboratory and field studies on the effects of environmental
variation on plant growth, development and reproduction; 2. studies of plant
competition under controlled environmental conditions; and 3. studies that
examine levels of genetic variability in population and measure the proportion
of variation in multi-gene traits determined by environmental or genetic
factors.
