This study will demonstrate the usefulness of strontium, carbon, and oxygen
isotopic ratios of biogenic carbonate for dating sediments from glaciomarine
environments and interpreting paleoclimatic conditions in Antarctic continental
shelves. The award will support an isotopic (strontium, oxygen and carbon) study
of foraminifera and bivalves from sediments of Oligocene to Recent age recovered
from several drillholes and outcrops on Antarctica. Age estimates based on Sr
isotope analyses will provide useful information about sedimentary and glacial
processes in Antarctica, as well as permit correlation of glaciomarine sequences
and assist in their correlation to lower latitude sedimentary successions. It is
the goal of this study to provide direct information about the Cenozoic climate
of Antarctic marginal seas, which is presently lacking. Paleoceanography will be
inferred from oxygen and carbon isotope ratios. Isotopic data from Antarctic
bivalves and foraminifera will be compared with published records for Cenozoic
surface and deep waters at low and high latitudes. This will clarify the sources
of bottom water formation in the world in the world ocean and the relation
between high and low latitude climates.
