This project will provide support for students attending US universities to
attend and present at the IEEE Conference on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks
(DySPAN) in Stockholm, Sweden from September 29 - October 2, 2015. IEEE DySPAN
is the premier conference to discuss, publish and present recent advancements
regarding technical and policy challenges in the spectrum domain. Conference
participation is a crucial part of training students to be researchers but the
cost can be prohibitive for many students. Given the scarcity of spectrum and
importance to the US economy, it is essential to develop this pool of
researchers.

Up to 16 students from US universities will have the opportunity to attend and
present their work in this international forum through travel grants. Students
from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply for the
grants. Attending students will get feedback on their own research, learn about
the state of the art and interact with a variety of senior researchers and
peers.
