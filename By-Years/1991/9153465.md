This is a model project focused on the Hispanic middle school eight grade
population of the Philadelphia area to address the underrepresentation of
Hispanics in engineering. The project is a collaborative effort between a
private research oriented University (University of Pennsylvania); LULAC, a non-
profit organization serving the Hispanic community; four middle schools with a
large Hispanic constituency; and the North Philadelphia Hispanic community. It
consists of weekly gatherings during the summer with 20 students and their
parents in the Hispanic community of North Philadelphia. These meeting are used
to discuss the advantages, potentials and family infrastructure needs associated
with a college education in the engineering sciences. The students spend two
days a week for 10 weeks during the summer at the Penn campus to participate in
workshops and other activities. The purpose of these activities is to
familiarize them with what engineering is about and what engineers do. In
addition to time on the Penn campus, the students visit local industries to
allow for exposure to the engineering work environment. A mentoring system has
been designed in cooperation with Hispanic undergraduate students, graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows. These individuals provide tutoring and
academic guidance to the participating students; they are also responsible for
explaining in detail the academic requirements and other needs involved in
obtaining an engineering degree.
