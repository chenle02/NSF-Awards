Methanogenic bacteria are members of a newly described, third primary kingdom
of organisms, the archaebacteria. One of the many characteristics that seperate
the methanogens from all other organisms, including other archaebacteria, is
their ability to produce methane. The production of methane requires a number of
novel coenzymes or cofactors; these include methanopterin and component B. This
research is directed at establishing the routes used by these organisms for the
biosyntheses of these important coenzymes. Methanopterin appears to represent
the first reported example of a structurally modified folic acid. Since this
modified folic acid is present in the methanogenic archaebacteria, there is the
possibility that other modified C1 carriers are to be found in other
archaebacterial species. Studies on one species of Sulfolobus, a thermophilic
archaebacteria, have indeed shown it to contain a C1 carrier different in
structure from methanopterin and from any known folic acid. In this research,
the structure of this C1 carrier will be determined and it will be compared with
those of folic acid and methanopterin in the hope that their structures may shed
some light on how the biosyntheses of these different C1 carriers have evolved
in the different groups of organisms.//
