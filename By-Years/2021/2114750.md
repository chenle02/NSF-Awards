The aim of this project is: (1) to carry out a social scientific analysis into
how scientists design and build large stretches of DNA and (2) to develop new
approaches to responsible research and innovation in an international, cross-
project, multispecies context. Synthetic genomics is an emerging scientific
field in which scientists aim to design and build larger stretches of DNA than
ever before, at the scale of chromosomes and even whole genomes. We aim to bring
diverse perspectives into this field by conducting a social scientific analysis
designed to support discussion of responsible research. By studying responsible
research within a large-scale, international, collaborative scientific in
genomics this project will mitigate the tendency for these conversations to be
organized at the individual project level by isolated social scientists. This
project will be of interest to scientists working directly in genomics and
engineering biology as well as citizens, policy makers, and scientists working
in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a cross-national social
scientific investigation of synthetic genomics to further the theory and
practice of responsible research and innovation, and to develop capacity for
productive future collaborations between the social and natural sciences. It
will examine how ideas of national competitiveness and international
collaboration are shaping policies for synthetic genomics and the place of
responsible research and innovation within these policies. It will reflect on
and articulating roles that social sciences can play in doing synthetic genomics
responsibly. This project will bring diverse stakeholder perspectives into
discussions of synthetic genomics through a series of workshops to investigate
synthetic genomics and developing social scientific engagement with the field.
The projectâ€™s findings will contribute the theories and practices of responsible
research and innovation (RRI), research and funding policy, the relationship
between expectations and research trajectories, the challenges of
interdisciplinary collaboration with scientific fields, and multispecies
studies. It will be of interest to researchers working in innovation studies,
sociology, anthropology, geography, politics, development studies, history,
philosophy and bioethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is
awarded under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency Opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
