This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen transfer reactions by Dr.
Robert G. Bergman of the Department of Chemistry, University of California-
Berkeley. Transition metal complexes capable of transferring heteroatoms, such
as sulfur, oxygen, and alkylated nitrogen, between organic molecules and metal
centers will be studied. Initial work will focus on organotantalum complexes
which remove these atoms and groups from three-membered organic ring compounds,
creating hydrocarbons and new metal complexes with heteroatom-metal multiple
bonds. After this initial phase, the project will define the mechanism of these
reactions in preparation for identifying other metal complexes which can run
these reactions in reverse catalytically, thus generating complexes which can
convert alkenes into species such as epoxides, thiiranes and aziridines. The
transfer of heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen between organic
molecules and transition metal centers is a fundamental chemical process in
organic and biological enzyme chemistry. The results should lead to the design
of reactions useful in organic synthesis in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries, and to methods for removal of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen from
fuels, thus reducing production of environmentally harmful sulfur and nitrogen
oxides from this source.
