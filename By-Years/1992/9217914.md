This award will partially fund the expenses for about ten participants in the
"1993 New England Doppler Conference". This conference will be held in
Lakeville, Connecticut on May 25 to 28, 1993. The conference will be divided
into twelve sessions and the topics will include, among others, Doppler
frequency analysis, the detection of flow in multiple directions, hemodynamics,
velocity displays and future applications. This conference is important since it
will bring together a group of participants from diverse areas to discuss future
directions in research in Doppler ultrasound. The meeting should stimulate
research into emerging areas important to the advancement of the field.
