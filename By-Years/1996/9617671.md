D Asaro 9617671 Turbulence is the upper ocean mixed layer will be examined by
analyzing recently collected data consisting of neutrally buoyant float
trajectories in both wind-driven and convectively-driven conditions, high-
quality air-sea fluxes, surface wave spectra and temperature/salinity profiles.
In addition to following the three-dimensional motion of water parcels, the
floats also measure temperature, stratification and vertical vorticity. From
these measurements, both Lagrangian and Eulerian profiles of Eckman velocity,
turbulent kinetic energy and its components, turbulent dissipation rates, rms
horizontal and vertical displacements will be calculated to see how they scale
with surface fluxes and surface wave properties. A numerical model will also be
used to investigate the use of Lagrangian floats for measuring heat flux and/or
mixing rates.
