Demand for content with high data rate requirements has reached unprecedented
levels. Services like video on-demand, once thought impossible to deliver
through resource constrained wireless channels, will become the norm rather than
the exception in the near future. Next generation designs thus need to utilize
new resources to satisfy user demands. Coded caching is a promising paradigm in
this direction in that it offers local data storage as a means to alleviate
network congestion. This project aims to make significant progress in bridging
the gap between theory and practice of coded caching by addressing the
heterogeneity in the data storage capacities of the nodes. This project also
puts forward a new content delivery network architecture envisioned to include
energy harvesting nodes whose heterogeneous energy availability needs to be
explicitly taken into account in designing caching strategies.

The project involves optimizing caching placement and delivery strategies for
networks with heterogeneous cache sizes. Building on these strategies, the
project will also pursue the research direction where energy sustainability is
improved by capitalizing caching in energy harvesting communication networks.
The research will utilize information theory, communication theory and
optimization as tools and is envisioned to be of fundamental nature. The broader
impact of the project includes informing the design of next generation content
delivery networks, as well as contributing to the vision of new network
architectures with energy harvesting nodes introduced to content delivery
networks. The educational broader impact includes dissemination through invited
lectures, tutorials, and publications, as well as integration of research
results into the graduate curriculum.
