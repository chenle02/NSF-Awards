The application of surface vibrational spectroscopy to the study of adsorbates
on electrode surfaces is the focus of this research project in the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry program. Professor Weaver will examine both in situ
electrochemical interfaces as well as electrode surfaces transferred into the
UHV environment. Carbon monoxide will be used as a probe molecule to investigate
the interactions of adsorbate and solvent molecules in model double layer
electrochemical environments. Surface reconstruction on gold and platinum group
substrates will be examined, as well as its relation to electrochemical
adsorption and reactivity. %%% Spectroscopic studies of electrochemical
interfaces will be carried out using a variety of model systems and approaches.
An understanding of the structure and reactivity of the solid-solution interface
will enable the design and optimization of electrochemical systems with
important application in electrocatalysis, power generation and storage, and
electrochemical synthesis.
