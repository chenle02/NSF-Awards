This project will develop a self-consistent model of the near-Earth portion of
the plasma sheet. It will specify the particle distributions, the effects of the
plasma sheet on the magnetic field, and the effects of the plasma sheet on the
formation of the ring current during magnetic storms. The approach will be to
use test particle tracing techniques in conjunction with an MHD code. The
technique will couple the particle tracing with the MHD modeling in a way that
will produce a self-consistent model without using the basic MHD approximations
that are invalid within the inner plasma sheet. This approach has already been
used in modeling the quiet-time plasma sheet and the method will now be extended
to conditions of enhanced convection, including the growth phase of substorms
and convection bays (steady magnetospheric convection). During the later stages
of the project the model will be extended beyond a 2-D plasma sheet model to
include field-aligned currents within the plasma sheet.
