Hardin DMS-1109266

The investigator and his colleagues study the theory and applications of
discrete minimum energy problems that are of significance in the discretization
of compact metric spaces. By utilizing minimal weighted Riesz energy
configurations, one can generate sequences of points on surfaces that
approximate prescribed density functions on that surface. Such constructions
have a myriad of possible applications to the physical and biological sciences.
Specifically, the team is studying (i) separation and fill-radius estimates for
optimal N-point weighted energy configurations; (ii) geometrical properties of
optimal and near optimal weighted energy configurations on 2-dimensional
surfaces; (iii) algorithms for the fast generation of points distributed on a
manifold in accordance with a prescribed density; (iv) properties of greedy
energy points; and (v) near optimal discretizations for problems of importance
in geophysical applications.

The investigator and his colleagues study stable (minimum energy) states of
charged particle configurations on curved surfaces and solid materials,
especially when such particles are restricted in density or under the influence
of external forces. One goal of the project is to determine efficient numerical
methods for the generation of optimal or near optimal distributions of point
charges that can be used to help understand the convection of the Earth's
mantle, for the modeling of the geodynamo, and to gain a better determination of
the Earth's gravitational field. This project addresses in several different
contexts the fundamental problem of how best to convert from analog to digital.
