9503295 Whitaker The primary objective of this project is to develop improved
methods for ensemble weather prediction. Numerical experiments with idealized
models will be performed to examine the utility of different strategies for
ensemble prediction. the reduced dimension of the models will allow the
principal investigator and his colleagues to perform experiments with much
larger ensemble sizes than would be feasible with complex, operational forecast
models. Archived operational ensemble predictions produced by the National
Meteorological Center will be examined to test diagnostic techniques and methods
for predicting forecast skill suggested by the idealized model experiments. The
research will focus on three critical topics: (1) the method of constructing the
initial conditions for ensemble runs; (2) determining the optimal number of
ensemble members required for useful estimates of the most probable forecast
state and (3) how systematic errors in the model affect the efficacy of the
ensemble prediction. This research has an enormous potential for contributing to
the improvement of operational medium-range weather forecasts. ***
