The Kawalo Marine Laboratory, a unit of the University of Hawaii, was
established in 1971 with funding from the NSF and the state of Hawaii. The
laboratory provides infrastructure for research and training in basic biological
research, marine biotechnology and conservation biology. This award provides
support for 1) the upgrade and renovation of portions of the seawater system and
2) the installation of an emergency notification system for freezers and
incubators whose failure could have serious impacts within hours. Planned
improvements in the seawater system include new seawater table supports, a sand
filter unit and UV water sterilization equipment. The permanent research staff
at Kewalo includes six University of Hawaii faculty. In addition, the laboratory
hosts 5 to 10 visiting scientists each year. University of Hawaii students
receive training and participate in undergraduate and graduate-level coursework
at the Laboratory, which provides access to nearby coral reefs, estuaries,
extensive beaches and deep ocean. Research interests of Kewalo scientists range
from biodiversity to invasive species and study of well-developed marine model
organisms.
