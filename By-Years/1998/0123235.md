Statement of Objectives. The Fort Berthold Community College Technology and
Instruction Enhancement Project is proposed to increase the numbers and
persistence of American Indian SMET majors and potential majors

- The technology infrastructure of the college will be strengthened by expanded
band width and high tech access for students, faculty and staff. - The SMET
curriculum will integrate constructivist methods and technology applications to
improve SMET student learning outcomes and persistence rates. - The college
faculty and staff will build teaching and learning capacities through
constructivist methodologies and techniques and technology applications. -
American Indian SMET students persistence will be increased by 10% per year
through a student retention model called Family Based Education. - SMET students
will have expanded internships and community service placements, workforce
placement and transfer opportunities through formal community outreach
relationships.

Methods to be Employed. The Technology and Instruction Enhancement Project of
Fort Berthold Community College will focus on the recruitment and retention of
American Indian Students toward graduation and transfer or workforce placement.
First, the technology infrastructure will be expanded by improving the band
width to speed up and broaden technology capacities. The student access to high
tech equipment and applications will include the additionof high tech
laboratories for student learning Web-conferencing capacities will be installed
in theMentor Sites in three remote satellite campus locations. Second,
constructivist teaching/learning methods and techniques that heightened student
experiential learning and active discovery based activity; and increased
technology applications will be integrated across the curriculum. The computer
science networking program will deliver professional certificationsand two full
time faculty members will make this a technology centerpiece in the curriculum.

Third, the curriculum and college services will be vastly improved through
faculty and staff development opportunities in constructivist teaching/learning
methods and technology applications. Faculty development opportunities will
include individual professional conferences and mini-grants for research
projects that involve SMET student interns as assistants. Fourth, to improve
student retention rates, the student services division will acquire a full time
retention officer to implement an aggressive, pro-active retention strategy
called the Family Based Education Model. Pressure points in the family based
American Indian students lives are identified and through a team analysis,
referral and intervention strategies are prescribed to each student itat-risk.ln
Community outreach will expand SMET student opportunities for internship and
community service placements.

Project Outcomes. The project outcome will be increased American Indian SMET
student retention rates, 10% increases annually during the project period. The
technology infrastructure will advance according to campus-wide plans. The
faculty and staff will have long term capacities and skills reflecting
constructivist methods and technology applications. The Family Based Education
Model will have intervened with at-risk SMET students, to heighten retention
rates. Broad-based community relationships will support SMET majors and
graduates and the college as an educational institution.
