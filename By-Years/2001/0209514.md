0209514&lt;br/&gt;Bellaachia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project
supports a U.S.-Morocco workshop on information technology to be held in Rabat,
Morocco June 2002. The U.S. organizer is Dr. Abdelghani Bellaachia, Professor in
the Department of Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington,
D.C. The Moroccan co-organizer is Dr. Said Belcadi, Director, Scientific
Research and Cooperation (CNCPRST), Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research, Rabat, Morocco. The workshop will cover topics in the following areas:
bioinformatics, e-commerce, internet/networking, software engineering,
telecomputing/telemedicine, and wireless communications. It is hoped that the
presentations and discussions will lead to identifications of areas of
cooperative research of mutual interest to the two
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project will likely open avenues for
collaboration in information technology research, an important area for the
United States and for many of the developing countries, such as Morocco, where
there is a need to accelerate the development in that area and to reap benefits
in many applications such as in education, communications and in
industrialization. The U.S. team that Dr. Bellaachia has assembled is composed
of eminent and experienced scientists. The Government of Morocco has strongly
endorsed the workshop. Funding for the project is provided by the Office of
International Science and Engineering and the Division of Advanced Networking
Infrastructure and Research.&lt;br/&gt;
