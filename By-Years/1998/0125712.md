Chemistry (12)

This proposal focuses on improvements in the Instrumental Analysis and Physical
Chemistry laboratories, in the undergraduate research program, and in the
enhancement of collaborative efforts across disciplines fostered by the
acquisition of an LC-MS. Experiments are being adapted from the research and
educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate curriculum. In the
Instrumental Analysis laboratory, students are performing project-based,
comprehensive investigations typical of those they will be expected to carry out
once employed in an industrial setting. Each project involves real world
problems, utilizes several instruments, includes a literature review, method
development, and laboratory preparation, and requires 2-4 weeks for completion.
The LC-MS is playing a significant role in several of these projects. The
instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate research, both within
the Department and in collaboration with faculty members outside the Department.
