In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Narayan Hosmane of Northern
Illinois University will develop ways to integrate metallacarborane chemistry
into a variety of materials. Carboranes are clusters of boron and carbon atoms,
and metallacarboranes are formed when the carborane is bonded to a metal ion.
When carboranes and metallacarboranes are bonded to supports, the resulting
materials could have novel therapeutic, heavy metal remediation or radiation
shielding properties. Additionally, the PI will investigate the chemistry of
boron nanotubes, a counterpart to the more widely studied single walled carbon
nanotubes. During this project, undergraduate and graduate students and
postdoctoral research scholars will be trained in synthetic chemistry and
materials science.
