The investigators seek to advance the creation of a Cooperative Institute for
Deep Earth Research (CIDER). This award will provide funds to hold a series of 2
workshops over a period of one to two years whose goal will be to define the
scope and activities of a possible future CIDER. The workshops will be
interdisciplinary in nature and will address the question of global Earth
structure, evolution, and dynamics. Participation will be open to the community.
The direct product of each workshop will be a report listing the key questions
identified during the workshop, whose resolution requires an interdisciplinary
approach, as well as recommendations for the activities and structure of the
future CIDER. These documents will then be used as a basis for the preparation
of a detailed proposal for the establishment of CIDER.
