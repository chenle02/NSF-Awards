Mentor - Colleague Teacher Project will involve development of 28 elementary
teachers in a single school district as mentor teachers over a three year
period. Each mentor teacher will receive 90 hours of science instruction prior
to the year in which they will work with their colleagues. In the interim summer
materials for work in hands-on inquiry based instruction to use with colleagues
will be developed. North Texas State University is contributing cost-sharing an
amount that is equal to 67.7% of the NSF award.
