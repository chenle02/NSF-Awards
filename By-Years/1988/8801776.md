This project is mathematical research in certain areas of function theory.
Functions in the plane satisfying rather simple partial differential equations,
for instance analytic and harmonic functions, turn out to have properties which
make them both useful and fascinating. A fundamental property exhibited by such
functions is that their values on a simple closed curve completely determine
their values at points inside. One can study harmonic and analytic functions so
to speak concretely, or one can take a more abstract approach by forming Banach
spaces or algebras of appropriate kinds of functions and applying the methods of
functional analysis. The investigators specialize in attacking concrete problems
with abstract methods. More specifically, the topics to be investigated include
uniform algebras, algebras of bounded analytic functions, the corona problem in
the plane, estimates for harmonic measure, and the spectral theory of certain
types of Schroedinger operators.
