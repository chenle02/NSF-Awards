9731426 Fleischman Villanova University provides a 36-month Teacher and Student
Development Through Research Experience project. The project provides 45
students entering grades 10 and 11 and 15 high school mathematics teachers with
interdisciplinary research experiences involving mathematical modeling and
computational analysis of biological systems. Participant teams of 3 students
and 1 teacher engage in research projects during a 5-week summer component. The
research activity continues during the academic year, using electronic
communication to maintain contact between the teams and project faculty. All
participants return for a spring research symposium. The project assists and
supports teachers in adapting and transferring portions of the research
experience into their classrooms.
