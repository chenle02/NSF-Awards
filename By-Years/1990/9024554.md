This is a one-year pilot project to investigate the integration of parallel
numeric and symbolic computation techniques. It will consist of the following
steps: o Establish the importance of parallel processing of computer algebra by
experiments with finite element problems. o Establish the potential of emerging
automatic parallelization technology to speed computer algebra by
experimentation with kernel algorithms for computer algebra. o Establish the
potential for parallelization of mixed symbolic/numeric computations by
experimentation with sparse matrix kernels.
