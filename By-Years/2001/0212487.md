0212487&lt;br/&gt;Pfrender&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contemporary natural populations
are faced with a challenging suite of changing environmental conditions. The
ability of populations to adapt to new conditions depends, in large part, on the
patterns of genetic variation underlying adaptive characters. A well-developed
theoretical framework exists for analyzing the rate and trajectory of
adaptation. However, there is a lack of sufficient empirical data to extend this
framework to make predictions about the potential for populations to adapt to
changing conditions. This research will make direct comparisons of freshwater
invertebrate populations before and after a rapid change in the environment,
focusing on a suite of alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California
that have known histories of fish introductions. Estimates of the rate and
trajectory of adaptation will be obtained by hatching eggs from lake-bottom
sediments prior to the introduction of fish and comparing the historical and
contemporary populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the current level of
anthropogenic influences on the environment, understanding the limits to the
process of adaptation in natural populations is critically important. The
results of this research will provide important insights into the ecological and
genetic processes in natural populations and will be directly applicable to the
conservation and management of natural resources and biodiversity, particularly
when these are challenged by phenomena such as climate change and invasive
species. Sediment cores obtained in these studies will document historical
changes in abiotic and biotic lake structure and will be a valuable resource for
researchers across a wide range of disciplines. Research and education will be
integrated through the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The
results of this work will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed journals
and direct contact with federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
