Professor Kahn and his graduate student will study high performance, free-space
infrared (IR) wireless communications systems. The team will seek to improve the
performance of such systems by enabling the transmission of higher bit rates, by
increasing transmission ranges, by improving link reliability, and by increasing
network capacities. These improvements will be sought while simultaneously
investigating the fundamental limits of IR technology in wireless communication
applications.
