The goal of this project is to develop a detailed understanding of the
hydrology of hyporheic zones and to interface chemical and microbial processes
occurring within hyporheic zones to the hydrologic dynamics of these
environments. The specific objectives of this project are: 1. Develop and
validate a numerical model coupling hyporheic groundwater flow and open-channel
flow. 2. Install hydrologic monitoring networks in three catchments with
differing parent lithologies to obtain uninterrupted measurements of the
hydrology of the hyporheic zones and surface waters. These data will be used to
test and validate the numerical models. 3. Perform tracer experiments to further
validate the general applicability of the coupled flow/transport model. 4.
Examine the interactions between hyporheic zone hydrology and microbial
processes with regards to dissolved oxygen availability, the form and amount of
inorganic nutrients, and the cycling of carbon. 5. Evaluate the role of the
hyporheic zone on microbial photosynthesis and chemosynthesis at the
sediment/water interface. Drs. Dahm and Campana are outstanding stream
researchers. This project couples stream hydrology with the chemical and
biological processes that occur within the hyporheic zone. The facilities
available for this research are outstanding. //
