9522078 Tamir The proposed work is a fundamental investigation into the
electromagnetics phenomenology of planar thin-film configurations which serve as
building blocks in a wide variety of optoelectronic devices. Both analytical and
computational tools will be used, but modal methods combined with network and
leaky-wave concepts will be emphasized because of their proven effectiveness in
solving microwave problems that are similar to those in the area of planar
optics. Interface and junction discontinuities exhibited by thin- film
geometries will be explored in order to accurately assess effects that occur
when components form complex composite structures. This approach will clarify a
host of unresolved questions involving the operation of thin-film devices. In
addition, it will serve to develop the systematic and accurate design criteria
that are needed to implement existing and future optoelectronic components. The
proposed research program is thus expected to advance the analytical state-of-
the-art in planar optics to a level that is comparable to, or higher than, that
already available in the microwave area. ***
