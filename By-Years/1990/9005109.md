Support is provided to enable graduate students and researchers without travel
support to attend the bi-annual Gordon Research Conference on Tribology. The
topic of the conference is "Recent Advances in Microscopic and Macroscopic
Tribology". The conference attempts to bring together, in an informal
environment, the two major sub-cultures of the tribology community: researchers
who approach the subject from the traditional macroscopic point of view and
researchers who employ recently developed microscopic and atomic-level
techniques of observation and modeling.
