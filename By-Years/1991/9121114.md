ABSTRACT This project completes the analysis and preparation for publication of
work begun in 1989 on the Tibeto-Burman language Chantyal, which belongs to the
Gurung-Thakali-Tamang group within the Bodic division of Tibeto-Burman, has
never previously been described, and indeed its existence has only been recently
noted in the literature. While still the principal language of a few small
villages in the Myagdi district of Nepal, the language is threatened and may
cease to be the principal medium of communication in these villages in the near
future. The goal of the project is to prepare for publication a comprehensive
grammar, a dictionary/thesaurus, and a collection of texts. The grammar will be
produced in a relatively non- theoretical, descriptive framework so as to be of
maximum utility to Sino-Tibetanists, anthropologists, and general linguists of
various theoretical persuasions. The grammar and dictionary/thesaurus will
contain copious illustrations from both elicted and textual material. The texts
will be chosen to exemplify several discourse types and a variety of cultural
situations, will be accompanied by morpheme-by-morpheme glosses as well as
translations into idiomatic English, and will be keyed to the grammar.
