The major component of the proposal is the development of methods designed to
substantially increase the range of biomolecular systems to which advanced
computational docking and design methodologies can be applied. The most
successful methods and applications to date have been limited to proteins whose
crystal structures are known, and which remain relatively rigid during complex
formation. The main obstacle limiting the analysis of more general systems in
which side chains and backbones change conformation is the target function. The
proposal therefore focuses on methods for obtaining accurate, rapidly
evaluatable semi-empirical free energy functions, with particular emphasis on
solvation. These include methods for eliminating the time intensive surface area
calculations required by current semi-empirical free energy functions, as well
as several new approaches to solvation. Docking algorithms that can take full
advantage of free energy- target functions will also be developed and tested in
a variety of applications, exploiting the extensive crystallographic and
thermodynamic databases available. Attention will be given to the systematic
comparison of currently available and emerging semi-empirical free energy
evaluation procedures, including the delineation of their range of
applicability. J
