This project is a study of galactic-scale "superwinds" - mass outflows driven
by the collective effect of supernovae and winds from massive stars.
Observational evidence for this phenomena has only recently been uncovered, and
the importance of this effect for understanding the formation and evolution of
galaxies and the inter-galactic medium is very large. Dr. Heckman, one of the
leaders in the study of active galactic nuclei, will utilize both long-slit
optical spectroscopy and H-alpha imaging to directly test a number of ideas
related to these superwinds.
