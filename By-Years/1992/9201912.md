This work addresses questions of nonclassical behavior of light in laser and
micromasers. Four projects will be examined. Two concern the dynamics of two
level atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field, the third deals with
nonclassical states and higher order squeezing and the fourth, the theory of
twisted phase operators. The long time behavior of the Jaynes-Cummings model is
examined in order to define probability distributions for atomic quantities and
independent and coupled micromasers studied to explore differences from normal
laser systems.
