A recurrent problem society faces today is that organizations with sensitive
data wish to conduct useful global studies on their aggregate data, but they
cannot share this data with each other. For example, healthcare organizations
often cannot share patient data due to privacy laws or concerns, but would
greatly benefit from conducting a global study over everyone's data to identify,
for example, the most successful treatments for rare forms of cancer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The PI's goal is to enable collaborative computation on confidential
data. Her approach is to have systems "process encrypted data'" instead of
plaintext data. Her research enables organizations to carry out collaborative
computation without giving away their data: each organization encrypts the data,
shares encrypted data, the collaborative computation (either at the
organizations or in a cloud) processes and computes on encrypted data producing
an encrypted result that only the organizations can decrypt. The overarching
challenge is to support such computation efficiently and to express rich
functionalities, when existing cryptographic methods are too slow. Using the
open-source platform the PI is building, she is collaborating with top Canadian
banks to detect money laundering in a collaborative way, as well as healthcare
organizations to build better medical models. The PIâ€™s plan includes enhancing
several courses and developing a new course based on topics and results of this
research, as well as educational outreach activities targeted toward
undergraduate and underrepresented groups, and
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
