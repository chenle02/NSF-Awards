0414347 Kemp The objective of this planning grant project is to prepare a
conceptual design of an Engineering Analysis Network (EAN) for the Chesapeake
Bay. This project will examine current practices and perceived future
developments in Chesapeake research, data gathering, and data use in the context
of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure capabilities in order to plan the
conceptual design of an EAN. An EAN is comprised of people and facilities linked
through an infrastructure of collaboration tools, sensor networks, data
repositories, computational tools (principally process models), and tools for
data visualization and interpretation. The conceptual design will be the result
of a multidisciplinary and multi-university under the direction of four PIs and
two co-PIs from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the University of Delaware
(U. DE), the University of Maryland (U. MD), and the Chesapeake Research
Consortium (CRC) Chesapeake Community Model Program (CCMP) in collaboration with
selected technical experts from the user and developer communities.
