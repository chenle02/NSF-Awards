The University of Georgia and the University of Michigan are leading the
development of a Center to implement a potentially powerful professional
development model for pre-K-16 mathematics education. The Center will establish
a research agenda to examine the nature of the mathematical knowledge that is
important to teachers' proficiency in teaching mathematics, and will use the
knowledge gained to strengthen both the pre-service education and the in-service
professional development of teachers . The Center will combine practice,
research and professional development to build resources and capacity for the
preparation of teachers of mathematics. The other higher education partners are
the University of Michigan-Dearborn and Henry Ford Community College. School
district partners in Georgia are Gwinnett County Public Schools, Morgan County
Public Schools and Social Circle city Schools; and in Michigan, the large
Washtenaw Intermediate School District. Connections are also established with a
number of professional mathematics organizations, including the American
Mathematical Society and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, to
enable the Center to collaborate with and support collegiate teachers of
mathematics and teacher educators on a broad scale across diverse settings.
