The present project will study electron-molecule collision processes in gas
phase, on surfaces, in cluster environment and in the presence of strong laser
fields. A particular focus will be on biologically-relevant molecules, like
simple amino acids, for which basic electron attachment mechanisms will be
investigated. The effects of laser fields in electron-molecule interaction will
also be studied.

This research will create new knowledge in the areas connecting collision
physics with chemical control, radiobiology and atmospheric science. The
research will involve interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations with
scientists from other fields. It will train students in broader areas, including
several subdisciplines. Examples demonstrating the role of low-energy electrons
in different areas of chemistry, biology and environmental science will be
incorporated in teaching.
