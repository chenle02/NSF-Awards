This project will explore relations among the three corners of a triangle of
research areas: quantum mathematics and information, theoretical computer
science, and geometric topology. The project will explore new quantum algorithms
for computational problems related to number theory and cryptography; and it
will explore computational complexity results, i.e., evidence that efficient
quantum algorithms do not exist. It will also explore hard problems relating to
the field of 'topology' and its connections to quantum information. The broader
impacts of this research will include a better understanding of what quantum
computers can do when they are one day built; a better understanding of computer
algorithms for topological problems; and greater interdisciplinary connections
among mathematics, computer science, and quantum physics, including greater
access to ideas for students and the public at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a
more technical level, the project will investigate quantum algorithms and
hardness results for algebraic problems such as the hidden subgroup problem. It
will investigate techniques such as normal surface theory to show that
topological problems are in NP or other similar complexity classes; or that they
are NP hard. And the project will investigate structural questions about quantum
topological invariants such as building geometry and images of braid group
representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
