This NSF award provides support for early career U.S. based mathematicians to
attend a summer school at the IHES near Paris, France in July 2023. The summer
school is called Recent Advances in Algebraic K-theory (July 10-21, 2023). The
proposal includes professional training for graduate students and junior career
mathematicians from throughout the United States. Few workshops on these topics
have been held in the United States in the past few years. The summer school
will be a critical opportunity for students and postdocs to be exposed to new
techniques and ideas, to forge new collaborations, and to learn about new
questions at the state-of-the-art of the field.

The program will cover a diverse mixture of topics from K-theory and p-adic
cohomology theory, centered around the theme of the interaction of new motivic
filtrations related to syntomic cohomology and algebraic K-theory. This includes
traditional topics, such as excision and the question of descent in K-theory,
but also emerging topics such as Selmer K-theory and the K-theory of rigid
analytic spaces in the condensed framework. Further information about the school
can be found at https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/8837/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
