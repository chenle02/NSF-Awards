The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a suite of research
infrastructure rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the United States.
GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed
systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems,
by providing a suite of infrastructure for at-scale experiments in future
internets. Nationwide experiments began in summer 2010, and GENI now supports a
wide range of interesting research experiments across the nationwide meso-scale
GENI prototype, built from GENI-enabled commercial equipment, that spans 14 US
campuses and the two national research backbones (Internet2, National Lambda
Rail [NLR]). Research teams presented 9 major demonstrations of live, nationwide
experiments at the 9th GENI Engineering Conference in November 2010. About 20
research experiments are now starting to drive GENI?s evolving design.

This project will fund the third round of development and prototyping for GENI,
effectively completing the transition from building GENI to using GENI for at-
scale research. This effort includes 1) enhancing the meso-scale build-out to
include six major regional research networks across sixteen states, connecting
campuses to Internet2 an NLR; 2) increasing the campus WiMAX deployments via
multi-cell sites, android handsets and vehicular experiments; 3) creating,
deploying and operating ~54 GENI racks within campuses, regional networks and
national backbones; 4) deploying and operating two robust, complementary
instrumentation and measurement systems; and 5) expanding the GENI experimenter
community by creating educational materials, running workshops and summer
schools and starting ongoing operations and helpdesk support.
