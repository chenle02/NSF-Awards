Undergraduate students at the Chemical Engineering Department of Clarkson
University experiment with microcontamination control, particularly as it
applies to gas filtration. Students work with particle size distributions and
statistical data analysis, measuring and controlling particles smaller than one
micrometer. The techniques and nomenclature learned in this experiment aid
students in such broad fields as pollution control and industrial hygiene, and
also give them specific insight into the concerns of the microelectronics
industry. The major cause of low manufacturing yields in microelectronics
production is the device failures produced by microcontamination. As devices
with smaller critical dimensions are produced the problems posed by submicron
particle contamination will increase. The new equipment in this laboratory
experiment includes a laser light scattering particle counter, a condensation
nucleus counter, a laminar air flow clean hood, ultraclean stainless steel
tubing, valves, regulators, and filter housings, and a computer for data
logging.
