Modern organizations such as social networking service providers, life-science
research centers, or security agencies own an unprecedented amount of data. Such
organizations want to analyze their data via software applications that are
written against that data. Writing, testing, and debugging such data-intensive
software applications is notoriously complex. This research develops novel
techniques for dealing with this complexity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
objective of this research is to develop techniques that can automatically find
a representative subset of an existing large-scale data set that allows the
programmer to predict how the program will behave on the full data set. The
intuition is that the resources needed for finding a representative data subset
plus executing the program on that subset can be orders of magnitude lower than
running the application on the full data set. The second research objective is
to develop techniques that automatically check if a user program violates the
correctness conditions imposed by data processing systems that offer a
MapReduce-style programming interface.
