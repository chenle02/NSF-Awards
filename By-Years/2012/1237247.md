This Innovation Corps project will explore the potential of developing a
marketable innovation based on the use of 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase III (KASIII)
enzymes. KASIII catalyzes the first carbon-carbon forming reaction in fatty acid
biosynthesis, and thus determines the chemical nature of the omega of the fatty
acids produced.

The proposed innovation is based on engineering of of the biocatalyst, KASIII,
and would result in the production of bi-functional molecules that can act as
the monomer percusors for making bio-based plastics. This innovation will
provide novel bi-functional, bio-based feed stocks to the emerging bio-renewable
chemical industry for the production of novel "green" plastics and specialty
chemicals. The proposed I-Corps team envisions a technology that will be
initially targeted to the synthesis of hydroxy-fatty acids, but can be readily
advanced upon to produce other bi-functional monomers (e.g., amino-fatty acids,
which can be used to produce polyamides). If successful, this technology will
lead to chemical products that can act as substitutes for petroleum-based
chemical products, and be precursors for novel bio-based products.
