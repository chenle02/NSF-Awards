Research will be undertaken to study nonperturbatively the role of anharmonicity
for vibrations of random networks; to conduct numerical calculations of
inelastic scattering amplitudes from vibrating fractal structures; to study the
scaling properties of the sound velocity for mixed amorphous materials; and, to
investigate the nuclear spin relaxation in dilute hole-doped high temperature
superconductors. %%% Certain disordered materials exhibit structures which are
best described by fractals. The proposed research uses the model of fractons, or
excitations on a fractal structure, to interpret various physical properties of
these disordered materials. Additional work will be conducted on nuclear
relaxation in the high temperature superconductors.
