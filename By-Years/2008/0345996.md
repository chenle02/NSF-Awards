A variety of seismic data is available to image the structure associated with
&lt;br/&gt;the western U.S. Because each data type is sensitive to different
aspects of Earth structure, &lt;br/&gt;they tend to produce different images.
The investigators in this study are inverting all available &lt;br/&gt;seismic
data to create a single image that satisfies the combined data set. This best-
possible &lt;br/&gt;image is being used to understand (1) how previous geologic
events - especially the Rocky &lt;br/&gt;Mountain event - continue to influence
western U.S. tectonic activity, and (2) where there is a critical need for
additional seismic data. This second point is timely as the seismology community
embarks on a major effort to improve the quality of seismic imaging under the
U.S. with the USArray component of EarthScope. As USArray data become available,
these data will be included to provide an improved quality of seismic image.
Software being developed by these investigators to integrate different types of
seismic data is to be made available to the community, as are the images that
they create.&lt;br/&gt;
