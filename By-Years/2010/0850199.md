The Reinvigorating Engineering and Changing History (REACH) Scholars Program at
Purdue University will offer qualified Masters and direct admit Ph.D.
engineering students opportunities to explore multiple academic pathways and to
work closely with their peers and with faculty to create a community of scholars
who will be prepared broadly for careers across multiple domains. Overarching
goals of the program are to help students transition from undergraduate programs
to engineering programs at Purdue and to inform Scholars about transition
options after they obtain their Masters or Ph.D. degrees. REACH Scholars will be
recruited from eleven Schools within the College and will be selected based upon
their academic talent and their financial eligibility for Graduate Assistance in
Areas of National Need (GANN). Upon determining the financial need of admitted
students, REACH will award up to $10,000 scholarships annually to approximately
29 engineering graduate students entering their first semester at Purdue
University.
