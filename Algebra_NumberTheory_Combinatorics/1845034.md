This project will enhance the understanding of enumerative invariants, which are
important numbers that arise both in the mathematical study of various
geometries, as well as fundamental physical quantities in quantum physical
theories, through the study of the underlying symmetries of the geometry itself.
Enumerative geometry is connected with many other parts of mathematics and
physics, with concrete applications to fields from knot theory to combinatorics.
As such, the field is of interest to graduate students from a variety of
backgrounds, and to this end the PI will organize yearly summer schools on
topics connected with the project.

The spaces whose geometry to be studied fall into one of two major classes.
First, quiver varieties that are built from the combinatorial datum of a graph.
Symmetries of quiver varieties are connected to Kac-Moody Lie algebras, Yangians
and quantum groups. Second, moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces and threefolds,
especially in the important example of Hilbert schemes, parametrize global
objects, and their study involves different techniques. The intersection of the
two classes of spaces consists of local geometries such as the plane or toric
surfaces, wherein many physical quantities can be explicitly computed. In this
context, the enumerative invariants of interest are obtained by integrating
cohomology classes over the space, taking the Euler characteristic of line
bundles, or at a higher level even studying the derived categories of the spaces
themselves. This project will study all three approaches.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
