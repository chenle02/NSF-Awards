This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 52nd
Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) to be held at Auburn
University, in Auburn, AL, March 14-17, 2018. This latest installment of a
successful conference series hosted for the fifth time by Auburn began in 1967
at Arizona St and will feature invited talks from some of the world leading
experts in fields related to topology, including exciting new applications. The
conference brings together researchers from a wide array of topics to interact
and share ideas. The conference involves researchers at all career stages and
features extended workshops on exciting, developing areas of Topology in a way
that should bring in new researchers. Additionally, there will be Special
Sessions with speakers who are renowned experts together with graduate students
and young researchers. A special effort is made to involve women and researchers
from underrepresented groups. To further disseminate the findings discussed at
the conference, the long running, peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings
will publish a volume dedicated to the conference. The Spring Topology and
Dynamics Conference (STDC) is an annual conference that typically attracts
between 150 and 200 participants. The Special Sessions this year will be on
Algebraic Topology, Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory,
Geometric Topology and Set-Theoretic Topology, and one of the invited talks will
focus on the application of topology to data science. As such, the conference
provides a platform for researchers with a variety of interests to forge new
links and to find new applications of topology. The grant provides funds to
support travel for invited speakers, graduate students and researchers without
external support. More information about the conference can be found on the web
site http://www.auburn.edu/~kuperkm/STDC2018/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
