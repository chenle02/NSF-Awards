The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this RUI award to
Spelman College to fabricate photonic bandgap crystals of ZnGeP2 that exhibit
substantial birefringence, and thus will have well-established applications in
the form of conventional phase-matched NLO devices. With this award, Professor
McCall will be using following approaches to study the photonic bandgap
crystals: 1) optimize liquid phase epitaxy of ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2/GaP
heterostructures, guided by theoretical modeling and simulations of homogeneous
chemical kinetics, coupled to convective and diffusive transport of reactive
precursors to surface reactions that feed epitaxial growth; 2) fabricate
ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2/GaP photonic bandgap crystals by selective chemical soft solution
machining and digital vapor etching, including electrochemical and photochemical
approaches, and to develop the theoretical basis for the understanding of these
fabrication processes; and 3) study the structural, electrical and optical
properties of ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2 photonic bandgap crystals with optimum interfacial
refractive index offsets of the fabricated materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this award, photonic bandgap crystals will be fabricated, and their structural,
electrical and optical properties will be determined including theoretical
modeling and simulations. These crystals would be useful for the integration of
NLO waveguides and tunable sources of coherent infrared radiation into compact
and robust systems for the detection and classification of infrared
spectroscopic signatures of chemical and biochemical agents. The proposed
studies will provide undergraduate students with comprehensive hands on
experience in research, supplemented by computational solutions to problems of
physical chemistry and materials science with practical applications. In
addition, the project has the potential to attract more under-represented
minority students to careers in science.
