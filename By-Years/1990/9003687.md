This research is concerned with the application of various diffusing-wave-
spectroscopic probes to the study of the dynamics of dense colloidal
suspensions. Light scattering experiments will be carried out on well controlled
particles suspensions. The primary aim of the work is to explore basic
scientific issues connected with: 1) the dynamics and structure of strongly
interacting, dense colloidal suspensions, and 2) the transport of light dense
random media. The secondary goals concern advancing diffusing-wave-spectroscopic
measurement technology and attempts to apply the technique to more complex
systems. It is anticipated the research will improve our understanding of the
roles played by hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions in affecting
particle dynamics and structure.
