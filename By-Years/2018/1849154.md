Robot designers cannot always anticipate all real-world eventualities; hence
robots will need to use algorithms that can learn to adapt to unexpected changes
in their environment. However, if robots are to learn and adapt in the real
world, they must adapt in ways that continue to maintain safety while learning.
This project develops methods that ensure that robots continue to be safe even
as they learn and adapt to unexpected changes in their environment. By enabling
robots to be cognizant of their uncertainty, these methods can help robots
operate more safely. Further, the methods will enable robots to be adaptive to
unforeseen changes in their environment. These methods will be applied to
autonomous driving, to enable robots to operate safely on surfaces with
different levels of friction or on uneven terrain that might otherwise be unsafe
to operate on. Such methods will enable safer autonomous vehicles for city
driving in poor weather conditions, as well as for operating in off-road
settings for search and rescue operations, patrol vehicles to detect animal
poachers, and for other applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
develops a set of methods for uncertainty-aware safe robot learning. These
methods will enable a robot to estimate the uncertainty of the effect of its
actions; based on the estimated uncertainty, the robot will determine how to
improve its performance while operating safely and cautiously. Furthermore,
these methods will use the estimated uncertainty to determine how the robot
should adapt its parameters to efficiently respond to environmental changes. The
methods in this project will operate on complex policy classes such as those
represented by neural networks trained with deep reinforcement learning. Such an
approach will enable robots to achieve safe and adaptive long-term
autonomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
