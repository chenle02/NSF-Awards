Temporal logic is a useful, powerful formalism for the specification, analysis,
and development of a large class of systems, referred to as reactive systems.
This class of systems includes concurrent and real- time programs, process
control and embedded programs, hardware devices, and other systems whose role is
to maintain a continuous interaction with their environment. This project is to
conduct a research aimed at making the temporal formalism into a practical tool.
The primary goals are to establish a uniform temporal-logic methodology for the
specification, verification, development, and automatic synthesis of reactive
systems, and to construct an experimental system that will provide computerized
support for these activities. Specific topics to be investigated include: the
expressive power and convenience of specification by temporal logic, and its
possible improvements by extensions such as past operators and quantification
over state-variables; combination of temporal logic with transition systems,
such as automata; and compositionality of temporal specifications as a basis for
systematic development by decomposition and refinement.
