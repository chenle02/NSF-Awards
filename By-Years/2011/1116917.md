This project is aimed at developing effective decision-theoretic planning
algorithms for multi-agent systems that involve dozens or hundreds of agents.
Current approaches to agent coordination that provide rigorous performance
guarantees can only handle a few agents. The project addresses this barrier with
the following objectives: (1) develop new problem representations that allow
planning algorithms to leverage the interaction structure and independence
relationships within a domain; (2) develop approximation methods that operate
with limited memory and time, and exhibit anytime characteristics; (3) perform
rigorous convergence analysis and establish tight error bounds on solution
quality; (4) develop techniques that make it easy to exploit parallelization
offered by multi-core processors; and (5) create a new set of challenging test
problems and perform a rigorous evaluation. The project produces two
fundamentally new approaches to planning in multi-agent settings. The first
approach offers efficient message-passing planning algorithms based on
computational paradigms such as expectation-maximization (EM) and the concave-
convex procedure (CCCP). The second approach offers rollout sampling methods for
domains that are too large to be explicitly represented. These new methods
improve the scalability of existing techniques by several orders of magnitude.
The results transform the ability of researchers and practitioners to apply
rigorous decision-theoretic planning to multi-agent domains such as sensor
networks and mobile robot coordination. The broader impact stems from the wide
applicability of the resulting technology, undergraduate and graduate
educational activities at UMass, dissemination efforts that make the
experimental domain and algorithms publically available, and the development of
international collaborations.
