The objective of this research is to develop a conceptually simple model that
can potentially provide new vistas into the complex nature of the mechanical
behavior of particulate media. This will be achieved by "zooming" down to the
scale of the particle size and numerically examining the details of the particle
geometry, kinetics and interactions. Through this simple model, a significant
insight into some of the essential features of the particulate medium micro-
mechanical behavior, its influence on macro-mechanical behavior, the
applicability of homogenization procedures, and the validity of available
deterministic and/or phenomenological models could be obtained. This approach
seeks a common ground between the interests of engineers/mechanicians and
lattice models developed by physicists to achieve full benefits from the
available experiences and accomplishments.
