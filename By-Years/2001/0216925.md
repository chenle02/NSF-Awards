This grant supports development of a pulsed laser deposition system, a key
component in a new deposition facility that optimizes the various layers
required for field-effect doping in a highly controlled manner and with well-
characterized interfaces. The system is built upon existing laboratory
capabilities. The development should permit versatile and reliable field-effect
structures to be fabricated that can routinely withstand the enormous electric
field stresses inherently present in such structures. An aim is to allow very
good control over the interfaces at which the field-effect doping occurs must be
achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of the field effect to dope the surface
of a material is a well-established technique in the study and application of
semiconductors. Until recently it was believed that field-effect doping could
not be usefully applied to conducting (metallic) materials. Recent results using
both direct, voltage-biased capacitive field-effect structures and ferroelectric
field-effect structures have demonstrated that quite substantial charge
densities can be induced. In some cases the consequences of this field-effect
doping have been dramatic. For example, Schoen, Batlogg and coworkers have
achieved a superconducting transition temperature of 117K by means of field-
effect doping into CH3Br intercalated carbon C60. These results both provide an
existence proof that the field effect in conducting materials can be made to
work and demonstrate dramatically the possibilities. These results represent the
opening of a new era in the study of two-dimensional electronic systems, one of
the most fertile areas of condensed matter physics over the past few decades.
Concomitantly, they represent a particularly effective venue for the training of
graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
