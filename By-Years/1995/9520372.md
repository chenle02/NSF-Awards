The goal of this project is to develop and apply scalable numerical methods and
a software infrastructure for the first principles prediction of the properties
of materials. These materials typically have complex structures and
compositions, a large number of atoms (n&gt;100) and little or no symmetry. For
many important examples reliable theoretical predictions are not possible using
present day approaches. Here a new method is being tested; preliminary results
show that it promises to remove a major roadblock to the wider application of
first principle calculations to real materials, thereby greatly expanding the
problems that can be treated. As part of the project this new method will be
applied to an important problem, the oxidation of carbon based materials. The
project builds on a novel computational approach to solving the LAD equations
based on a parallel, real-space, adaptive multigrid eigenvalue solver. Unlike
Fourier methods, this adaptive method locally refines the solution to capture
the short length scales in the problem; for example, the short length in near
oxygen region in the carbon oxygen system. The investigators' preliminary
calculations are currently limited to model problems with structures similar to
the real materials Schrodinger eigenvalue equation. However, the new
computational method shows promising improvements in convergence and efficiency
over present algorithms. The purpose of this program is to enhance the proposed
solver to enable application of an adaptive method to real materials.
