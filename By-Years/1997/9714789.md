Researchers use the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory to couple lower portion of the
atmosphere with the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Based on lidar
observations of mid-stratosphere to lower thermosphere temperatures, this
emphasizes the transition region between the upper mesosphere and lower
thermosphere. Using a much larger telescope, they're able to precisely determine
Rayleigh-scatter temperatures and time resolution in the upper mesosphere, and
extend maximum altitude above 100 kilometers. Nightly averaged lidar
temperatures are used to study seasonal variations in the transition region,
especially (1) the mesopause altitude and structure near 87 and 102 kilometers,
(2) the relationship between high-altitude summer inversion layers (by Rayleigh
lidar) and an inversion layer near 90 kilometers (by sodium lidar), (3) the
behavior of vertical wave-like appearance of mesospheric inversion layers to
higher altitudes. These nightly temporal variations (or their monthly averages)
examine time-varying phenomena, such as tides and downward/upward phase
progression of mesospheric inversion layers.
