ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9618807 Principal Investigator: R. Madix Institution:
Stanford University A better understanding of the reactivity of supported metal
oxide catalysts is sought. The model catalyst selected is vanadium oxide
deposited on titanium oxide single crystals. The deposition is to be done from
the vapor or alternatively from aqueous solutions. Growth morphology and
structure will be studied by STM and LEED; electronic structure by UPS, XPS and
EELS; reactivity by TPD and oxidation reactions of probe molecules.
