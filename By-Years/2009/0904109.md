The research objective of this project is to evaluate the capability of a novel
remote sensing method in acquiring time-dependent spatial data (4D surface) of
construction sites for "as-built" modeling. Under this method, video streams are
initially collected from a calibrated set of high resolution video cameras that
is progressively traversed around a construction site. The possible
correspondences of each point in each video camera's view are computed (epipolar
lines) and the corresponding points are matched using a novel window similarity
matching method that compares the video frame along each epipolar line. Based on
each match and the camera calibration, the depth value of each point is
computed, and the depth map (dense point cloud) of the scene is generated. In
each subsequent frame, all points with a previously identified correspondence in
the other video camera's frame are tracked using established 2D point tracking
techniques. This prevents redundant and computationally intensive epipolar line
computation and correspondence matching. The resulting point cloud at each frame
is then converted to a 3D surface using intelligent proximity algorithms, and
the visual data are overlaid to produce a photorealistic, rendered 3D surface.
This method is significantly automated, allowing the user to reconstruct a scene
or structure progressively and in real time, without the need for post-
processing. It can also identify and track complex point clouds with a variable
precision (according to the user needs). The data resolution is virtually
limitless, since both macro and micro data sensing is possible by adjusting the
distance of the sensor system to its targets and using the proper lenses. The
equipment cost is two orders of magnitude less than the cost of a LiDAR scanner,
and also compact, lightweight and highly portable. Thus, the immediate advantage
that will result from this work is the ability to automate the 3D surface
generation step of the "as-built" model generation process and significantly
reduce the cost for the necessary remote sensing equipment. Currently, engineers
need to spend several days to post process the raw data and convert them to a
basic 3D surface. Under this approach, engineers need only scan the desired site
until the automatically generated 3D surface is consistent with their needs.

If successful, the improvement is expected to open up new avenues for future
research and enhancements that can ultimately achieve real-time model
generation. It is therefore expected to significantly reduce the time and effort
needed to create an "as-built" model. This will increase the infiltration of
innovative spatial modeling technologies to the AEC industry and allow its
benefits to be realized by the majority of construction projects, especially by
small projects.
