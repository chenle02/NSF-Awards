The sampling design and sample size of most large scale national surveys are
usually determined so as to produce a national estimate of a parameter of
interest with a desired level of precision. Quite often there is a need to
produce similar estimates with the same level of precision for certain
subnational regions (such as states or counties). However, the small samples
associated with subnational regions do not produce reliable estimates. Problems
of this kind are known as small area estimation problems. Reliable small area
statistics are needed by various federal and local government agencies for
policy making and the allocation of funds. The empirical Bayes (EB) and
hierarchical Bayes (HB) methods have been widely used to produce small area
statistics. These methods use explicit hierarchical models to borrow strength
from related resources. This research extends the empirical Bayes (EB) and
hierarchical Bayes (HB) methods to address the following issues in small area
estimation: (1) Measurement errors in survey responses; (2) Small area
statistics from a dual-frame sampling design; and (3) Estimation of small sample
means under exponential power distributions.
