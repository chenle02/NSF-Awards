A new computational code for engineering problems with large deformation will be
developed. The code will use finite element method as a global calculation tool
and the discrete element method for locally yielded elements. The intent is to
erase difficulties in defining materials's non-linear constitutive equations as
well as intercface elements betwen two distinctly different materials by
involving fewer assumptions and simpler procedures, thus resulting in an
economical computational process.
