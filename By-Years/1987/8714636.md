The American Society of Plant Taxonomists publishes Systematic Botany
Monographs to provide an outlet for longer systematic works. Timely publication
of such monographs is often impossible through other means, due to the high cost
of publishing short-run books and the scarcity of appropriate monographic series
accessible to botanists. Fifteen volumes of the Monographs have already been
issued, and two more are in press. Previous NSF subsidies have aided in the
publication of volumes 5-8, 10 and 11. This project will provided funds to
offset the anticipated difference between the cost of publishing three
additional volumes and the income from sales of these volumes.
