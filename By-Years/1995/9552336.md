Within the decade, career opportunities in the environmental sciences will
outpace those in many other disciplines. To strengthen the curriculum in this
area, eight univesity biology, geology, geography, and chemistry faculty are
involved in a project to prepare students to address contemporary environmental
issues. One such issue is the contamination of soil, water, and marine sediments
with heavy metals, especially lead which is toxic to children at low blood lead
levels. The state-of-the- art method of analysis employed by environmental
laboratories for low levels of heavy metals, particularly lead, is atomic
absorption spectrometry utilizing a graphite furnace. A new automated atomic
absorption spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace allows collection of
heavy metal data in air particulates, river sediment, marine sediments, soils,
plants, mussels, and shrimp in courses spanning four disciplines and ranging in
difficulty from general education courses to advanced senior level courses for
majors. The data are stored on an environmental science database shared by
natural science classes that can be the basis for integrated studies in the form
of special projects, statistical analyses, and independent study assignments.
The new equipment can thus be used to expose non- science-majors to contemporary
environmental issues, to prepare undergraduates for the technical demands
required of advanced environmental professionals, and to strengthen critical
thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective.
