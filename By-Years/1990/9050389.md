This project updates and improves the Electrical Engineering Technology
Electrical Machines and Power Systems Engineering Lab- oratory. This was
accomplished through the acquisition of a power systems simulator, computer
control system, motor driven three-phase alternators, and industrial interface.
This equipment provides students with "hands-on" experience in testing,
operating, and analyzing computer controlled power systems, including
residential, industrial, and commercial systems. This grant is being matched by
a greater amount, 171%, by the Principal Investigator's institution.
