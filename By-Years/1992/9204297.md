This award is concerned with the study of certain invariants, known as local
Chern characters, defined for modules over local rings. These invariants have
been defined for bounded complexes of free modules. The principal investigator
will study the contributions of individual matrices defined by these complexes.
He will also consider questions concerning multiplicities and other ideal-
theoretic properties. The results of these studies will be applied to
homological conjectures and to related problems. This is research in the field
of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and
robotics.
