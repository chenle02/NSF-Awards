This award supports a one-year collaborative research project between Dr. Diana
Beattie, Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, and Dr. Job
Kiaira, Department of Biochemistry, University of Nairobi, in Kenya. The
investigators will collaborate on research to clarify the mechanism by which
mitochondrial biogenesis in the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is regulated. The
investigators will establish the time course of the appearance of different
segments of the electron transfer chain during the differentiation from long,
slender mammalian bloodstream forms into procyclic insect forms and examine the
products of mitochondrial protein synthesis during differentiation. The proposed
collaboration combines the expertise in mitochondrial biogenesis in the United
States with the Kenyan expertise in the development of trypanosomes. T. brucei
is the causative agent of trypanosomiasis in cattle. This study will contribute
important new insights into the understanding of the electron transport chain
and its regulation during differentiation.
