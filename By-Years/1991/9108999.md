This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California acquire a 500
MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the
following areas of chemistry: 1) High Field NMR Studies of Carbocations and
Related Reactive Intermediates, 2) Reactions of Hydrocarbons in the Coordination
Sphere of Soluble Metal Complexes, 3) New Materials for the Study of Novel
Optical, Electrical, and Magnetic Properties, 4) Synthetic Organic, Bioorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry, 5) Synthetic Applications of Anionic Vinyl
Polymerization, 6) Studies in the Synthesis of Silicon-Containing Polymers.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
