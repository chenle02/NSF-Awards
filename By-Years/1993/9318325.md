9318325 Donoghue The rate of publication of phylogenetic studies has increased
dramatically in recent years. Access to phylogenetic trees, and to the data
underlying those trees, is needed for a wide variety of purposes, including
comparative studies of morphological and molecular evolution, biogeography,
coevolution, and studies of the congruence of different sources of evidence.
Such data are also needed to monitor progress in phylogenetic research, to test
new methods of taxometric analysis, and to address immediate practical problems
in conservation of biodiversity. The aim of the project is to establish a
prototype database of phylogenetic studies designed to make published
information readily accessible, and thereby to explore the feasibility of
developing an internationally comprehensive database. Development of a prototype
will involve examination of alternative strategies for obtaining phylogenetic
studies from the literature and from authors via electronic submission of data.
Consultation with colleagues will help delimit a core of essential information
to be included in the prototype database, including data matrices on characters,
basic information on taxa, bibliographic citations, and phylogenetic trees. %%%
Software will be developed for electronic transfer of taxonomic data sets, for
data entry, for retrieval and manipulation of data sets and for importing and
exporting data sets to phylogenetic and analy tical programs. The database will
be designed to allow flexibility to incorporate additional information and to
export data to future implementations on other platforms or software
environments. The prototype will stimulate community discussion on the
development of a comprehensive phylogenetic database for all groups of
organisms.
