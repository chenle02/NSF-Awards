Logical errors in sequential circuit designs and communication protocols have
always been an important problem. They can delay getting a new product on the
market or cause the failure of some critical device that is already in use. The
most widely used method for verifying such systems is based on extensive
simulation and can easily miss significant errors when the number of possible
states is very large. This research deals with developing an alternative
approach based on a technique called temporal logic model checking. In this
approach specifications are expressed in a propositional temporal logic, and
sequential circuits and communication protocols are modeled as state transition
systems. An efficient search procedure is used to determine automatically if the
specifications are satisfied by the transition system. The technique has been
used in the past to find subtle errors in a number of non-trivial designs.
