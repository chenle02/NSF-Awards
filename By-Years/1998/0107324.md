The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr. Paige C. Geiger to work
with Dr. Giovanni Cecchi at the University of Florence in Firenze, Italy on the
role of titin-actin interactions in the development of static stiffness in
skeletal muscle fibers.

Muscle fiber stiffness has been attributed to cross bridge formation. However, a
component of muscle stiffness, static stiffness, precedes tension development
and is independent of myosin and actin interaction. The physiological
significance of this non-cross bridge based stiffness is unknown. The goal of
this project is to characterize static stiffness in skinned frog muscle fibers
and identify structural elements of the sarcomere that contribute to static
stiffness. This research experience will afford Dr. Geiger with the opportunity
to learn all aspects of single fiber mechanical measurements using a variety of
physiological techniques.

The current research focus of Dr. Cecchi's lab concerns ultrastructural changes
accompanying force generation, analysis of cross bridge state during isometric
force development and isotonic shortening.
