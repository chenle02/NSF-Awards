The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign supports a broad range of interactive and interdisciplinary
research organized around the general theme of structured materials in six
primary thrust areas. The optical semiconductors and heterostructures thrust
focuses on semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices. Investigations
include advanced methods of multilayer fabrication, microstructural
characterization, diffusion and disordering, and electronic and vibrational
properties. The thrust on advanced catalytic materials aims to extend the range
of catalytic materials that can be made, control their microstructure, develop
techniques to characterize the microstructure, and understand the relationship
between structure and function. Activities in the mechanisms of high temperature
superconductivity thrust center around two main questions: (i) what are the
underlying mechanisms responsible for high temperature superconductivity, and
(ii) how can materials be prepared to study these mechanisms and to enhance
desirable properties of the new materials? The thrust group in advanced
computational materials research is developing new algorithmic approaches to
problems in materials science, designed to exploit the most advanced
computational systems available and to look forward to developing architectures
for computers that will change desirable algorithmic characteristics. A new
thrust in self-ordering macromolecular materials brings together researchers
from materials science, physics, chemical engineering and biochemistry to
explore features of self-organization (spontaneous development of structure) in
organic macromolecular materials. Finally, properties of mesoscopic systems is a
new MRL effort directed toward fabricating submicron thin film structures and
studying electronic transport phenomena in them. The MRL also supports the
development, operation and maintenance of major central materials research
facilities, and provides seed funds for new faculty and high-risk research
related to its overall program. The program currently involves 47 faculty
members from chemical sciences, engineering, materials science and physics, 14
postdoctoral research associates, 61 graduate students, 10 other scientific and
technical professionals and 6 students participating in "Research Experience for
Undergraduates". The Illinois MRL is under the direction of Professor Myron B.
