The research themes in this proposal are centered in geometric group theory and
geometric topology, but have connections to several other fields, including
number theory, combinatorics, convex geometry, dynamics, and probability.
Geometric group theory is most often focused on quasi-isometry invariants:
measurements that are insensitive to bounded (additive and multiplicative)
distortion of distances. This allows us to pass between the study of groups and
the spaces they act on geometrically, and between different Cayley graphs for
finitely generated groups. A unifying theme for the research projects described
here is the pursuit of "finer" approaches to asymptotic geometry through the use
of more sensitive measurements. In particular, the PI proposes to study large-
scale geometric statistics that are not invariant under quasi-isometry. This
point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in
groups, and of properties of "typical" geodesics in spaces.

The ideas in play here have already led the PI and her collaborators to new
density results in free abelian groups and the Heisenberg group; new invariants
used to further the classification program for right-angled Artin groups; and
progress in the study of Teichmueller geometry. Statistical geometry is broadly
applicable in a range of settings outside pure mathematics, from computer
science to medicine---wherever geometric models are made and long-term
probabilistic prediction is required. In addition to the research program, this
proposal describes a collection of educational projects: principally, the
development of an organizational infrastructure for Research Labs engaging
faculty and students from a wide variety of institutions. Each lab will work on
a cluster of problems around a coherent mathematical nucleus, with opportunities
for mutli-level teaching, learning, exploration, and collaboration. There will
be conferences and journal issues coordinated with these Labs, guided by the
principles of combining expository soundness with research value and emphasizing
collaboration.
