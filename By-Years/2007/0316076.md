Professor James Kindt, of Emory University, is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform research on self-assembled polymers,
domains and disks. Research in James Kindt's group will use off-lattice coarse-
grained simulations to study major classes of systems that exhibit reversible
self-assembly. Phenomena to be studied include nematic liquid-crystalline
ordering in equilibrium polymers; reversible cross-linking of self-assembled
fibers into gels or networks, with an emphasis on the structural protein actin;
influence of electrostatic dipolar interactions on the shape, size, and position
distributions of fluid surfactant monolayer domains at the air-water interface;
and liquid-crystalline ordering of self-assembled mixed-lipid bilayer disks or
"bicelles". The simulations will employ a novel Monte Carlo approach for
modeling polydisperse self-assembled systems to efficiently equilibrate both the
number of aggregates and their size and shape distributions. Domain and disk
simulations will also rely on a recently developed method for Monte Carlo
sampling of equilibrium size and shape distributions of self-assembling two-
dimension rings or disks. Simulation models will be designed to permit rigorous
tests of statistical theories of self-assembly as well as to shed light on open
experimental questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in methodology
for modeling self-assembled systems and in the fundamental understanding of
self-assembly transcend chemistry and also impact materials science and biology.
In materials science, reversibly self-assembled aggregates are used as templates
in the production of advanced mesoporous materials for catalysis and photonics,
and have been polymerized in novel elastomers. Fabrication pathways can be
significantly optimized from the improved theory and modeling initiative here.
In the biological sciences, the work performed here will aid in analyzing the
structure of proteins and in understanding the function of the cell framework.
