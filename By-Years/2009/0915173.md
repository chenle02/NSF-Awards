Pacific salmon are renowned for the great diversity of life histories and
morphologies among populations. This diversity is the product of the combination
of natal homing, which leads to reproductively isolated populations, and
spatially varying selection pressures. Divergent natural selection acting on
heritable phenotypic traits then drives adaptation to local conditions and,
ultimately, population differentiation. Diversity among salmon stocks is
important for the long-term sustainability of salmon fisheries because the
relative contribution to total production of a fishery shifts depending on the
prevailing environmental conditions. The overall goal of the PI?s research
program is to illuminate the causes and consequences of diversity among salmon
stocks. This research three components. First is in depth exploration of the
ecological and evolutionary causes of diversity among current populations of
coho salmon. The second component is a study of the consequences of population
homogenization (i.e., diversity loss) by focusing on California's recently
collapsed Chinook salmon. Finally, a theoretical component will focus on
advancing methods for analyzing selection. The research starter award will help
to launch this research program.

The results of this research will have direct implications for the management
and conservation of Pacific salmon. In the United States, 28 Evolutionary
Significant Units of Pacific salmonids are currently listed as threatened or
endangered. Ten of these units are found, either wholly or in part, in
California. Explicit consideration of the evolutionary challenges facing these
organisms should result in more effective management and conservation efforts.
The PI is making a strong effort to engage members of underrepresented groups in
her research program.
