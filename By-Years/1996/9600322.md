This proposal will provide necessary R&D for a group of Universities
participating in the CMS collaboration at the LHC. The University of California
at San Diego group, will address design a trigger and data acquisition (DAQ)
electronics; Johns Hopkins will be concerned with the silicon pixel and strip
tracking devices and with computation and software design; the University of
Illinois at Chicago will be concerned with the signal transmitting fibers of the
scintillator-tile hadron calorimetry; Nebraska will participate in development
of the luminosity monitor; Northeastern will be concerned with developing
improved avalanche photo-detector (APD) devices to convert optical to electric
pulses from the calorimeters, microstrip gas chamber trackers, and computing and
software; Notre Dame will design devices to couple transmission optical fibers
from the hadron calorimeters to their readout; Virginia Tech will participate in
testing photodetectors. All groups will, as appropriate, will produce prototypes
and engage in beam tests.
