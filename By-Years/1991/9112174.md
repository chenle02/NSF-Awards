The primary objective of this proposal is to study the archaeology and
paleoecology of the Broken Mammoth and Mead sites in central Alaska. Preliminary
archaeological testing of these sites provided an abundance of artifacts, faunal
and other organic materials from the late Pleistocene-Holocene, 11,500-10,500
B.P. This may be the first conclusive evidence that humans and mammoths
coexisted in Alaska and could provide the most detailed picture of human
subsistence thus far discovered in northern North America. In addition, this
study will provide information about human adaptation and climate change in
Beringia, the main migration route of humans to the New World.
