The purpose of the above course is to introduce students to state-of-the-art
procedures and instrumentation relating to the use and synthesis of
oligonucleotides as probes, primers and instruments of mutagenesis. The
instrumentation, which includes a DNA synthesizers, high pressure liquid
chromatographic systems and DNA tempcyclers, is used in the synthesis of
oligonucleotides, the isolation of oligonucleotides, plasmids and PCR-generated
DNA fragments using HPLC, and to introduce mutations using oligonucleotides.
