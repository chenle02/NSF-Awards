This award funds work in economic theory that incorporates ideas from psychology
into a formal model of how individuals make decisions. In this model, a
decisionmaker must make a choice from a group of alternatives. She first selects
alternatives she can explain or justify. From this smaller group, he or she then
chooses the alternative that best satisfies her individual tastes, preferences,
or goals. This theory predicts that rationalizability will play an important
role in economic decisionmaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs show how this
theory of of individual decision making can be tested through observing real-
world choices. They also examine outcomes in strategic environments when this
rationlizability concept is added to standard Nash equilibrium arguments.
Finally, they intend to conduct a number of laboratory experiments to test their
ideas, including experiments on how rationalizability affects rational voting
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has interdisciplinary implications
for economics, decision science, psychology, and political science.
