The PI will observe the dynamical effects of pickup protons on solar wind
structure and shocks in the outer heliosphere; in particular, the global
solution of the pickup proton solar wind inside the termination shock. He will
primarily use a system of MHD solar wind equations for the mixture of three
species - electrons, solar wind protons, and pickup protons - and a system of
pickup proton equations. He can simultaneously solve the two equation systems
numerically with an analytical solution for the distribution function of
interstellar neutral hydrogen in the heliosphere. Finally, he will determine the
effects of pickup protons on the solar wind shocks jump condition, the
interaction of interplanetary shock with solar wind structures, shock-shock
interactions, and the termination shock location and heliopause.
