Research infrastructure projects aim to develop advanced research facilities and
provide broad access to research infrastructures to the community to conduct
cutting-edge research. Over the years, multiple research infrastructure projects
in NSF's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), which can be
considered in the mid-scale range, have been awarded; they are in different
stages of their life cycles. Some earlier funded projects (CloudLab, Chameleon,
Colosseum) are relatively mature with a stable user base, eager to explore how
to do cross-platform experimentation with newer projects. Other available
platforms (such as FABRIC, SAGE, COSMOS, POWDER, AERPAW) have relatively newer
components in the infrastructure and strive to expand their research user base.

The Midscale Experimental Research Infrastructure Forum (MERIF) plans to hold a
MERIF Workshop on May 22-24, 2023 in Boston, MA, to bring together above-
mentioned research infrastructure providers and research users to share
experience and improve infrastructure to support science and engineering
research. The workshop is intended to help recruit additional researchers who
can make highest and best use of the current midscale research infrastructure
facilities through raising community awareness, reducing barriers to use,
sharing best practices, and facilitating cross-facility research. The workshop
will also include training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds
to learn how to use various platforms to conduct research. Further information
about the workshop is available at http://merif.org

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
