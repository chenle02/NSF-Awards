This is a Division of Mathematical Sciences Focused Research Group (FRG) award
made under solicitation http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02129/nsf02129.htm

Holomorphic curves recently have emerged as a powerful tool in low-dimensional
topology. The goal of this project is to unite and coordinate research in the
area of applications of holomorphic curves in order to: - construct new
invariants of manifolds of dimension 3 and 4; - develop new methods for proving
diffeomorphism between the manifolds; - find new relations between string theory
and symplectic geometry on the one side, and knot theory and topology of
3-manifolds on the other. The core of this project, Embedded Symplectic Field
Theory, is expected to provide a unified approach to many seemingly different
problems in low-dimensional topology

The impact of this project is expected to be much broader than its immediate
goal of developing low-dimensional topology. There is a hope that the newly
developed methods open new horizons in our understanding of links between
Topology and Theoretical Physics, and in particular String Theory. The project
should also have a significant educational value. In particular, under this
project there will be developed a Dissertation Subject Database, an actively
managed and supported list of problems which will serve as a source of topics of
PhD dissertation for graduate students of the senior project personnel.
