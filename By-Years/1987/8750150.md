This project will assist the institution in introducing biotechnology into the
chemical engineering curriculum. A bench-scale fermentor and ancillary equipment
will be coupled to a microcomputer-controlled data acquisition system. This will
result in a system that permits students to learn about the special conditions
and problems associated with fermentation, an industrially important
biotechnology process. The computer controlled data acquisition system will
provide flexibility in experimentation, enhance data reduction and analysis, and
expose the students to modern instrumentation.
