of Protein Binding via Aptamer Functionalized Field-Effect Detectors

Recently, highly scalable electronic detection systems for DNA have been
developed based on the molecule's intrinsic charge. Micrometer-scale field
effect sensors, constructed using standard silicon microtechnology, were used to
detect nanomolar DNA concentrations within minutes and to distinguish between
oligonucleotides differing by a single base. Potential of tailor-made DNA and
RNA aptamers for specifically capturing target proteins on the surface of a
silicon field-effect sensor is being investigated under this project. In
collaboration with University of Texas at Austin, aptamers are designed to
translate the aptamer-target complex into a modulation of surface charge at the
sensor surface. In addition, in collaboration with Molecular Sciences Institute,
recognition molecules are being coupled to the sensor surface to electronically
detect simulated biological agents.
