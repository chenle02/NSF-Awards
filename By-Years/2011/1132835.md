1132835&lt;br/&gt;Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface tension plays a role in
many industrial problems and natural phenomena; many of these involve
significant elastic effects of the basic materials such as the surrounding
substrates and/or porous matrices, e.g. textiles, hair, and filters are just
some of the soft materials that readily change shape (and possibly function)
when wet or dried. Although static problems involving the interplay between
surface tension (capillarity), elasticity, and possibly other forces are well
studied, there are very few studies of the dynamics of elastocapillarity, which
is the subject of this proposal. Because of the breadth of applications that
involve elastocapillary dynamics, spanning material science, and the biological
and environmental sciences, we believe that this research area will yield new
insights and applications. The research in this proposal is focused on
characterizing, both experimentally and theoretically, two common geometries -
sheets and fibers - and two common dynamical situations - spontaneous wetting
and drying. In addition, we will study the dynamics of wetting and drying of a
model soft porous material consisting of a fibrous matrix. In this way, we will
provide a systematic, yet broad characterization of the dynamics of
elastocapillary flow problems. The research described in this proposal may yield
new insights such as whether there is an optimum drop size for wetting a fibrous
medium and how the drying rate of a fibrous medium is influenced by the softness
(elasticity) of the fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: In addition to
publishing our findings in journals that span engineering, physics, and
materials science, the PI will continue his multi-faceted outreach activities,
including hosting visitors from different disciplines and educational
institutions, engaging undergraduate students in research and giving talks at
conferences, leading professional development activities for undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral colleagues, and participating in mentoring programs
for young researchers from under-represented groups. Also, the PI has
successfully incorporated research themes into "holiday" lectures for children
and parents that he has given over the past 9 years and which he will continue
to develop and present. Overall, the research will have a direct impact on our
understanding of wetting and drying of common soft fibrous materials, which
arises in a wide variety of industrial and natural systems.
