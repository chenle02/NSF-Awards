Northeast Louisiana University will initiate a three-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in computer science for 30 students entering the 8th and 9th
grades. During this summer program participants will be introduced to the
fundamental concepts of computer science; have hands- on experience with topics
such as graphics, robotics, expert systems, telecommunications, and databases;
discuss careers in science and mathematics with invited evening speakers; go on
field trips to local industries; work on group research projects; follow-up with
guided activities throughout the school year; and return for two days the
following summer to complete these activities.
