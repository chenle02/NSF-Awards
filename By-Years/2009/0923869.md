This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Research (STTR) Phase II project seeks to develop and commercialize an optimized
technique to produce durable nano-porous surfaces (NPS) for heat transfer
applications using an inexpensive electrochemical process. This technology will
be very beneficial for the development of high-efficiency boilers, heat
exchangers and electronic cooling devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project will be the enhancement to boilers,
heat exchangers, and electronic cooling devices that serve various industries,
such as, power/utility, oil and gas, chemical, food and beverage, and building
and construction. Additional benefit from the this project will be its potential
application in efficient heat transfer to increase energy output, reduce energy
consumption and greenhouse gases, consume less fossil fuels and reduce harmful
pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
