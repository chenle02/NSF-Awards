The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has awarded a grant to Professor
Herbert Strauss of the University of California at Berkeley to continue his
studies probing complex, disordered systems using infrared (IR) hole-burning
techniques. Using an IR laser, Strauss will irradiate a probe molecule (ammonium
ion, in this case), which makes up part of the complex system, forcing it to
rotate into a new position, and thereby creating a dip in the IR absorption.
These holes are refilled by tunneling of the probe molecule at low temperature,
and the relaxation dynamics is monitored by IR absorption. In related
experiment, Raman and neutron spectra of hydrogen (probe molecules) in water,
ice and zeolites will be undertaken to yield comparable information. Hydrogen
embedded in ice or zeolite is of importance in many fields of science and
technology such as astronomy, energy storage, and catalysis. Hydrogen is of
special importance because its properties are amenable to calculation.
Consequently, calculations of the hydrogen time-dependent properties, which lead
to the spectra, are likely to be incisive.
