This project is a computational and theoretical study using a model that
describes the coupling of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The coupling process
is the kinetic Alfven wave which originates in the magnetosphere. The
mathematical approach is to use the three-dimensional Strauss equations with
additional term corresponding to electron inertia. The effect of finite electron
temperature will be included in the model. The computational approach is to use
the 3-D fluid simulation code. The goal of this research is to understand the
processes that are responsible for the evolution of discrete auroral arcs on
about the one kilometer scale. A mechanism for the auroral electron acceleration
due to kinetic Alfven waves, will be studied.//
