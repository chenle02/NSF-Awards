Third generation personal communication systems are likely to involve many
bursty, mobile, multi-media users whose quality of service needs may vary
dynamically over time. In order for a wireless system to respond adequately to
these demands it will be necessary to determine fundamental mechanisms for
allocating QoS needs in the radio environment. Unlike fiber optic links, radio
links are likely to be expensive and of poorer quality. Thus, a large part of
the quality of service arbitration will have to be supported via coding and
other link enhancements techniques. In this proposal, we first present findings
that reveal the importance of higher order error statistics in assessing the
impact of particular forms of error control on higher layer services. Then we
note that when communications are conducted over a layered stack, a particular
error control module exerts influence on the overall end to end performance not
only via its own error correcting capabilities but also via the type of error
events that it passes up to the higher layers. Therefore, we propose to
investigate error management mechanisms that not only correct errors but also
shape and possibly exploit the statistics of the residual errors that escape to
the higher layers. Finally, given a set of end user performance requirements,
one can conceive of multiple ways of distributing the error control functions.
So, we propose to investigate how to distribute the error control functions. We
expect that the proposed work will help in the design of a new generation of
network radios.
