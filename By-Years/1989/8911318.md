This grant funds the purchase of an rf/microwave source and a spectrum analyzer,
for use in two ongoing research projects. The first project involves research in
plasma processing, in support of Sematech research on semiconductor fabrication.
The second involves squeezed- state enhanced FM spectroscopy, applied to gas
sensing problems which arise in processing electronic materials.
