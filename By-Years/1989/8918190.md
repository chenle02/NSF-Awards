This research provides a continuation of the current program involving
theoretical and observational studies of plasma waves in the vicinty of the
Earth's bow shock. Four major topics will be addressed. These include (1)
theretical studies of Alfven waves; (2) analysis of observations in the
foreshock; (3) continuation of studies relating to electron beam instabilities
using linear analytical techniques; and (4) electron beam instability
simulations using numerical computer techniques. The research will address both
Alfven and Langmuir waves, both of which are known to exist in this part of
space. Studies of the of the wave and particle interaction of the solar wind
with the Earth environment are essential to futher our understanding of the
various coupoling processes tying the Earth's atmospheric structure to solar
variability. *** //
