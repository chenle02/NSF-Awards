The principal investigators will conduct research of a cross disciplinary
nature, spanning both statistics and biophysics fields. They will investigate
the spectra and their changes in response to variation in the conditions of a
specimen in order to ascertain important information about the components of a
specimen. For example, fluorescence from aromatic amino acids is a useful probe
of the structure of proteins. Frequently, 'in vivo' studies and other important
experiments concern a single specimen that contains multiple components with
overlapping spectra, components that cannot be separated without seriously
altering properties of the native specimen. The investigators will work toward
three goals: the development of optimal statistical methods of resolving
component spectra, development of efficient and reliable algorithms and computer
codes that implement the methods developed, and application of these methods in
the laboratory.
