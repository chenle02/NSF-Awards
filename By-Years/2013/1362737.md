With this New award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Michael
C. Pirrung of the University of California-Riverside in a project investigating
reactions that add an amino acid to a peptide chain, thus extending the chain.
Three different amino acids will be employed in these reactions, which build
peptide chains. This project focuses on broadening the methods available for
building peptides and proteins. Such reactions are of far reaching importance in
diverse areas of organic and biological chemistry. Hence, these methods will
expand the synthetic toolboxes of a wide range of researchers in the biomedical
sciences. This project will also provide training in organic synthesis and
peptide chemistry to students, from undergraduates to post-doctorals, including
those from groups historically underrepresented in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study peptide bond forming
reactions between serine and mildly activated C-terminal peptide esters. These
reactions, which will be extended to threonine and homoserine, will expand the
scope of peptide forming reactions and help to alleviate problems of
concentration and scalability. The viability of the method will be tested
through the synthesis of naturally occurring peptide sequences.
