This award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in cell biology. The
investigators are Dominick and Margaret Basile of Lehman College, City
University of New York, and Keith Roberts of the John Innes Institute, Norwich,
United Kingdom. The research focuses on Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), which
are cell-surface glycoproteins, and their role in cell proliferation. AGPs are
associated with numerous functions in the plasma membranes and extracellular
matrix in plants. Through the development of monoclonal antibodies, the
investigators propose to identify AGPs associated with the suppression and
desupression of cell proliferation in plants. Once the AGPs associated with cell
proliferation are isolated, they can be characterized and their genetic
regulation and mechanism can be better investigated. The U.S. investigators
bring to this collaboration their work on morphoregulation in liverworts and
their recent findings on the involvement of AGPs in plant development. This is
complemented by the British investigator's expertise in producing monoclonal
antibodies and his skill in immunocytochemical localization of AGPs. Their
combined efforts will advance our understanding of the growth processes in the
development of multicellular organisms and in the function of AGPs in regulating
cell proliferation.
