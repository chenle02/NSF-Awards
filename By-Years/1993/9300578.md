A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for New Directions in Chemical
Engineering is designed for ten undergraduate students at Purdue. The students
will receive a ten week research experience in three major areas of chemical
engineering: 1) polymers and materials; 2) adsorption science and engineering;
and 3) process systems engineering. Students will be recruited from a variety of
colleges and universities - particularly from smaller midwestern colleges that
do not have major research programs and with an emphasis on historically
underrepresented groups. Student projects will be managed to provide a balanced
experience in which they will be exposed to and work with tools and techniques
at the forefront of modern engineering research. The students will have direct
and frequent contact with both faculty and graduate students. They will
participate in weekly research seminars, prepare written reports describing the
methodologies, results, and conclusions of their projects, and give oral
presentations of their work in a colloquium at the end of the project. The
students' future progress and professional plans will be monitored and analyzed
to suggest optimal ways to enlarge the pool of research- oriented undergraduates
for advanced studies and industrial research and development.
