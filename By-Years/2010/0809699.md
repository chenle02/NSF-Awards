Nancy Makri of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research on
the development of simulation methods for dynamical processes in quantum fluids.
The PI and her group are working to improve upon the pair product method which
was developed in the prior award period so that longer-time simulations will
become possible. The work is expected to generate benchmark calcualations that
can be used to assess the validity of other approximate
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation of dynamic processes in low-
temperature fluids where quantum mechanical effects can be prominent continues
to present a major challenge to theoreticians. In recent years, several
approximate methods for carrying out such calculations have been developed and
applied to neat liquids and even though the results obtained with these methods
are in reasonable agreement with each other, there is a clear need for accurate
results that can serve as measures of validity, or benchmarks, for all these
approaches. The supported work is expected to provide this, thus broadening the
impact of the work on large sectors of the research community. The work is
having a further broad impact through the training of students.
