CiteSeer, a computer science document search engine and digital library, has
become over the last three years the search engine of choice for exploring and
accessing computer science documents for computer scientists and related
disciplines. Not only can the searcher find actual documents but also many other
related linked aspects of document information such as citations, relevance of
citations, active bibliography and co-citations. CiteSeer is so popular with the
computer science community that it gets over 100,000 hits and thousands of
document downloads a day. CiteSeer currently has over 500,000 documents with
over 10 million citations. The goal of this research is to explore methods for
making CiteSeer a permanent research fixture for the computer science community.
Archiving and URL permanence methods, plus methods for enhanced archive
mirroring and archive scaling will be investigated. Availability of CiteSeer
resources is promoted through exploratory APIs (application programming
interfaces) for researcher data access. In addition, new linked information such
as organizations and individuals in acknowledgements will be correlated with
citation rankings. Exploratory research investigating new document crawling
algorithms and procedures further boost the efficiency and functionality of
CiteSeer. This project will have broad impact by providing computer scientists
enhanced access to the computer science literature and promoting the
participation of the researchers in building the CiteSeer by new additions to
the document database.
