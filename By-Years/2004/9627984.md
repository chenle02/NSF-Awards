9627984 HARDIN The Department of Mathematics of Vanderbilt University will
purchase a dual processor DEC UNIX AlphaServer 2000/250 with 256 MB of memory
and 6 GB of storage, 6 NCD HMX20 X-Terminals, licenses for Fortran 90 and C++
compilers which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: investigation of conservation laws using by Professor John Ahner,
research on conjectures in graph theory by Professor Mark Ellingham, developing
applications of local orthogonal bases by Professor Doug Hardin, investigating
the controllability of connected plates and beams using numerical methods by
Professor Mary Ann Horn and research into splines and their applications by
Professor Larry Schumaker. These research projects are all currently limited by
the computational resources now available to the investigators.
