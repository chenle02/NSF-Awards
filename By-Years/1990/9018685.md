The functional and structural properties of Rp1 will be analyzed at the
molecular level and by complementation studies. Individual clones from the Rp1
region will be fine-structure mapped relative to Rp1 functional components and
screened for the location of encoded transcripts. cDNA clones derived from
potential Rp1 transcripts will be isolated and mapped relative to the genomic
clones. Chromosome walking will be used to acquire genomic clones that are
likely to fully encode Rp1-derived disease resistance. These clones will be
transformed into maize and tested for the ability to impart race-specific
resistance to transformed tissues.***//
