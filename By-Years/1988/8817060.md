Shallow-water carbonate platforms contain a rich-record of changing
environments related to globally synchronous external controls including sea
level and changes in circulation. However, we have until now been unable to link
the timing of these controlling events with actual platform rock sequences due
to early diagenetic changes. Furthermore, the correlation and influence of
platform-derived sediment with the proximal deep- water areas was also not
possible. Many of these limitations for efficiently extracting information from
the platforms have now been obviated by the successful application of
magnetostratigraphic dating to the shallow-water carbonates. This research will
develop a chronostratigraphic facies evolution of a carbonate platform, will
assess the influence of eustatic sea level changes and will correlate with
surrounding deep-water environments. Once completed, the results will enable a
refined chronostratigraphic platform-periplatform model, linking the entire
depositional system.
