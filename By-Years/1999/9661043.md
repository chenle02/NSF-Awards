*** 96-61043 He This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate a new method to minimize the evaporation of volatile colorants
during the glass melting process. This non-conventional method consists of
extremely rapid melting (few seconds) and spheridization of colorant-rich glass
spheres, which will be added to the molten glass, By introducing these colorants
in a pre-melted glassy form, the degree of volatilization which these materials
currently demonstrate will be reduce. Commercial application is expected in
glass manufacture, where this process of producing colorant-rich glass spheres
will allow the introduction of colorants in the form of a new raw material. With
less volatilization and higher retention in the finished glass product, glass
manufacturers will benefit from lower raw material costs, greater process
stability, and significant environmental improvements. ***
