This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student participation
in the 11th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and
Storage (NAS), a premier international forum for the presentation of research
results in networking, high-performance computer architecture, and parallel and
distributed data storage technologies. It seeks to increase student
participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would support the
travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Travel grants encourage the
research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well
funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are
interested in entering it. A special effort is made to reach out to women and
under-represented minorities. Preference is given to students who will present
their research at NAS.
