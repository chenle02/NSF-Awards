The Ramapo College of New Jersey requests funding to develop the "Senior
Environmental Experiences (SEE)" project. The project will produce a series of
interactive science experiences using Internet videoconferencing to connect
seniors at community centers and extended care facilities with environmental
experts at the Meadowlands Environment Center as the principal context for
discussions of environmental concepts and issues. The goal of the program is to
increase the interest of seniors by linking science to history and politics.
"SEE" will create experiential modules related to the natural history, ecosystem
structure and future of the Meadowlands. Discussion from the field using live
images and feedback from the seniors would support exploration of details
relevant to the specific topic at hand. The videoconferences will be recorded
and made available to seniors in other locations throughout New Jersey and the
US. Follow up materials will encourage further activities by the seniors. "SEE"
will reach approximately 4,500 seniors in 32 centers during the three-year
project.
