&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of this research is to optimize and expand the
scope of the asymmetric vinylation of aldehydes to furnish secondary allylic
alcohols with high enantioselectivity. The second objective is to use the
resulting chiral allylic alcohols in the synthesis of densely functionalized
chiral building blocks. Using a single reaction vessel, tandem reactions
resulting in the formation of multiple C-C bonds and stereocenters will be
explored. Elaboration of the allylic alcohols to a variety of useful chiral
building blocks including allylic amines, allylic cyclopropanes and allylic
epoxides will be examined and the research will develop methods for the
preparation of alpha- and beta- amino acids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Patrick J. Walsh of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Walsh will focus his work on the development of
methodologies for the creation of chiral building blocks containing functional
groups useful for directing reactivity. Specifically, chiral allylic alcohols
will be targeted. The project could have important broader impact on organic
synthesis, in particular in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The
work provides an excellent venue for the training of both undergraduate and
graduate students and Professor Walsh has developed excellent international
collaborations with Mexican scientists. &lt;br/&gt;
