PI: Haru T. Pinson, University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0301830&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator is interested in the issues surrounding the notion of universality
in systems with large degrees of freedom, specifically in two contexts-2d
critical Ising model and the random matrix models. We would like to investigate
rigorously at least three directions - &lt;br/&gt;1. Rotational invariance of
various correlation functions of the 2d critical Ising model.&lt;br/&gt;2. We
would like to investigate more fully certain aspects of universality in the 2d
critical Ising model.&lt;br/&gt;3. We would like to understand or derive a
certain asymptotic expansion for a class of the random band matrix models using
the supersymmetric random matrix formalism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a nutshell,
we are interested in obtaining precise macroscopic information while we
are&lt;br/&gt;only give some microscopic descriptions. This situation is
ubiquitous in life ranging from biology&lt;br/&gt;to physics where we only know
some local laws, yet we would like to know what happens at a larger scale. Aside
from such general considerations, we hope that the results and methods obtained
from this investigation may prove useful for other outstanding conjectures such
as establishing universality for the general 2d critical Potts models and the
various forms of universality phenomena associated with the higher dimensional
random Schroedinger operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
