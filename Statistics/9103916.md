Regression diagnostics and robust procedures are two areas in statistics that
have exhibited rapid growth in the last decade.Diagnostic procedures for judging
fits of models fitted by robust procedures will be investigated. Properties of
residuals from models fitted by R and M estimates, bounded influence GR and GM
estimates, and high breakdown estimates, will all be studied. Graphical
procedures for assessing the fit will be also developed.
