This proposal outlined a multitargeted approach to quantify and find the
mechanisms of the previously observed enhancement of sintering of alumina and
other oxide ceramics in high temperature plasmas through an extensive systematic
investigation of sintering, defect structures and diffusion under otherwise
identical plasma and non-plasma conditions. A universal sintering model will be
exploited for quantitative comparison of plasma and non-plasma sintering. This
model will be further developed as a more general tool to ultimately assist in
prediction of sintering behavior, in or out of plasmas. %%%% This proposal
expects to use the observed defect structure and their or evolutions during the
sintering process as a means to trace the sintering mechanisms and their
kinectics. Both the plasma and non-plasma sintering conditions will be used.
Efforts will be made to make both sets of conditions nearly identical with the
presence or absence of plasma as the only variable. Sintering model will be used
to compare with the results. It will enhance the usefulness of the plasma
sintering of ceramics.
