This award provides renewed support for The Center for Molecular Biotechnology,
a Science and Technology Center (STC) first established at the California
Institute of Technology in 1989. The STC will move in stages to the University
of Washington during 1992-1993, and will be located entirely at the University
by early 1994. The Center sponsors research and development activities aimed at
the creation of new or improved instrumentation in several key areas of modern
biotechnology. These include the sequencing of sub-picomole amounts of purified
proteins, the large scale mapping and sequencing of genomic DNA and the 2-
dimensional gel electrophoresis of highly complex mixtures of proteins. Other
research activities include development of mass spectrometric instrumentation,
accompanying software and a variety of other computational tools useful in the
Center's development of new technology and data analysis. In addition, the STC
also sponsors education and outreach programs aimed at providing research
experience and training for high school, undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral students. These include programs expected to encourage increased
participation by members of underrepresented minority groups in scientific
research. Other activities of the Center provide for transfer of the Center
developed technology to the academic and commercial sector, and for research
collaborations with academic, industrial and Federal scientists. Support of
these various activities within a center maximizes the benefit of all research
activities from progress to new developments and facilitates the transfer of new
ideas, technologies and research results to basic research and commercial
development activities in other institutions and sectors. The recent, enormous
progress in our understanding of basic cellular processes and the concomitant
growth in our ability to analyze and manipulate basic genetic phenomena for the
benefit of mankind have derived from a variety of techniques for the separation,
analysis and synthesis of the protein and nucleic acid components of all living
organisms. Key to this progress has been the development of automatic
microchemical instrumentation and computational tools of the type being
developed by this Center. The new devices and methodology created by the Center
are expected to have impacts on areas of basic and applied research as diverse
as anthropology, molecular biophysics, forensic and clinical medicine, and
agriculture.
