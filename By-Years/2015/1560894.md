Very few opportunities exist for junior women faculty in engineering to network,
foster peer mentoring relationships, and interact with other female engineering
faculty, particularly with female role models. The difficulty in connecting
junior women faculty with senior women mentors contributes to under-
representation of women in engineering faculty. The proposed workshop for
assistant professors is designed to provide them with professional skills that
will help them be successful faculty members and give them opportunities for
mentorship and professional collaborations across institutions to counter
isolation and lack of networking opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this workshop is to enhance the professional skills and network of junior
women faculty in engineering departments in the Big 10+. Methods used will
include faculty toolbox sessions to provide core skills (negotiation, elevator
pitch, management skills), activities designed to build peer-mentoring skills,
and a professional coaching session. A keynote speaker and a panel session with
deans from the Big 10+ will provide participants the perspectives of senior
administrative leaders. In addition, a panel will address the intersection of
race and gender in a session during the meeting. The senior women mentors who
attend will also benefit from additional mentoring training, mentoring
experience, and development of their own research networks.
