Southern Coalition for Modern Engineering Design Graphics at Two-Year
Institutions The project using a six-day workshop introduces faculty, who teach
Engineering Design Graphics courses at two-year institutions to new methodology
in Engineering Design Graphics and helps their institutions to develop and
organize modern laboratories and modernized programs. The project involves the
formation of a coalition composed of two four-year institutions, the University
of Texas at Austin and Georgia Institute of Technology, and a larger number of
two-year institutions in the Gulf and South-Atlantic states. In addition, six
leading educators, one from each state of the coalition region, will consult to
provide local input to the program. A total of 48 faculty members from
approximately 40 two-year institutions will benefit directly from this project
and through them several thousand students each year. Of that number 23% of the
students are expected to be minorities and 28% will transfer to four-year
engineering colleges to complete their B.S. degree.***//
