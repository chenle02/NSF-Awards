Colby College requests funds for the renovation of advanced chemistry research
and research training facilities in Keyes Chemistry Building. The renovated
facilities will strengthen advanced laboratory instruction in Chemistry; will
support emerging interdisciplinary programs in cell and molecular biology/
biochemistry and environmental science; and will facilitate collaborative
student-faculty research - a hallmark of Colby's new undergraduate science
curriculum. Specifically, the proposed renovation will upgrade facilities for
three general areas of chemistry on two floors of Keyes - biochemistry,
analytical/physical chemistry, and chemical synthesis. In addition, the project
includes an instrumentation laboratory area which encourages shared use of
instrumentation and collaboration. The chemistry faculty, comprised of six
members, will conduct research or research training in the proposed renovated
facilities. The successful completion of the plan to modernize Keyes will help
Colby attract more students to major in the natural and physical sciences, will
nurture the skills and enthusiasm that will lead them to go on to earn higher
degrees, and will motivate them, through excellence in teaching and research, to
make contributions to the strengthening of America's scientific base. Further,
the availability of improved chemistry research facilities will make Colby more
competitive as it seeks to recruit outstanding young science faculty.
