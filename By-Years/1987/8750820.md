This project is to set up a computer aided software engineering (CASE)
environment for first course students in computer science. As CASE is already
used in the industrial environment, this project will be unique in bringing it
into the undergraduate environment. The CASE environment places increased
importance on modularization, abstraction, team programming skills and the use
of automated aids to software development. Ten Apollo workstations with
associated mass storage elements will make up the environment. An important
component of this project is the development of software modules and curricular
materials for the integration of CASE equipment into the undergraduate
environment.
