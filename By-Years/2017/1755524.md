The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in its
ability to identify potential customers for IoT connected sensor technology and
monitoring services that provide timely and accurate data regarding the adoption
rates and impacts of technologies engineered for humanitarian aid settings.
Initially, the focus is toward non-government organizations who fund,
manufacture or distribute clean, energy efficient, biomass cookstoves to rural
communities who still cook over open fires. The project will then explore
potential customer segments with technologies engineered to improve energy
efficient water purification, and food production. The broader impact of
providing accurate and timely data will guide and promote aid organizations to
improve the design, energy efficiency, and culturally directed marketing efforts
thereby improving public health and livelihoods.

This I-Corps project will enable customer discovery of a Fuel, Usage, and
Emissions Logger (FUEL) system. Conceived via a design thinking approach
informed by first hand observations of the significant challenges of monitoring
development projects, FUEL is one of the first Internet of Things (IoT)
connectable sensor specifically engineered to provide accurate time-correlated
technology usage and emissions reduction data. Continuing efforts will develop
the transmission hardware and software architecture needed to enable the sensor
to become an autonomous IoT and data storage/transfer/analysis device, designed
with the users in mind. Detailed customer discovery is essential to informing
the objectives, constraints, packaging, and pricing for this technology to be
attractive to potential customers as well as identifying potential
commercialization partners and competitors.
