Graph-based methods form a powerful framework for a range of data-intensive
applications: any dataset involving pairwise relationships such as similarities
can be naturally expressed as a graph on the underlying objects, and structuring
natural-language and related data in graph form makes this data accessible to
powerful combinatorial algorithms. Crucially, efficient graph algorithms enable
the analysis of data relationships in a global fashion, which greatly increases
the amount of information that can be distilled from both annotated and un-
annotated data.

This work develops new algorithms based on graph-theoretic ideas, including
network flow and spectral analysis. It applies these methods to a range of
different application areas in text and language processing, including
sentiment-based text categorization and document retrieval; it also develops
connections between these problems and some current issues in social network
analysis. The main results of this work will be to open up to the natural
language processing community a new set of effective, theoretically sound graph-
based paradigms for learning from language data. In addition, this work will
make resources available to the broader research community through the
dissemination of novel datasets and through educational activities.
