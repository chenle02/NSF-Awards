The reproductive potential of an adult depends on the embryo forming specialized
stem cells, called primordial germ cells. They are the only cells of the body
that are able to develop into the eggs or sperm of the adult. If this mechanism
fails, or if those cells are lost, the adult will not be able to make eggs or
sperm, and will be reproductively sterile. The process of developing these
important primordial germ cells is not understood, but they are a type of stem
cells with the ultimate in developmental capability. These investigators are
using a simple animal as a model to explore how the process of primordial germ
cell formation works. They are using echinoderms, i.e. sea urchins and sea
stars, as a model to explore this mechanism with an understanding that they will
reveal general and fundamental principles of this process. Embryos from these
animals are easily manipulated, they develop outside of the adult, and advanced
genomic resources are available. Echinoderms are also closely related to
vertebrates, so these results will have broad ramifications for animals in which
this process is difficult to study.The research support will also have a
significant impact beyond the bench as our lab has an aggressive outreach
program. We are regular hosts to URM faculty and students, Professor Wessel
serves as a scientific advisor to several preK-12 schools, and has involved a
variety of students in the lab in observation, hands-on research, authorship,
and creative learning. Overall, our outreach activities over the past 3 years
have involved directly over 300 citizens, and benefit both the members of the
lab and society, hopefully changing us all for a healthy science outlook in the
future.
