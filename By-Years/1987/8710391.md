The research involves experimental analytical and theoretical methods in the
study of chaotic vibration in a nonlinear system described by Duffing's
equation. Emphasis is on nonlinear vibration analysis. Energy concepts are
explored as a way to derive chaotic criteria. The relationships are investigated
between the energy levels of the states of periodic motion and the equation
parameters: damping, and the amplitude and frequency of the forcing function.
This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate
Engineering Students.
