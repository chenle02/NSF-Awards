The principal investigators will study the vibrational spectra of hydrous
silicate glasses and melts at conditions of both elevated pressure/temperature.
Results will provide information on the speciation of H2O in silicate melts
under magmatic conditions, and will be of significance in both igneous petrology
and materials science.
