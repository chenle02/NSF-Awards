Colorado State University proposes a two-year, $200,000 project to effect
institution-wide changes in the core curriculum in mathematics, computing
skills, and science for non-science majors. One goal of the project is to
develop in non-science majors an integrated understanding of `oth process and
content in science and mathematics in ways that will be meaningful to them as
educated citizens. To achieve this goal we will build on the adoption of a joint
core curriculum by the Colleges of Natural Sciences and of Liberal Arts by
developing two new yearlong core courses, one to integrate scientific concepts
and applications and the other to provide mathematical skills and perspectives.
Successful extant experimental courses will be used as the nuclei for
development of two-semester, multidisciplinary, lab-based science, mathematics,
and computing skills cores for non-science majors. A second goal will be to make
explicit to non-science and science majors the roles played by and the impact of
science and technology on society in general and the role of non-science
disciplines in influencing and shaping scientific endeavors. To achieve this
goal we will use the new joint core curriculum to establish well-defined
linkages between arts, humanities, history, and social sciences components of
the core with science and math courses designed for majors. An ancillary goal is
to create a program for faculty development, team planning, and team
implementation of the above programs as a realistic first step toward systemic
and sustainable change.
