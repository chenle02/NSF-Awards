With National Science Foundation support, Dr. James A. Matisoff will complete
the final cycle of the Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus
project (STEDT), which was founded in 1987 at the University of California,
Berkeley. This project has the mission of clarifying the history of Sino-
Tibetan, one of the greatest linguistic families of the world, with over a
billion speakers, consisting of Chinese on the one hand, and the 250
understudied languages of the vast Tibeto-Burman group on the other. To achieve
this goal, STEDT has created large computer databases of words from these
languages (almost 700,000 at last count), culled from over 500 sources, ranging
from published dictionaries and wordlists to questionnaires solicited from field
researchers.

STEDT has produced a steady stream of publications, culminating in the 800-page
Handbook of Proto-Tibeto-Burman: system and philosophy of Sino-Tibetan
reconstruction (University of California Press, August, 2003). In this book, the
pronunciations and meanings of over 2800 roots are reconstructed for the
ancestor languages from which all the modern Sino-Tibetan languages descend,
Proto-Tibeto-Burman and/or Proto-Sino-Tibetan. During the final stages of the
project, to be accomplished during this grant period, the focus will be shifted
to electronic publication, making our data and analyses part of the public
domain. The STEDT project has already advanced the state of research into East
and Southeast Asian languages, and will help to decide further questions about
the interrelationships among all the language families of this complex region of
the world, including Tai-Kadai, Mon-Khmer, Austronesian, and Hmong-Mien.
