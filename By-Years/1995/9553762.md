Fiber optics technology has an ever increasing number of applications, not only
in industry, manufacturing and research, but also in the home and office. Over
80% of the optical fiber in use in the United States is employed in
telecommunications applications. It is anticipated the industry will grow at an
accelerating rate as the demands of the "information super-highway" expand into
businesses and homes. The New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) proposes
to administer and coordinate a series of regional two-day workshops, one-week
summer workshops, two-day technical assistance sessions and a final one-week
summer workshop, beginning in the fall of 1995 and completing in the spring of
1998, designed to increase the number of high school teachers and two-year
college faculty who will include fiber optics and related topics in their
science/technology programs. Special attention will be paid to include
traditionally under-served populations such as women and minorities. The project
will link with the Regional Student Network and faculty mentors that are part of
NEBHE's Equity and Pluralism project. The project will include faculty
enhancement, curriculum development and laboratory improvement. There will also
be strong participation form industry, including a co-PI, members on an advisory
committee, presenters in the workshops, development of laboratories, site visits
and possible future internships for students.
