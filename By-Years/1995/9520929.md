This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. The research examines how artistic and literary excellence are defined
and how the subsequent criteria are applied. The research settings are two art
museums and two university literature departments, selected to contrast cultural
organizations where multiculturalism is the focus from those with more
traditional orientations. Theoretical concerns relate to the formation of
cognitive systems and their relation to social action. Data come from careful
observations and from 90 interviews with museum curators and literature
professors. %%% This research will contribute to the sociological understanding
of cultural systems by examining the relation between aesthetic standards and
standards used in other social situations. In addition to the scientific gains
to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough
training of the next generation of social scientists.
