Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop
effective, efficient, and practical algorithms for phasor measurement unit
operation and application. The approach is to: 1) develop the next generation
phasor measurement unit with novel signal modeling and processing to enable both
static and dynamic analysis; 2) gain a thorough understanding of bad phasor data
processing by exploring methods of bad data identification and removal; 3)
establish a theoretical framework to explicitly deal with bad data using
statistical inference and compressive sensing; and 4) identify from simulation
where our methods bring improved situational awareness, and verify with field
data.

Intellectual Merit: TheÂ gap between the current state of the art in phasor
measurement units and their envisioned capability calls for advanced technology
beyond today?s industry standards. This research proposal will contribute to
this endeavor by developing novel signal processing techniques tailored for the
phasor measurement unit and its applications. Successful development of the
algorithms will also have impact on a number of fundamental problems of
synchronization and anomaly detection in signal processing.

Broader Impacts: In the U.S., power interruptions cost up to $135 billion each
year. A main cause is inadequate situational awareness. With the proposed
advancement, the next generation phasor measurement units will provide a picture
of grid conditions that is truly accurate, anytime, and everywhere. Besides
integrating research issues into our curriculum, special efforts will be made to
enrich graduate student training with industrial internships, and to recruit and
retain women and underprivileged students.
