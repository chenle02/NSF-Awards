The principle objective of this project is to introduce new state-of-the-art
laser vibrometry and PC-based instrumentation technology into the undergraduate
laboratory curriculum in the area of Mechanical Vibrations. The experiments
introduced into the courses are of a fundamental and design application nature.
Labs are conducted in which concepts such as natural frequency, mode shapes,
resonance, Bode plots, and aerodynamically induced vibrations of flexible
structures are introduced. A rotor vibrations lab is introduced in which the
students measure the vibration of turbine blades while the rotor is spinning at
a high rate of speed. A design lab is introduced in which the students are asked
to eliminate the noise produced by a cellular phone antenna mounted on the rear
window of a car. The equipment to be installed in the new labs includes laser
vibrometers, Bentley Nevada rotor kits, and PC-based hardware and software for
real-time Fast Fourier Transform and Oscilloscope instrumentation.
