This project is to support a problem-posing and problem-&lt;br/&gt;solving
workshop on an emerging new topic in Computational&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, with
applications in Graphics, Robotics, and&lt;br/&gt;Mobile Computing. Funding will
support a small&lt;br/&gt;international group of participants, including
students and&lt;br/&gt;post-docs, to get together and draft a list of the
main&lt;br/&gt;questions to be answered about this relatively new
data&lt;br/&gt;structure, and to work on solving some of them.&lt;br/&gt;
