9450731 Harvey This project is building on previous research and curriculum
development work to develop flexible understandings of topics in precalculus,
calculus, and linear algebra. Exemplary course materials will be produced using
a modular approach to package the concepts and activities. Based on the broad
mathematical themes, these materials will make use of constructivist pedagogies,
involving cooperative learning, computer technology, and alternatives to
traditional lecturing. Field testing of the curriculum will provide sites for
research into the way students learn the topics and environments for teacher
enhancement.
