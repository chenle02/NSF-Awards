During development, neurons (nerve cells) develop elaborate processes that may
extend over long distances to reach highly specific local targets. The
mechanisms that determine such accurate pathfinding and connectivity are not
fully known. The fruitfly, Drosophila, has provided valuable data on such
development, and the ease of producing genetic crosses and mutations provides
approaches to the molecular mechanisms involved. Ground-based studies show in
great detail how particular motor neurons develop specific connections with
specific muscles. With this very detailed background from identified single
cells, this project uses the space flight of Neurolab as a unique opportunity to
test, by lacking normal gravity, how gravity may be a subtle cue important in
developing such neuronal outgrowths and connections normally. Drosophila has the
advantages for space flight of having very low mass and needing minimal care, so
this study can involve very large numbers of individuals to assay developmental
variability. Results of this study will be important for developmental
neuroscience, and also will raise issues important for developmental biology in
general. Contribution to this project represents the NSF Biological Sciences
Directorate's participation in the NASA/Interagency Neurolab activity on the
space shuttle orbiter, which in turn is part of Decade of the Brain activities.
