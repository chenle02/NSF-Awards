9315251 Liou The objective of this research is the development of light
scattering programs for nonspherical ice crystals using both the theoretical and
experimental approaches. The proposed theoretical studies include the
application of the newly developed geometric ray-tracing/Monte Carlo method
applied to complex ice crystals such as capped columns, spatial aggregates, and
graupel. For ice crystals with size parameters less than about 30, we propose to
develop a numerical technique, referred to as the finite difference time domain
method, for the solution of the scattered field. The proposed laboratory
experiment uses a laser light-scattering analog measurement for a single
crystal. Initial experimental arrangements and preliminary results are presented
and the proposed experiments for the measurements of the phase matrix elements
for crystals of various shapes and sizes are outlined. ***
