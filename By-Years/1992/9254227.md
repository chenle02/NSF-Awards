This project redesigns the laboratory curriculum of physical anthropology
courses. The courses involve a two-semester sequence and core curriculum, which
actively engage students in the learning process using problem-oriented class
exercises. These exercises are also used to integrate the laboratory with the
lectures, as well as help standardize materials presented in different sections
of the courses. The program is primarily offered to freshman and sophomore non-
science majors, and teams of experienced undergraduates and graduates are used
to help enhance students' learning skills.
