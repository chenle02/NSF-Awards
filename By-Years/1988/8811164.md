This action provides funding for three investigators at the University of
Illinois at Chicago to continue their research on an experiment using the
facilities at Fermilab (E665). The experiment involves the scattering of muons
from protons and other nuclear targets. The experiment will investigate the
composition of elementary particles in terms of their constituents. This is the
most comprehensive study of this type done to date. Other NSF grantees are
collaborating on the same experiment.
