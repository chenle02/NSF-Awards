Insect herbivores can have large effects on the performance, life histories,
and demography of plants, and often exert strong natural selection on plant
populations. In addition, plants are often exposed simultaneously to stresses
from biotic (i.e. herbivory, parasitism) and abiotic (i.e. resource limitation,
heat) sources. This project will use the tallgrass prairie perennial Silphium
integrifolium (Asteraceae) and one of its major herbivores, the gall wasp
Antistrophus silphii (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae), as a model system to examine how
herbivory, nutrient stresses, and water stress interact to affect life history
and physiological responses of plants. Experiments will address two specific
questions. 1. How does gall infestation affect life-history traits and fitness
components of Silphium intergrifolium? 2. How do nutrient limitation and water
stress influence the physiological and growth responses of plants to gall insect
attack? To answer the first question, plant physiology (i.e. photosynthesis,
water potential), growth, biomass allocation, and reproduction will be measured
over a two-year period in experimentally galled and gall-free plants growing in
natural field populations. The second question will be addressed in a common
garden experiment in which gall frequencies and nutrient/water availabilities
will be manipulated in a factorial design, and physiology, growth, and
reproductive output will again be measured.
