With this EAGER award, the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program is funding
Professor Stephen Sprang of the University of Montana to address fundamental
structural, functional and mechanistic questions about the class of soluble
adenylyl cyclase (sAC) enzymes. Namely, Professor Sprang and his group will use
the tools of x-ray crystallography and mechanistic enzymology to address how
sACs sense carbon dioxide and pH and whether they produce previously
unrecognized second messengers for biological signal
transduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student and research associate co-workers
involved in this project will be exposed to cutting edge biophysical techniques
at the interface of mechanistic chemistry and structural biology. Additionally,
the PI will endeavor to broaden participation through the inclusion of members
of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in physical science research.
