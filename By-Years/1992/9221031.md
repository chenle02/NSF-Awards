Research will test the hypothesis that climatic change in the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan has produced changes in aquatic environments as it has caused range
expansions of mesic tree species. Cooling climate should reduce
evapotranspiration causing lake levels to rise and major ion concentrations of
lake water to decline. Bogs and fens should also expand under the cooler, wetter
climate of the late Holocene. Past lake levels will be determined at Sylvania
Wilderness and Recreation Area, Michigan, using multiple, dated sediment cores
from the shallow waters of a lake. Ages of bog development will be determined
using radiocarbon dating of peat cores. Past lake water chemistry will be
determined using diatom microfossils from the sediment cores %%% The results of
this study should shed light on the impacts of climatic change on aquatic
environments and provide an independent record of climatic change to compare
with the terrestrial vegetation.
