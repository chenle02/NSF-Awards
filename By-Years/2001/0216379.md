This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
commercialize an ultra fast block data retrieval method for the company's
patented chiral film-based optical data storage system. The technology will
combine ultrahigh storage capacity with ultra fast retrieval speed. The current
retrieval rates of CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and MO technology is inherently limited for
applications such as image retrieval for medical diagnosis or target
recognition. The company's block retrieval technique is a new method for solving
the bottleneck of data retrieval. Using imaging and pattern recognition
techniques, data is retrieved in 2D blocks. This retrieval method will result in
orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput and increases in storage density.

Since the need for high density, high-speed storage is continuing to escalate,
there will be a ready market from storage system vendors who supply products to
the myriad of industries whose business depends upon volumes of storage and
quick retrieval.
