The University of Arkansas has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supercomputing. They will be connected to the MIDnet, a regional
network which connects to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET)
through a medium speed (9600 bits per second) communication lines. Six
federally-funded supercomputing centers can be accessed through NSFnet. This
grant provides a gateway/router, which is a portion of the system proposed by
the University, and is consistent with NSF's policy regarding connection to
existing regional networks. The communications line to an existing MIDnet node
will be provided separately by MIDnet, and other required equipment will be
funded by the University and the State of Arkansas.
