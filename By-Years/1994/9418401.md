Booker 9418401 The PI has suggested that crustal seismicity in the Pugen Lowland
is largely controlled by the deformation properties of material below the
volcanic basement and that this sub-volcanic basement may be fluid-bearing and
hence electrically conductive. To test this hypothesis he has collected 20
magnetotelluric (MT) and 10 magnetovariation (MV) sites. With current funding,
he expects to collect 5 mare MT sites and 10 more MV sites. The MT data appear
consistent with the hypothesis, but higher resolution will be achieved when new
seismic results are used to provide structural constraints. When combined with
earlier data, the MV data will beused to test whether large-scale three-
dimensional effects are distorting the interpretation. Funds will support
completion of the analysis. ****
