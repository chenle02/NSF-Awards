Minorities are inadequately represented in the sciences generally, and in marine
science in particular. The small minority representation in marine science, led
a group of Directors of Marine Laboratories in the southeastern U.S. to approach
their colleagues at Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCUs) to
see what could be done to increase minority student interest in marine science
careers. To this end, a program will be initiated at the University of Maryland,
Eastern Shore, an HMCU, to involve students in marine science early in their
college career. The intent of the program is to provide support, by way of
stipends, and to nurture and expand the student's interest in marine science
through course work during the academic year and full time laboratory research
experiences during the summer.//
