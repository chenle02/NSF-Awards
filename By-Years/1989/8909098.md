In the last decade, discrete-event distributed simulation has been a research
topic of several researchers. However, there has been no commonly accepted
solution, neither a commonly useful implementation. The main objectives of this
project are: (1) Increasing the concurrency of distributed simulation by
employing efficient graph algorithms, (2) Finding an efficient distributed-
deadlock detection algorithm for a conservative distributed simulation, (3)
Developing a suboptimal method to eliminate cycles from a process graph by
replicating some nodes and edges of this graph, (4) Developing an efficient
clustering algorithm for mapping of processes to processors, (5) Investigate the
problems of flow control, load sharing, and memory management, (6) The
implementation of (1) and (4) on the network of SUNs and/or on the Encore
Multimax multicomputer, (7) The evaluation of the proposed methods by simulation
(changing different parameters in the implementation, using different input
models, comparing the performance to a sequential simulation executed on a
uniprocessor).
