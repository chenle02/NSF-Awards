Ophiolitic rocks in the Coast Ranges of California show many similarities to
modern ophiolitic forearcs such as in the Marianas, where large-scale normal
faults cause catastrophic landsliding into the trench and there are giant
serpentinite mud volcanoes. Observed processes in modern ophiolitic forearcs
suggest that large volumes of oceanic material can be transferred from the
forearc into the subduction complex and from the subducting plate into forearc.
This study will examine the Mesozoic ophiolitic rocks in the Coast Ranges and
compare them to rocks in the Mariana forearc to better understand the processes
of formation and modification of forearc crust. The results of this work will
have importance for tectonic processes in subduction zones.
