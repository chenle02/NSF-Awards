Professor Krener proposes to develop analytical methods to deal with nonlinear
control systems governed by systems of ordinary differential equations. Three
topics will be covered. The first topic is the nonlinear observation and
filtering. Here, Professor Krener wants to study geometric, asymptotic and
stochastic aspects of these problems. The second topic is the identification of
nonlinear systems. A new approach, based on the normal forms for nonlinear
systems, is proposed. The third topic is the stochastic realization of acausal
systems. It has potential applications to signal-and image processing.
