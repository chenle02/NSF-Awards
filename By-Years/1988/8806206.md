This "research opportunities for women" project will consider uniform central
limit theorems for families of semi- martingales. These arise as the extensions
of the results in empirical processes for independent identically distributed
random variables. The principal investigator has already found sharpest results
so far in the traditional empirical processes area using the "bracketing"
technique. The relaxation of the condition of independence makes the theory open
to wider applications. The particular dependence structure assumed here is that
of semi-martingales. One of the anticipated applications is to provide
approximations to certain self-similar Gaussian random fields which arise in
modeling physical variation.
