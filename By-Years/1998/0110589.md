This grant provides partial travel support for US participants to Plasmodesma
2001, the fourth international workshop on plasmodesmatal biology, to be held in
Cape Town, South Africa, August 19-24, 2001. The workshop will bring together
junior and senior scientists from around the world to discuss many aspects of
plasmodesmata science, basic and applied. These topics include: plasmodesmata
structure and development, virus movement, solute transport, symplastic domains
and regulation, macromolecular trafficking, and gene silencing. Plasmodesmata
research is very active at present and is moving quickly on many fronts. The
cross-fertilization of ideas that conferences are noted for is especially
important in this multidisciplinary field, where the subject matter and
techniques used by one group may be quite foreign to another. A total of
approximately thirty speakers will be invited on the basis of submitted
abstracts. Others will be encouraged to present posters and short talks. The
funds from this award will be used to support the travel and per diem expenses
of US scientists, most of junior rank (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
and assistant professors).
