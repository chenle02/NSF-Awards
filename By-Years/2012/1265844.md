This grant provides funding to design, fabricate and test a new class of polymer
stents for treating cardio-vascular disease. We will investigate the texturing
of these stents with arrays of nano-scale features using a novel
nanomanufacturing process. The hypothesis is that nano-scale texturing, unlike
texturing at micron sizes or larger scales, will prevent blood clots that would
allow cardio-patients enjoy the important possibilities of extended life. In the
proposed work, plasmons will be generated using a laser technique and utilized
to produce nano-scale protrusions and nanoparticles on the polymeric stents with
a focus on scalability issues such as size uniformity, throughput, cost and
repeatability. The drug will be applied to the nanotextured stents and its
effects on the drug storage, drug effectiveness and polymer degradation will be
evaluated. A cardiologist in the advisory role will provide continuous input
during the progress of the project so as to achieve an efficient and safe
nanotextured drug eluting stent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
research will lead to the prevention of late stent blood clots. Thus, the
project has potential to reduce the healthcare spending in the cardiovascular
market. The proposed process could also be an enabling technology in other
fields such as semiconductors, organic solar cells and nanoelectromechanical
systems (NEMS). The project will also offer new knowledge of laser-induced
plasmonics for nano-scale processing that represents an important area in
nanomanufacturing. The proposed work will impact education through an annual
organization of the symposium "Nanomanufacturing Innovations in Medical Devices"
with results disseminated through booth exhibits in local and national Medical
Design and Manufacturing conferences and Iowa State Fair impacting a large
number of visitors. In addition, the work will contribute to K-12 STEM education
at Iowa State University by developing an inquiry module, "Learn Nanotechnology"
for students in grades 9-12.
