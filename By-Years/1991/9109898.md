Under a Research Initiation Award, a novel birefringence technique will be
explored for characterizing the properties of polymeric fluids. In particular,
more accurate and reliable measurements will be obtained for the full stress
tensor, including the second normal stress difference. The technique will be
applied to several phenomena in entangled linear polymer solutions, such as for
example oscillatory shear. Polymeric fluids, and their characterization, play an
important role in a very broad range of materials processing techniques. Optimal
processing conditions would be predictable with greater certainty with better
materials characterization.
