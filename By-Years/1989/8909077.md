This proposal aims to investigate fossil fluid-rock interactions in three major
shear zones which range from fluid- rich to fluid-starved conditions. Combined
isotopic and petrographic studies will be used to construct a model of fluid
movement within crustal shear zones. In particular, micro- sampling of mineral
components in the altered rocks will be combined with laser microprobe
techniques to characterize fine- scale isotopic variations with respect to
alteration zones and deformation structures. Close collaboration with Dr. J. R.
O'Neil (U. Michigan) will introduce the PI to the laser microprobe technology
and hydrogen isotope geochemistry which will allow transferral of this
technology to her home institution (as per ROW objectives). Additional
collaboration with Dr. A. K. Sinha (VPI) and Dr. Carol Simpson (John Hopkins
Univ.) will facilitate integration of the stable isotopic work with radiogenic
isotope and structural data. Together, these lines of research are intended to
provide constraints on timing of fluid flow and extent of interaction with rock-
forming minerals.
