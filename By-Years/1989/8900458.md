A REU Site program in mechanical engineering is established involving a
community of faculty and students who will be actively engaged in both
individual and group research efforts. Each faculty member will work directly
with one or two students on research projects and will participate in activities
for the entire group. The students will assist a faculty member in research, do
independent research under the guidance of the same faculty member, and
participate in a program of seminars and research meetings. Approximately half
of the students will come from schools other than the host institution. The
students will be involved in projects in the areas of biomedical technology,
power and propulsion, design and productivity, industrial engineering, heat
transfer and thermodynamics and environmental engineering and particle
technology. Research projects include photoelectric pressure distribution
sensors, robust scheduling systems, high temperature solar processing, and
microcontamination in high purity gases.
