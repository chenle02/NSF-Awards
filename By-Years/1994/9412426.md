9412426 Koch The goal of this study is to understand how the electrical signals
(called spikes) generated by nerve cells encode information. Studying nerve
cells that are part of the early visual or auditory pathways in the nervous
system provides an opportunity to directly relate visual or auditory stimuli
with the trains of spikes generated by these neurons. To understand how the
nervous system works it is important to understand how time-varying signals such
as the velocity of a moving target in the visual field of an animal is encoded
in such spike trains. Another important issue is to understand how information
encoded in neuronal spike trains depends on the biophysical properties of the
nerve cells, the hardware of the nervous system. This group of investigators
will apply methods of information theory, which up to now have been mainly used
in the engineering sciences, to estimate the rate, in bits per second, at which
nerve cells can transmit information and to understand better the nature of the
encoding of time-varying signals in neuronal spike trains. The role of the
biophysics of single cells in this information transmission will be investigated
by performing realistic computer simulations of nerve cell activity.
