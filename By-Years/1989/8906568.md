The early part of the Ordovician Period witnessed the rapid radiation of many
of the invertebrate groups that rose to dominate the world's Paleozoic oceans.
The echinoderms of this age, however, are poorly known, throwing into
controversy the relationships between Cambrian and later Ordovician
representatives of the phylum. Dr. James Sprinkle proposes to collect and study
three newly discovered local faunas of early Ordovician echinoderms from the
Rocky Mountain region. This research project will provide the basis for
determining the evolutionary rates active within the group during this critical
interval. In particular, better data for the earliest Ordovician would establish
whether the Paleozoic radiation proceeded in two phases of evolutionary
diversification disjoined by an extinction episode, or whether a single
protracted growth of diversity occurred but is poorly preserved and sampled. The
proposed research will address an important gap in our knowledge of a major
taxonomic group during a critical episode of earth history. The results of the
project will contribute to a controversy that has a wide audience.
