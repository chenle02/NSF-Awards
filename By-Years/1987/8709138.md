The Yongom live in the lowland rainforest of Papua New Guinea. This study will
attempt to understand the significance of ritual knowledge and beliefs in this
little-known society. Specifically the student will look at divination
ceremonies and see how individuals resolve illness by applying social pressure
to persons suspected of sorcery and how knowledge is transmitted through
initiation ceremonies. The student will focus on the way in which religious
knowledge helps to organize Yongom daily life. This study will help us
understand how ritual knowledge is organized, taught, and used in a society. It
will enable us to understand the role of beliefs and ritual in everyday
situations as well as ritual contexts. Religious knowledge is used in all
societies in everyday situations: this research will provide new information on
how a belief system is integrated with practical and strategic knowledge and
provides a framework for events faced everyday.
