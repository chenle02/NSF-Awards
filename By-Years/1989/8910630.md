A major limitation to our progress in understanding of larval dispersal and
recruitment processes in marine systems is our inability to track the movements
and fate of larvae in the ocean. Dr. Levin will investigate the development of
techniques for use of rare earth elements to label invertebrate larvae and
inanimate (passive) particles in the field. Rare earth elements make excellent
tracers because they occur at extremely low background levels in nature and are
inert when introduced into the field, but become highly radioactive and are
detectable at nano-to picogram levels when subjected to neutron activation.
Advantages of this tracer over others are the short time and minimal manpower
required for label detection in plankton or tissue samples, and the high degree
of sensitivity and accuracy associated with neutron activation analysis. The
research will develop incorporation techniques for bivalve, crustacean and
polychaete larvae, assess label persistence and behavioral effects, and
incorporate rare earths into passive particles with fall velocities comparable
to the larvae of interest.
