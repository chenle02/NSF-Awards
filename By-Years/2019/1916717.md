Machine learning is fueling major advances in biomedical research, natural
language processing, image recognition, self-driving vehicles, etc. These
advances depend on the continuing availability of data. By assuring the
integrity and privacy of both the data and the machine learning models based on
this data, this project aims to bring the benefits of machine learning to all
data holders. However, machine learning can unintentionally reveal sensitive
data such as the identity of specific persons. This project will investigate
unintended learning, i.e., what machine learning models are discovering beyond
their stated objectives, and its consequences for the data on which the models
are trained and to which they are applied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project, the first focus area is developing inference techniques that detect
leakage of sensitive data and, more generally, determine what models are
actually learning. This research will help identify the root causes of training-
data memorization in deep models, develop methodology for detecting and
measuring it, and help prevent deep models from unintentionally learning
privacy-sensitive features of the data. The second focus area is developing and
analyzing methods for mitigating unintended learning and ensuring that models do
not contain unwanted or malicious functionality. In addition to improving
privacy of the training and test data, this research will help detect and
prevent backdoors in models trained on smartphones and other edge devices. All
technologies developed as part of this project will be evaluated on state-of-
the-art image-analysis and natural-language models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
