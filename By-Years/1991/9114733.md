Using a dedicated high-dispersion fiber-fed spectrograph facility at the 1.1-m
telescope of Lowell Observatory, we propose to study stellar/solar magnetic
cycles and chromospheric activity The spectrograph records, using CCD detectors,
the line profiles of Ca II at the K line (3933 ) and the infrared triplet (8542
), and H. (6563 ) for solar-type stars and for the Sun itself, observed as just
another star using the same instrument. The purpose of these observations is to
use stellar cycles as tools to study the solar cycle. From detailed studies of
cycle morphology (amplitude, shape, regularity) as a function of stellar mass,
age, rotation rate, chemical composition, etc., we may hope to: (a) Infer the
time-history of cyclic behavior for a star like the Sun over its entire
lifetime, including information about the statistical frequency of major
departures from "normal" behavior (e.g., Maunder minima); and (b) Obtain a broad
perspective of the total ensemble of cycles possible, hence gain deep insight
into the nature of stellar dynamos and into the ultimate origins of stellar
magnetism. Stellar cycles provide complementary information unobtainable from
observations of the Sun itself but of crucial importance to understanding the
solar cycle.
