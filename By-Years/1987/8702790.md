Interactions and quenching of the excited state-selected metastable atoms neon
and argon in collisions with other atoms and molecules are to be studied in
crossed supersonic molecular beams. Scattering attributes to be measured include
nonreactive scattering angular distributions, angular distributions of excited
products, and mass-resolved relative cross sections for Penning ionization, all
carried out over a wide range of collision energy. Penning ionization electron
spectra are to be measured under conditions of high kinematic resolution . In
conjunction with other scattering studies, these results will be used to
estimate potential surfaces for more complicated target molecules, as well as to
resolve the overall Penning resonance width (lifetime of the complex against
ionization) into orbital-specific components. This research program makes an
important experimental and theoretical contribution to the understanding of the
fundamental reaction dynamics of chemiionization processes. This kind of
spectroscopy of excited intermediate states addresses the boundary line where
differences and similarities are likely to be found between neutral-neutral and
ion-molecule reaction dynamics.
