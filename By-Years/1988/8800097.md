This project provides partial funding for a symposium on Artificial
Intelligence, jointly sponsored by NSF and the Japanese Institute for New
Generation Computer Technology (ICOT). The purpose of the joint symposium is to
provide a venue for the interchange of new scientific ideas, methods and
approaches between the researchers from the U.S. and Japan. The main focus of
the symposium is on artificial intelligence architectures, foundational aspects
of artificial intelligence, artificial languages and methodologies, natural
language processing and learning, and machine learning and knowledge
acquisition. The 3- day symposium will be held in Tokyo, Japan, with a fourth
day scheduled for a visit/tour of the ICOT facility.
