This award to the Bucknell University "Summer Research Program in Physics and
Astronomy" will give 8 undergraduate students per summer the opportunity to
collaborate with a member of the Bucknell faculty for 10 weeks on his or her
research. Projects to be offered cover a broad range of topics, including
experimental atomic and molecular physics, theoretical statistical mechanics,
quantum information theory, theoretical quantum optics, computer simulation,
experimental nonlinear dynamics, astronomy, and geophysics. This immersion in a
research environment is intended to complement traditional classroom experiences
of the students. Participation will help students make career choices, and will
provide specific preparation for those that continue on to graduate studies in
physics. Students will be recruited from around the country. All of the students
will live together on the Bucknell campus, conduct most of their research in on-
campus facilities, and participate in weekly departmental seminars and
colloquia. Students will have the opportunity to present their work in regional
and national conferences. Finally, it is anticipated that much of the work of
the participants will be published in peer reviewed journals and these papers
will include students as co-authors. This site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.
