In-service performance of concrete structures depends on consistent monitoring
of condition for early scheduling of repair and retrofit operations. Proper
quality control and condition monitoring procedures are either nonexistent or
not readily applicable to large concrete structures. Early detection of large
displacements and cracks in concrete elements will result in increased safety
and considerable savings in rehabilitation costs. This research will examine the
feasibility of using a novel class of fiber optic sensors for real-time
condition monitoring of concrete structures. The new embedded sensor will serve
a dual purpose by providing in-place strength estimations at early ages during
construction, and crack detection capabilities there after.
