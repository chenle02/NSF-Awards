Providing a meaningful applied statistics learning experience in a traditional
classroom setting is a dilemma faced by colleges and universities that offer
courses in manufacturing engineering or applied statistics. One of the major
challenges is in engaging all students as active learners. Another challenge of
educators in the quality control field is in getting students to think
critically about applications at a full-scale production facility. Both of these
challenges can be addressed by giving students an opportunity to participate in
projects and to ask a broad range of questions to professionals in the field.
This initiative is resulting in the creation of a new course in Statistical
Process Control (SPC) that incorporates uploading real-time quality data
directly from the factory floor of a production facility operated by an
industrial sponsor. Computers located at the sponsor site will electronically
transfer the data to a university computer laboratory in a matter of seconds.
Students will: (i) be shown how to upload current quality data from the factory
floor, (ii) complete four multi-week team projects, and (iii) make oral
presentations and submit written reports to the professors and to industry
representatives. Essentially, each student performs as a member of the quality
control team for industry. This project represents an opportunity for industry
to share their expertise and their billions of dollars in equipment investment
with academia. Since good data is a critical need of applied statistics courses,
the solution proposed offers an affordable source of real-time production data
for several applied statistics courses. In addition, this approach is highly
transportable to other institutions. The cooperative climate between industry
and academia resulting from this project is novel. It will show students how to
apply statistics to help make American industry competitive at a global level.
