Microwaves can provide the controllable, volumetric heating necessary for
producing superior, high-quality advanced composites. Effective utilization of
microwaves will require accurate modeling capabilities as a basis for hardware
and process design. The proposed research will produce the first model capable
of determining temperature and electric fields during microwave processing of
polymer matrix composites. This model will promote more effective use of
microwave heating by providing a critical evaluation tool for microwave
processing techniques. The proposed research will be divided into three parts:
1. predicting temperatures in polymer matrix composites during microwave
processing; 2. evaluating microwave applicator designs for curing thick- section
fiber-reinforced composites; 3. determining cure cycles and materials to achieve
desired temperature profiles during microwave processing.
