The University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is
providing 26 Undergraduate Science Majors, who are members of the UHD College of
Science and Technology Scholars Academy (SA), a unique new career opportunity in
Science Education. The SA was formed in 1999 to encourage and motivate more
minorities, females and first generation college students to complete STEM
degrees and pursue related careers or graduate degrees. The SA has been lauded
at the state and national levels for its successes. UHD is an urban commuter
institution that is recognized as both a Hispanic and Minority Serving
Institution. The UHD Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program involves close
cooperative efforts between the UHD Departments of Natural Science and Urban
Education, Aldine Independent School District (a minority dominant urban
district in Houston), the Harmony Academy of Science and HUNSTEM (the Houston
Urban Network for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). A minimum
of 26 SA science majors are becoming Noyce Scholars and are earning
baccalaureate degrees in a STEM discipline in addition to satisfying Texas
science teaching certification requirements. These 26 Noyce Scholars are
accepting employment as a science teacher in a Houston area high-need school.
The success of these Noyce scholarship recipients in their new careers will
ultimately result in many more minority and financially needy students being
motivated by their middle/high school science courses to pursue university
degrees and careers that are science based.
