A report on the international results from the longitudinal portion of the IEA
Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) will be prepared by an
international team of mathematics educators and other educational researchers
and will appear as Volume III in a series to be published by Pergamon Press,
London. SIMS is a cross-national study of the content of the curriculum, what is
taught and what is learned in school mathematics at two age/grade levels, Grades
8 (Population A) and 12 (Population B), in the United States and several other
countries. This investigation will examine mathematics learning ("growth")
during the course of a year of instruction and its relationship to specific
teaching practices and processes in lower secondary school mathematics
classrooms (Population A) in eight participating countries ?Belgium (Flemish),
Canada (British Columbia and Ontario), France, Japan, New Zealand, Thailand, and
the United States!. This investigation of student performance and teaching
practices, within a broader socio- cultural perspective than is possible using
only within-country data, represents a unique opportunity to inform national
policies and practices at a time of concern about the quality of American
mathematics and science education.
