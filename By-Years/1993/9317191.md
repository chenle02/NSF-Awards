9317191 Zoller This award will fund the visit by Professor Peter Zoller of the
Department of Physics at the University of Colorado to spend one month at the
University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, conducting collaborative
research with Dr. Crispin Gardiner on quantum noise problems in quantum physics.
The primary focus of the collaboration will investigate aspects of wave function
simulations of the quantum master equations using white noise methods. There
appear to be a number of potential applications in quantum optics for these
noise theories. Significant experimental effort is being expended to observe
Bose-Einstein condensation in cold atomic samples employing laser cooling and
magneto-optical traps. The detection of Bose condensation using light scattering
requires a theoretical formulation in terms of a master equation. This U.S.-New
Zealand collaboration will work on such a theory both from the point of view of
a general master equation and the wave function simulation method.
