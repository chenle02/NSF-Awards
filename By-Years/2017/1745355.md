Few questions in biology are as profound, or have persisted for as long, as the
question of how life originated. The study of life's origins has provided no
shortage of possible ways in which life may have started. However, the field has
been stuck for the last hundred years in debates over which idea is right, and
little progress has been made. By integrating views, backgrounds, and tools from
many types of scientists, the proposed Research Coordination Network will
develop new ways of looking at the origin of life that combine different
scientific perspectives. Multiple meetings and specialty workshops, will
encourage scientists from many areas of science to collaborate. This will allow
young scientists to create new views that merge ideas from outside their own
discipline. In addition to the advances in theory and experimentation that will
arise from this network there will be a massive open online course and other
outreach activities that will provide the public with a clearer view of how life
originated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Coordination Network will move
beyond debates such as which came first RNA or cellular metabolism. The project
promotes Convergence by bringing together researchers from astrobiology, the
study of artificial life, evolutionary biology, systems biology, bioinformatics,
paleobiology, chemistry, geochemistry, planetary sciences, biochemistry, and
statistical physics to explore how the pieces of the theory we have on origins
of life fit together. The approach is to move from understanding how building
blocks of life originated to understanding how the building blocks assembled
into life. The focus is shifted from the pieces to how they become organized.
The Santa Fe Institute will provide home base for a series of core meetings
along with topical working groups that will explore the rules under which life
is assembled. The steering committee of this network represents an enormous
diversity of disciplines and institutions and will look to expand that diversity
of views.
