9630358 Dooner The meiotic recombination process in maize will be further
investigated with the use of the large collection of mutants which have a defect
in the bronze (bz) gene. That gene affects seed pigmentation and is at least 100
times more recombinogenic than the average DNA segment in maize, so that many
intragenic recombinants can be generated for analysis. The meiotic recombination
process in maize will be investigated by 1) determining the continuity and
average length of conversion tracts for the bz region in a constant genetic
background, 2) determining the relationship between genetic and physical
distance outside of the bz gene, correlating it with the repetitive vs. the
unique nature of the flanking DNA and comparing it with the relationship already
determined inside of the bz locus, 3) refining the relationship between genetic
and physical distance within bz, 4) further analyzing the suppressing effect of
insertions on intragenic as well as intergenic, recombination and determine the
extant to which single base pair heterologies affect recombination and 5)
examining the fidelity of the recombination process in maize. %%% Meiotic
recombination is a fundamental genetic process and can serve to create novel
genotypes in sexually reproducing organisms. Yet, in spite of its importance,
little work has been done to elucidate the process of meiotic recombination in
plants. This work will make important contributions to that small storehouse of
knowledge in this area. ***
