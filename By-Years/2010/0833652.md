A six-week-long research workshop on Intelligent Information Systems (IIS) is
being held at Johns Hopkins University on Machine Learning for Language
Engineering. It strives for cross-fertilization with other areas of machine
intelligence. The workshop has diverse teams of professionals and students
engaged in an intensive effort to advance the state of
science.&lt;br/&gt;Language Engineering encompasses speech recognition, machine
translation, information retrieval and extraction, etc., and shares fundamental
Machine Learning techniques with other fields within IIS, most notably computer
vision, medical- and bio-informatics and social network analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the workshop is to advance machine learning for IIS and to attract
students to the field and initiate them in research by working alongside senior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;For projects to address relevant problems, an open call
for proposals was issued to the IIS community. The (35) received proposals were
evaluated at a planning meeting (attended by project proponents, government
representatives, and experts from related fields) which chose the specific
projects, their research leaders and many senior participants. The graduate
students were selected according to their known performance, the undergraduates
through a national search.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will disseminate its results
and help incorporate them into research at geographically diverse institutions.
The five past workshops resulted in 80 publications in premier journals and
conferences. Some of the work was initiated in the workshops and completed after
their conclusion. &lt;br/&gt;Individuals from several institutions are
conducting collaborative research in this workshop, discovering new techniques,
creating and disseminating valuable tools and establishing long-lasting
collaborations. Graduate as well as undergraduate students are being initiated
into the IIS field.&lt;br/&gt;
