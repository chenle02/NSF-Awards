Eight investigators from five departments of Duke University will purchase an
isothermal titration calorimeter. This instrument will provide the investigators
with access to a state-of-the-art isothermal calorimetry instrument which will
allow elucidation of the fundamental thermodynamics of molecular recognition
processes in research currently underway in the laboratories of the
investigators. Among the systems to be studied are: (1) protein - ligands and
their interactions; (2) signal peptides in lipid bilayers; (3) carbonic
anhydrase and metal affinity; (4) extracellular matrix proteins and cell
receptors; (5) membranes and macromolecular binding; (6) interactions of ATP and
other agents with DNA topoisomerase; and (7) neurotrophins in cortical neurons.
The new instrument, in conjunction with ongoing structural and biochemical
studies will permit a molecular level dissection of structure-function
relationships in these important systems.
