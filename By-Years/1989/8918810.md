This project is a study of microscopic models of incommensurate phases and phase
transitions of various types, along with development of new mathematical and
computational procedures for problems of this sort. Specific interests are: (1)
models of entropically stabilized quasicrystal phases including "realistic"
atomic models in two and threee dimensions and random tilting approximations to
these models; (2) finite size scaling analysis of incommensurate phases.
