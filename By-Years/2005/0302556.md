0302556 Willis This award to Oregon State University provides instrumentation to
significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the institution
and the research vessel Wecoma, an NSF-owned ship operated by OSU as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The award
supports acquisition of 1) two sets of ustrasonic wind sensors and displays for
R/V Wecoma, replacing existing propeller anemometers; 2) new hydraulic units for
the SeaSoar undulating towed vehicle, to improve reliability, and to allow
retention of the existing units as backups for these critical components; 3) two
new oxygen sensors for the CTD, replacing the now-obsolete units with the new,
higher precision model; 4) a backup deck modem unit for the biological sampling
system, to complete the spare parts inventory for this heavily-use instrument;
and 5) a digital barometer, to serve as backup and operating unit when the
existing unit is being calibrated. All of these are shared-use capabilities that
are available to all funded users of the R/V Wecoma, or in the case of the
SeaSoar system, users of any UNOLS vessel. These improvements will be of
substantial advantage to marine scientists during 2003 and future years. ***
