Professor Lynn Francesconi of Hunter College Chemistry Department is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for her
materials chemistry studies on the incorporation of lanthanide (Ln) ions into
polyoxometalates (POMs), early transition metal oxide anions that are widely
used in heterogeneous catalysis. Various analytical approaches, encompassing
stability constant determination, use of species-specific techniques to study
speciation (radioactivity, luminescence, and solid-state NMR) as well as routine
characterization tools, such as X-ray crystallography and solution multinuclear
NMR spectroscopy, will provide thorough understanding of the aqueous and organic
solution chemistry of Ln POMs. Understanding solution speciation chemistry of
lanthanide polyoxometalates (Ln POMs) is a prerequisite for their successful use
in applications such as homogeneous catalysis, medicine, separations, and
development of new functional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will
focus on the chemistry of new polyoxometalates (POMs)containing lanthanide ions.
Polyoxometalates are early transition metal oxide anions that are widely used in
heterogeneous catalysis. Lanthanide substitutions in polyoxometallates may
enable applications of these materials in homogeneous catalysis, medicine,
separations, and the development of new functional materials. Postdocs, graduate
students and undergraduate students will receive multifaceted training in
inorganic materials synthesis and characterization.&lt;br/&gt;
