Gravity waves (GW) are waves generated in a fluid medium or at the interface
between two media when the forces of gravity and buoyancy work against each
other trying to restore equilibrium. Wind-generated waves on the water surface
are examples of gravity waves, as are tsunamis and ocean tides. Gravity waves
are also observed in abundance in the atmosphere where air layers with different
density interact with each other and transport enormous amount of energy and
momentum over large distances. These waves are key drivers of the air general
circulation and temperature distributions through the middle and upper
atmosphere; they also affect many weather-related processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will continue studies of gravity waves at the
continental-wide scale in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica. With the wide
collaboration of several National Antarctic Programs, these waves will be
further investigated to quantify their properties, variability, momentum fluxes
and dominant sources within the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region.
This region is important to understand contributions of the MLT gravity waves to
the upper atmosphere dynamics and allow better modeling their effects. There is
a need to parameterize the GW effects while modeling climate changes and
responses to variable solar forcing (aka "space weather"), as well as for
numerical weather predictions that are of immense societal importance. The
ANGWIN workshops provide an excellent forum for the in-depth involvement of
national and international students and young researchers working together with
mid-career scientists in the collaborative research and
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
