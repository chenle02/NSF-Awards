This project deals with the study of the temperatures in ultra-precision
machining. An analytical model will be developed which generates the frictional
heating at the tool-workpiece interface due to elastic recovery and possible
flank wear. Heating at the shear zone, rake face and flank face will be coupled.
Functional dependence of the partitioning of heat and the resulting temperatures
on the process variables and tool/workpiece material combinations will be
provided. Cutting tests will be performed on ultra-precision machine tools to
provide model input data and verification. The resulting predictive capability
and insight into the governing physics will significantly increase the
understanding of the mechanics of chip formation in ultra precision machining,
tool performance and wear, and the resulting workpiece subsurface damage and
residual stress state. This will lead the way to improved accuracy and quality
of the machined workpiece, in the ultra precision machining process.
