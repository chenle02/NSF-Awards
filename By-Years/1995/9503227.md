9503227 Yarmush This project is on research to study the use of hydrostatic
pressure as a mild and effective means of dissociating antigen-antibody
complexes, thus providing a rational basis for the design of strategies which
utilize this pressure sensitivity in separation and/or sensing applications. The
proposed studies include three aspects: (1) fundamental solution-phase
thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the pressure-induced phenomena for
a panel of antibodies using high pressure fluorescence spectroscopy; (2) protein
engineering studies directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating
pressure effects; and (3) thermodynamic, kinetic and pressure cycling studies
with immobilized antibodies to develop operational strategies for practical
pressure elution on a large scale. In addition to providing the rational
framework for the development of strategies for engineering and utilizing
pressure sensitive antibodies, this research could also result in advances in
the fundamental understanding of pressure effects on protein structure and
function. ***
