This collaborative research between Florida State University and Cornell
University is to identify language-action features from text-based messages that
can be used to dynamically infer a social actor's perceived trustworthiness. The
team will investigate using optimal analysis techniques to calibrate
trustworthiness reasoning, which can be used to computationally model actors'
deceptive behaviors in cyber space and to infer actors' intent based on their
words and actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have a transformative
impact in understanding the dynamics of trusting relationships through observing
language-action features and psychosocial trustworthiness attribution
mechanisms. This study serves as a precursor to a socio-technical schema that
will facilitate national security and data protection for the general populace
while also protecting the individual's right to privacy. This study will
contribute to the science of cyber-security, and will help the cyber-security
community to understand and enable trustworthy communication and collaborative
information behavior among computer-mediated groups in a systematic way.
