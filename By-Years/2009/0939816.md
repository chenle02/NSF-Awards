This project will investigate plasma structuring on an intermediate spatial
scale along the edges of mid-latitude ionosphere disturbances known as storm
enhanced density (SED) using data-assimilative models. Although this topic has
received attention only recently (relative to high- and low-latitude phenomena),
improved understanding of SED generation and development is important for
improving space-based communication and navigation capabilities. The project
will use numerical models (IDA4D and EMPIRE) in order to study the spatial
structuring of SEDs along with their physical drivers. Auxiliary data sets --
such as field-aligned plasma velocities measured by the Millstone Hill
incoherent scatter radar, DMSP satellite data, estimated drift speeds from the
Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) model, and total
electron content measurements from GPS -- will also be used for cross-comparison
with the model results.
