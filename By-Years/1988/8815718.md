The overall long term goal of this project is to understand the structure and
function of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP). It is one of the more thoroughly
studied heme enzymes and the X-ray structure of the native protein, as well as
its reactive intermediate, compound I, are known at high resolution. CCP offers
an ideal system for the study of electron transport between hemeproteins and the
activation of oxygen-oxygen bonds. Many of the components contributing to
electron transport and energy transduction processes are heme-containing
enzymes, usually multi-component, complex membrane-bound assemblies which are
exceedingly difficult to study. The advantage of CCP is its relatively small
size and ready crystallizability. Although many lines of investigation are made
possible by the availbility of the combined techniques of site-directed
mutagenesis and single crystal X-ray diffraction, Dr. Kraut's past work and that
proposed now may be described as two separate but ultimately convergent
experimental paths.***//
