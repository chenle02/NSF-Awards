This project allows Western Kentucky University, Department of Chemistry, to
improve its organic laboratory program. The first stage in this process is the
implementation of a microscale organic program which has been funded by the
University. The next step is the acquisition of the required analytical
equipment. Specifically, infrared spectrometers and gas chromatographs for
product purification and identification. These instruments enhance the range and
scope of experiments and allow for the creation of a new advanced-level
laboratory course. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
