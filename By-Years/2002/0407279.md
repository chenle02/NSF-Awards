This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the University of
Connecticut supports a multidisciplinary team, Professors Faquir Jain, John
Ayers, R. Magnusson, and Rajeev Bansal, Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, and F. Papadimitrakopoulos, Institute of Materials Science, and B.
Sinkovic, Department of Physics, for their work to prepare Engineering and
Science majors for a future role in industries impacted by nanotechnology. This
will be accomplished through the following steps: (1) develop teaching modules
to introduce basic nanoscience and nanotechnology (NSNT) concepts in an existing
core of four lower division (Freshmen and Sophomore) courses, (2) develop
teaching modules for strengthening nanostructures concepts in four existing Core
Courses and four Professional Elective (PE/PR) upper division (Junior and
Senior) courses, (3) create two new team-taught upper division NSNT courses, and
(4) provide Senior Design experience in Nanotechnology. The teaching modules,
new NSNT course material (including dedicated software), and laboratory training
will be available to institutions participating in Connecticut Microelectronics
and Optoelectronics Consortium (CMOC) [Trinity College, Yale University,
Southern Connecticut State University, and U. Bridgeport and 18 industrial
members], and also to research collaborators, Prof. W. Huang (Electrical
Engineering Dept., US Military Academy, West Point, NY) and Prof. S. K. Islam
(Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to
the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) announcement, NS 03-044,
category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport
Systems (CTS), Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Materials
Research, the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physcial Sciences (MPS), and the Diectorate for Computer and
Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE)
