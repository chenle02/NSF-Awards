9400961 Sengupta The project involves an investigation of several mathematical
problems arising from gauge theory (or Yang Mills theory) on compact surfaces.
The first project is to construct a certain measure on an infinite dimensional
non-linear space (of certain geometric objects which represent the physical
concept of gauge fields); the next objective is to solve a number of concrete
problems related to this measure. Some of these questions involve the "moduli
space of flat connections", a space whose structure has been of interest in
mathematics from other points of view and has involved deep questions. Gauge
theories are used to describe the interactions of the fundamental constituents
of matter. While these theories arise in physics, they involve many elegant and
deep geometric ideas in mathematics. When combined with quantum field theory to
obtain a more realistic description of nature, gauge theories give rise to more
complex mathematical questions. Such questions are of intrinsic mathematical
value even in situations where there is no immediate physical significance of
the question. The present proposal addresses mathematical problems of this
nature. The problems involve ideas from a variety of mathematical disciplines,
including topology, geometry and probability theory. ***
