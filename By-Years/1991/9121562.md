In many coastal species, a critical platonic larval stage is spent in the
waters of the inner continental shelf, the most shoreward few kilometers of the
shelf where depths are typically less than 30 m. Our knowledge of the parameters
of the shelf where these planktonic larvae live is meager. Physical processes
which strongly influence the biology, such as sediment transport and the
stratification and circulation of inner shelf waters, are poorly understood. A
major goal of this study is to obtain synoptic, moored, long-term measurements
of biological, physical and sediment transport parameters at the same time and
space scales. The field program is aimed at gaining insight into the processes
that may control the successful dispersal and settlement of planktonic larvae of
organisms living in near-shore sandy sediments. The study is designed so that
critical disciplinary, as well as interdisciplinary questions can be addressed.
The basic hypothesis guiding the research is that planktonic larvae of organisms
living in the intertidal zone (or in very shallow water) exploit the circulation
of the inner shelf to control their cross- shelf transport.
