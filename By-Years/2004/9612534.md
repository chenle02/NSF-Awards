Romero 9612534 One of the defining features of life is the interaction of an
organism with its environment. Unfortunately, not all such interactions are
benign and the effects of noxious or stressful stimuli must somehow be
ameliorated in order for an organism to survive. Vertebrates react to noxious
stimuli with a suite of behavioral and hormonal responses, collectively called
the stress response. The stress response is crucial for survival since even
mildly noxious stimuli can cause death in animals unable to respond.
Unfortunately, long-term exposure to stress can lead to a multitude of
deleterious effects, including brain cell death. Presumably, a balance must be
struck between needing a stress response to survive a noxious stimuli and
controlling that stress response to prevent deleterious effects. Recent studies
by Dr. Romero have suggested that some species seasonally control stress
responses. The present studies are investigating the novel mechanisms by which
this unique seasonal regulation of the behavioral and hormonal components of the
stress response occurs. These studies are making important new contributions to
our understanding of the basic neuroendocrine regulation of the stress response.
In addition, the studies will provide significant new insights into the
physiological strategies employed by species in the wild to grow, prosper and
reproduce.
