Proposal: DMS-0072342

PI: Greg Kuperberg

The purpose of the project is to study the properties and applications of
quantum groups, the Yang-Baxter equation, graph homology, and similar
constructions in algebra with geometric formalism. In particular the role of
these constructions will be considered in two areas: In 3-dimensional topology,
they arise in the guise of of perturbative and non-perturbative invariants of
Chern-Simons field theory. There is a good chance that such invariants are
related to the Thurston Geometrization Program, at least for hyperbolic
manifolds. In quantum computation, the same non-perturbative Chern-Simons field
theory produces an interesting method for fault tolerance, one which needs to be
developed further.

The purpose of the project is to develop and apply certain areas of algebra in
which formulas have a geometric structure. Two famous examples of this are a
linear algebra, in which matrices have some geometry, and Feynman diagrams,
whose geometry is physically meaningful. Geometrization of algebraic formulas
has been influential in enumerative combinatorics, in non-commutative algebra,
and in geometric topology in the last 15 years. One of the first and most
important representatives of this recent trend is the Jones polynomial, an
invariant of knots. Although the Jones polynomial arose in algebra and
mathematical, it and its generalization are at least as important in topology,
and recently also in quantum computation. These applications of the new trend in
algebra will be investigated.
