Wireless communication has become an intrinsic part of modern implantable
medical devices (IMDs). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that wireless
connectivity can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality of IMDs'
transmitted data or to send unauthorized commands to IMDs. The key challenge in
addressing these attacks stems from the difficulty of modifying or replacing
already-implanted IMD. This research explores the feasibility of protecting an
implantable device from such attacks without modifying the device itself. It
develops a solution that delegates the security of an IMD to a personal base
station called the shield. The shield introduces a novel radio design that
allows it to jam the IMD's messages, preventing others from decoding them while
being able to decode them itself. It can also jam unauthorized commands --even
those that try to alter the shield's own transmissions.

The research delivers a novel full-duplex radio design that, in contrast to past
work, has no requirements on antenna separation and hence can be built into a
wearable device. It also delivers the first non-invasive security mechanism for
securing IMDs? communications without modifying them. Finally, it increases the
resilience of wireless medical devices to jamming attacks, bad channel
conditions, and interference.

By enabling medical devices to leverage wireless communication without incurring
security risks, the research can improve the quality of life for patients and
reduce the cost of healthcare systems. The broader impact plan also includes
academic publications, integration in educational programs, and working with the
medical device industry.
