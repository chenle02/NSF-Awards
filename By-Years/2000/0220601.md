&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0220601&lt;br/&gt;PI: Judith L.
Gersting&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Hawaii at Hilo&lt;br/&gt;Title:
ALOHA - A Learning Opportunity for High
Achievers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CSEMS program provides support
for a cohort of 15 students for 4 years to complete the Bachelor of Science
degree in Computer Science. Three target population groups have been identified,
with the intent to secure, as much as possible, an equitable representation of
students from each group: traditional high school graduates, community college
transfer students, and students from U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, including
U.S. territories of American Samoa and Guam, the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Commonwealth of the
Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI), and the Republic of Palau
(Belau).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are selected based not only on academic
ability and financial need, but also on their understanding of the rigors of the
degree requirements. Student support services for the first two years include
both academic and social support structures in an attempt to improve retention.
These services concentrate on mentoring and providing supplemental instruction.
The following two years include an emphasis on skills and opportunities to
transition to a high technology workforce, and exposure to career opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program builds on existing strengths such as the
quality of the computer science degree program, a caring faculty, a high sense
of identity among computer science majors, and support services and activities
designed to broaden the path to graduation for students. Consistent with the
program guidelines, academically talented but financially disadvantaged students
are identified, challenged, supported, and guided through completion of the
degree and on into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
