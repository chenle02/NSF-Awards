ABSTRACT Nazarov Nazarov will investigate exponential polynomials and lacunary
series and on weighted norm inequalities. The objectives of the proposed
research are: 1) to get a complete version of the Turan Lemma, 2) to investigate
the distribution of values of trigonometric polynomials with random spectra, 3)
to complete the theory of weighted norm inequalities for singular integral
operators with one matrix weight and 4)to start an attack on the scalar two-
weight case. The problems described in this proposal are of fundamental
character and have numerous connections to other fields some of which in their
turn have a direct impact on science and technology. For example, fast computing
and data compression based on wavelets. The idea of the wavelet compression is
strikingly simple: you just take the wavelet expansion of your image and drop
all small terms, memorizing only several "large" ones. The problem is that you
should be sure that the large terms are really few and that the small terms
together cannot add up to something huge. The formal requirement (which is more
or less just the above phrase translated into mathematical language) is that the
system of wavelets should form a basis in a certain function space.
