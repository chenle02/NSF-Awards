The distribution of ordinary ("baryonic") matter, in the form of gas and dust
grains, in the extended halos of galaxies has been largely unconstrained in
recent decades, and thus subject to considerable debate. This matter is expected
to carry signatures of key processes in galaxy evolution. But very recently, the
Principal Investigator and collaborators have demonstrated that statistical
reddening measurements can dramatically increase the sensitivity with which
reddening effects by dust grains can be detected, and can be used to map out the
presence of dust on scales ranging from roughly 20 kiloparsecs to several
megaparsecs. This opens a new avenue for exploring the distribution of baryons
around galaxies and understanding the enrichment of the intergalactic medium. In
this project, the proposing team will extend their existing techniques in order
to probe the distribution of dust around galaxies of different types,
luminosities, redshifts, and environments. The planned improvements will provide
unique information on feedback processes and galaxy evolution, and will provide
new constraints on the opacity of the Universe as a function of redshift. They
will also apply their techniques to the statistical detection of extremely weak
absorption lines. The goal is to reveal the large-scale distribution of heavy
elements in the gas phase, probing the physics of galaxy formation and its
related feedback processes. The project will contribute to workforce development
by supporting a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. The Principal
Investigator, postdoc, and student will continue development of the STOMP
library: a generic, public platform for doing fast spatial statistics using tens
of millions of points. Results understandable to non-specialists will be
incorporated in classroom lectures. In collaboration with the Johns Hopkins
Center for Educational Outreach, the Principal Investigator will also give
public talks in high schools of the Baltimore area.
