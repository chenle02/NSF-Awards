9604967 Barrett Under this cooperative research project, Dr. Bruce R. Barrett
of the University of Arizona and Dr. Serdar Kuyucak of the Research School of
Physical Sciences, Australian National University (ANU), Canberra, Australia,
will investigate the M1 properties of rare-earth nuclei within the proton-
neutron Interacting Boson Model for even-even nuclei and the proton-neutron
Interacting Boson-Fermion Model for odd-A nuclei utilizing the 1/N boson-
expansion technique. The research groups at the University of Arizona and the
ANU will be significantly aided in their studies by close interaction with the
nuclear experimental research group at ANU.
