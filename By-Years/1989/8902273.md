A number of related problems arising in the mathematical theory of several
complex variables will be addressed in this project. They are concerned
primarily with the theory of analytic functions of several variables and the
domains on which the functions are defined. The first question concerns curves
in two complex dimensions on which restrictions of holomorphic functions can be
expressed as a sum of two functions of a single variable. The requirement for
this is that the two coordinates projections of the curve have multiplicity
equal to one. Work will be done in determining what the form of the function can
be if the multiplicities are known but are not equal. A second line of
investigation will consider the higher dimensional form of a famous theorem of
Carleman which relates the quadratic norm of the derivative of a holomorphic
function with the integral of (the modulus of) the derivative along the boundary
of a domain. This result is the general isoperimetric inequality which allows
for multiple coverings of the domain. A first step in this direction will be to
consider n-sheeted covers of a disk with boundary which has finite linear
measure. An interesting by-product of such a result would be to prove that such
covers have finite measure, a fact which is not yet established. A continuing
investigation will also be carried out on the structure of polynomial hulls in
two complex variables. The polynomial hull of any compact set is the largest set
to which all polynomials can be extended without increase in uniform norm. Hulls
are easy to describe in one complex dimension and almost impossible to visualize
in several. If the compact set lies over a disk in the first variable, and the
fibers are convex, then the hull can be described precisely. The current work
will seek to analyze the hulls when the fibers are no longer connected, for
example when then are the join of two disjoint Jordan curves. Some form of two-
sheeted cover of the disk is the anticipated result.
