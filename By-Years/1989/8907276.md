Professor Kriete will investigate four problems in which operator theory and
function theory interact in a fruitful way. The first of these is to determine
completely the invariant subspace lattice of a particular cyclic subnormal
operator related to the Cesaro operator. The second concerns composition
operators acting on Bergman spaces. The third is a classical question in
weighted polynomial approximation which is of interest in the study of subnormal
operators. The last is about the extremal behavior of the norms in the de
Branges - Rovnyak functional model for contraction operators. The research
envisioned here is about analytic functions, a central preoccupation of
mathematics for well over a century. They can be defined variously as solutions
of a certain simple system of partial differential equations, as maps which take
planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves angles except at
isolated singularities, or as limits of polynomials in a suitably precise sense.
Corresponding to the diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be
studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this project is operator-
theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of functions by taking polynomials and
their limits in a particular fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that
arise naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by composition.
Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often turn out to be quite
general in operator theory, so by studying the functions one can learn a great
deal about operators in the abstract. Professor Kriete's project is to travel
this two-way street in both directions.
