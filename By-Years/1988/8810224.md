There has been a significant growth in recent years in the field of adsorption
science and technology. An increasing number of new adsorbents and adsorption
processes are being developed and commercialized. Japan has been very active in
the field, and has some unique developments which are only vaguely known to
other countries including the U.S. An example for the unique Japanese
developments is the activated carbon membrane which has the high surface area
like activated carbon but shaped as hollow fibers. This funding is provided as
partial support for the American academic participants to attend a tri-lateral
workshop to discuss these developments. An understanding of the developments in
Japan and China will stimulate further growth in the field in the U.S. and
provide a better competitive edge for the U.S. in chemical and biochemical
technologies where separation/purification is a critical part.
