This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the study of fundamentals of reactive collisions and soft-
landing of polyatomic ions at surfaces. Professor Cooks and his students at
Purdue University will contrast soft-landed ions at self-assembled monolayers
with landing into vacuum-compatible liquid films. The functional groups
available for reaction with impinging polyatomic ions at both of these surfaces
will be varied to control the properties of the reaction products produced by
these collisions. New multi-quadrupole instrumentation will be built and used in
conjunction with existing multi-sector mass spectrometry instrumentation in
pursuing this work. This project will provide a strong educational experience
for students in the areas of mass spectrometry and surface science. The nature
of chemical reactions that occur at surfaces involving projected polyatomic ion
reactants remains poorly understood. Professor Cooks and his students at Purdue
University will study the chemical reactions occurring between these polyatomic
ions and a range of surfaces that exhibit diverse chemical properties. The long-
term objective of this work is to develop new methods for the characterization
of chemical reactions that occur at surfaces and to produce surfaces that have
desired chemical features. The results of this work will have technological
value in applications that depend on having surfaces with controlled chemical
and physical properties.
