This award will continue research in experimental gravitation and low-energy
elementary particle physics by Professor Adelberger's group. Sensitive searches
for new macroscopic interactions will be carried out. The University of
Washington team will probe interactions with ranges greater than 3 cm by looking
for apparent violations of the weak equivalence principle. They will develop two
torsion balance instruments for this purpose: -- a continuously rotating balance
used in conjunction with a fixed topographic source. This device will be
optimized for interactions with ranges from infinity down to 1m. -- a stationary
balance used in conjunction with a continuously rotating 3 ton uranium source
optimized for interactions with ranges between 0.03m and 10m. By placing
unpolarized test bodies in these instruments they plan a 10-fold improvement in
constraints on macroscopic scalar or vector interactions. They will also develop
a novel spin-polarized pendulum to search for parity and time-reversal violating
monopole-dipole interactions.
