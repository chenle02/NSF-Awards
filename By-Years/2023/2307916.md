Planets are made from dust, gas, and ice in disks around young stars. Disk
observations offer insight into why planet properties vary, and ultimately how
places like the Solar System might develop. Planet formation models have been
heavily shaped by the nearby, isolated disks that could be most readily
observed. To explore variations in planet formation conditions, the program will
use radio telescopes to analyze the structure and chemistry of disks in
environments that have been characterized in less detail. The investigator will
train a graduate and an undergraduate student. She will also mentor
underrepresented public high school students as part of Columbia University's
Engineering the Next Generation program.

This program will conduct sensitive observational studies of protoplanetary
disks under conditions that have traditionally been challenging to characterize
in order to provide a better understanding of how the circumstances of planet
formation might deviate from those of the best-studied systems. Molecular line
and dust continuum images from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array
will be used to compare the chemical properties of disks undergoing late infall
of cloud/envelope material to previous observations of isolated disks, re-
evaluate the evolutionary classification of an apparently young, embedded disk
exhibiting evidence of planet-disk interactions, and search for disk
substructures in a highly irradiated star-forming region to assess whether
planet-disk interactions occur in a manner similar to nearby, less-irradiated
regions. The investigator will also use widefield CO mapping with the Green Bank
Telescope to characterize the mass and distribution of the large-scale gas
reservoir available to a disk undergoing late infall.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
