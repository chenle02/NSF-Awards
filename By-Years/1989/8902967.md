Dr. McLaughlin will develop algorithms for inverse nodal problems in two
dimensions. In this new class of inverse problems the data is nodal positions,
or zeroes of eigenfunctions, and the solutions are coefficients in differential
operators. One dimensional inverse nodal problems for second order operators
have been carefully studied using asymptotic forms for eigenvalues and
asymptotic forms for nodal positions. In two dimensions the algorithm will be
based on formulas which have been derived using variational principles.
Interactive activities include teaching an advanced undergraduate or first year
graduate level course on inverse spectral theory for bounded domains,
encouraging and advising women mathematics students, and sponsoring a seminar
presentation by a visiting woman mathematician. This project furthers VPW
program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF
and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by
providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
