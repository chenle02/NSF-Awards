From a structural standpoint, tRNA's are an important class of molecules. They
were the first naturally occurring nucleic acids to be sequenced and to yield to
crystallographic analysis, and they contain many features common to nucleic acid
structure. Biologically, they stand at the center of the machinery for
translating the genetic code into protein sequences and they interact with a
large number of other macromolecules. A deeper understanding of the principles
that determine tRNA structure, dynamics and interactions is an important goal.
Dr. Harvey will continue the development of computer-based models for transfer
RNA and the use of these models to examine a number of questions about tRNA
structure, dynamics and interactions with other molecules.
