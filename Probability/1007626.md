This project studies random spatial systems, such as percolation or the Ising
model of ferromagnetism. These models all exhibit the statistical physics
phenomenon of a phase transition, their macroscopic behavior changing
drastically as one parameter varies: there is a sharp transition for a
particular critical value of this parameter. At the critical point exactly,
random macroscopic - most often fractal - geometries arise, and in two
dimensions these geometries are widely believed to possess a strong property of
conformal invariance. The mathematical understanding of these models has
considerably improved over the last ten years following breakthroughs of Lawler,
Schramm, Smirnov and Werner, in particular thanks to the conformally invariant
Schramm-Loewner-Evolution process of stochastic growth in the plane. This
project addresses questions related to the behavior of these models at and near
criticality, as well as related "self-critical" systems - forest-fire models for
instance - where a phase transition intrisically appears without any fine-tuning
of a parameter. The area of probability theory studied here overlaps
combinatorics and complex analysis, and it also uses ideas and techniques from
statistical mechanics.

Random shapes, such as rough interfaces created by welding two metals, or
irregular sea coasts fashioned by erosion, are omnipresent in nature. These
shapes usually display a fractal behavior, and an increasingly important part of
probability theory is devoted to studying such models where spatial randomness
plays a central role. This leads to deep and fascinating mathematical questions,
in particular surprising "universality" properties arise: for instance, similar
shapes appear in situations that are, at first sight, completely unrelated,
based on totally different physical, chemical or biological mechanisms. A better
mathematical understanding of simplified models would provide new insight on
more complex models used in applications.
