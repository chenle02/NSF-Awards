9713424 Gruner The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) operated by
Cornell University since 1978, is a national user facility that provides high
energy X-ray synchrotron radiation services to the scientific community.
Experimental studies carried out at CHESS impact the scientific fields of
condensed matter physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, biology,
and geology. Integral parts of the CHESS program are MacCHESS, the NIH-funded
macromolecular resource, and the NSF-based National Facility for High Pressure
Research. The program at CHESS is designed to enhance the national science
infrastructure by taking advantage of unique aspects of the CHESS environment to
provide research capabilities not available at other synchrotron x-ray sources.

CHESS is a user oriented facility which accepts proposals from all qualified
investigators on a comptetive basis. In addition to providing operating costs,
this project supports the development of synchrotron radiation facilities using
high power photon levels provided by the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR).
At present, more than 500 individuals per year from universities, industries,
and national laboratories, conduct research on the public experimental stations
provided by CHESS.

Under this award CHESS staff will continue to operate CHESS to build on current
user programs. These programs include enhancing existing capability, providing
new user capabilities in materials and biological sciences, the development of
advanced instrumentation, and the integration of research and education through
the training of students. %%% ***
