0426116&lt;br/&gt;Schmidt, Longcore, Martin&lt;br/&gt; Despite the importance of
and threats to alpine areas, little is known about the diversity of microscopic
creatures that inhabit these systems. Preliminary studies using DNA probes
revealed an astonishing diversity of previously unknown fungi in alpine soils of
Colorado. Especially surprising was the discovery of several large and never-
before described groups of fungi. In this project by Colorado and Maine
investigators Steven Schmidt, Andrew Martin, and Joyce Longcore, soil fungi from
diverse alpine sites in Peru, New Zealand and Western North America will be
studied. The investigators will use new DNA-based methods to study the
distribution of these organisms in nature. Simultaneously with this effort they
will implement a large-scale effort to bring many of these previously unknown
organisms into laboratory culture. Having these organisms in culture will allow
the researchers to describe previously unknown fungal species, link their
findings to traditional taxonomy, and screen these organisms for potential
biotechnological applications. Isolated organisms, photographs, genomic DNA, and
ribosomal DNA sequences will be archived in a public museum (American Museum of
Natural History) and in appropriate databases. In addition, an interactive Web-
based museum will be established at University of Colorado, providing access to
all the data and links to descriptions of the research sites. &lt;br/&gt;There
is a sense of urgency about studying the biodiversity of alpine environments
because they are among the world's most threatened ecosystems due to
environmental change, including global warming. In fact, alpine snowfields and
glaciers are presently melting at unprecedented rates. The research will involve
scientists and technicians in three countries. Training will be provided for a
graduate student at the University of Maine and a minority graduate student and
a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Colorado (CU). In addition, the
proposed research will dovetail with existing Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) programs at CU and with an ongoing K-12 education program
by providing opportunities for students and teachers to become involved in the
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
