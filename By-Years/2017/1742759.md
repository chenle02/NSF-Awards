The goal of the project is to explore a non-conventional cementation technique
using highly ductile and durable double-network materials, namely "D3 cement."
This research mainly addresses two challenging issues - brittleness and non-
durability - with current chemically or biologically cemented soil.
Specifically, many mineral precipitation-treated soils can be stiff, but break
easily at low strains. Hydrogel-treated bio-cemented soil has been found more
ductile upon drying, but loses its strength when exposed to water, as the large
volume expansion of the water-absorbing hydrophilic polymer network breaks the
bonding between the soil particles. The D3 cement has broad potential
applications in geotechnical, civil, environmental and petroleum fields,
including dust control, infrastructure construction, and liquefaction
mitigation, with potentially millions of dollars of cost savings. This research
will also create a large data set rich in new knowledge on fundamental bio-
inorganic-organic-soil interface interactions, and the relationship with their
mechanical properties (strength, stiffness, ductility). Diverse education and
outreach activities will promote K-12 and public education and Cross-
disciplinary Graduate Workshop for the teams from the PI's Materials Lab and the
collaborator's Biogeotech Lab.

In this cross-disciplinary project, the objective is to overcome the limitations
of fracture at low strains and non-durability by developing a novel cement that
is 1) ductile and stiff and 2) less susceptible to water-induced soil strength
loss, by uniquely extending concepts of material science to bio-cementation. The
approach is to design and develop a hybrid cementing materials which can
simultaneously form an organic-and-inorganic, interpenetrating double network in
the soil and strongly bind the soil particles, possessing novel self-healing
ability via organic-inorganic-soil reformable bonding. The performance of the
new composite material will be examined with controls over the material
composition, morphology, and hierarchical structures. This research, if
successful, will yield a high-performance bio-based geological material. The
work will be done in collaboration with researchers at the NSF-funded Center for
Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics at Arizona State University.
