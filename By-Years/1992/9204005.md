Ji will investigate noncommutative differential geometry on operator algebras
associated with discrete groups, C*-dynamical systems, and strict deformation
quantization of a cotangent space of a smooth manifold. Central to this study is
the construction of smooth and dense subalgebras of the corresponding
C*-algebras. Completion of the projects will enable Ji to elucidate certain deep
properties of operator algebras, such as a partial solution to the generalized
Kadison conjecture, a further understanding of the noncommutative Toeplitz index
theory, and a new birth of certain noncommutative manifolds. The general area of
mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert
space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of
complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together in an
algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have a
surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in knot
theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and
they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming
increasingly important in physics.
