Despite general acceptance of the monophyly of the monocotyledons, there are
still questions that remain regarding relationships among the primary lines of
evolution. We propose to bring together evidence from morphology and molecular
sequences of rDNA to address this problem. This, in turn, would provide the
appropriate context in which to study genome size, a feature that shows
interesting patterns of variation in this group and closely related
"dicotyledons". Phenotypic and ecological correlates of genome size can then be
evaluated within this phylogenetic context and their evolutionary significance
assessed. Funds are being sought for sequencing of rDNA and measurement of
genome size using flow cytometry.
