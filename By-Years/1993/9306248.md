The ecological study of how populations are regulated in their numbers and
abundance has moved from single-factor investigations to more complex analyses
of multiple factors. Plants and their insect herbivores present a favorable
system for experimental manipulation in order to tease apart these multiply
interacting factors. Dr. Harrison in a planning grant is studying the western
tussock moth that feeds upon lupines across a 1000 km north-south transect.
Competition for lupine herbage as well as predation by ants and other insect
predators upon the moth larvae are being studied through experimental enclosures
and other manipulations. Parasitism and insect dispersal are also being
monitored in order to construct an abstract model of population regulation, with
identification of differing control points along the north-south climatic
gradient. %%% The complexity of ecological factors affecting the numbers and
abundance of organisms makes experimental manipulations challenging but
necessary. Dr. Harrison in a research planning grant is beginning an ambitious
investigation of the western tussock moth that feeds on native lupines in
coastal California, along with the ant and other insect predators of the moth,
along a 1000 km north- south transect. One goal is to identify controlling
factors in the population regulation of moths that are likely to differ in
different parts of its latitudinal range.
