This Leadership Activities project, centered at both Portland State University
and Oregon State University, will provide professional development and
programmatic leadership expertise to 60 "leader teacher" in the upper
Northwestern United States. An additional 60 "impact teachers" will participate
in a 3 week summer program to enhance both their mathematics backgrounds and
teaching skills. The leader teachers will also provide in-service education
programs in their local area for all mathematics teachers. A set of demonstation
videotapes will be produced for dissemination beyond the schools involved in the
project. Extensive follow-up by project staff will do much to insure high
quality implementation and in-service efforts. A conference meeting in 1987-88
will serve to evaluate the impact of the project and provide the opportunity for
determining the continuing activities necessary for quality mathematics
education in the schools. The "leader teachers" have already participated in an
Honors Workshops for mathematics teachers as part of a former NSF project
developed by the Principal Investigators. In addition to conducting a need
assessment in their districts, these teachers will identify the "impact
teachers" with whom they are going to work both in the summer program and in
their schools. The leader teachers will participate in a one- week intensive
workshop, prior to that for the impact teachers, in which they will develop
plans for their in-service and programmatic leadership activities during
following year. Consultants as well as program staff will provide expertise and
assistance in these endeavors. An extensive evaluation plan to measure
effectiveness of the program for both teachers and students has been developed.
