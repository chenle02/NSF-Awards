The lack of empirical data describing the cost of precision in manufacturing
processes is restricting the development of cost driven computer-based
engineering design tools for such tasks as: tolerance analysis, process
planning, tool design and manufacturability evaluations. The objective of this
study is to evaluate the applicability of existing manufacturing data to the
determination of empirical relations for the relative cost of produced
tolerances. This initial study will examine a limited number of machining
processes. A cooperative research effort with United States manufacturers will
provide actual production data. The cost of precision is the result of many
simultaneous factors, including: process, size, shape material, tooling, amount
of perform, etc. The question to be resolved is whether a factorial design may
be implemented successfully to isolate the effects of each factor and determine
a quantitative representation. Relative cost will be determined from time
studies and charge rates. The resulting cost versus tolerance functions will be
plotted for discrete sizes of parts for each process, with additional
multiplicative factors for the effects of material, shape, etc.
