This creative project pairs grandparents or other senior citizens with children
in grades K-7 for an intergenerational hands-on SMT program. The OASIS
institute, which has a large national membership of adults 55 and older with
centers based in 25 cities across the US, is the source of adults. Twenty
intergenerational modules will be developed which address the learning styles of
both children and older adults, half of which will be linked with the NSF-funded
"Find Out Why" materials. Master training sessions will be conducted for OASIS
trainers, who would then train volunteers at their local centers. Anticipated
outcomes include increased knowledge of standards-based SMT concepts, enhanced
problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how science, math and
technology apply to everyday life. In addition to the modules, the program would
also result in the creation of a supplementary guide for volunteers, materials
kits and a comprehensive training program. It is anticipated that this exciting
program will be piloted in the following nine states: MO, IN, OR, MD, AZ, TX,
CA, IL and OH. Over 100,000 individuals will be impacted during the three years
of the project.
