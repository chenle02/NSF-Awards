Physics(13) With previous support from NSF's Major Research Instrumentation
award program, Agnes Scott College, in collaboration with the Georgia Tech
Research Institute, developed and built an eye-safe atmospheric laser radar
(LIDAR) instrument that has been used by ASC undergraduates and faculty for
research. Boundary layer aerosols, man-made plumes and contrails, tropospheric
transport of smoke and dust, cloud physics and climatology, and stratospheric
aerosol layer composition before and after a volcanic eruption are being studied
by ASC students and faculty. With the present CCLI award, these individuals are
making the device more "user friendly" and developing web-based curricular
modules that enable its use across a broad spectrum of undergraduate physics and
astronomy classes. The project is also developing an operator's manual for the
instrument, refining MatLab-based software tools for data analysis, and
developing an atmospheric measurements handbook. The assessment component of the
project is focusing on best practices in attracting and retaining women in
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
