0303660&lt;br/&gt;Maher&lt;br/&gt;This award supports mainly junior faculty and
students from US universities to participate in a workshop on learning and
teaching mathematics in collaboration at the University of Oslo in Norway in
2003. The purpose of the workshop is to plan and organize future research in
mathematic education by bringing together potential collaborators from Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, and the US. The US participants will come from Brigham Young
University, North Carolina State University, the University of Hawaii, the
University of Delaware, and Rutgers. The foreign researchers will come from the
University of Oslo, Arhus University (Denmark), Teacher Training College
(Denmark), and the Universities of Lulea, Kristianstad, and Lund (Sweden). The
common research goal of the participants is to design and implement
collaborative, cross-cultural research aimed at articulating mechanisms through
which educators can develop methods of instruction that take into account the
learners' thinking. The participants will gain from the variety of perspectives
by building mutual awareness of important differences, thereby making the most
of alternate approaches, distinct traditions, and different educational
designs.&lt;br/&gt;
