The research focusses on understanding the composition and morphology of natural
materials and using these findings in designing and selecting man made
materials. Since natural materials have developed efficiency through evolution,
the results from the work should lead to development of efficient
microstructural designs for man-made materials. Novel materials will be
fabricated and studies at micro- and macro scales. Micro-mechanical models will
be formulated to describe the performance of these materials.
