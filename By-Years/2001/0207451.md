Shu 0207451 The investigator and his colleague study high-order-accuracy
computational methods for linear and nonlinear waves, with emphasis on shock
wave calculations and simulation of electro-magnetics waves. The work includes
the development and analysis of high-order finite difference, finite element,
and spectral methods, as well as applications of these methods to computational
fluid dynamics and computational electro-magnetics. In particular, the efforts
include the following components: high-order methods for shock wave
calculations, including finite difference WENO schemes, spectral methods for
supersonic reactive flows, and finite element discontinuous Galerkin methods;
high-order methods for Maxwell's equations; and perfectly matched absorbing
layers. Computers are now used more extensively in engineering and other applied
sciences. An important component to effectively use computers is the design and
analysis of efficient numerical algorithms. Important applications such as
computer-aided design of aircraft are to a large extent dependent on efficient
and reliable algorithms designed by applied mathematicians. The high-order
methods the investigators develop and analyze in this project should
significantly increase the efficiency and reliability of algorithms used in
crucial application areas such as aerospace industry, communications, and
material science.
