The PI proposes two areas of research continuation and initiation. These areas
are (1) mantle heterogeneity as the driving force of Mesozoic and Cenozoic plate
motions, and (2) theory and experimentation on mantle plumes and hotspots. The
PI intends to model recent earth evolution as a dynamical process in
understanding plate motions, as well as using the Galapagos Islands as a natural
experiment to study mixing between MORB (ridge) and OIB (hotspot) geochemical
sources. In addition, a laboratory for geodynamics will be established at the
University of California, Berkeley.
