9405261 Nicholson The tectonic evolution of the Pacific-North America plate
boundary is tied to the development of several engimtic features of the
California margin, including large-scale rotations of the Transverse Ranges, the
location of several strike-slip faults and regions of extreme crustal extension.
A recent tectonic model based largely on seismic reflection data has been
developed that, in theory, accommodates these features. This project will test
this model by investigating the relationship and interaction of off-shore
oceanic plates with respect to known geology of western North America, taken
from a variety of databases. Results should test the new model, and if
successful, will result in a series of quantitative palinspastic maps of the
evolving Pacific- North America plate boundary since 30ma.
