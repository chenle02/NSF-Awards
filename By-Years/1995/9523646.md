One of the biggest roadblocks preventing people from using natural language to
interact with computers is that understanding language perfectly is difficult,
even for people. Recently, theories have been proposed explaining how
interactors can behave appropriately---even if they differ about the meaning of
some part of the discourse. This project aims to extend these ideas so that
their effectiveness can be tested and their insights put to use. Extending
earlier work comprises four tasks: elicitation and collection of examples;
theoretical extensions; evaluation of the extended model within its logical
framework; and the construction of applications supporting a user study. The
planning activities are to include a review of the relevant literature;
preliminary experimentation with candidate methods of data collection and
validation; discussions with researchers whose expertise bears on these issues;
and the construction of two prototype applications that discuss medical
information with doctors and patients, respectively. Upon completion of these
activities, a detailed plan for extending prior a pproaches to misunderstanding
will be developed. If computers can be enabled to address misunderstanding, they
will be better able to understand natural language reliably and robustly, which
is essential if they are to help those who need them most, non-computer-experts.
