Dr. Perry at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, has initiated an
observational program which has as its primary goal a high resolution, three
dimensional survey of the dust component of the interstellar medium in the
neighborhood of the Sun. The results will complete the coverage of the spatial
distribution of the interstellar reddening in the solar neighborhood, as similar
data for stars in the Northern Hemisphere have already been analyzed. Although
cosmic dust may comprise only one percent of the interstellar medium, its
presence has a pronounced effect on astronomical observations because it is a
wavelength dependent absorber of radiation from stars. It is essential,
therefore, in many astronomical studies to correct for this reddening effect for
any direction in space and at various distances from the Sun. Dr. Perry's aim is
to provide reliable information on which astronomers can make a reddening
correction.
