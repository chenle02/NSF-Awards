Computational geometry uses graphs, polygons, and arrangements to model physical
objects and phenomena. Some of the objects are inherently flexible (e.g.,
proteins and robotic arms), others are stationary but require adjustments on a
regular basis (e.g., communication and transportation networks). The focus of
this project is on reconfigurations. The goal is to describe, understand, and
control the combinatorial, geometric and topological changes in geometric
configurations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop new
algorithms and data structures for modifying geometric configurations in three
areas: (1) Optimization problems for in the configuration space of geometric
objects, including graph augmentation, variations of the classical TSP tour
problem, and network design for multiple criteria. (2) Reconfiguration through
discrete moves, where current challenges include designing efficient data
structures to support shortest path computation in the configuration space,
approximating the diameter and radius of configuration spaces, and deciding
whether reconfiguration is possible. (3) Modeling continuous motion, which
includes motion planning algorithms and corresponding dynamic data structures
for bar-and-joint frameworks, hinged polygons, and disk arrangements, motivated
by applications in protein folding. A unified approach to discrete and
continuous reconfiguration problems allows breaking down complex systems into
elementary operations, which in turn leads to more efficient computational
tools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The collaboration between faculty members and
students from two universities ensures a high quality of training and opens new
opportunities for all participating students.
