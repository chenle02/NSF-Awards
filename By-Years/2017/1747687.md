Linguistics, the scientific study of human language, is widely taught at the
university level, but the findings and concepts of the discipline have not yet
made their way into American K-12 education in any systematic way. In response
to this challenge, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) has launched an
ambitious effort to develop an Advanced Placement (AP) course in Linguistics for
the nation's high schools. Creating AP Linguistics will involve a collaborative
effort between high school teachers and linguistics faculty from across the U.S.
to create and deliver courses. AP Linguistics will need to recruit talented,
enthusiastic high school faculty who are prepared to teach the AP Linguistics
curriculum. Various experiments with introductory linguistics courses are
currently underway in U.S. high schools, by English teachers, foreign language
teachers, mathematics teachers, and social studies teachers. As part of its
teacher recruitment effort, AP Linguistics proposes to send past and current
experimenters to national and regional conferences in their subject matters to
report on their efforts in relation to AP Linguistics, and to motivate others to
join in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support to enable
U.S. high school teachers to attend national and regional conferences in
connection with the LSA's AP Linguistics initiative and to speak to their fellow
teachers about their efforts to develop introductory linguistics courses at the
high school level. Rather than a "top-down" approach, wherein college faculty
attempt to recruit from above, this award will let our national teachers speak
for themselves from their own experiences.
