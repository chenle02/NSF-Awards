9509071 Whitten The Stanhopeinae orchids of the American tropics are a group of
ca. 250 species of epiphytic orchids with flowers of strange and contorted
shapes and usually with strong fragrances. Many are now known to be pollinated
by male fragrance-collecting bees, which are suspected to use these floral
fragrances in the manufacture of their own pheromones. The diversity of floral
shape and size in these orchids appears linked to the pollination behaviors of
native tropical bees. Yet the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships of the
orchid species are typically based on these same morphological characters of the
flowers. This raises the problem of circular argument in arguing the co-
evolution of plants and insects, and emphasizes the need for an independent set
of characters on which to construct a phylogeny of the orchids. Researchers Mark
Whitten and William Stern at the University of Florida, in collaboration with
Mark Chase at Kew in England, are analyzing chloroplast and nuclear DNA
sequences in Stanhopeinae orchids, in order to assemble a large dataset of
independent molecular characters, as well as new features of vegetative and
reproductive anatomy. Preliminary molecular data of mutational differences
between DNAs of different species show promise for resolving close species-level
relationships in this group of orchids. By comparing and combining the molecular
data with new and traditional morphological characters, the researchers will be
able to construct an improved classification that reflects phylogenetic
relationships. Using this framework, they can then superimpose various
ecologically related traits onto the phylogenetic tree, to generate hypotheses
about the rate and direction of change in floral features. In turn, such
hypotheses will guide the study of how pollinating inects have interacted or
coevolved with their plant associates.
