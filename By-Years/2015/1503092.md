This award provides support for a workshop on methodological challenges across
the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, to be held at the National
Science Foundation in Arlington, VA in February 2015. The results of the
workshop will contribute to long-run strategic thinking about quantitative work
in the social and behavioral sciences and the methodological advances that are
needed to move the social, behavioral, and economic sciences forward. Possible
dissemination mechanisms include journal submissions or an edited volume and a
supervised online blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together
methodologists from across the social, behavioral, economic, and statistical
sciences to help identify challenges to and opportunities for furthering
methodological developments across these disciplines. Potential research topics
to be discussed include new data definitions, modeling and estimation, null
results, and data privacy. Workshop participants also will explore methods for
facilitating continued communication among methodologists across disciplines.
