Topological n-manifolds are spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean n-space.
The simple local structure of manifolds lends them a very special role in
mathematics since phenomena modeled on these spaces are amenable to a vast array
of methods and tools. The study of the structure of manifolds has been an
important theme in geometric topology for many decades. More recently, spaces
called generalized manifolds, with the large-scale properties of topological
manifolds but very intricate local structure, were discovered by the proposers
in joint work with S. Ferry and S. Weinberger. Previously conjectured not to
exist, the first theoretical evidence that they might exist appeared in the work
of F. Quinn. This project proposes to continue the investigation of the topology
of generalized manifolds. This study is intimately related to important
structural properties of manifolds, such as the conjectural rigidity of
aspherical manifolds and the Siebenmann periodicity phenomenon. Other
indications of the relevance of these spaces are present in areas as diverse as
Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory and C-star-algebras.

The long-term goal of this project is to probe the local structure of
generalized manifolds and establish a deeper parallel between generalized
manifolds and topological manifolds by showing that these exotic spaces satisfy
most of the fundamental properties of manifolds, such as topological
homogeneity, the s-cobordism theorem, and the alpha-approximation theorem. More
immediate goals of the proposed investigation include the study of control
improvement problems, submanifold and map transversality questions, normal
bundle and embedding problems for generalized manifolds. These are elements that
arise naturally in the study of the core problems, and they also represent
important ramifications of independent interest. The main technique to be
employed is controlled topology, including controlled homotopy theory,
controlled K-theory, and controlled surgery applied to patch representations of
generalized manifolds and, ultimately, to generalized manifolds themselves.
