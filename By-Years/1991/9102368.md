Recent analysis of ocean bottom seismometer data indicates the presence of very
low rigidity bodies at the base of young oceanic crust. The data are conversions
of compressional waves to shear waves upon interaction with the Moho. This
project will map compressional-to-shear reflectivity of the Moho, using an
extensive ocean bottom seismograph survey along with simultaneous and
independent short-streamer multichannel seismic data. The survey will be
conducted on the East Pacific Rise near the overlapping spreading center at 12
degrees 54 minutes north.
