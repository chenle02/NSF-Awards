A nerve cell in the primary somatosensory cortex of the brain responds to
stimuli, such as touch, over a restricted part of the body surface. The
peripheral area of stimulation that elicits activity in the cell is called the
cell's "receptive field." When such a cell is deprived of its normal input, its
receptive field shifts so the cell now responds to stimuli in areas that were
ineffective earlier. These shifts may involve mechanisms similar to those the
brain uses for other forms of plasticity, where change occurs during growth or
during learning, by changing the effectiveness or presence of the connections
called synapses among nerve cells. There are several levels of synaptic
connections in the neural pathway from the skin to the cortex of the brain. This
work uses electrophysiological recording, pharmacological agents to block
specific kinds of normal synaptic activity, and local anesthetic to induce
effects of temporary denervation in the cortex. These studies on single cells
allow investigating the changes that occur over minutes rather than days, so the
emphasis is on the fast mechanisms of neural signalling and transmission rather
than the slow mechanism of new growth. In the novel approach here, not only the
cortex will be studied, but also activity of subcortical single cells to define
how shifts occur, and to determine the influence of cortical feedback
connections on subcortical neurons. This integrative approach is likely to have
impact beyond somatosensory work alone to the whole field of neural plasticity
and the role of sensory experience to sensory and behavioral function.
