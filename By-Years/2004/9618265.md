The flux of pore water DOC to overlying waters and the cycling of DOC within
sediments are important but poorly constrained components of the oceanic carbon
cycle. Preliminary pore water work and in situ benthic tripod flux estimates
suggest three hypotheses: 1) marine sediments are an important source of water
column DOC, 2) a component of the flux contributes to the refractory water
column DOC pool, and 3) A component of the flux may be oxidized near the
sediment water interface. The first hypothesis will be tested by using a benthic
tripod to accurately measure this flux along a depth gradient reaching across
the shelf to upper slope. The second hypothesis will be tested by pooling the
overlying water in the flux tripod at the end of several deployments to form an
ultrafiltered large volume sample that we will characterize at the molecular
level and compare to similarly characterized water column DOC. An in situ
dialysis sampler to sample for pore water DOC concentration and in situ oxygen
concentration manipulation experiments will test the third and all will take
place along the Pacific Northwest cost, off the northwest coast of Mexico and in
the Puget Sound.
