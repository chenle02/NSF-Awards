IRI-9521487 Iwanska, Lucja Wayne State University $18,000-12 mos RPG: The
Semantics and Pragmatics of Natural Language in A Computational Model for
Representation and Inference This research planning grant is to develop a
knowledge representation system closely resembling computational, algorithmic,
representational and inferential characteristics of natural language, starting
with a Boolean algebra approach. It is planned to demonstrate that only
combining semantic and pragmatic processing, logical, context-independent, and
nonlogical, context-dependent reasoning in natural language allows one to fully
simulate human understanding of natural language and write programs that
correctly derive, represent, and reason with the information from natural
language texts. Further, it is planned to demonstrate the attractiveness of the
proposed framework by applying it to computing some pragmatic aspects of natural
language, all extremely common and all having to do with the way knowledge is
communicated and acquired by natural language. The objective of the project is
to produce a research proposal for continued research in this area.
