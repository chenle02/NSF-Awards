9703996 Teichner This project deals with topological problems related to
4-dimensional manifolds. The main question to be answered is for which
fundamental groups the higher dimensional techniques of surgery and s-cobordism
theorems work. The existing techniques include sophisticated constructions of
Casson-handles that answer the question in the affirmative for a large class of
groups. In addition, there is a proposed nilpotent group theory method for
locating obstructions for free fundamental groups. Both methods will also be
applied to the link homotopy classification of disjoint 2-spheres in 4-space as
well as to questions concerning concordance classes of knots and links in
3-space. One of the most exciting mathematical discoveries in the last decade is
the fact that Euclidean n-space behaves very differently depending on whether
the dimension n equals or doesn't equal 4 (which is the dimension we live in,
allowing time as the fourth dimension). More precisely, we have all learned
calculus in one real variable, and some of us went on to learn calculus in n
variables, i.e., the theory of smooth functions on Euclidean n-space. But very
few of us were told that for n=4 there are (uncountably!) many such theories,
whereas for all other dimensions there is a unique one, namely the one we were
taught. In mathematical terms, I am talking about the "exotic" structures on
Euclidean 4-space, discovered by Donaldson, Freedman and others around 1983.
This project deals with similar questions on more complicated 4-dimensional
manifolds (technically, those which have nontrivial fundamental group). One
concrete difference from Euclidean 4-space is that in a general 4-manifold, not
every vector-field corresponds to a potential energy function. ***
