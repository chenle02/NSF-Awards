9306293 Kirk Silicon heterostructures, such as Si/ZnS, represent new directions
for increasing the functional density of electronic systems through novel
nanoelectronic device designs. In addition to single junction heterostructures,
we propose investigation double and multilayer heteorstructures of the type
ZnS/SiZnS/Si both experimentally and theoretically. The main efforts will go
toward the determination of the physical conditions necessary for epitaxial
growth of both ZnS onto Si as well Si onto ZnS. Once grown, the epilayers will
be studied to determine their electronic transport, defect or dopant
incorporation, interface conditions, and other characteristics (e.g. band
offsets) which would affect device behavior. The growth of monocrystalline
heterostructure layers of Si/ZnS will be done with molecular beam epitaxy in the
first stage of the project. In later stages of the project, atomic layer
eptitaxy will be developed since it offers greater potential for producing
higher quality materials. To assist the experimental growth and processing work,
theoretical band structure KKR calculations will be employed to determine
bandgap line-ups, which will help refine and improve the growth conditions. ***
