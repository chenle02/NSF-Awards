9403134 Lieberman Dr. Marya Lieberman has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Lieberman received her doctoral degree from the
University of Washington under the supervision of Professor Tomikazu Sasaki. Dr.
Lieberman will continue research at the California Institute of Technology under
the sponsorship of Professor Nathan Lewis. Her postdoctoral research will focus
on the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, specifically on the synthesis and
characterization of a coating which, when illuminated, injects electrons into
the conduction band of a semiconductor. Longer term, she plans to design,
synthesize and characterize at molecular resolution, composite materials
consisting of layered metal organophosphonates and organic spacer molecules.
These designer solids will find application in catalysis, molecular recognition
and signal transduction. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
