Plants vary dramatically in the ways in which they defend themselves from
herbivorous animals. Even within a species, physical and mechanical defenses
differ depending on environment, historical factors and genetic composition.
Variation in plant defenses will be examined to determine the causes of
variability, and subsequently, the costs to the plant of an investment in
defense. The significance of this work lies in relating the natural variation in
plant properties to a selective force, herbivory, and determining the effect on
plant productivity. This work is central to understanding plant-herbivore
interactions.
