This project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of investment casting
with ice patterns generated by Rapid Freeze Prototyping, a novel solid freeform
fabrication process which builds a three-dimensional part according to a CAD
model by depositing and freezing water droplets layer by layer. The feasibility
study includes: exploring ways of handling and transporting ice patterns between
stations for the subsequent investing casting process; identifying suitable
materials including powders and binders for making ceramic shells from ice
patterns; studying limitations on feature shapes and sizes of ice patterns for
investment casting and ability to retain sharp features of ice patterns over
time; and investigating the dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the metal
castings obtained from ice patterns.

If the project is successful, it will likely create a significant new approach
for rapid prototyping and small-quantity manufacturing of investment casting
parts with ice patterns fabricated by a cost-effective and environmentally
benign method. This could significantly improve the environmental impact of
processing molds in the investment casting industry.
