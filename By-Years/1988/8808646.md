Professor Hawkins is examining the origins and development of the theory of the
structure and representation of semisimple Lie algebras. This theory is an
important component of contemporary mathematics, with many applications to other
areas of mathematics and physics. The historical roots of Lie algebras are
entwined with many strands of 19th and early 20th century mathematics, involving
the leading mathematical schools of the period. By considering together and in
some detail the complex web of mathematicians and mathematical ideas that
combined to produce the theory, a more realistic portrait of the development of
mathematics will emerge. That is, one that does justice to the fact that
mathematics grows in large part through the cross fertilization of diverse
mathematical ideas, theories and perspectives originating from many sources and
that the significance of a mathematical problem or theory often changes with
time and circumstances. Professor Hawkins studies will also provide a broad-
based case study of the growth of mathematical knowledge that will benefit
philosophers of mathematics who utilize history in their philosophical studies
of the nature of mathematics.
