This research advances several new directions for current-mode (I- mode) analog
integrated circuits. I-mode circuits potentially operate at high frequencies
using low power supply voltages because they process current rather than voltage
as in conventional or switched-capacitor signal processing circuits. Moreover,
I-mode circuits do not require precision linear floating capacitors, and are
therefore very attractive for implementing mixed-mode signal processing systems
in the emerging submicron digital CMOS and/or BiCMOS technologies. Several high-
speed high-accuracy current-mode techniques are considered in the design of a
basic analog signal processing block with emphasis on developing techniques
suitable for implementation with digital IC technologies using a reduced supply
voltage. A high-gain universal fully differential current mode operational
amplifier topology is being used and, in one application, is extended to
implement fully differential switched-current filters with accuracy comparable
to switched-capacitor filters. Several clock-feedthrough cancellation schemes
are also suggested. Finally, a new high-frequency continuous time current-mode
filtering technique will be used. Frequencies exceeding 100 MHZ appear feasible
using a 2 um CMOS technology with higher frequencies possible using more
advanced CMOS and/or BiCMOS technologies.
