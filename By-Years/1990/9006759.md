A high power,auto-scanning, ring dye laser system is proposed for accurate
sizing of micro-particles (1 to 50 microns) by means of wavelength dependent
resonance spectra. Measurements are performed on a single particle levitated in
an electrical field. The particle is illuminated. Accuracy on the order of 1
Angstrom is expected. Besides the particle size, one can determine forces on
particles in temperature and density gradients, evaporation and condensation
rates, nucleation rates, and collection efficiencies. Measurement of micro-
particle properties is important to many research area, such as manufacturing
(superconductors, semiconductors, chemicals), weather (fog, mist, ozone, nuclear
winter) and pollution control (smog, acid rain, radon).
