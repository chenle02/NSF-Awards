Interdisciplinary (99) Exploring Science in the Studio is expanding a
pedagogical approach that embeds science into courses in the fine arts, design,
architecture, and creative writing. The project is engaged in developing and
disseminating new pedagogical approaches and non-lab based instructional
materials to deliver science content to humanities students. The outputs will be
specially-designed and produced mobile units for scientific exploration. These
mobile units will provide a replicable and scalable process for bringing science
instructional materials directly into classrooms at colleges that do not have
stand-alone science departments or facilities. This project has two goals: 1) To
enable students in such colleges to understand the transferability of scientific
methods of inquiry and knowledge to their practices in art, design, and writing;
and 2) To help the humanities faculties in these colleges to integrate science
into their teaching on the topic of sustainability. Sustainability is the
science focus because of its substantial breadth, and because problems arising
from climate change and the need for increased sustainability in the use of
natural resources will be increasingly addressed by teams of individuals who
contribute not only scientific knowledge, but creativity and innovation. Artists
and designers have important roles to play on such teams.
