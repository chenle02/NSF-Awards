The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor Joseph M. O'Connor of the University of California San
Diego to investigate late-metal metallacyclobutene complexes. Such complexes
have been proposed as key intermediates in a large number of important metal-
mediated transformations, including alkyne polymerizations, enyne methathesis
reactions, and in the synthesis of cyclopropenes, furans, pyrones, and
benzannulated compounds. The development of new synthetic routes to these
targets maximizes the potential for subsequent reactivity. Isolable
metallacyclobutene complexes allow for: a) structural studies, b) well-defined
reactivity studies, c) the development of new reactions, d) appropriate modeling
of key steps in reactions which are thought to involve metallacyclobutene
intermediates, and e) applications of metallacyclobutene-derived products in
many areas of the chemical sciences. Undergraduate and graduate students trained
in the area of organometallic chemistry are well-positioned to make important
contributions to both industrial and academic endeavors which require
interdisciplinary research in areas such as materials, inorganic and organic
chemistry.
