This award provides funds to establish an REU Site at San Diego State University
which will provide undergraduate student research experience in the laboratories
of a strong group of molecular biologists who are faculty members of the
Departments of Biology and Chemistry and who interact professionally as members
of the College's Molecular Biology Institute (MBI). Nineteen of the 22 MBI
members have expressed interest in supervising approximately 30 undergraduate
student in research activities in their laboratories. Both plant and animal
science areas are represented in their research interests, and the molecular
approaches applied to their research problems represent the latest technologies.
Eighteen of the 22 members currently receive extra-mural funding, which is
indicative of the quality of the science performed in their laboratories.
Student participation will be limited to 8 students, to ensure the quality of
the recruitment process. The majority of students, after a laboratory assignment
is made, will participate in that laboratory's research program for one academic
year and the following summer. Participation will involve a minimum of 10
hrs./week during the academic year and 40 hrs./week for eight weeks in the
summer. Students will participate in weekly laboratory meetings and will
progress as quickly as possible to independent project status. They will also
attend the weekly MBI seminar, which features nationally and internationally
known scientists in fields of molecular biology. The primary objective of this
project is the encouragement and preparation of students to enter advanced,
especially doctoral, degree programs in the sciences. Working with a highly
competent research scientist for an extended period of time will permit the
development of the student's personal research skills and understanding of the
research process. This excellent preparation should encourage students to apply,
and make them highly competitive, for openings in a variety of advanced degree
programs.
