Woody plants are important structural components of old fields, which come to
dominate and define much of community structure during succession. The presence
and stature of trees in old fields can affect persistence or invasion of other
species in the community. In spite of their importance, however, the controls on
invasion and performance of the initial woody colonizers are little known. This
study will exploit a long and detailed data base on succession in order to
analyze temporal and spatial patterns of invasion of old fields by woody plants.
In order to understand these patterns, field experiments to investigate
mechanisms operating at the regeneration phase of the life cycle will be
performed. The relative role of seed predation, seedling herbivory, and plant-
plant interactions in regulating woody plant populations in old fields will be
determined. The integration of pattern and process is critical to an
understanding of ecological communities. It is especially powerful in this study
because both the long-term pattern and the process occur at the same site.
