This is a Phase II Small Business Research Initiative grant to continue the
progress achieved during the Phase I grant. During Phase I, it was demonstrated
that a silicon carbide fiber was produced which exhibited tensile strength of
three hundred thousand pounds per square inch, an elastic modulus of fifty eight
million pounds per square inch, virtually no degradation of properties after
exposure to temperatures of twelve hundred degrees centigrade for three hours.
The Phase II program seeks to optimize the processing of the fiber to achieve
strength in excess of five hundred thousand pounds per square inch, elastic
modulus of sixty million pounds per square inch, with similar thermal stability.
Fibers of silicon carbide are used in ceramic. and metal. matrix composites.
These materials are used in heat engines. The current research is aimed at
improving the resistance of the fibers to high temperatures. The development of
this fiber will obviate the need for the United States to import silicon carbide
fibers, and will provide an opportunity to export them.
