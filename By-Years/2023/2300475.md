HBCU-UPâ€™s Research Initiation Awards provide support for STEM faculty to pursue
research activities to further their research capabilities and effectiveness and
help enhance research and teaching at HBCUs. This award to Bowie State
University has the potential to identify new drugs using machine learning (ML)
methods and provide interdisciplinary training to students. The project focuses
on identifying bonding ligands for Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
which are the targets for 40-50% of all pharmaceuticals. The project aims to
make significant contributions to drug discovery and provide training in
emerging fields for HBCU undergraduate students.

This project seeks to develop new molecular models and a machine learning
approach pipeline for rapidly and accurately building 3D structural models of
individual inhibitor/GPCR complexes without experimental structures. ML tools
will be used to extract binding features from all complexes and deep learning
models will be generated using GPCR protein-ligand complexes to identify novel
molecules that target Class A GPCRs. The project has the potential to develop
valuable tools for optimizing the potency and selectivity of new drugs at lower
costs and higher efficiency. The project will build new opportunities for
students in interdisciplinary science using ML techniques and contribute to
developing a more diverse workforce.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
