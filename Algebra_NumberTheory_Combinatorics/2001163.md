Many objects in nature, such as flowers, crystals, and molecules, exhibit
symmetry. Symmetry can be described mathematically through motions, for example,
a rotation after which the object appears the same. Such motions collectively
form what is called a symmetry group. In quantum physics, this classical notion
of symmetry group is no longer enough to capture all symmetries and is replaced
by a notion more suited to quantum phenomena, termed quantum symmetry groups, or
by related more general mathematical structures. This project carries out basic
research in quantum symmetry, which is important in current applications of
mathematics such as quantum computing and quantum information science. The
project aims to develop and apply techniques for breaking down instances of
quantum symmetry into smaller components, facilitating understanding. This work
will expand the techniques available for answering questions about quantum
symmetry that arise in applications. The project involves training of students
through research involvement.

Quantum groups, noncommutative algebras, and tensor categories are the settings
for quantum symmetry studied in this project, which uses homological techniques
to shed light on their structure. The research involves several directions. The
investigator will study the cohomology of Hopf algebras and tensor categories,
specifically to investigate a conjecture that cohomology of finite tensor
categories is always finitely generated. The investigator aims to establish
results on the structure of support varieties for finite tensor categories,
harnessing homological techniques combined with geometry to obtain information
such as a tensor product property and criteria for wild representation type. She
plans to establish a direct connection between two different techniques that
were developed recently, the homotopy lifting method and loops in exact
categories, calling on techniques used in connection with A-infinity structures.
She will also continue to develop improved techniques for understanding the Lie
structure of the Hochschild cohomology of twisted tensor product algebras,
particularly skew group algebras.
