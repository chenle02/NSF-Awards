Feldmann OPP 9526252 Abstract This award supports a study of fossil crabs and
lobsters from the southern hemisphere with the goal of understanding the
paleobiogephraphic framework of these fossils compared to molluscs and
foraminifera. Field work and laboratory analysis of fossil crabs and lobsters
from Antarctica and other high latitude sites in the southern hemisphere has now
provided a robust data base from which the pattern of paleobiogeographic
distribution can be discerned. Recent field work, supported by the National
Science Foundation, has resulted in the collection of several new faunas which
more narrowly constrain the northern influence of Antarctic fossil biotas than
has been possible previously. Laboratory analysis of these faunas coupled with
examination of significant museum fossil collections made by other workers in
Madagascar and on Alexander Island, Antarctica, will assure that the principal
investigator will have examined and confirmed the identification of all known
decapods from the mid and high southern latitudes. As a result, knowledge of
these organisms will be great enough to synthesize their geologic history and
evolution which, in turn, will make it possible to test the paleobiogeographic
framework of these animals against models based upon the more commonly preserved
molluscs and microorganisms.
