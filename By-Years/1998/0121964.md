The sponsorship and funding of the Division of Electrical and Communication
Systems (ECS) of NSF, is requested to partially support the International
Semiconductor Device Research Symposium (ISDRS'Ol), December 5-7, 2001, in
Washington DC. NSF has been a valued sponsor in the past (ISDRS'99). The
Symposium is encouraging student participation and provides a highly interactive
international forum for engineers, scientists, and students in the areas of
advanced materials for devices, novel semiconductor devices, and processing
technologies. We propose to use the funds to partially support student and
faculty participation (partial travel reimbursement), symposium supplies and
printing, and plenary speaker stipends. The sponsorship, participation and
endorsement of NSF is invited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
