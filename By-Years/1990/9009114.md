Muscle movements are carefully controlled during posture by mechanical
impedance. This is an area where neuroscientists can apply the accuracy of
control systems analysis to quantitatively analyse how a single neuron matches
the mechanical stress on the muscle as relayed by mechanoreceptor input with the
maintainence of a movement or posture. To do this cells which control a single
reflex will be recorded in the hermit crab and experiments carried out to test
the cell response to quantifiable resistances applied to the leg movement. The
data will be analysed mathematically. The results will determine which
mathematical model best describes the way in which a neuron maintains posture
and stiffness in a complete motor reflex. This kind of information has important
consequences for the understanding of movement and efficiency of neuronal
systems.
