This award will enable Professor Jack T. Spence from Utah State University to
collaborate with Dr. Anthony G. Wedd at LaTrobe University, Australia on a study
of molybdenum containing enzymes. Research will involve detailed spectroscopic
analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrochemical
investigations, and theoretical calculations related to the molybdenum centers
of these enzymes, as well as the synthesis of analogues to these complexes.
Although molybdenum containing enyzmes are involved in several important
biological processes, their mode of action is not presently known. The purpose
of this research is to gain an understanding of these enzymes at the molecular
level. The research will benefit from the complementary skills and
instrumentation of the research groups in the United States and Australia. Dr.
Spence's expertise is in electron theory and in ligand design and synthesis. Dr.
Wedd will provide equipment and techniques which permit detailed monitoring of
electrochemical and EPR properties.
