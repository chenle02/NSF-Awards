This project is aimed at understanding the tradeoffs among computational
resources and hierarchies of computational resources. Of particular interest are
feasible (polynomial-time) computation, NP- completeness, and the relationships
between time and space and between determinism and nondeterminism. For example,
the research addresses subtleties raised by the question, "When are $k+1$ bits
of information more computationally useful than only $k$ bits of information?"
Also under investigation are issues of current practical importance, such as
sorting with special-purpose hardware, fault detection in parallel models,
efficient layouts of processor and interconnection networks, and DNA sequencing.
