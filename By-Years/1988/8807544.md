This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses the
techniques of infrared, Raman, and fluorescence spectroscopy to obtain energy
levels and potential energy surfaces for cyclic and bicyclic molecules. Other
areas of study include intermolecular interactions in liquids and vibrational
energy levels of metal clusters. These studies will elucidate chemical bonding
and intramolecular forces, both in the ground and excited states of the systems
studied. Far infrared, Raman and Fluorescence spectroscopy will be used to study
the energy levels of cyclic, four, five and six membered rings, bicyclic species
and cyclohexene-like molecules. These data will be interpreted to yield
potential energy surfaces for these species. Raman difference spectroscopy will
be used to obtain small frequency shifts in isotopic mixtures of liquids in
order to understand intermolecular interactions. Infrared and Raman matrix
isolation spectra will be obtained for prototypical metal clusters in order to
determine the vibrational force fields for these molecules.
