9416933 Gehrels One of the fundamental questions in Cordilleran tectonics is the
degree of orogen-parallel transport of outboard terranes before final docking
and amalgmations to North America. Paleomagnetic data has commonly been used to
determine latitude shifts of allochthouous terranes, but the method has many
possible sources of error. As a result, geologic data is frequently at adds with
paleomagnetic interpretations. This project intends to employ an entirety
different technique to detect and quantify orogen-parallel terrane translation.
Prior work has assembled a database of the distribution of zircons in source
rocks along the western north american craton. This project will examine suites
of detrital zircons from outboard terranes and match their age distributions to
the North American craton database to estimate the degree of allochthoniety.
Successful results will provide an independent test for possible northward
translation of several exotic terranes in western Nevada and northern
California, thereby helping to resolve the discrepancy between paleomagnetic
results and geology analysis. ***
