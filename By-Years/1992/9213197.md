The Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) system will be used for research in
tissue engineering, and drug release from bioerodible copolymer matrices. The
research work in tissue engineering involves the development of novel
biomaterials for cell transplantation to regenerate metabolic organs and
structural tissues. Biodegradable polymers with high porosity and large
surface/volume ratios can provide a sturdy, yet temporary, scaffold for
osteoblast transplantation to regenerate bone. For drug release studies, the GPC
will supplement in situ video microscopy, image analysis, and computer
simulations already used in the laboratory for the design of polymer devices
with optimal release characteristics.
