0217299&lt;br/&gt;Inhorn&lt;br/&gt;This project by an anthropologist from the
University of Michigan studies how masculine identity in Arab culture is
affected by male infertility. The project studies how new reproductive
technologies are used (or not used) in the Middle East, where religiously
observant Muslim men are prohibited from accepting donor insemination or legal
adoption. The project will study the use of reproductive technologies, including
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (a technique which allows severely infertile
men to father their own biological children) in an urban and a semi-rural
infertility clinic in Egypt, as well as among Middle East men in Detroit, a city
with the largest such population in the US. The project will interview in Egypt
100 infertile men, as well as a control sample of 100 fertile men, as well as a
smaller sample of infertile men's wives, and medical specialists to understand
how moral as well as pragmatic decisions are made when fatherhood, marriage, and
a sense of manhood itself may be at stake. Several hypotheses will be tested
linking male infertility to culturally relevant factors such as smoking,
consanguinity, lead exposure, and also to the sense of masculinity, marital
relations, medical treatment-seeking, and morality. The "medical migration" of
Middle Eastern men to the US for infertility treatment will be studied through a
focus on two Arab-American medical centers. The impact of the Western context on
religious morality of Middle Eastern men will be studied through in-depth
interviews with men, their wives, and medical specialists. This research will
advance our understanding of male identity and masculinity in a Middle Eastern
cultural context, and should be of wide interest to those concerned with the
nature of Middle Eastern culture and society. &lt;br/&gt;
