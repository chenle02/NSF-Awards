University of North Texas (UNT) is supporting three cohorts for the CyberCorpsÂ®:
Scholarship for Service (SFS) program from a selected list of students who are
interested in pursuing a PhD in Information Assurance and are interested in
serving federal/state/local agencies after graduation. UNT's PhD Program
prepares students to account for both technical and social issues when
addressing security vulnerabilities. UNT's program is an interdisciplinary
program between the College of Engineering, College of Business, and College of
Information. The Center for Information and Computer Security at UNT has been
designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in both Information
Assurance Education (CAE-IAE) and Research (CAE-R) by the National Security
Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. UNT's 4-year PhD program is
preparing students to: 1) Develop and apply theoretical models that draw from
multiple disciplines to predict and solve security threats to public sectors
such as electronic commerce, healthcare and telecommunications, 2) Conduct
advanced data analysis and visualization of vulnerabilities using the data from
emerging technologies such as smart phones, social networks (e.g., Facebook,
Twitter), using embedded-sensors, and using the next-generation Internet
capabilities, and 3) Develop, interpret, and administer local, state and federal
security standards, policies and laws relevant to IA. All students conduct
research and write a dissertation with the help of a doctoral committee
constituted of faculty from the three colleges. Each semester an assessment
committee evaluates the SFS program. The College of Information student body
population is more than 75% female and the SFS program draws on the large number
of undergraduates to increase the number of minority and women PhDs in IA. UNT's
SFS Program is also promoting a plan to recruit community college teachers who
are already teaching security courses.
