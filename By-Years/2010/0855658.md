This proposal is to provide partial support for an international workshop to be
held at the Univerity of Oklahoma in May 2009, namely the 3rd International
Workshop on the Interconnection between Particle Physics and Cosmology (PPC
2009). The previous meetings were very successful and compelling. With the
recent turn-on of CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and start-up of the
Xenon-100 dark matter search experiment, a workshop on particle physics and
cosmology is more timely than ever. Topics to be addressed in this workshop
include: recent progress and data from LHC and Tevatron, recent results from
Xenon-100 dark matter search, results from GLAST and Pamela, Higgs
phenomenology, supersymmetry, grand uni&amp;#64257;cation, extra dimensions,
little Higgs models, direct/indirect dark matter searches, dark energy
measurements, and large scale and deep surveys, and cosmological parameters and
models.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this conference are as follows: This is
an interdisciplinary conference. The workshop will bring together experts in
high-energy physics and cosmology. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will contain a
significant education component, involving graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, and established leading scientists, and will provide substantial
opportunities for unstructured discussion to facilitate collaboration.
