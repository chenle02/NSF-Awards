This Workshop on Opportunities and Challenges in Uncertainty Quantification for
Complex Interacting Systems, to be held at the University of Southern California
in the early part of 2009, will provide a forum where issues of uncertainty
quantification and model validation in predictive science will be addressed. The
Workshop will bring together leading scientists from physics-based modeling,
network science and social networks to explore the fundamental similarities and
differences in the challenges facing them. The gradient in the level of maturity
and scientific opportunities provided by these three themes will serve to drive
knowledge mixing and transfer between all participants. Challenges and
opportunities will be identified and a community of researchers and
collaborators seeded. This Workshop will greatly accelerate the maturity of
these methods and bring them, much faster, to a point where they can fulfill
their promise as an enabling technologies for economic growth and societal
sustainability.
