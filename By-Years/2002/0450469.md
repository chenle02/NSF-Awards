This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop field deployable kits for the detection of bio-terror pathogens. These
kits would consist of fluorescent-labeled antibodies directed against protein
toxins expressed by bio-terror pathogens, relying for detection on strong
antibody-antigen interactions and fast chromatographic discrimination using
simple chromatography strips supplied with inexpensive pre-measured reagents. In
Phase I project, new water soluble blue-emitting reporter fluorophores were
synthesized that were extremely photo-stable and could be easily visualized
under any type of light conditions. These fluorophores were conjugated to an
antibody against Bacillus anthracis as the initial proof-of-concept, and
methodology was developed to attach these reporter fluorophores to monoclonal,
polyclonal or recombinant antibodies. The objectives of Phase II project are to
optimize reagents and chromatography, to synthesize new fluorophores for
multiplexed pathogen detection, to design and assemble prototype kits, and to
test and validate the kits.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland
security. The proposed kits are expected to be inexpensive, versatile, and easy
to use by relatively untrained first responders (such as police, firefighters,
paramedics, hazmat personnel, other emergency response teams).
