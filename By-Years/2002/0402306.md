A collaboration between the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications
(COMAP), the Community College Research Center, and the Information Technology
Association of America, the WorkMAP project will conduct research and design
strategies to examine the level and nature of mathematics and problem-solving
skills required in entry-level jobs and career advancement for technicians in
the technical workplace. The results of the study will inform two- and four-year
higher education institutions on the type of mathematics skills needed and used
in the technological workforce. Three component phases comprise this two-year
ATE project: 1) development and implementation of research strategies to assess
mathematics skills employed in the IT workplace; 2) creation of tools to measure
workforce skills; and 3) dissemination of research findings, materials and
tools. Research briefs will be produced to include identification of the
mathematical skills and problem-solving strategies used by IT workers,
description of sample problems encountered in the IT workplace, discussion of
case studies of IT workplace site visits, and presentation of instruments and
protocols for future workplace examination. A one-day teleconference as well as
project workshops will be offered to disseminate project results.
