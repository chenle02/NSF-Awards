This award is to purchase a color stereo head mounted on a robot arm, high
performance graphics workstations, and cameras in order to support
investigations in the use of color algorithms in model based vision; algorithms
for machine stereopsis; applications of invariant theory in recognising curved
surfaces from a single perspective outline, from multiple outlines, and from
stereo pairs; particle motion analysis; and simulation techniques for complex
physical objects. The University of Iowa will be purchasing a color stereo head
with supporting image processing electronics, a Zebra Zero robot arm, two high
performance workstations, and camera equipment to support research projects in
the use of sophisticated color algorithms for machine stereopsis, advanced
algorithms for machine stereopsis, shape recognition, and simulation techniques
for complex physical objects.
