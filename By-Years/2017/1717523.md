This project addresses the following four sets of fundamental questions in
quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;(1) Randomness extraction in the presence of
quantum side information.&lt;br/&gt;To secure communication security, it is
necessary to generate cryptographic keys that cannot be predicted by an
adversary. Such keys are usually obtained through a randomness extraction
process, which converts a weakly random input to a (almost) perfectly random
output.&lt;br/&gt;The team is researching the most efficient methods for this
task, with the focus on the setting that the adversary?s knowledge about the
input is quantum.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Quantum cryptographic hash functions (qchash).
Hash functions are powerful tools that can be used to verify the authenticity
and the integrity of a message. Quantum hash functions extend (classical) hash
functions by using a quantum state to ?tag? a classical message. The team is
working to identify the advantages of such functions, especially in the scenario
where classical side information is leaked to the adversary.&lt;br/&gt;(3)
Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE). Homomorphic encryption allows encrypted
data to be processed by multiple parties without the need for decryption or for
interactions with the owner of the data.&lt;br/&gt;The team is looking for the
most efficient methods for achieving this task, when the data are quantum and
the adversary is assumed to be all-powerful.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Quantum algorithms
for combinatorial optimization. Many optimization problems from practice are
extremely difficult to solve, even if one is content with an approximate answer.
The team is examining to what extent quantum algorithms can speed up the
computation or increase quality of approximation. A focus is on the recently
proposed algorithmic framework of quantum approximate optimization algorithms
(QAOA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positive solutions to the above questions may lead
to new and powerful quantum information applications for safeguarding
information security and for solving optimization problems. The project also
trains multiple students to become experts on quantum information science.
