A soil coring rig is being used to core surficial materials to a depth of 25
feet or greater, increasing students' exposure to a wide range of material only
accessible through study of intact soil cores. The easily extracted cores allow
students to map subsurface paleotopography, ascertain bulk density, particle
size over depth and soil structure over depth, do stratigraphic correlations,
describe soil horizonation, ascertain the extent of cultural overburden, and
relate soil properties to rooting depth for trees and other plants. This
equipment is shared by five departments at Memphis State University and Rhodes
College.
