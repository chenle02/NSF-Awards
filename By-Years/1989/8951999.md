The Western Piedmont Community College Chemistry Improvement Project allowed the
upgrade and expansion of undergraduate curricula in General Chemistry, Inorganic
and Organic Chemistry for freshman non-science transfer students and pre-
professional and technical associate degree students. The research and industry-
standard laboratory equipment acquired with the NSF grant permitted the
following objectives to the achieved: (1) the introduction of new gas
chromatography exercises, (2) the introduction of new visible and infrared
spectrophotometric exercises, (3) the teaching of computer assisted analytical
skills for data acquisition and manipulation, and (4) the opportunity for
students to acquire hands-on experience with sophisticated laboratory equipment.
Important scientific concepts previously taught with audio-visual aids and
visits to university and industry laboratories are now integrated into campus
classroom and laboratory instruction. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
