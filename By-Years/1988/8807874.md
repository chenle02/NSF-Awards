This interdisciplinary research conference will bring together experimentalists
and theoreticians from some of the most active areas of biological and medical
research, who believe that theory and mathematical modeling can make valuable
contributions toward understanding some of the basic phenomena in their
respective areas. Some program topics are Cell and Tissue Movement, Spatial
Organization of Tissues, Cardiac Dynamics, Population Biology, Fractal Geometry
in Biology, and Neurobiology. The conference will be held at Tilton School,
Tilton, N. H. June 13 - 17, 1988. The program organizers are Professors Hans
Othmer, Department of Mathematics, University of Utah, and Michael Mackey,
Department of Physiology, McGill University. There is some participant support
available, and participation of young scientists is particularly encouraged.
