The descriptive cyclone model originated by the Norwegian school of
meteorologists in the second decade of the 20th century has long served as a
cornerstone of weather forecasting in the middle latitudes. In this paradigm, a
word-girdling boundary zone between polar and tropical air (the polar front) is
the focal line of action, with waves on this front forming, evolving and dying;
producing typical weather patterns and changes during their lifetime. The later
development of observational networks extending through the troposphere,
dynamical theorys of jet streams and planetary scale waves, and the advent of
Numerical Weather Predic- tion models have both complicated and overshadowed the
frontal cyclone model. This is due, in part, to the fact that in each case, the
treatment is too coarse-meshed in the horizontal to capture the narrow frontal
zone. More recently, radar and satellite-image depiction of mesoscale features
associated with cyclones, and the development of numerical research models with
mesoscale resolution, offers the possibility of describing mid-latitude frontal
cyclones in much finer detail. Mass proposes to use a widely-used mesoscale
model (the MM4 model), together with conventional coarse-grained operational
data sets, to generate detailed quantitative four- dimensional descriptions of a
sample set of five or six cases of such cyclones (explosively developing and
normally developing marine cyclones, a continental cyclone over level terrain,
and cyclones moving across and to the lee of the Rocky Mountains). Analyses of
these data sets will include air trajectory computations and sophisticated
three-dimensional graphics. Mass expects that these analyses will contribute to
the establishment of a new paradigm to modify the useful, but incomplete,
Norwegian model. This will contribute to the improvement of short-range, local
weather forecasts and to the development of operational versions of numerical
mesoscale models.
