This project examines the causes for variations in population growth between
different societies in the Caribbean. Households in Santa Lucia and Antigua will
be surveyed to study the reasons for high and low family sizes,using a survey
questionnaire that has been used to study similar issues in Barbados. The
hypothesis tested is that women have fewer children when they are freed from
financial dependence on their children in their old age, and that this
independence comes from changes in the educational sytem and occupational
structure. This research is important because understanding the causes of high
population growth will help us to control it; and the general theory of the
changes from high to low population growth must be tested against local
circumstances to discover its strengths and weaknesses. The islands of the
Caribbean represent a natural laboratory of similar but different societies in
which to test the theory.
