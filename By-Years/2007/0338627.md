Purdue University, in collaboration with Indiana University is funded by a two-
year Cooperative Agreement from the Division of Advanced Computational
Infrastructure in the amount of $1,467,769 to integrate the resources available
at Purdue University and Indiana University with the Extensible Terascale
Facility (ETF). Funding is provided to establish a 20 gigabit/second connection
from Purdue University and Indiana University through Indianapolis to the
Chicago Hub of the ETF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of the funding provided
through this Terascale Extension Award, Purdue University and Indiana University
will be contributing a significant fraction of their resources to the ETF user
community including: 1) a heterogeneous group of systems delivering 1.67
teraflops on an ongoing basis with the capability to offer up to 6.26 teraflops
for very demanding well-justified applications; 2) a baseline storage capacity
offered as part of ETF would include 129 terabytes with peak demand
contributions exceeding 400 terabytes; 3) access to a variety of visualization
resources including a CAVE, an Immersadesk, Display Walls, etc. are also
offered; 4) specialized instrumentation facilities including the Purdue
Terrestrial Observatory, and the Service Crystallography at Advanced Photon
Sources (SCrAPS); and 5) access to a number of large scientific data sets in the
life sciences, earth system simulations, vegetation and soils research,
multispectral remote sensing imaging, geological GIS data, economic and social
scientific data, and anthropological data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators
at both Purdue University and Indiana University will also contribute
significantly to the broader goals of the Extensible Terascale Facility. They
have a significant concentration of expertise in areas of grid computing,
middleware, and portal development. Both universities, through their IP-Grid
participation, also have extensive outreach activities fostering the training
and education of a diverse technological workforce extending from K-12 programs
through undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;
