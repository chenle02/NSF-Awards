This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist in Los Angeles,
California. The project studies the history and present state of community
activism about housing in a multi- ethnic, blue-collar Black, Latino, and White
neighborhood. Using the methods of ethnography and oral history the project will
study how women have been key forces in maintaining their community's informal
infrastructure, shaping its cohesive values and transforming daily networks and
values into local activism and grassroots political culture. This research is
important because grassroots political movements are one of the bedrocks of
democracy. Understanding how they are formed around issues of varying importance
to different ethnic groups, and analyzing the role of women in maintaining local
political culture will provide information useful to municipality governments
and urban housing planners.
