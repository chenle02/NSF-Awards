Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop
and verify a nanoscratch methodology in measuring the in situ toughness of a
class of materials that are brittle in nature but allow for appreciable plastic
deformation, such as bone and tooth. A novel mechanistic model of the
nanoscratch test is derived using a synergetic approach of both analytical and
empirical processes based on the assumption that a failure flow occurs along the
shear planes in front of the sliding tip during the scratch process. The
efficacy of this method in detecting the local resistance of bone tissues to
failure (toughness) is verified using bone specimens with known fragility.
Deliverables include a mechanistic model of scratch process, testing procedures
and associated techniques, experimental validation of the test methodology,
documentation of research results, engineering education and research
experiences for students from high school to graduate
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this unique methodology will enable
direct, quantitative, and minimal destructive measurements of in situ failure
behavior of bone or other materials alike, thus facilitating the development of
physically sound constitutive models of these materials at ultrastructural
levels and the applications in the field of materials and biomedical research.
In addition to bone research, other potential applications of this methodology
include the characterization of biomaterials in tissue engineering, thus giving
rise to great potential for advancement towards improved treatments of
congenital diseases, traumatic injuries, and degenerative processes of bone
tissues. The results will be disseminated to allow for adding new functions to
the existing nanotechnology in materials characterization. As a broad
educational component of this project, the comprehensive research program will
benefit graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with integrated
training opportunities in materials science, biomechanics, and nanotechnology in
both classroom and research labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
