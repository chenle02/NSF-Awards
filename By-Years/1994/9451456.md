9451456 Williams This project proposes to upgrade the teaching of NMR in organic
chemistry, analytical chemistry & physical chemistry and facilitate
undergraduate research, through the replacement of computer- simulations and
photocopies with hand-on use of an FT-NMR Spectrometer by students. The organic
chemistry lab will be divided into "mini-research" projects all of which will
employ NMR for the characterization of products and the analysis of reaction
mixtures. Students in Quantitative analysis will observe a single signal for 2
exchangeable protons and relate it to the concentration of the mixture.
Instrumental Analysis students will determine the signal to noise ratio and
resolution under various experimental conditions. In the Physical Chemistry lab
NMR will be integral in experiments involving relaxation times, magnetic
susceptibility and inorganic synthesis. Implementation of this project will
considerably affect the level of education offered by the Chemistry Program at
Francis Marion University.
