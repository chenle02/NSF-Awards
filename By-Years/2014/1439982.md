Roughly 70 million Americans suffer from chronic pain - more than from diabetes,
heart disease and cancer combined. Yet the fundamental causes of pain are still
not understood and patients are left with few treatment options other than the
administration of opiates and closely related drugs. Opioids, however, often
lead to the development of tolerance and dependence, and are thus severely
limited in their treatment efficacy. With nearly 7 million Americans abusing
prescription painkillers), a push from the sphere of basic research toward
clinical applications is now more pressing than ever. The development of safe
opioid analgesics is at the forefront of this
ambition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's objective is two-fold: 1) uncover
details in the pain signaling mechanism of the µ-opioid receptor (µ-OR) - a key
protein in the management of pain in the body - and push the development of non-
addictive opioid analgesics, and 2) develop a technology that will enable the
study of similarly large and complex biological systems by other research groups
in the scientific community.
