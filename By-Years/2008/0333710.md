This Targeted Research project is conducting market research that evaluates what
content and services the NSDL needs to offer to attract and thus support itself
at least in part with subscriptions paid by academic libraries. A second strand
of activity is developing a prototype service that integrates NSDL into the
foundational science collections managed by libraries. The prototype includes
tools that enable libraries to create views of their integrated science
collections customized to the needs of different patrons. Work on this aspect of
the project is informing the modifications that the NSDL and its collection
providers may need to make to their technical architectures to enable them to
better support integration into academic library collections, thus enhancing
NSDL's value in the library market. This project leverages the considerable
digital library infrastructure and expertise that resides with the California
Digital Library (CDL) and the ten University of California research libraries.
Because these libraries operate highly diverse technical environments, service
deployment and evaluation is taking place in a test bed setting representative
of the heterogeneous technical environments that characterize academic libraries
in general.
