The purpose of this research is to analyze four separate, but related topics
dealing with asset markets. (1) This part will involve time-series modeling of
the stock and bond markets and their relations to the macro economy. The
correlation between returns in the stock and bond markets will be examined to
see to what to extent it is consistent with efficient markets models. (2)
Markets for single family homes will be modeled and analyzed in the second part
of this project. The degree to which this market may be considered efficient
will be better specified. (3) Direct study of investor behavior will be
undertaken using questionnaire-survey experimental methods, with the objective
of learning how institutions can be modified to help serve the public better.
For example, the reasons for the failure of the CPI futures markets and markets
for other indexed instruments will be studied. (4) If and important event occurs
in the financial markets, like the stock market crash of 1987, data will
immediately be collected and analyzed regarding investor behavior during the
crisis period. This project is important because it will shed important new
light on the operations of stock, bond and housing markets.
