Among physical interactions, gravitation plays a unique role because it applies
to all forms of matter and energy, it determines the structure of space and
time, and it is believed to be dominant at the very largest and very smallest
physical scales. At small scales gravity and quantum theory must be combined
consistently, a major unfinished goal of physics for many years. Significant
clues as to how this can occur may well be embodied in the thermal quantum
radiance of black holes. A major objective of this project is to exploit and
deepen recently obtained new understanding of the statistical and quantum
physics associated with black hole radiance. Productive application of gravity
theory to large scale systems, including unusual stars and star systems, and
further advances in recent explorations seeking a quantum theory of gravity both
depend strongly on an accurate implementation of a subset of Einstein's
equations called the constraints. The current understanding of the constraints
will be applied in new ways to problems of both the above types. One major
application will be calculation of possible initial configurations of two black
holes as they begin an orbiting encounter. Such collisions are expected to
produce gravity waves that should be detectable by experiments in the 1990's.
