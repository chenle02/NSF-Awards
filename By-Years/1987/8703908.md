Cure composition, kinetics, mechanism, molecular mobility, and mechanical
properties of several cross-linked polymers will be characterized by using
molecular sensors in the form of a reactive diamine-type dye to mimic the
reactivities of an aromatic diamine in epoxy, polyimide and polyurea. The
changes produced in the UV-VIS spectra and fluorescence behavior by these dyes
will provide information on cure compposition and kinetics. In polyimides it
will be possible for the first time to distinguish amic acid-imide from di-
imide; the kinetics of imidization can thus be obtained with greater detail than
is currently possible by any other spectroscopic technique. We also propose to
synthesize new sensors to be applied to the above systems in order to further
improve spectal separation. Then, photoisomerization of the labels and the probe
molecule will be studied to characterize molecular mobility and free volume
during cure. Mechanical and physical properties of crosslinked polymers will be
measured as a function of cure composition, extent of reaction, or chain end
concentration, in order to establish composition-structure-property
correlations. The basic scientific information obtainable from this research
will enable this molecular sensor technique to be utilized for "in-process" cure
monitoring of high performance composite materials via fiber-optic techiques.
