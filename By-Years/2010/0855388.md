This is an award for a research program in cosmic ray astrophysics focused on
the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), an instrument designed to investigate the
origin and nature of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays having energies above
10^19 eV. Data from the PAO will help to answer a number of the most fundamental
questions about cosmic ray origins, composition, acceleration mechanisms, and
propagation effects and may shed light on hadronic physics at center-of-mass
energies up to 450 TeV.

This group has led the development of the offline analysis software framework
and made contributions to physics analysis. They plan to continue their role in
software development and to extend their analysis efforts using new data.

The broader impact of the program includes the development of technologies and
methodologies which cross domains such as connections with computer science and
laboratory-based particle physics, and a vigorous outreach program involving
regular newspaper, radio, and television appearances in several countries.
