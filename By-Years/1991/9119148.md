This award supports studies to obtain high precision bulk and trace element and
mineral chemistry data on a large suite of Antarctic ordinary chondrite
meteorites. These data will serve the dual purpose of proper characterization of
these samples and determination of the reality of resolvable compositional
differences between Antarctic finds and non-Antarctic observed falls. This work
will include high-precision instrumental neutron activation analysis studies of
25 elements in 24 Victoria Land H- chondrites. To eliminate run-specific
analytical biases, H- chondrite falls will be included in each neutron
activation run, and to improve precision, each meteorite will be analyzed in
duplicate. The electron probe data will focus on the existence of additional
ordinary chondrites with properties intermediate between those of established
groups. These data will help in determining the existence of additional ordinary
chondrite groups.
