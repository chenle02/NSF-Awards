This award will partially support a group from the University of Arizona,
working in high energy physics. The group is participating in the construction
and testing of the electronics for the calorimeter of the D0 detector, a general
purpose detector to be installed at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at the end of
1990. Of the physics topics to be covered by this detector, the group intends to
concentrate on quark compositeness, symmetry violation, heavy quark physics and
Higgs searches. The group also intends to be involved in the detector
development for one of the large new detector to be used in the future with the
Superconducting Super Collider.
