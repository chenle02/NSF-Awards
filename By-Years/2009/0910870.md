This project will continue work on the development of methods for the
development of solid-phase motifs (disks, monoliths) for reusable and
regenerable main-group and transition-metal reagents/catalysts as well as the
development of practical asymmetric routes to optically active targets using
resin-bound asymmetric pyrrolidine catalysts in enamine-mediated reactions.
Adaptation of organometallic mediated processes to the solid state can provide
physical segregation of products from reagents, regeneration and reuse of
reagents, and the development of flow-through methodologies. Development of
resin-bound asymmetric pyrrolidine catalysts which facilitate recoverability and
reusability as well as expedite syntheses through microwave-assisted reactions
will address a growing need for effective and versatile applications of
organocatalysis. These specific aims fit squarely into and are united by the
monikers 'reactive polymer' and 'green chemistry'.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professors Mark J. Kurth and Neil E. Schore of the Department of
Chemistry at University of California-Davis. Professors Kurth and Schore's
research efforts revolve around the investigation of reactive polymers in
organic synthesis. Their research could expand the scope of solid-phase
strategies in multi-step organic synthesis and solve problems that cannot be
readily solved in other ways. Multi-step organic synthesis is required in the
manufacture of many prescription drugs.
