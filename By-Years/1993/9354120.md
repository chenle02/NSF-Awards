9354120 Ford Southern University and A&amp;M College System (SUS) proposes to
continue to make Southern University and A&amp;M College at Baton Rouge (SUBR) a
Model Institution for Excellence (MIE) in science, engineering, and mathematics
(SEM) education and research. SUBR's quantified objectives include (a) the
yearly production of 400 and 640, natural science, mathematics, and engineering
(NSEM) and SEM graduates respectively, by 1998; (b) a measurable enhancement of
the quality of SEM programs, infrastructure, and specially of SEM graduates; and
(c) the guiding of at least 200 of its SEM graduates to the successful pursuit
of SEM graduate degrees, with emphasis on the Ph.D. These outcome-objectives
will be attained through process-objectives consisting of involving and getting
input and support from partners that include the National Science Foundation,
State and federal governments, private industry, and the precollege and Ph.D.
program communities. These objectives are direct corollaries of the mission of
Southern University and A&amp;M College. This mission comprises quality
instruction, research and development, and public and professional service. The
development of the detailed strategic plan will address the following: (1)
reassertion of the objectives; (2) the development of premises to include the
reassessment of internal and external factors and trends; (3) the decisions or
the selection of strategies; (4) the details of the implementation, with time
table and measures of success; and (5) the monitoring, evaluation, and related
adjustments and updating. Existing plans, reports, and the content of the
literature will constitute key instruments.
