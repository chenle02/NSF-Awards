Trends in the design of high-performance computing systems are making them more
difficult to use effectively. This EAGER award focuses on the problem of
managing massive parallelism while effectively exploiting locality. Its goal is
to develop breakthrough techniques for parallel runtime systems that will
support libraries, applications, and other software infrastructure on the next
generation of high-performance systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to
develop the Parallel Runtime Scheduling and Execution Control system (PaRSEC),
which will serve as a prototype for novel ideas about parallel runtime systems.
The PI's approach will be based on scalable directed acyclic graph (DAG)
scheduling techniques that will track data dependencies between tasks. The
scheduling structures will be designed to handle billions of tasks running on
millions of computational nodes. The scheduling framework will also have to
handle task migration and load balancing to maximize parallelism while
preserving data locality. The prototypes developed as part of this EAGER will
provide the foundation for future research on parallel linear algebra routines
for extreme-scale computing systems.
