Dr. Trant wants to conduct a comparative study of the production of androgen, a
male hormone, in the testis of two different species of elasmobranch.
Elasmobranchs are vertebrate animals that represent an evolutionary important
taxon of fish. Here he will develop molecular probes as one of the requisite
molecular biology techniques to analyze the enzymes involved. The results of
these studies will greatly enhance our understanding in the area of reproductive
endocrinology.
