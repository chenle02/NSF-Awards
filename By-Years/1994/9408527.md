9408527 Green The PIs will convene a workshop in February 1994 at Lake
Arrowhead, CA, to bring together about 20 researchers from the different fields
within geophysics that are studying the different aspects of deep-focus
earthquakes. This workshop will be run as part of the CSEDI initiative, and may
result in the submission of one or more collaborative interdisciplinary research
proposals within that initiative. ****
