The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to significantly improve the quality of life
for people with hearing impairments. Hearing loss affects more than 37 million
people in the US each year, accounting for 15% of the adult population. The
cochlear implant (type of hearing aid) market is estimated at $2 B. This project
will develop an implantable hearing aid with improved differentiated speech,
sounds, music, and acoustic nuances of daily life. The objective is to address
current technical limitations with a technologically superior solution enabling
improved pitch specificity and speech perception. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the
feasibility of a circuit design to significantly increase the capabilities of
hearing aids by eliminating the current data constraints of conventional wire
bundle cochlear electrodes. A novel electrical circuit design will be fabricated
on a thin-film platform using standard manufacturing equipment. These prototypes
will undergo electrical bench tests of performance, reliability, and mechanical
tests indicative of implanted patient conditions. This product will improve
pitch specificity and speech perception by increasing data processed to enable
hearing at higher resolution across a wider frequency range. Moreover, the
design enables significant manufacturing improvements with automated
semiconductor fabrication processes that significantly reduce production costs
and improve product consistency over current hand-made cochlear implant
electrodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
