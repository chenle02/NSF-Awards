Gravitational collapse driven by the excessive potential energy of the
lithosphere owing to over thickened crust or deep thermal perturbations is
believed to be the primary mechanism for Tertiary extension in the North
American Cordillera. The objective of this project is to constrain the major
parameters controlling gravitational collapse and their possible implications
for tertiary tectonics in the Cordillera. The research will combine geological
and geophysical evidence from the Cordillera with physical modeling. The major
processes to be investigated, such as rheologic stratification, localized strain
softening and mechanical decoupling between rheological layers, are critical to
the evolution of all continents. Insight gained from this research should have
broad implications for continental tectonics.
