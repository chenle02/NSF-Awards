This grant supports the education symposium of the April 2004 Spring Meeting of
the Materials Research Society (MRS). The symposium title is "Educating
Tomorrow's Scientists and Engineers". This symposium has run continuously since
1996, it is currently held every 18 months at the Fall or Spring MRS meeting.
This year's symposium includes sessions on innovating teaching through the
introduction of, among others, nanoscience and nanotechnology to the
undergraduate curriculum, teaching&lt;br/&gt;computational materials and
improving the programs available to the K-12 curriculum. Symposium attendees
include educators from four-year colleges and universities, people associated
with industry, and people who work closely with K-12 teachers. Both
undergraduate and graduate students can benefit form an improved curriculum. In
the K-12 area, materials researchers can benefit from education partnerships
with teachers that introduce materials science in the physics and chemistry pre-
college curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
