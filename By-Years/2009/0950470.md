Martin Wikelski 0950470 Integrative Migration Biology
Symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people are familiar with the phenomenon of
migration, though they may not realize how important it is. Migration has been
called a keystone behavior by some researchers because of the large effects that
migratory animals have on their ecosystems. One of the main goals of this
meeting is to bring together researchers who are trying to understand how and
why animals migrate so that biologists can understand, for example, how to
conserve salmon in the Pacific Northwest and how migrants may affect the spread
of the avian flu. The best way to answer these important questions is to perform
integrative research on migration, which combines, among other things, multiple
scientific disciplines (such as meteorology, genetics, physiology, and
behavior), many different species, and laboratory-based and field-based studies.
This meeting and the associated travel grants are designed to attract students
and post-doctoral researchers interested in migration from all over the world,
which is appropriate since migration is a global phenomenon. The meeting will
allow these young investigators to mingle with the speakers and other
researchers who are committed to performing integrative migration biology. The
students will also have the opportunity to present their own research in
coordinated sessions. Individuals who are not able to attend the meeting will be
able to gain insights about migration biology through papers authored by the
speakers and published in the journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology, a
high-impact, well-read journal. Overall, this meeting is designed to increase
the visibility of integrative migration biology and promote integrative projects
that will lead to a deeper understanding of a phenomenon that has puzzled both
children and adults everywhere for hundreds of years: how and why do animals
migrate?
