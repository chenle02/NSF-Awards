This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to focus on
the formation of grain-oriented (textured) lead-free piezoelectric and
dielectric ceramics for various electroceramic and transducer applications. The
overall objective of this project will be to produce lead-free ceramics with
high piezoelectric performance, and demonstrate that these materials can be used
in existing actuator/transducer designs, especially for applications currently
using lead-based ceramics.

The broader impacts will be the elimination of lead-based compositions, such as
lead zirconate titanate (PZT), there are no commercially available lead-free
compositions that possess comparable properties to PZT. Beyond the commercial
effect, lead is known to be toxic, so commercial products containing lead
present serious health and environmental hazards at both a local and global
level. Therefore, there is a substantial need for a high performance, lead-free
piezoelectric ceramic with properties comparable to lead-based compositions in
order to sustain the growth of piezoelectric transducers and sensor market,
while meeting the many environmental and health needs.
