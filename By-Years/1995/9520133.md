9520133 Parris With the transition from a command to a marketized economy in
China, a growing class of private and individual business operators has emerged
in both the rural and urban areas. This Research Planning Grant study seeks to
reconstruct the ways that private business owners in china conceptualize
citizenship and their own roles and competencies as citizens through the use of
Q-methodology. Citizenship is defined as the privileges and duties attached to
full membership in the community. Private business owner refers to those
individuals whose income is largely (though not wholly) dependent on self
employment in industrial or commercial spheres and who define themselves as
private or individual entrepreneurs. Two stages of research will be undertaken.
The first stage is an intensive ethnographic examination of the current
discourse on citizenship among private and individual entrepreneurs. This stage
involves semi- structured interviews and careful analysis of documentary
resources, including newspapers, journals, books and manuscripts. This
ethnographic research forms the basis for Q-sort method which allows the
researcher to model selected entrepreneurs reactions to a set of statements
about citizenship. With this methodology the researcher explores the subjective
understanding of selected individuals in a way that is constrained by
statistical results. While the initial need is for description and definition,
the long term goal is an unfolding comparative study on citizenship and business
ownership that attempts to establish the role of political culture in the
process of democratization. ***
