The project will seek efficient algorithms for extracting the structure of
interaction networks: systems consisting of finite populations of elements in
which the state of each element may change as a result of interactions with a
small set of other elements according to specific rules of interaction. Such
networks are ubiquitous in the physical and social sciences, and include
standard models such as Boolean circuits, Bayesian networks, social networks,
chemical systems, gene regulation networks, and epidemiological models of the
spread of disease. The research carried out will apply methods of active
learning based on recent progress by the principal investigators on determining
the structure of certain kinds of Boolean, analog and probabilistic circuits and
social networks using experiments.
