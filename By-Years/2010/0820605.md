CBET-0820605&lt;br/&gt;Chiu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides partial
support for the Advanced Thermal Processing Workshop, which will be held in
conjunction with the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress &amp;
Exposition on October 31 - November 6, 2008. The purpose of this meeting is to
bring together an international group of researchers to discuss emerging topics
in manufacturing and materials processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to
the intellectual merit of the workshop, there has been a lot of attention
addressed to advanced manufacturing processes over the last decade, especially
with regard to thermal transport. These issues, however, have not recently been
discussed at any single venue. This workshop will bring together a wide variety
of researchers, from within and outside the field of thermal transport, to
discuss their latest findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
workshop include enabling researchers in the traditional mechanical engineering
fields to interact with the invited speakers from outside these areas. The
workshop will be advertised on the internet, and the reports will also be
disseminated through the internet. It is anticipated that both new research
directions, and new international collaborations, will result.
