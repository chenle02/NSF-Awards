Most complex quantitative traits, such as growth rate, virulence, disease
susceptibility, ageing or longevity, are actually multivariate trait suites
comprised of smaller, individual elements. The evolution of such complex trait
suites is predicted to be affected by the number of genes contributing to
(co)variation within the trait suite, the strength and additivity of gene
effects, and the degree and nature of interactions among these genes (i.e., the
genetic architecture of the trait suite). Unfortunately, the genetic
architecture of variation in complex, quantitative traits is largely unknown.
The proposed research employs a novel introgression approach to isolate genomic
regions responsible for variation in wing shape between two closely related
Drosophila species. These regions will be identified by using a genome-wide,
fine scale mapping approach. By combining this introgression and mapping
approach, this research promises to reveal the complex, fine-scale genetic
architecture of a model quantitative trait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research program represents a new way of studying the genetics of complex trait
suites in animals and consequently, it will deliver methodologies that can be
used to pry open elusive genetic architectures underlying variation in complex
traits in other biological systems. This will generate the empirical data that
are sorely needed to test predictions of the nascent, generalizable theory of
development and evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
