This project will examine how children's ability to explore different movement
patterns affects their ability to learn new motor skills. This project will
enhance basic understanding of the differences between how children and adults
learn to acquire such motor skills, which will provide theoretical insight into
how the brain organizes movement and learning. The knowledge gained from this
project has important implications for how learning and rehabilitation paradigms
should be customized for children, especially in cases of movement disorders
such as cerebral palsy. The project will also include an outreach component to
involve middle and high-school students in STEM research. Because children are
not simply smaller versions of adults, rehabilitation programs must be tailored
in age-specific manners; by adopting a developmental focus, this research will
facilitate the creation of such child-appropriate
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there is evidence that children and
adults differ in terms of motor learning, the mechanisms underlying these
differences are poorly understood. The investigators hypothesize that motor
exploration--the ability to generate different movement patterns--may play a
critical role in this difference. This project examines the role of motor
exploration in motor learning with a specific focus on how this relation changes
with development during childhood. Specifically, the investigators attempt to
answer three research questions: (1) how does motor exploration during learning
change with development, (2) how does age mediate the relation between motor
exploration and learning, and (3) can practice schedules that modify motor
exploration be used to facilitate learning? The investigators use a novel
paradigm called a body-machine interface to minimize typical confounds (such as
body size and strength) to compare motor learning across different age groups.
This research will contribute to a more elaborated understanding of how children
acquire complex motor skills during development.
