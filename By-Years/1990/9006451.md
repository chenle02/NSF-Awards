In mammals generally, and in meadow voles in particular, males tend to move
greater distances than females between their place of birth and the location of
their initial breeding attempt. Considerable controversy exists over the cause
or causes of this pattern of movement known as male-biased natal dispersal. One
explanation, the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis, states that the sexes move
different distances to avoid mating with close relatives because of the
potentially deleterious effects of inbreeding. A second possibility, the
competition- for-mates hypothesis, suggests that competition among males for
mates causes male-biased dispersal. This study proposes to experimentally
examine these 2 hypotheses. Laboratory-reared meadow voles will be released into
small, uniform patches of grassland habitat, and their dispersal from these
patches will be monitored. Sibling groups will be released into some plots and
non-sibling groups into other plots. These groups will consist of either 3 males
and 1 female or 3 females and 1 male. Greater dispersal from patches containing
siblings will support inbreeding avoidance as a cause of dispersal patterns in
mammals, whereas dispersal from patches with male-biased sex ratios will suggest
competition for mates is important. This proposed study is one of the first to
test experimentally these 2 hypotheses. It should provide valuable information
concerning why male mammals tend to disperse greater distance than females.
