This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Ten students per year
will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a unique twelve-week summer
experience at a U.S. federal laboratory. This program leverages the resources of
two federal agencies (NSF and NIST) to foster an undergraduate research program
that gives students access to state-of-the-art equipment and world-recognized
researchers. Student participants will engage in cutting-edge research in topics
such as intelligent systems, manufacturing metrology, precision engineering, and
manufacturing systems integration. The program will serve to encourage
undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the
nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers. It is anticipated that this REU Site will
have a Broader Impact on the nations need for increased participation of
citizens and permanent residents from demographic groups traditionally
underrepresented in the science and engineering research enterprise.
