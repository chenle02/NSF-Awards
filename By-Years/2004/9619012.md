9619012 Fisher This three year project seeks to improve mathematics, science
and technology education by integrating the use of systems thinking and dynamic
computer modeling into the high school curriculum. Building on an earlier
project, this effort expands the project's role in serving Oregon and adds
national centers to serve other regions. Forty teachers are trained each year,
31 from Oregon and 9 from national sites. The focus of the twelve-day summer
session and three-day follow-up are on systems thinking, dynamic computer
modeling using STELLA software and other tools, and instructional approaches
applying these concepts and skills in ways that are appropriate for diverse
students populations. Other features include an extensive plan for on-going
support and the expansion and formalization of an accessible cross-and single-
disciplinary library of models. A WWW site and the Creative Learning Exchange
are used as additional dissemination tools. Cost sharing is 38%
