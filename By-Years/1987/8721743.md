This proposal aims at studying the mode of regulation of catabolic and anabolic
genes in Pseudomonas with a view to determining which nucleotide sequences are
critical for the transcription of downstream gene(s). The systems to be studied
comprise the structural and regulatory genetic regions of (i) the clc cluster, a
group of plasmid-borne genes involved in the degradation of Chlorocatechol; (ii)
the catBC operon, a tightly-linked cluster of two chromosomal genes involved in
the degradation of catechol; and (iii) the alg cluster, a group of chromosomal
genes involved in the biosynthesis of a polysaccharide alginate. We propose to
delineate the critical nucleotides in the upstream regions of the clcABD, catBC
and algD gene clusters by altering specific nucleotides at various locations by
site directed mutagenesis and then examining the effects of such alterations on
the expression of the downstream genes. In order to detect other critical
nucleotides at other locations, nonspecific mutagenesis will be used to alter
upstream nucleotides at random and the effects of such alterations will be
noted. Since many regulatory genes controlling structural gene expression in a
positive manner are known to interact at upstream sequences between 50 and 100
nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site, the products of algR,
clcR and catR genes will be purified after hyperproduction and their interaction
with the upstream sequences at -50 to -100 regions will be studied by
footprinting and electrophoretic protein DNA binding assays. These experiments
should provide us with a wealth of information on the nature of gene regulation
in Pseudomonas, a bacterial species which is occasionally a human pathogen, in
some cases an important plant pathogen, and in other cases is being exploited to
an increasing degree for industrial purposes.
