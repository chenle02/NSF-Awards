9415552 Mathis This is a three year project to produce an enhanced TCP to
support high performance applications over national scale, high latency, high
bandwidth networks. The basic purpose is to eliminate TCP as a bottleneck for
this environment. The three parts of the proposal are developing tools for
validating TCP implementations, developing a simulator for use over production
networks, and developing and testing TCP enhancements.
