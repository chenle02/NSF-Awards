This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a renovation
project to provide infrastructure improvements needed to expand the existing
Extreme Light Laboratory into a multi-disciplinary shared core facility, the
High Power Laser Science Collaboratory (HPLSC). It will house a new multi-
terawatt laser with distinct new capabilities (built by UNL physicists using an
existing $3 million investment from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research)
and five laboratories to support laser science investigators. The HPLSC will
further enable investigations in relativistic optics and strongly relativistic
nonlinear optics, anticipated to result in a deeper understanding of optical
physics and the development of novel extreme radiation sources and advanced
accelerators. The new laser's bandwidth of 1-100keV will provide unique
opportunities to characterize the electronic structure of materials and provide
new insight into their physical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HPLSC will
enable UNL to extend the use of these unique capabilities to internal and
external interdisciplinary teams working on the development of applications in
molecular, optical, plasma and nuclear physics, materials science and
biomedicine. The HPLSC will provide research and training opportunities for the
next generation of researchers in physics, engineering, chemistry and
biochemistry, and initially extend access to 10 faculty researchers, 10
postdoctoral researchers, 29 graduate students and 13 undergraduate students.
HPLSC affiliated researchers actively participate in UNL efforts to broaden
participation in science and engineering by offering meaningful research
opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on increasing
opportunities underrepresented groups.
