Strategic, operational, and real-time control decisions are often made without
complete information about the effects of these decisions. Stochastic
programming models incorporate this uncertainty explicitly into the decision-
making process. These models quantify uncertainty into distributional
information on key model parameters and address an objective that reflects the
goals and risk sensitivity of the decision maker. Advances in the theory
supporting the models and in computer implementations of this theory have
brought stochastic programming to the threshold of widespread, practical use.
The International Conference on Stochastic Programming will further this
development by bringing together the leading researchers in the field to share
their individual findings, to gain insights from the exchange of ideas, and to
focus on selected applications that can benefit from stochastic programming.
This conference will continue the field's strong tradition of truly
international cooperation by including scientists from around the world.
