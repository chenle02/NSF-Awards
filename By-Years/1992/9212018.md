Given a multicomputer program, its input and target architecture, we want to
predict the synchronization strategy resulting in the fastest simulation of the
program. Simulators are often present in environments facilitating parallel
program design. In addition, they are used to compare the performance of
different parallel architectures on a given program. In both instances, speeding
up the simulator's execution decreases development time of parallel programs.
The major emphasis of this research is on comparing different synchronization
strategies for multicomputer simulations. The project will proceed in two
stages. First, a simple multicomputer simulation paradigm having a few
communication primitives and a simple timing model will be used. Methods for
predicting the execution times for this paradigm using both analytical and
empirical techniques will be developed. Together with sequential simulation, a
variety of parallel synchronization strategies, such as synchronous, time-
driven, asynchronous, and hybrid strategies will be considered. Second, more
complex multicomputer simulators, including additional communication primitives
and more complex timing models will be investigated.
