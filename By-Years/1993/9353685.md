9353685 McKenney I recommend that we continue for one year the grant to AACC
which underlies the AACC/NSF Fellows Program and which will generate a pool of
outstanding community college faculty in science and engineering for
participation in activities that are of service to community colleges and
improve the design of NSF programs such as those in technician education, human
resource development, dissemination, and systemic change. I recommend the
requested budget of $56,822. ***
