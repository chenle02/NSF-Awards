The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes high quality data that indicates a
population?s sense of well-being and environmental safety--two essential factors
in the effort for long-term sustainability. MindRider and Multimer collect and
analyze human signals at the neighborhood, town, city, and regional scale, thus
providing proactive, standardized, geospatial, real-time information to improve
both personal mobility and urban monitoring. MindRider and Multimer can help
overcome limitations in two prevalent monitoring methods: 1) A reactive
methodology for quantifying danger is to count accidents. While government-
collected accident data is often reliable and includes many years' worth of
information, it does not provide precise spatial details such as direction of
movement. Most importantly, an injury or fatality must occur before a statistic
is produced, which therefore misses all the non-reported minor injuries, as well
as perceptions of danger. 2) Many researchers use qualitative instruments like
surveys and interviews to study perceptions of safety without the occurrence of
an accident But while qualitative methods are highly valuable, these methods
cannot be deployed continuously, are often not geospatial, and their results may
not be standardized.

The proposed project addresses the challenges that stakeholders like
transportation planners and real estate analysts encounter as they monitor rapid
change in cities and towns. For these stakeholders, improved data helps to
reduce the complexity, cost, and risk of site selection decisions like choosing
the location for a store, transit hub, outdoor advertisement, home, or office.
Existing location analysis tools show similar kinds of evaluations for very
different neighborhoods, based on limited data that doesn't often change.
MindRider, which pairs custom ergonomic biosensors with GPS-enabled smartphones
to record EEG and location data, and Multimer, which categorizes and analyzes
MindRider data against existing geographic inputs, has the potential to provide
key insights for data-driven decision making. We have built the basic system to
collect and analyze geolocated biosensor data and have proven the technical
feasibility of collecting these data from a pilot sample population for an
extended period of time. Our primary objective for Phase I is to improve our
data modeling and analysis--with a focus on affective interpretation, biosensor
comparison, geospatial and temporal statistics, and reproducibility--so as to
offer a fully robust product that stakeholders will confidently integrate into
their existing workflows.
