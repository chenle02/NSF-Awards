The foci of this research are the preparation and characterization of a variety
of linear perphenyl acenes and numerous macrocyclic and branched polyphenyl
aromatics. The key steps in the syntheses of the former class are Diels-Alder
reactions of polyphenyl arynes and dienes. Syntheses of the latter compounds
will depend heavily on the reactions of aromatic alkynes and polyphenyl arynes
with an array of polyphenylcyclopentadienones. The ease of synthesis, ease of
derivatization, well-defined conformation, great stability and excellent
solubility properties make the compounds excellent candidates for study and
application. Applications for use in electrochemical, photochemical and host-
guest purposes will be probed. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert A. Pascal of the Department of
Chemistry at Princeton University. Professor Pascal will focus his work on the
preparation and characterization of very large polyphenyl aromatic compounds.
These compounds have potential for having great value in electrochemical,
photochemical and host-guest applications.
