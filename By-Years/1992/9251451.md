This project provides equipment (e.g., computers, programmable instrumentation,
commercial robots, and computer-aided design packages) to develop the capability
to modernize and enhance the undergraduate laboratories in control and robotics.
A set of relatively complex experimental test-beds in control and robotics is
being developed. These experiments will be developed and utilized as design
projects for undergraduate students. The primary objectives of the projects are
: to increase the exposure of the students to modern programmable
instrumentation and a PC-based laboratory by increasing the number of stations;
to provide state-of-the-art computer controlled instrumentation and a set of
advanced design experiments; and to introduce students to CAD software for
analysis and design.
