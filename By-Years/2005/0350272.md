This research project follows 300 Mandarin-speaking children in
Beijing,&lt;br/&gt;China, who will be tested at yearly intervals from 8 months
to 5-1/2&lt;br/&gt;years of age. Our goals are to describe basic patterns of
language&lt;br/&gt;development in Mandarin Chinese as well as to examine how
different&lt;br/&gt;aspects of language development interact over time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandarin is the language of focus for this research not
only because of&lt;br/&gt;the current under-availability of data on the language
spoken by the&lt;br/&gt;world's largest population, but also because specific
features of&lt;br/&gt;Mandarin phonology, vocabulary, and syntax differ
enormously and in&lt;br/&gt;theoretically interesting ways from English. Several
of these issues&lt;br/&gt;have been examined independently in small samples of
children and&lt;br/&gt;results from these studies have already posed major
challenges to&lt;br/&gt;existing theories of how children learn their native
language.&lt;br/&gt;Replicating and extending these findings in a large,
representative&lt;br/&gt;sample will allow for much stronger universal theories
of language&lt;br/&gt;acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sample of children
to be investigated in this study is unique and&lt;br/&gt;exemplary in child
language acquisition in terms of its size, diversity&lt;br/&gt;across gender and
socioeconomic groups, representativeness across&lt;br/&gt;different levels of
linguistic abilities, and in the wealth of&lt;br/&gt;linguistic and background
data sampled. At each wave of data&lt;br/&gt;collection, children's
phonological, lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic&lt;br/&gt;development will be
measured, allowing for the investigation of specific&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses with
powerful statistical modeling techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
