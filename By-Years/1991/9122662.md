This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program, is divided into five areas: 1) reductive coupling of linear
ligands (CO, CNR, etc.) by early transition metal compounds, 2) chemistry of
recently discovered paramagnetic, trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(III) complexes,
and especially possible alkyl derivatives, 3) conjugate addition chemistry
employing new copper and silver coordination complexes as catalysts, 4) metal
complexes of binucleating phosphand ligands (macrocyclic ligands in which some
donors are phosphorus), and 5) oxidative coupling reactions, especially of
water, in polymetallic oxo complexes. %%% The research to be performed in this
project is concerned with the fundamental structures and reactivities of
inorganic and organometallic compounds. Knowledge obtained here will likely
impact on a number of areas including catalysis, synthesis of fine chemicals,
reaction mechanisms of biological molecules and solar energy conversion.
