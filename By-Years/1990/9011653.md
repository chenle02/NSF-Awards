This research is concerned with the antecedents of mood, affect, and optimism,
and the effects of these factors on subsequent behavior. The research is to be
undertaken by two of the very best investigators in this line of work. Their
past research is highly respected and widely cited. The underlying assumption of
the research is that affect, mood, and optimism is tied to the individual's
perception of the rate at which he or she is progressing toward a desired goal.
Developmental and applied promises to detail not only the antecedents of mood
and optimism, but also the effects of these transient (in the case of mood) or
chronic dispositional (in the case of optimism) features on the behavior of the
individual. The fundamental gains to be realized in this research are
impressive. Equally impressive are the implications of this set of
investigations for applied research (e.g., on health). All in all, this set of
investigations presents an ideal blend of basic, applied, and developmental
research approaches, all focused on an important topic, by highly qualified
researchers. The program of research promises to tell us much of the manner in
which personal factors influence the fundamental status of the human organism.
