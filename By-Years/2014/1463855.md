This project will provide a service to the Earth Science community by organizing
historic magnetotelluric data into an openly available and searchable database.
At present, magnetotelluric data from historical observational campaigns are not
widely or easily available. Thus, a researcher planning an experiment is
typically unaware of these data, with very limited (or no) access to previous
data from the same or nearby areas, except through the published literature.
More complete and free access to these previous results would be a great asset
in planning an observational campaign and would enhance the outcomes of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetotellurics is a geophysical method for
inferring the earth's subsurface electrical conductivity from measurements of
natural geomagnetic and geoelectric field variation at the Earth's surface.
Magnetotelluric data enable studies of Earth's deep crustal structure,
investigating the distribution of silicate melts in the crust and mantle, and
earthquake precursor research. Commercial uses of the data include oil and gas
exploration, geothermal exploration, mineral exploration, and groundwater
monitoring.
