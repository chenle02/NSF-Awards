This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Lynn C. Francesconi of the Chemistry Department,
Hunter College-City University of New York. The bonding, structure, and
reactivity of technitium-oxygen compounds would be investigated. During the
planning period, two strategies for incorporating Tc, and its congener Re, into
polyoxoanions of molybdenum and tungsten would be attempted. Successful
completion of this preliminary research would allow work to proceed on synthesis
of a wide variety of compounds containing technitium-oxygen bonds. A long-term
goal of research in this area is to enable the separation or immobilization of
technetium, which has a long-lived isotope common in nuclear waste site
contaminants, in borosilicate or phosphate glasses.
