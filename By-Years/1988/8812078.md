This project is for study of temporal variation of 3He/4He on Gran Canaria,
Canary Islands. A variety of phenocrysts types throughout the stratigraphic
section at Gran Canaria will be studied. Results will provide constraints of
different magma types at Gran Canaria. Geochronology of the samples will be
attempted using (U + Th)/ He and compared with Argon ages already available. %%%
Helium isotopes provide an important constraint on the source of magmas
generated in the lithosphere and upper mantle. The study at Gran Canaria is
especially important because isotope data presently available is inconsistent
with geophysical data relating to the Canary hot spot.
