Dr. Laurie J. Butler is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the time evolution of molecular dissociation
processes from electronically excited molecules. These measurements will allow
for an enhanced detailed understanding of how molecules decompose and form
various sub-molecular moieties or of how chemical species react with other
systems. The initial experiments use polarized emission spectroscopy, which
measures the wavelength and polarization of the photons emitted during
dissociation, to probe the change in the nuclear dynamics induced by forces at a
conical intersecton along the dissociative pathway. Professor Butler focuses on
determining the change in the dissociation dynamics and the branching between
energetically allowed fragmentation products induced by 1) the presence of a
conical intersection along the dissociation pathway, 2) the excitation of a
selected vibrationally activated molecule to the electronically dissociative
state, allowing access to the excited potential surface beyond the Franck-Condon
region, and 3) the change in the nonadiabatic coupling between two dissociative
electronic states when a vibrationally excited molecule is promoted to the
dissociative surface.
