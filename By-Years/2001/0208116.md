This project includes the research activities to obtain the stability and
scalability of the inter-domain routing protocols. The proposed research will
not only address issues on the current interdomain routing protocol, Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP), but also develop new interdomain routing protocols that
can facilitate fast convergence and ensure reliability. In enhancing interdomain
routing, robust configuration and traffic engineering capability are the
integral part of the research. This includes fundamental understanding of BGP
capability and investigating the minimum set of extensions to the current BGP.
Robust configuration capability also requires high-level specification of the
network configuration goal. The research team will perform systematic studies of
fundamental issues on interdomain routing, including tradeoffs between traffic
engineering capability and scalability of interdomain routing, routing policy
guidelines to avoid persistent oscillation and the tradeoff between these
guidelines and traffic engineering capability, reducing routing protocol
convergence delay, and enhancing routing reliability by specifying high-level
routing policy semantics. One component of this project is to educate graduate
and undergraduate students on the management and configuration of the networks
as well as to create awareness and interest among students on the issues
surrounding interdomain routing.
