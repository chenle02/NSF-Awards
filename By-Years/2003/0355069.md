This research project focuses on the application of the power of laser cooling
and trapping techniques to a new system - ultracold neutral plasmas. This
represents a completely new mode of neutral plasma confinement, and it will
enable fundamental experiments on strong coupling, recombination, and cold
electron-ion collisions and thermalization. Ultracold neutral plasmas are
produced by photoionizing laser cooled atoms just above the ionization
threshold. A significant fraction of the proposed research will thus involve
characterizing the dynamics of the charged particles. Absorption imaging, a
diagnostic recently demonstrated with ultracold plasmas, will make this
possible. The broader impact involves education of both graduate and
undergraduate students, commitments to diversity and coupling of AMO physics
with plasma physics.
