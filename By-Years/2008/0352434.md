This award supports the development of an inexpensive, compact, high power, and
fully electronically controlled femtosecond laser system operating at 530 nm,
650 nm, 780 nm or 1060 nm. The laser system will be useful for multiphoton
imaging applications in biological research, and in other areas of research
where relatively inexpensive, pulsed laser light will be of use. The funded
effort will explore the use of active electro-optic phase modulation in a loop
configuration as a replacement for the commonly used mode-locking technique. The
source will use entirely linear optics, enabling adjustable pulse repetition
rate and pulse width. The chirp of the output pulse can be electronically tuned
to compensate for the linear dispersion of several meters of optical fiber,
allowing fiber delivery of femtosecond pulses without the use of cumbersome
free-space grating pairs. The proposed research efforts will create "telecom
grade" femtosecond sources that are truly robust and turn-key, and yet preserve
a high degree of flexibility for a wide range of applications in biological
imaging. Broader impacts of the project arise from training of undergraduate and
graduate students, and the potential utility of the laser system in a variety of
research and industrial applications.
