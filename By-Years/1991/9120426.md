This project involves two social scientists studying how rural Mexican families
use remittance funds from migrant workers in the US. Two anthropologists and an
economist will survey households in four peasant villages in Michoacan, Mexico.
Using a combination of ethnographic, in-depth interview techniques and
econometric surveys of household consumption patterns, the project will study
how migration itself changes household values about the sorts of goods consumed.
Most studies of migration and consumption assume that migrants have fixed
economic needs or targets. This project's analysis of how migration changes the
cultural basis of consumption will provide information that will advance our
understanding of why people migrate from Mexico to the US. This understanding is
important as our two nations draw closer together economically.
