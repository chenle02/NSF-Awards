Bark beetles in the genus Ips produce and perceive blends of pheromone
compounds. Ipsenol and ipsdienol are two pheromone and allomone components whose
specificity may guide resource partitioning of the same host pine by sympatric
species in different subgeneric groups. The stereochemistry of ipsdienol is
particularly crucial to the aggregation behavior of I. pini. Because both males
and females respond to male-produced blends of (-)-ipsdienol, the link between
the stereospecificity of response and production can be tested directly by
measuring the production of ipsdienol for each response group. In the sympatric
species I. paraconfusus, the presence or absence of monoterpene precursors may
delineate which hosts can be colonized. The analysis of extract samples using
GC-MS instrumentation and field bioassays on the aggregation behavior of I. pini
will improve understanding of Ips chemical ecology, a subject of great interest
to foresters since bark beetles are serious forest pests.
