The focus of this research is on model-based image sequence estimation and
restoration and implementation using multi- processing. The image estimation is
achieved using extended reduced order model Kalman filter and estimates of
displacement parameters. Simulated annealing type algorithms are explored in
solving the resulting estimation problem. The restoration is achieved by the
incorporation of velocity constraints explicitly into the 3D space-time model.
Finally, the algorithms are implemented on massively parallel computers such as
DAP and MASPAR configured as a linear array.
