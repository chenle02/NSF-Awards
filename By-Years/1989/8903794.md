This award provides two years of support to continue developmental work aimed
at adapting the technique of Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) for the
isotopic analysis of natural geological samples. FTMS is potentially a fast and
relatively inexpensive method of isotopic microanalysis, but the analysis of
geologically interesting elements (for example, dating the age of rocks using
uranium-lead radioactive decay systematics) raises problems regarding unwanted
isotopic fractionation effects that must be resolved before FTMS can be used
profitably in geochemical research.
