This research is designed to reveal the generally simple, fundamental chemical
factors which underlie the relatively complex behavior of rare earth elements in
oceanic, estuarine and riverine environments. Chemical associations of the rare
earths with dominant solution ligands (carbonate and phosphate) will be
investigated. Solid/solution equilibrium partitioning of rare earths between
seawater and selected solid surfaces (calcium carbonate, silicates, iron oxides,
and organics) will be examined as a function of seawater solution conditions.
Methods will be developed which will permit assessment of the role of dissolved
natural organics on rare earth element behavior in the environment. This work
should provide improved capabilities for modeling the behavior of rare earth
elements and transplutonium elements in natural systems.
