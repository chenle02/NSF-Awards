The award will support collaborative research between Dr. B. Lakshminarayana,
Department of Aerospace Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, and
Professor Francis Leboeuf, Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics Laboratory, Ecole
Centrale de Lyon, France. The objective of this project is to develop and
validate models for turbulence. The flow phenomena in turbines is extremely
complex. It is three dimensional, turbulent and unsteady, with substantial
influence of rotation, curvature and heat transfer effects. Attempts to predict
this flow have not been successful due to inadequate turbulence models. The
inability of the Navier- Stokes codes to capture the physical phenomena in
turbines and pumps has hampered improvements in design and analytical procedures
for the development of high performance turbo- machinery. The aim of this
cooperative research effort is to develop turbulence models that incorporate the
effects of rotation, curvature, compressibility, three dimensionality and heat
transfer. The turbulence transport equation (based on density averaging) and
velocity-density covariance transport equations will be modelled to derive
algebraic stress transport and Algebraic heat flux equations respectively. These
equations, coupled with the turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation
equations, and mean momentum equations, should provide accurate prediction of
flow and heat transfer field in turbines and pumps. A validation experiment is
also proposed to check the accuracy of modelling, including evaluation of
various terms contributing to the turbulent stress and energy, and turbulent
heat flux transport equations. This research will benefit from the extensive and
complementary expertise of the US and French investigators in turbulence
modeling of turbomachinery.
