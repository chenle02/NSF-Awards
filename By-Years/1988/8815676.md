This project will document the changes in farming in Burkina Faso, Upper Volta.
The researcher will combine ethnographic fieldwork with archival research to
analyze the changes over the colonial past in farming practices and the social
relations entailed. The project will study the links between the transformation
of social relations, modifications in the management of farms and production
trends in local farming with the establishment of effective administration and
the broadening of markets. Changes in the composition of work groups, the
ownership patterns of work tools, and the gender pattern of workers and tasks
will be analyzed. During the ethnographic portion of the research the
anthropological researcher will be assisted by a folklorist who will study the
oral narrative accounts of farming system changes. This research is important
because changes in agriculture and their impact on social relations are not well
understood in Africa, while the changes have been radical. Understanding the
past African experience will help us improve that experience in the future as
well as provide a comparison that will help us understand and improve the social
relations of farming in our own country.
