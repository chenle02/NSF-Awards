The Workshops teach a series of computer graphics and software development
skills to organismic biology faculty, to enable participants to independently
develop multimedia instructional materials, and to incorporate these skills into
undergraduate laboratories. These skills include technical illustration, two-
dimensional animation, solid modeling and three-dimensional animation,
photorealistic rendering, single-frame and continuous video digitization, video
compression, sound digitization and editing, video micro- and macrophotography,
video photography under field conditions, and simulation modeling.***//
