95-28169 Honeycutt, R. Kent Dr. Honeycutt's objective is to understand some of
the known and newly-discovered changes that occur in cataclysmic variable stars
(CVs) on time scales of weeks to years. CVs emit most of their light from an
accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf. Accretion disks occur in a wide
range of astronomical situations, including proto-planetary systems, quasars,
and stellar black hole candidates as well as x-ray sources containing neutron
stars. The unusual long-term changes in the brightness and in the spectrum of
CVs are likely to be due to accretion disk instabilities and/or the accretion
process itself. Other changes may be due to stellar activity cycles on the mass-
losing component of the binary system, analogous to the solar sunspot cycle. ***
