FLOW TRANSITIONS AND TURBULENCE IN THE TAYLOR-COUETTE FLOW OF DILUTE POLYMER
SOLUTIONS

This is a study of polymer-induced effects on flow transitions, turbulence, and
drag reduction in curvilinear flows. Under this grant, a combined experimental
and numerical modeling approach will be undertaken to provide complementary
information and allow direct, quantitative comparisons of experiments and direct
numerical simulation results. This will yield faithful modeling and simulation
tools to describe the interaction between polymer chains and nonlinear flow
states, guidance regarding important parameter ranges to study, insight into the
types of flow structures and polymer chain architectures important in drag
reduction, and provide quantitative information about the mechanisms of polymer-
induced turbulent drag reduction. This study will advance understanding of
friction control in large scale fluid transportation systems and guide the
development of polymeric additives that will lead to drag reduction. In
addition, the knowledge of how polymers induce qualitative and quantitative
changes in fluid flow and drag will help develop polymer-mimetic technologies
for designing energy-efficient mixing devices and drag reduction systems for
ships and submarines that could result in enormous savings in fuel costs. In
addition to the potential for energy savings, broader impacts in the areas of
processing of macromolecules in microfluidic devices and in the optimization of
conventional polymer mixing and processing operations are also anticipated. In
addition, the PI's will develop an undergraduate transport laboratory module and
website based on Taylor-Couette flow. The website, in addition to summarizing
the research results, will include flow visualization movies aimed at
introducing basic ideas of flow stability, turbulence, and the effects of
polymers on flow to high school and undergraduate students.
