One of the central goals of biological oceanography is to determine the nature
and consequences of physical forcing in marine ecosystems. While major advances
have been made in pelagic and soft-bottom benthic ecosystems, little is known
about the coupling of physical and biological processes in rocky subtidal
ecosystems. Previous NSF sponsored research has shown that the rapid, vertical
displacement of warm phytoplankton-rich water by internal waves is one of the
most striking aspects of rocky subtidal ecosystems in the central Gulf of Maine.
This research will conduct an integrated set of measurements and field
experiments proposed to test the general working hypothesis that patterns of
vertical distribution and secondary productivity of suspension feeders on rocky
ledges and pinnacles in the central Gulf of Maine are determined by the
mechanics of internal waves and their effects on food and larval supply.//
