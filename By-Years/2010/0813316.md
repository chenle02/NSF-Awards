This project addresses the development of new synthetic methodology for
asymmetric azomethine ylide cycloadditions. By increasing the efficiency and
generality of this reaction, with a particular emphasis on asymmetric synthesis,
the resulting methodology will enable the efficient assembly of a variety of
complex pyrrolidine structures found in many bioactive natural products and
synthetic analogs. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions to be studied will
involve both acyclic and cyclic azomethine ylides. The influence of resident
substrate chirality, chiral auxiliaries, and chiral catalysts on the
stereochemical outcome will be examined in detail. Efficient target-oriented
syntheses of the antitumor antibiotics cyanocycline A and bioxalomycin will be
developed, with longer-term applicability to the synthesis of the structurally
related dnacins.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Philip P. Garner of the Department of Chemistry at Case
Western Reserve University. Professor Garner and his students are developing new
methods for the efficient and controlled synthesis of cyclic nitrogen-containing
compounds. The resulting methods are then utilized in the construction of
relevant naturally occurring compounds, thereby illustrating the power of the
new synthetic methods, providing access to larger quantities of compounds than
may be obtained from natural sources, and facilitating the synthesis of
unnatural analogues that may lead to the future discovery of next generation
pharmaceuticals. The project brings together graduate and undergraduate students
from diverse cultural backgrounds to work together towards common goals and
provides an opportunity for graduate students to serve as mentors to the
undergraduates.
