This award provides funds to the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at
Cornell University to help purchase equipment which will be used to teach
undergraduate biology students, and students in allied fields such as physics,
engineering and computer sciences, modern techniques in cellular neuroscience
through hands- on laboratory experience. This will be accomplished by active
research scientists in a series of three undergraduate courses entitled: 1)
Principles of Neurophysiology, 2) Electronics for Neurobiologists, and 3)
Computer Interfacing for Neurobiologists. In the first course, undergraduates
will use the state-of-the-art research equipment (computers, voltage clamp
amplifiers, micromanipulators, microelectrode pullers, and perfusion pumps) in
laboratory exercises designed to teach the principles of electrical signalling
in the nervous system. In these exercises, computer data acquisition and
analysis and teaching students the use of Macintosh II computers, along with the
related hardware and software necessary for this purpose will be emphasized.
This course will replace all standard vertebrate preparations with invertebrate
model systems. In the electronics course, students will learn fundamental
principles of electronics as applied to electrophysiology and other biological
fields to design simple, relevant circuits such as those used for basic voltage
and patch clamp amplifiers. The computer interfacing course will use the
Macintosh II computers to teach the technical details (hardware and software) of
computer interfacing methods in biological experiments. This project has
important significance not only in providing undergraduates with training in new
and powerful methods of experimental neuroscience, but also in developing
advanced teaching tools useful for other neuroscience training programs. Through
this project, undergraduate students will gain theoretical and technical skills
that will help them be productive scientists in both corporate and academic
research environments. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal
sources.
