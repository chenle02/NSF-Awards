Funds are provided to test a set of hypotheses that address the process of
calving into a freshwater lake, the dynamical effect of a calving retreat on the
glacier system, and the relative contributions of mass loss due to surface
melting and calving. A ?whole glacier? approach of data acquisition and
monitoring will be used to achieve these goals. These field components of the
project will be complemented by the development of a lake glacier calving law
that can be incorporated into dynamical models of glacier flow. Both
observational and modeling results will be compared with data from other
glaciers around the world through international collaborations established by
the principal investigators.
