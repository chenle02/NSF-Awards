This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program
supports research and educational activities involving rare-earth complexes by
Professor Gregory M. Ferrence at Illinois State University. One goal of this
research is to modify the supporting ligand environments of Group 3 and
lanthanide metals in order to gain insight into chemical structure and
reactivity that is distinct to rare-earth compounds in their predominant
trivalent oxidation state. Rare earth complexes with N-confused-porphyrin and
carbaporphyrin ligands will be prepared, which are expected to display
contrasting reactivity compared to their traditional porphyrin analogs. Divalent
lanthanide complexes will also be studied by using trispyrazolylborate ligands
in order to also provide a fundamental understanding of the chemistry of
divalent lanthanides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this
proposal focuses on teaching principles and practices in X-ray crystallography
by using extensive computer based course materials that better enable students
to determine aspects of molecules dependent on three dimensional visualizations.
Faculty and students from regional liberal arts colleges and universities will
be involved so as to offer aspects of the X-ray course via distance education
and to foster regional research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
