Abstract ATM-9631673 Porter, Stephen C. University of Washington Title: High
Resolution Paleomonsoon Records from Central China The Loess Plateau of central
China contains a nearly continuous record of paleoenvironmental change spanning
the last 2.5 million years. Studies over the past two decades have described and
attempted to date the long loess/paleosol sequence that mantles the plateau, but
only during the past several years has attention been directed toward obtaining
high-resolution time-series of the last glacial/interglacial cycle in order to
understand the factors that influenced the East Asian Monsoon system during the
late Quaternary. This award supports a paleoclimate investigation in the
climatically sensitive boundary zone between arid and semi-arid climates of
central China where the changing monsoon effects are pronounced and well
documented in sedimentary strata. Sampling of loess/paleosol profiles along the
desert margin will help to assess temporal and regional variations in winter
monsoon strength during the last glacial cycle and the Holocene. Data derived
from this study also will be relevant to addressing problems of erosion,
decertification, natural resource exploitation, and agricultural productivity in
the densely inhabited transition zone between arid and semi-humid climates.
