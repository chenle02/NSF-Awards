With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Dr. D. Michael Heinekey of the University of Washington will continue
his investigations of a new quantum mechanical process involving pairwise
tunnelling of protons at high temperatures in certain transition metal
polyhydride complexes. This proceess leads to exceptionally large proton-proton
coupling constants in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of these
complexes. The scope of this novel phenomenon will be defined by the synthesis
of additional polyhydride complexes with different transition metals and a
variety of ligands in addition to hydrogen. The detailed mechanism of the
tunnelling process will be investigated using inelastic neutron scattering,
structure determination by neutron diffraction, and NMR spectroscopy, with
particular emphasis on tritium NMR spectroscopy. %%% Pairs of hydrogen atoms in
certain organometallic hydrides exchange positions without breaking the metal-
hydrogen bonds. Organometallic hydrides constitute an important class of
industrial catalysts, and this project is expected to help provide a better
understanding of the mechanism of catalytic action.
