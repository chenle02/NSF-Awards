A joint social science research project on earthquake planning is being
undertaken by the Section on Seismosociology of the Institute of Geophysics in
Beijing, the People's Republic of China, and the Disaster Research Center (DRC)
at the University of Delaware, U.S.A. Each side will concurrently study the
earthquake hazard mitigation planning (Phase I) and the earthquake emergency
preparedness planning (Phase II) in two earthquake prone cities in their own
countries (San Francisco and Memphis are the two communities selected in the
United States). In general, information will be sought on the characteristics of
the organizations involved in both kinds of planning, the nature of the planning
measures and arrangements in place, the problematical aspects of the planning
process, and the factors or conditions associated with the character of the
groups, the nature of the planning, and the problems in both the hazard
mitigation planning and the emergency preparedness planning. The data gathering
research design will be roughly comparable in both societies and close
collaboration on the work over a 36 month period will be maintained by extended
study visits to the United States of two Chinese researchers, and briefer visits
of DRC staff to China to compare research results and to agree upon a common
report setting forth the implications which can be drawn for the transfer in
both directions of the social technology of earthquake planning (Phase III). In
addition, the DRC research will examine in more detail for the American context
what links exist between mitigation and preparedness, the relationship of
earthquake specific and all hazard preparedness planning, and the social aspects
of earthquake hazard mitigation practice.
