The American Society of Plant Physiologists (ASPP) is organizing a two day
workshop to explore ground breaking approaches for disseminating educational
information in a way that will build a strong link between education and
research. The expected outcome of the workshop will be the design and initiation
of an innovative plant science education publication to be published and
distributed as a supplement to one of ASPP's plant science research journals
inclusive of all plant biologists.
