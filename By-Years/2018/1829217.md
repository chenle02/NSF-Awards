This project, from the University of South Florida (USF), continues their
activities to strengthen Innovation and entrepreneurship within the university
and region through their I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-
funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and
support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. This is a
Type II I-Corps Site - Type II projects reside at institutions that have already
received a Type I award. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and
regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors,
researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
integrates efforts from the USF Research and Innovation's Vice President for
Research (VPR) Office with participants from engineering, business, and
medicine, and support from their patent and licensing office. This I-Corps Site
reaches across the campus and filled a crucial gap by providing hands-on
entrepreneurial training to scientists and engineers about how to think about
translating an idea to actual use by society. This Site at USF accomplished a
great deal during their first three years and "changed the culture" of the
institution - 115 teams completed the Site curriculum, 42 teams completed their
boot-camp, and they sent 25 teams to the National I-Corps
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
