One of the major mechanisms for coupling the ionosphere and the magnetosphere is
through ion outflows. On the dayside, the primary driver of the polar wind is
photoelectrons. This project will investigate the evolution of the polar wind,
using a hybrid simulation code that can take into account the collisional
effects of the photoelectrons and wave-particle interactions. The self-
consistent effects on the polar wind due to particle precipitation from the
magnetosphere will also be included. The results from the theoretical and
modeling work will be compared with data from the Akebono and POLAR satellites.
The results will advance our understanding of ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling,
which has an important role in the dynamics of the magnetosphere and space
weather.
