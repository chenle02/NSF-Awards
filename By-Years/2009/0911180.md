The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
research of Professor Richard F. Jordan of the University of Chicago to design
general methods for the syntheses of enantiopure group 4 metallocenes and
libraries of the new catalysts for applications in asymmetric catalysis. The new
chiral metallocenes enable the development of new catalytic, stereoselective C-H
functionalization reactions that can be applied in organic syntheses and in the
syntheses of novel polymers that contain heterocycles in the main chain. The
studies of the d0-metal alkene and alkyne complexes provide new insights to the
structures, thermodynamics, kinetics, dynamic properties, and insertion
mechanisms of these species. The synthesis of chiral compounds is of critical
importance in the pharmaceutical and polymer chemical industries. This project
provides valuable research training for undergraduates at the University of
Chicago, Lake Forest College, and other Chicago-area undergraduate schools. The
project also offers exciting science experiences for high school students from
the Chicago Public School system through the University of Chicago Collegiate
Scholars Program.
