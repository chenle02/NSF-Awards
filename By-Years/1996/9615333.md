This award is for support for four years of funding for a program of biogenic
sulfur measurements on the Siple Dome ice core. Biogenic sulfur is a major
aerosol-forming constituent of the atmosphere and has potentially important
links to the earth's radiation budget. Previous work on the Vostok ice core has
demonstrated a remarkable climate-related variability in biogenic sulfur,
suggesting that the sulfur cycle may act to stabilize climate (keep the glacial
atmosphere cool and the interglacial atmosphere warm) in the Southern
Hemisphere. In this study, methane-sulfonate (MSA) will be measured on the Siple
Dome ice core as part of the West Antarctic ice sheet program (WAIS). Siple Dome
is located in a region which is strongly impacted by the incursion of marine air
onto the Antarctic plateau. Because of its proximity to the coast and
meteorological setting, it is expected that variability in high-latitude marine
biogenic sulfur emissions should dominate the MSA record at this site. In
addition to the deep ice core record, samples from shallow cores will also be
analyzed to provide information about regional variability and decadal-to-
centennial scale variability in the deposition of sulfur-containing aerosols
from high latitude source regions over the past 200 years.
