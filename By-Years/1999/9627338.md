This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, targets
the development of nanostructured gold surfaces which will be applied to
fundamental studies of interfacial electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and
microscopy. During the tenure of this thirty-three month standard grant,
Professor Michael Natan and his students at Penn State University will fabricate
tailored gold surfaces by self-assembling nanometer sized gold particles onto
substrates covered with organic or inorganic thin films. These gold surfaces
will then be used for probing the direct voltammetry of redox enzymes, for the
optimization of metal roughness for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS),
for studies of electron transfer through organic films, for SERS spectroscopy of
proteins, for the development of near-field SERS microscopy, and for the
controlled electrochemical release of molecules from a single nanoelectrode.
Microstructured metal surfaces offer unique properties which can be
advantageously exploited in a broad range of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and
microscopic applications. Using molecular self- assembly protocols, Professor
Michael Natan and his students at Penn State University are pioneering
techniques for tailoring microstructured gold surfaces for use in these
applications. The successful pursuit of the goals of this project should give
rise to significant progress in electrochemical and optical sensors, and could
afford new techniques in near-field optical microscopy.
