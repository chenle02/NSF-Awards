Two major research thrusts will be pursued: optimization of algebraic systems
and dynamic vehicle routing. Within optimization of algebraic systems, the focus
will be on the "matroid parity" problem. The major goal of this work is
algorithmic and conceptual and is an elegant generalization of a number of
important problems in combinatorial optimization. In the area of dynamic vehicle
routing, the goal is to develop effective heuristic procedures for solving the
emergency scheduling problem. The methodologies will include interactive
scheduling and hierarchical decomposition techniques. It is expected that this
research will extend the "state-of-the-art" in dynamic scheduling and routing
problems by drawing on research developments from mathematical programming,
combinatorial optimization, control theory, queueing theory, and artificial
intelligence.
