instance after its creation, was filled with a very hot and dense soup of
matter, consisting of quarks, leptons and gluons. When the universe expanded and
cooled, but still just milliseconds after the Big Bang, quarks and gluons
suddenly condensed into protons and neutrons which eventually made up the nuclei
of all the chemical elements around us. This process (called the QCD phase
transition) and the hot and dense primordial matter (called the Quark Gluon
Plasma), can be recreated nowadays in the laboratory in collisions of heavy
nuclei with very large energies. Such experiments take place at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the US and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in
Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the PI develops tools that will
allow us to (a) understand how a Quark Gluon Plasma is formed in nuclear
collisions, and (b) how its properties can be tested. The first part is
important to separate the new phase that we want to study (the Quark Gluon
Plasma) from the creation mechanism in the lab (the nuclear collision). This
should eventually allow us to determine important properties of Quark Gluon
Plasma and the nature of the QCD phase transition to much higher accuracy than
before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part studies how probes which can
penetrate this dense matter, photons and so-called QCD jets, can be used for a
tomography of Quark Gluon Plasma and all nuclear matter. This is an existing
method which works on a qualitative level, but will be dramatically improved in
precision through the planned research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal also
includes an outreach program which will enhance the existing Saturday Morning
Physics program at Texas A&amp;M University by involving high school teachers
and adding interactive components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
