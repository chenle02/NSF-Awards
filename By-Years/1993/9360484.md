9360484 Hun This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
simultaneously stimulate entrepreneurship among Native Hawaiians, a community
with a history of underrepresentation in the business sector, and teach Native
Hawaiian students the culturing of snails/fish/and hydrophonics via the
efficient use of effluent water. Students will be exposed to many areas of the
biological sciences in an appropriate learning context predicated on an
understanding of Hawaiian culture and will be offered hands-on experience in
hydroponic experimentation. From the beginning of the project, they will be able
to participate in and contribute to scientific research that involves actual
commercialization. Native Hawaiian students will be shown how their indigenous
technology combines with scientific principles to produce ecologically sound and
environmentally benign outcomes, and they will be stimulated to be creative--to
expand the concept of a closed hydroponic system to other plants and beyond. The
major educational product of this project will be the cultivation of human
resources. ***
