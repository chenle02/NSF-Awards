EAR-0349894&lt;br/&gt;Lund &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will permit the
University of Southern California to augment our current paleomagnetic and rock
magnetic facilities through the purchase of three pieces of major equipment.
Each of these would significantly expand the overall range of our research
capabilities and significantly improve the speed and quality of data
acquisition. The three pieces of equipment are as follows: Princeton
Measurements Corporation MicroMag Model 2900-02 Alternating Gradient
Magnetometer (AGM) with cryostat; AGICO Model KLY-4S Spinner Kappabridge; and
D-Tech Model D-2000 Alternating Field Demagnetizer (this system will replace our
current 20-year old Schonstedt GSD-1 af demagnetizer). There are three active
research programs in the Department of Earth Sciences with several NSF-funded
projects that will use these facilities: paleomagnetism, rock magnetism, and
environmental magnetism studies of Lund; structure/tectonic studies of
Paterson/Lund; geobiology studies of
Nealson/Popa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
