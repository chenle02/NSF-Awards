This research project deals with an in-depth analysis of rotating mechanical
systems. Such systems are modelled by ordinary differential equations with
periodically varying coefficients. The models are very often high-dimensional,
possess non-linearities that cannot be neglected, and depend on many widely
varying design parameters. The point-mapping based methodology used in this
research combines the advantages of analytical methods that allow qualitative
analysis and the ability of numerical methods to analyze high-order systems with
parameters varying over a large range. The point mapping approach results in an
analytical representation of discrete-time dynamics of the rotating system. The
equations for steady-state solutions, conditions of stability and bifurcation of
these solutions, and sensitivity of the system's behavior to design parameters
are formulated in terms of closed-form algebraic equations. The analytical
formulation allows design tradeoffs to be performed using computer algebra. The
research includes development and implementation of the theoretical and
computational aspects of the point mapping based methodology, and study of
important classes of rotating systems. In each application, a detailed
sensitivity and design tradeoff analysis as a function of system parameters is
performed using high-speed computation algorithms. +▒+¬ ó ¬ñ«¬^áúú¬^Ñ¿«ñ +▒+¬ ó
