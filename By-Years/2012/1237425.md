The cost of writing data from a computer's processor to its storage components
remains a bottleneck for modern computing systems. The speed of the processor
continues to improve, more processing units are packed into a computer chip, but
these advances only cause more data to be written to storage per second. The
speed of storage subsystems has not kept pace with the processor?s ability to
produce data for storage, and this difference in performance is likely to
continue. Moreover, the trend in building storage subsystems for computers is to
utilize technologies such as flash memories whose contents can be changed a
relatively small number of times before the memory wears out. These technologies
are cheaper and pack more storage into a given area, but care must be taken to
avoid writing to memories made from such technologies at rates usually seen from
a processor to memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project aims to discover
mechanisms that reduce or eliminate traffic from a processor to the storage
subsystem. Elimination of such traffic increases the speed of the overall system
and saves wear on storage components. This research finds data that would
otherwise be sent to storage from the processor and eliminates such writes to
memory. This technique is based on finding that such data cannot subsequently be
referenced by an application. This effort focuses on a preliminary study to
validate the technical approach, namely investigating the consequences of
eliminating stores of data that has been explicitly deallocated by an
application.
