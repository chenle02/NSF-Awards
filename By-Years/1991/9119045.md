This research is concerned with the formation of noncentrosymmetric materials
with ferroelectric properties. These materials are based on a new class of
liquid crystalline compounds which have pyramidic transition metal complexes as
core group. The orientation of these materials by the application of electric
field will be explored as a route to noncentrosymmetric solids with a
macroscopic electrical polarization. The materials are ferroelectrics if
polarization persists after electric field is removed. Because polarization is
sensitive to pressure and temperature, ferroelectrics possess piezoelectric and
proelectric properties. Mechanism for polarization reversal, and experiments for
their elucidation are proposed. Also, methods are proposed for the formation of
electro- responsive polymers that exhibit large field-induced deformation. The
ultimate aim is to develop field-and pressure-responsive conductors.
