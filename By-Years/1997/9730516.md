OCE-9730516 Proehl The project is for a joint observational and theoretical
investigation into the dynamics of the inter-annual variability of the tropical
instability waves in he tropical Pacific ocean. Considerable data exist,
allowing a quantification of mean circulation and instability wave dynamics.
Models will be used to investigate the structure and dynamics of instability of
background states constructed from ADCP/ATLAS transects. The structure will be
compared with observations.
