Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0354401 PI: Mohapatra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
research being undertaken by the Maryland Particle Theory&lt;br/&gt;Group is to
search for the ultimate laws that govern the nature of particles, forces and the
Universe. The focus will be to explore the nature of physics beyond the
successful standard model of strong, weak and electromagnetic forces using
results from neutrino physics and theoretical ideas such as supersymmetry, grand
unification and string theory. Neutrino masses have already provided some clues
as to the nature of this new physics. The current and planned experiments at
various laboratories around the world using neutrinos, protons, electrons and
muons are expected to add considerably to this knowledge. The plan is to use
these results and predict new ones to test the different theoretical ideas
mentioned above. This research will also explore ways to resolve some of the
puzzles of cosmology such as nature of dark matter in the universe, origin of
matter-anti-matter asymmetry, nature of the expansion of the early universe etc.
using the same theoretical ideas and propose ways to test them in different
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hope is that this research will provide
answers to some of the outstanding questions of modern physics such as (i) what
is the origin of the mass of fundamental particles; (ii) are all the diverse
forces of nature such as gravity, electro-magnetism, weak and nuclear forces
really different manifestations of one force that operates at very short
distances; (iii) why are some forces weaker than others; (iv) are the most
elementary building blocks of matter point-like particles or strings; (v) are
there extra hidden space dimensions in nature? There will be strong
participation in this research by post-doctoral associates, graduate students as
well as undergraduate and high school students. It will therefore provide
training for future scientists by bringing them into close contact with the
frontier areas of research in this exciting field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
