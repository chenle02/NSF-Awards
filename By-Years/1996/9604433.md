Inside the nose of mammals, the sheet of cells that contains olfactory
receptors also contains many sustentacular cells. The function of these
sustentacular cells is not well understood, but their secretions may modulate
the handling of odorant molecules in the moist coating of the epithelium. There
now an active interest in how functions of receptors in chemosensory tissues are
influenced by such peri-receptor mechanisms. This limited study is a Minority
Research Planning Grant that uses molecular tools to identify gene expression,
and so clarify mechanisms by which the proteins produced by these cells are
regulated. Results will have an impact on chemosensory research by laying
groundwork for further analysis of this important class of cells. By helping to
establish an independent career for a young investigator, teacher and mentor
from a group that remains underrepresented in science, this award also will have
an impact on the infrastructure of science and education.
