In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Zwier will use multiphoton spectroscopic techniques to study the unimolecular
decomposition dynamics of benzene-water clusters and their ions. The data
obtained will allow determination of structural information from the rotational
envelopes and vibrational information about van der Waals modes. The main effort
will focus on neutral clusters with from one to fifty water molecules attached.
Photofragmentation and photochemical studies of ionized benzene-water clusters
will also be explored. %%% A study of the hydrophobic interaction between non-
polar hydrocarbons and water is one of the most important forces in nature which
plays a role in the conformations of proteins. It is also central to the
formation of micelles and biological membranes. The current study of clusters
composed of benzene and water molecules will provide some understanding of the
hydrophobic forces involved and will provide a better understanding of forces
which determine conformational changes in biological systems.
