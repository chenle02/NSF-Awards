The principal investigator will be seeking to obtain a new central limit
theorem for sequences of weak dependent random variables. Some of the results
will have a theoretical character and will be a contribution to the
clarification of some old problems. Other results will have rather a practical
meaning. The focus of the study is the asymptotic distribution of partial sums
of weakly dependent random variables normalized by estimators of the standard
deviation of partial sums. These estimators will be easily computable from data.
