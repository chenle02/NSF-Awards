Critical questions in galaxy evolution center on the processes of feedback --
the injection of energy and momentum from stars and active galactic nuclei
(AGN). Due to the vast difference in spatial scales between galaxies and stars,
direct simulation of the relevant physics is still impossible with current
computing technology; one must resort to subgrid models for key processes such
as turbulence. The collaborating team on this project will adapt the FLASH-3
hydrodynamics code to test subgrid models of high Reynolds-number (low
viscosity) turbulence against laboratory experiments and direct, brute-force
calculations. They will then apply the modified hydrodynamic model to three
astrophysical problems: (1) The role of bubbles powered by active galactic
nuclei in the centers of galaxy clusters. Simulating these bubbles will require
including buoyancy-driven instabilities on scales too small to be resolved
directly. (2) Globular cluster heavy-element enrichment. Globular cluster stars
are chemically homogeneous and must have formed from well-mixed material.
Subgrid models that include shear-driven instabilities will allow detailed
simulations of mixing that can constrain when and where these clusters were
formed. (3) Development of supernova-driven outflows in starburst galaxies. Due
to the short cooling times in the interstellar medium, this will require the
modeling of supersonic turbulence. The project?s broader impact includes
graduate student and postdoctoral researcher training, the presentation of
public lectures, the development of an undergraduate course in computational
fluid dynamics, and the release of simulation packages to the community.
