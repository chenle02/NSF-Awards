This award supports the laboratory analyses of samples derived from the Lac
Toponowini project. This project is a new joint French/United States
collaborative initiative to reconstruct variability in the northern Amazonia
climate and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Holocene on
decadal to century time scales. The Toponowini cores are a unique test bed for
analyses because they are well laminated and well preserved. The researcher will
conduct a suite of exploratory analyses on the Toponowini working core halves
that include: (1) multivariate statistical analyses, using Positive Matrix
Factorization (PMF), to explore the high (2 mm) resolution compositional changes
seen in preliminary X-ray density data; (2) analyses of key biomarker compounds
from selected horizons to determine longer-time scales changes in their
molecular and carbon isotopic composition; and 3) carbon-14 analyses to
construct an accurate age model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research could have
broad impact on the wider science community by catalyzing new thinking in issues
surrounding climate by offering a new perspective on knotty scientific problems
surrounding ITCZ variability and its consequent environmental impacts. The
planned activities are high risk yet potentially transformative.
