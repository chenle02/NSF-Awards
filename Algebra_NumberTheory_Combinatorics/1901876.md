This is a research in algebraic geometry. The field of algebraic geometry
studies geometric models by distilling and encoding their essential complexity
in polynomial equations. The project integrates ideas from quantum physics and
the physical study of symmetries of the fundamental laws of nature to extract
new and unexpected information about the geometry of spaces. The project will
focus on unravelling the hidden structure of multi-dimensional geometric models
of quantum fields and to capture this structure in a cascade of polynomial
invariants. These invariants will give a new mathematical tool for understanding
and proving various empirically observed physics dualities which are expected to
identify a priori unrelated quantum theories. The project aims to unify the
analytic and geometric properties of parameter spaces of representations in
arbitrary dimension and sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of
moduli problems in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of
applications. The proposed work will be immediately relevant to deep questions
in symplectic geometry, geometric representation theory, string theory and
quantum field theory.

Three directions will be studied. The first is to investigate how the Hodge
theory of varieties with potentials and the associated perverse and weight
filtrations are exchanged by T-duality. In the second project a new method will
be developed for constructing moduli of irregular connections on non-compact
algebraic manifolds, for building explicit symplectic foliations, and for
computing their leaves. This will involve a new de Rham theory of formal
boundaries of varieties, and a new construction of sheaf theoretic invariants
from the formal geometry. The final project will build a spectral coverformalism
for constructing Hecke eigensheaves on moduli of bundles related to
intersections of quadrics.
