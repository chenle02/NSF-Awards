This Presidential Young Investigator will work on a nonlinear harmonic theory
for representations of the fundamental group of ordinary differential equations.
He will also work on the relationship between the two algebraic structures on
the space representations, in particular the behavior at infinity. This project
falls into the general area of modern geometry -a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: algebra and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many application are to gauge theories in physics and
dynamical systems in mechanics.
