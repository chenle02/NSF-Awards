LittleFe is a complete 6 node Beowulf style portable computational cluster which
supports shared memory parallelism (OpenMP), distributed memory parallelism
(MPI), and GPGPU parallelism (CUDA). These low-cost light-weight units are well-
suited for institutions and teaching environments that do not have access to
parallel platforms for parallel and distributed computing education. Teaching
key concepts such as speedup, efficiency, and load balancing are much more
effectively done on a parallel platform.

This award is to support hosting LittleFe buildouts as part of the HPC Educators
Program at the SC13 and SC14. In total, this will enable the LittleFe project to
place 16 additional LittleFe units at educational institutions throughout the
United States during 2013 and 2014. These units will support parallel
programming and distributed computing in the undergraduate CS curriculum at 16
additional colleges and universities. They will also support student programming
contests which will be hosted at e.g. the XSEDE13 and XSEDE14 conferences, and
outreach events at junior and senior high schools across the United States.
