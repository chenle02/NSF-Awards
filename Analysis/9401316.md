94013162 Blackadar The investigator proposes to continue work on a range of
problems concerning the structure of operator algebras and noncommutative
algebraic topology. Specific topics to be studied are: structure of inductive
limits of C*-algebras, structure of groupoids and their C*-algebras, nonstable
K-theory and the fundamental comparability question, and existence and
properties of cohomology theories on C*-algebras. The proposed work will lead
toward a description of the internal structure of a class of algebras which
arise naturally throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. It has become
very important to understand these algebras, and most of the necessary tools now
seem to have been developed, by the proposer and others, to lead us to believe a
complete description is within reach. ***
