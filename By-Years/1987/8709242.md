The early Tertiary Period was a critical time in the evolutionary radiation of
mammals, and the American West has an extraordinarily rich fossil record of this
time interval. Principal Investigators Krishtalka and Stucky propose to continue
their highly successful excavations and study of fossil vertebrates of this age
from the Wind River Basin in Wyoming. In addition to excavating and studying
these important fossils, they have received research support from NASA for the
geological aspects of their work, and for computer equipment, software and
training for remote sensing research. Images from satellite- and aircraft-borne
sensors have provided them with an unprecedented view of the region's
stratigraphy. This new technology has allowed finer distinctions between rock-
types, which can then be related to faunal differences between ancient habitat
types. The Wind River Basin project has already produced complete cranial and
post-cranial remains of previously poorly-known groups, and the proposed project
has the potential to increase greatly our understanding of early mammalian
history. This first attempt to use remote sensing technology in systematic
paleontology will break new methodological ground, and will open new areas for
biological research.
