The purpose of this project is to reform the chemistry laboratory curriculum at
Sage JCA in Albany, NY by incorporating hands-on student use of microcomputers.
To accomplish this goal, funding is sought for eight Power Mac computers, eight
set-ups of computer interface plus probes/sensors, a variety of software
packages, and cable for networking. The networked computer workstations along
with existing instruments will allow for 1. an increase of student awareness of
the capabilities of the microcomputer as an instrument of chemistry; 2. an
enhancement of traditional teaching techniques currently used; 3. an increase in
the diversity of experiments and simulations which may be performed by students;
4. an increase in student interest and understanding of the nature of
measurements and of the principles of chemistry; 5. an increase in student
appreciation of the role of technology in acquiring useful information; 6. an
increase in student's computer literacy skills. Acquisition of the proposed
equipment will impact all of the chemistry course offerings at Sage Junior
College of Albany. Computer-assisted experiments and simulations are proposed to
enable students to acquire, analyze and display data in a variety of different
and exciting ways. These activities can help students to investigate phenomena
and perform calculations rapidly and transparently to look for trends and
inconsistencies in experimental data. This experience will provide students with
relevant skills and improved abilities as they enter an increasingly
technological world where knowledge-intensive job skills are necessary to
compete for careers.
