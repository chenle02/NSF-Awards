This award is made as part of the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program. This Program funds innovative new projects for undergraduate physics
laboratories. The project supported here will have two goals: first, to
emphasize the most recent techniques of data collection; second, to set up a
laboratory focussed on current problems in optics.
