This project aims to identify disease-specific changes in human brain
connectivity in early stages by developing a novel Deep Learning framework
applicable to data with arbitrary structure such as graphs. This is important
because regional brain variations often do not manifest as cognitive changes
until significant brain pathology has accumulated, and a better understanding of
the brain may be possible by characterizing changes in connectivity defined by
relationships between different brain regions. Recent techniques with Deep
Learning have demonstrated successful results with human-level precision in
various image analysis tasks such as image classification, object detection, and
image segmentation, but they cannot be directly applied to analyze brain
connectivity because of its arbitrary structure. The key is to derive effective
representation of the data; however, it is still unclear how to derive
sophisticated representations for complex data such as graphs and it often
requires large-scale datasets. A novel Graph Deep Learning technique that can
detect subtle changes in brain connectivity with small numbers of samples is
therefore necessary. Success of this project will facilitate understanding of
the relationship between brain connectivity and neurodegenerative disease,
mechanisms for early diagnosis, and discovery of new treatments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, the overarching goal of this project is to
design a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for graph data and to determine
the extent to which it yields new scientific findings in neuroscience. To meet
the goal, this project will focus on: 1) Developing a novel transform for graphs
(e.g., brain networks) for their novel multi-resolution representations that are
theoretically described by convolution, 2) Developing an efficient deep learning
architecture for graphs that operates within a small sample-size regime to
improve performance of disease diagnosis and sensitivity of statistical
inferences, and 3) Validating the developed models on a simulation study as well
as real brain network datasets for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease to characterize disease-
specific patterns in the brain connectivity. The developed framework will
benefit various areas of neuroimaging research with functional and structural
brain connectivity that are locally carried at small scales, and spur
development of further studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
