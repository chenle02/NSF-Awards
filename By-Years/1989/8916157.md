This project supports the dissertation research of a Harvard University
graduate student in anthropology who will study the beliefs and experiences of
middle-class cancer patients in a middle-sized Mexican city. The focus will be
on the cognitive and social means used by people to cope with the disease.
Methods include qualitative ethnographic participant- observation in hospitals
and clinics and in-depth interviewing as well as surveys of clinic patients.
This will be one of the first ethnographic studies of cancer patients that
focuses on the middle-class, rather than the poor in a developing country. This
research is important because cancer is a common yet dreaded disease. Increased
knowledge of how people understand their illness and deal with it in various
circumstances will proved insight into the human context of chronic illness.
