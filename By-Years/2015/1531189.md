With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, the University of
Oregon will acquire an epifluorescence microscope. The instrument consists of a
light source and a microscope. The microscope detects the light that is emitted
(fluoresced) from a sample after irradiation by the light source. The instrument
will enable experiments focused on imaging of live cells. It will be used by
undergraduate and graduate students in their research. This training will assist
them in future careers as live cell imaging is widely used in the biotechnology
industry. The acquisition will be incorporated in community outreach activities
including K-12 programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) creating
imaging tools for hydrogen sulfide detection and delivery; (b) making molecular
probes for small molecule/ion recognition; (c) preparing Pt(II) reagents for RNA
biochemistry; and (d) using carbon quantum dots to engineer nanostructures for
biomedical imaging.
