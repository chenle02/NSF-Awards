*** 9501307 Robertazzi This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop a 100 GHz integrated receiver for millimeter wave heterodyne
detection. Millimeter wave receivers have direct application in radio astronomy,
and may be used to construct multipixel mm wave imaging arrays. The receivers
which will be developed in Phase II will use SIS junctions as the nonlinear
mixing elements in combination with on chip local oscillators based on the ac
Josephson effect. The advantages of such an arrangement include (i) complete
integration of all the elements required to produce a heterodyne receiver in a
single compact circuit, (ii) extremely low power dissipation of the local
oscillator, (iii) the ability to tune the local oscillator electrically, making
the system frequency agile, (iv) the possibility of attaining the quantum
detection limit at mm wavelengths, and (v) easy fabrication of large mixer
arrays for mm wave imaging applications. The research objectives include the
development of a 100 GHz receiver design which can be extended to higher
operating frequencies (500 Ghz). It is anticipated that the noise temperature of
the receivers will be better than 10 times the quantum limit. Support under the
NSF SBIR program will establish a commercial source of monolithic SIS quasi-
optical receivers. These elements are in demand for radio astronomy, as well as
advanced radar and secure communications systems. They will find application in
advanced far infrared spectrometers and mm wave imaging systems. A mm wave
camera can be used to make images showing the presence in small amounts of all
possible atmospheric pollutants. These capabilities have great commercial
utility in both civilian and military applications. ***
