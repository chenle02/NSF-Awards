Form 10 Abstract Proposal AST 96-16899 PI: Dennis Zaritsky Institution: U.
California, Santa Cruz This award supports partial conference expenses for
speakers at a workshop on "Galactic Halos", to be held on the UCSC campus during
11-15 August, 1997. The workshop is useful because many new observations-e.g.,
of MACHOs, of galactic rotations curves, of X-ray emission around galaxies-
indicate that our present ideas about halos are too simple, and that halos
interact with their central galaxies to a greater extent than realized hitherto.
A clearer understanding of halos will improve our theories of galactic formation
and evolution.
