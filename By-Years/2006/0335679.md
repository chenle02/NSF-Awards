The Noyce Fellowship Program at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is improving
the quality and quantity of certified secondary science teachers in Texas by
reducing or eliminating barriers faced by scientists who desire to transition
into secondary science teaching careers. The project combines resources
available via Noyce with a new project conducted by BCM and Texas A&M
University, known as Opening Pathways for Teacher Instructional Opportunities in
Natural Sciences (OPTIONS). OPTIONS provides academic routes and supporting
structures for science graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and professionals
to become certified secondary science teachers in Houston, Texas. The program
combines online instruction, small-group experiences and mentored teaching under
the guidance of highly qualified teachers and project faculty. The Noyce Fellows
Program eliminates financial barriers and makes it possible for talented young
scientists to obtain careers in secondary science teaching. It covers all
program-related costs and allows OPTIONS to recruit and enroll 10 of the most
talented and motivated candidates each year.
