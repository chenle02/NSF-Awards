9412644 Yong This research will support an Engineering Faculty Internship under
the GOALI program at the Corporate Research Laboratories of Motorola, Inc. The
primary objective of the research is to advance the state of the art knowledge
in designing and fabricating piezoelectric thin film resonators. The project
will complement an on-going experimental research program on thin film devices
at the Phoenix Corporate Research Laboratories of Motorola, Inc. The principal
investigator at Motorola, Inc. is Mr. Luke Mang. The proposed work will be
performed in two phases: (I) research and development of finite element programs
for piezoelectric thin film resonators, and (II) parametric study of thin film
resonators using the results of experimental research at Motorola, Inc. and the
numerical models developed in phase I. The impact of the proposed work is a
better analysis/design tool for piezoelectric thin film resonators. ***
