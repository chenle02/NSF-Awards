There is great interest in the properties of semiconductor strained- layer
superlattices but their practical application is hampered by phenomena involving
both point and line defects. In this study the most common line defects, i. e.,
misfit dislocations, which are concomitant with the misfit strain of the
structures of interest, will be used to remove the point defects from the region
where the desired devices are to be grown. This will be accomplished with a
combination of optically induced dislocation glide and optically induced
dislocation climb through the lithographic masks used in the present art to form
the devices. The net effect is to getter the point defects at the threading
portions of the misfit dislocations after these have been induced to glide to
the outer boundaries of the device. As a final solution, the threading
dislocations will be used to nucleate dissolution in an etching process to
provide trench isolation between the devices. The first target of this process
will be the "DX center," which is the major impediment to economically viable
AlGaAs HEMT devices, and which has already been found to getter on threading
dislocations under optical excitation.
