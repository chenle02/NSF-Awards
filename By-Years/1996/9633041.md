Infrared observations of the atmosphere from to sites in the Arctic are
proposed: Fairbanks, Alaska and Eureka, NWT, Canada. The instrument at Fairbanks
will be a very high spectral resolution solar absorption spectrometer. This
instrument covers the range 2.5 to 15 (m. At least 30 chemical compounds have
absorptions in the instrument bandpass. This permits the derivation of total
atmospheric quantities of those gases. The very high spectral resolution permits
recovery of altitude profile information for at least half a dozen gases,
including ozone, HCI, HF, and N2O. This information will be used to study
stratospheric chemistry and dynamics, and will be compared with data from
McMurdo Station, Antarctic and other northern hemisphere sites. Fairbanks is
usually outside of the stratospheric polar vortex, but is in the area where
maximum leakage of vortex air occurs. This allows the study of filaments of
materials with different temperature, sunlight, and chemical conditioning. The
Eureka, NWT, Canada (80(N, 86(W) instrument is a medium spectral resolution
system designed to measure the infrared thermal emission of the atmosphere. This
instrument covers 6 to 15(m. The atmosphere is very cold, and the signal is
small, but measurements can be made in the absence of sunlight. Eureka is
usually on the edge of the polar vortex, allowing observations in and out of
vortex conditions within a few days. The amounts of several gases can be
determined from the observations, particularly HNO3, which is directly involved
in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) and the chemical processing
that occurs in ozone destroying conditions. The spectral data also relate
directly to the greenhouse effect, and will be used to study the effect of
chemistry, clouds, and snow on the radiation balance. Both instruments will be
used for the study of chemical processes that occur in the Arctic during the
winter. The multiyear data set will be important in the study of seasonal
cycles, and in the study of global change.
