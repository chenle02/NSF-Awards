This project will transfer the Abbott personal collection of marine algae into
the Bernice P. Bishop Museum's so that future generations of researchers and
educators may benefit from them. All information associated with these specimens
will be databased and assimilated into the Museum's algal collection. The
correct names of the primary reef-building algae will be resolved. The resulting
algal collection will be the most accurate comprehensive documentation of algal
biodiversity of the Pacific region in the world.

The Abbott Collection contains many thousands of valuable seaweed specimens that
document the marine reef-building floristic biodiversity of the Hawaiian Island
chain from Kure Atoll to the island of Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific.
Research, monitoring and resource management efforts, especially pertinent to
threats of marine invasive species and other environmental changes, are
substantial activities of many federal, state, and commonwealth governments.
Reliable records and accurate taxonomic identifications, with emphasis on the
reef-building coralline algae, are of major ecological importance in
understanding the dynamics of reef ecosystems. These data are crucial to any
effective resource management throughout the Pacific. The Museum's virtual algal
herbarium direct Internet access will enable immediate availability of precision
information and rapid response via interactive data platforms. Educational
benefits will range from general species information and images, to accurate
known distribution, species range predictability, potential spread of invasive
species, and ecological changes.
