9528574 Richardson In this project, PIs will study the Benguela Current as it
flows northward through the South Atlantic and across the equator. Specific
objectives are to measure the flow of Intermediate Water that is carried into
the South Atlantic by the Benguela-Agulhas system, and to trace its extension
northwestward. RAFOS floats are designed to float at a given depth in the ocean,
and to communicate with moored sound sources in a way that gives their location
periodically from which velocities at that depth may be inferred. Thirty such
floats will be deployed and tracked downstream of the Benguela Current at the
level of the Intermediate Water (about 700 meters), and in several Agulhas
eddies to estimate their contribution to the transport. The work will be carried
out in collaboration with South African (Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD)
surveys) and German scientists (18 additional floats and two additional sound
sources). The observations are expected to provide a visualization of the flow
field and velocity statistics which will be applied to developing and validating
models of the thermohaline circulation of the ocean.
