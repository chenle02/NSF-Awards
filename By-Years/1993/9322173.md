9322173 Fabes This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight
undergraduates to gain research experience in electron microscopy and
microanalysis of advanced ceramic materials. Students will initially take a one
week intensive course to gain a basic knowledge in micro structural
characterization of materials in general and to understand the concepts,
instrumentation and applications of scanning electron microscopy and x-ray
analysis. Following this, students will be integrated into numerous on-going
research projects, including: laser processing of sol-gel coatings, structure of
thin film ceramics, strengthening of glass by alkoxide coatings, and processing
of glass-ceramics from lunar resources. %%% The goal of this program is to
provide undergraduates with an experience of the excitement as well as
frustrations of conducting research at the cutting edge of technology. It is
expected this experience will serve to inspire and motivate students, as well as
to help make career decisions, increase interactions between students and
faculty, and expand job and graduate school choices upon graduation. Emphasis
will be placed on participation of Hispanic, women, and community college
students. Students will be recruited at the freshman and sophomore levels,
allowing the REU experience to impact career decisions before they are set.
