This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a high-rate and large-area manufacturing process for a non-toxic barrier coating
that can be used in flexible display and other applications. A flexible single-
layer and environmentally-friendly barrier that has both inorganic and organic
properties will be used to allow a much thinner barrier to be effective, thus
significantly reducing the manufacturing costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of a cost-
effective thin film encapsulation technology to enable a wide range of
applications such as emerging display, imaging, battery and power generating
technologies. These applications require a flexible, low-cost, and mostly
transparent, thin permeation barrier to prevent oxygen and moisture from causing
degradation. In this project, large-area scalability and ability to encapsulate
devices made on flexible substrates will be addressed.
