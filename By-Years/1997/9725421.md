9725421 FAZIO This proposed investigation will examine the use of relational
terms in children's mathematical performance. Young children in poverty are at
risk for academic failure in mathematics. One neglected area of research has
been children's understanding of mathematical vocabulary. Differences in life
experiences between children from poverty and their middle class peers may lead
to differences in the development of mathematical vocabulary. This exploratory
research would study the relationships among young children's understanding of
relational terms, their ability to use context in judging the meaning or works,
and mathematics achievement. Low-Income children's basic knowledge of relational
and mathematical vocabulary will be compared to classmates from middle -class
homes. In addition, the research will investigate how young children from
different backgrounds come to understand that some words have a dominant meaning
and an alternate mathematical meaning.
