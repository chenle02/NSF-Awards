This grant is in support of international travel for the U.S. scientific
community to participate in the Fifth International Permafrost Conference to be
held in Trondheim, Norway. Permafrost science is an active field which seeks to
explain a wide range of phenomena that characterize cold region landscapes and
influence Arctic ecology and hydrology. Permafrost is also a sensitive indicator
of climate and climate change, and permafrost thawing may have global effects
due to the release of greenhouse gases. This meeting is an important aspect of
the polar geosciences research program and will point to new directions for
future research in this area.
