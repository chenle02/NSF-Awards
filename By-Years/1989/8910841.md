In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Joseph B. Lambert
from the Chemistry Department at Northwestern University will study "New Organic
Intermediates Containing Silicon or Tin". He will explore the interactions
between the element and adjacent positive charge in order to study the
phenomenon of hyperconjugation. Efforts will be made to use silylenium ions to
provide new methods for carbon-silicon and silicon-silicon bond formation and to
serve as catalysts for polymerization reactions that may lead to new materials.
Positively charged species containing silicon, tin, or other Main Group elements
will be used to study hyperconjugation. Tin and lead will be used to study
delocalization of positive charge over many sigma bonds in order to prove a new
mechanism called multiple stage hyperconjugation. The spatial dependence of
hyperconjugation in vinyl and saturated systems will be studied. New strategies
will be devised for obtaining silylenium, germylenium, and phosphenium ions with
greater ionicity and stability. Silylenium ions will be used to provide new
methods for carbon-silicon and silicon-silicon bond formation and to serve as
catalysts for polymerization reactions that may lead to new materials. The
exceptional ability of tin to stabilize positive charge will be used to create
new phenyl and vinyl cations.
