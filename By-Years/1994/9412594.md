The Science and Technology Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science (DIMACS) will hold a special year program in Mathematical
Support for Molecular Biology. This award will help support the activities
planned for the special year. In particular, the program will feature a series
of several focused workshops and a number of exploratory mini-workshops, an
algorithm implementation challenge, a visitor program, and a postdoctoral
training program. The special year will explore the uses of the methods of
discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science in the solution of
problems of molecular biology. It will involve leaders and outstanding junior
researchers in the mathematical sciences in the solution of problems of interest
to and formulated with the help of biologists, will give focus to the developing
community of mathematical/computational molecular biologists, will engage
biologists in a primary role in defining the agenda of
mathematical/computational molecular biology, and will establish long-term
partnerships between mathematical scientists and biological scientists. This
award is being funded by several programs within NSF: Theory of Computing,
Algebra and Number Theory, Applied Mathematics, and Computational Biology.
