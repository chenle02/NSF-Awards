EEC-9513169 Baier This award provides funding for a joint, international
research collaborative program between the I/UCRC for Biological Surface Science
at SUNY Buffalo and six scientists from three former Soviet Union (FSU)
countries--Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The research will study the population
dynamics of zebra mussels (Dreissen Sp.) in an effort to understand how
environmental factors can play a role and manage zebra mussel populations in
North America. The researchers identified in this proposal have excellent
backgrounds, expertise, and qualifications to perform the work described. The
importance of identifying mechanisms to control this biofouling organism in the
U.S. and FSU is great.
