The goal of this research is to continue investigation of automated reasoning in
elementary geometry, differential geometry, and mechanics. It covers not only
theorem proving, but also formula derivation. In each of these three areas, the
following research will be conducted: (1) to improve existing proving
techniques; (2) to further study mechanical formula derivation; (3) to collect a
significant number of worked examples; (4) to improve Ritt-Wu's decomposition
algorithm and other key algorithms; (5) to combine Ritt-Wu's method with
Collins' method in elementary geometry; (6) to study practical application of
resulting techniques to areas such as kinematic synthesis of linkages and
mechanisms, CAD/CAM, etc.
