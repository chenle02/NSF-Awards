Ocean modelling suggests that the effect of the closure of central American
isthmus on ocean circulation was greater than previously suspected. The PI will
continue his sensitivity experiments on the effect of oceanic gateways through
the simulation of the Ocean General Circulation model. He will also focus on the
equatorial ocean model which is interactive with atmosphere to test the
upwelling patterns in equatorial Pacific. The results of these modelling
experiments will lead to understanding of the causes for changes in Cenozoic
oceanic circulation.
