The PI will carry out a two-year investigation of the area surrounding the
mountain, Ih Bogd, and the rupture area of the 1957 Gobi Altay earthquake in
southern Mongolia. The proposed research includes (1) mapping the surface
rupture in some detail and (2) searching for and dating organic material to
constrain recurrence intervals of such earthquakes and Lake Quaternary rates of
slip and vertical movements. Long term goals include understanding how the
landscape in such a clearly intracontinental region evolves by both tectonic and
surface processes. Using a total station he will make topographic maps of some
30 to 50 segments of the rupture zone of the Gobi Altay earthquake in order to
obtain objective data to determine the amount of slip, variations in such
amounts along the ruptures, and the orientations of the slip vectors on the
various segments.
