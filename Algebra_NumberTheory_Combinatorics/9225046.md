This award supports the research of Professor Rodger to work in combinatorics.
Professor Rodger will continue his investigations into the area of graph
decompositions and embeddings of partial graph-designs. Professor Rodger will
also continue his development of a natural generalization of latin squares,
which he has called patterned holes. This concept of patterned holes has led to
dramatic improvements in embeddings of various partial graph designs and has led
to generalizations of several classical embedding theorems. The research is in
the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
methods to study how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes
use of combinatorial research.
