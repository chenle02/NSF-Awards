This award supports a long-term visit by Dr. John R. Dickel of the University of
Illinois Urbana to the Australia Telescope National Facility in Sydney to work
with Dr. D.K. Milne. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are an important link between the
stars and the interstellar medium. An important contribution to understanding
these objects can be made by radio observations of a sample of SNRs in our
neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. Only the newly commissioned
Australia Telescope has the capability to make such observations of this
southern galaxy.
