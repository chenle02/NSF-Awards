Harford Community College's High Intensity Student Engagement Model (HIStEM)
will provide scholarships and co-curricular support to up to 42 academically
talented students with financial need in biology and engineering. The program
will function to increase the number of students completing associate's degrees
in biology and engineering and facilitate their transfer into a four-year
college or university to continue their STEM studies, thereby addressing the
need for qualified STEM professionals in the workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HIStEM program will provide up to 14 scholarships each
year to students who demonstrate financial need, possess high academic
potential, and are enrolled full-time. The goals of the HIStEM program are to
increase the retention and graduation rates with an associate's degree of
biology and engineering students and facilitate their successful transfer to a
four-year institution. Students will be supported through a cohort learning
community and activities aimed at increasing student-faculty interactions and
engagement in the college and scientific communities. Activities will include
the assignment of a personal faculty mentor and an academic advisor to provide
academic and professional advising, opportunities to network with STEM
professionals and engage in independent research, course redesigns, and sessions
in academic skills development. Through the use of institutional research data
and student surveys, the program will measure the effectiveness of increased
student-faculty engagement activities on the retention and graduation rates of
biology and engineering students at Harford Community College and their
subsequent transfer to a four-year institution.
