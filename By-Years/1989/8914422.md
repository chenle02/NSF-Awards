This research involves numerical modeling of flow near a surface containing
riblets, or corrugations alligned in the flow direction, to ascertain the basic
mechanisms behind their drag-reducing capability, and also development of a new
numerical scheme for dealing with flow over rough surfaces. In the second thrust
a spectral element method is to be coupled to a Cellular Automata (CA) model
very close to the surface to create a faster and more accurate method for the
numerical prediction of flow over complex surfaces. The research results should
provide both physical insight into the drag-reducing properties of structured
surfaces, as well as superior numerical codes for modeling complex surface flow.
