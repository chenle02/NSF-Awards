This work is aimed at the development of fast and processor efficient parallel
algorithms for graph problems in the PRAM model, and at the implementation of
them on currently available parallel machines, with particular attention to the
following. 1) Efficient parallel algorithms for several problems on undirected
graphs using the efficient parallel search technique, open ear decomposition. 2)
Efficient parallel search techniques for directed graphs by developing
alternative techniques to overcome the transitive closure bottleneck that exists
for these problems. 3) An optimal parallel algorithm for bucket sort.
