This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study in-situ
measurements of the global stratosphere which are needed to quantify long-term
changes, to improve the observations and parameteorization on which global
numerical models are based, and to calibrate/validate indirect probing methods
from ground or satellite sensors. Radiosondes routinely and inexpensively
monitor the stratosphere, but provide only limited information; research
aircraft, at great expense, operate sporadically and cannot reach the upper
stratosphere. BLAG (Balloon Launched Autonomous Glider) expands on the
radiosonde concept, and on the 1965 development by MacCready of the automatic
homing miniature glider, with the aid of modem technology -- especially GPS
navigation; miniaturization of sensors for turbulence, water vapor, and other
parameters; and advanced aerodynamics and structures. The small instrument
package is raised by balloon; it descends as a glider, covering substantial
traverse distances, and lands at a pre-designated spot. The economic potential
is to sell, and continually upgrade, these sophisticated BLAG systems that could
substitute for (and expand the usefulness of) a large percentage of radiosondes.
The approach is consistent with the AV motto of `doing more with less` BLAG will
provide vital information that is at unobtainable in spite of giant past and
planned investments in high altitude research aircraft programs.
