The current tsunami histories for Alaska and Hawaii are inadequate for making
decisions on tsunami warnings, inundation mapping and other tsunami mitigation
measures. The errors introduced through repeated compilations, the omissions of
detail in ensuing recompilations, the limitations due to the scope and purposes
of the ordinal compilations and subsequent studies, and the original material
overlooked and omitted from each compilation all combine to obscure the real
nature of the hazard. This project, together with work that is being done on the
West Coast tsunami experience, will provide a data base that substantially
covers the U.S. tsunami history and provide a useful tool for research and
revision of inundation maps, warning systems, and other mitigation efforts with
significant safety and financial implications. It will also be a contribution to
the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.
