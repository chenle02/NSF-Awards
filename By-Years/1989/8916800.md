Since its origin in the late Pleistocene, >Emiliania huxleyi> has become
ubiquitous in the world's oceans. It is the most abundant living coccolithophore
and the most important organism in the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to
the ocean sediments. Morphological forms include coccolith.bearing and naked
coccoid cells, and scaled flagellates. Only the coccolith.bearing morphotype is
readily identifiable in natural samples, and all studies to date on the
distribution and abundance of the species have been studies of only this
morphotype. Comparison to other coccolithophores suggests the motile form is an
alternate life cycle stage, but the life cycle of >Emiliania hyxleyi> remains
poorly understood, and its role in bloom dynamics is unknown. Recently developed
techniques permit identification and tracking of naked and flagellated
>Emliliania huyxleyi> cells in natural populations and simplify determination of
ploidy in cultured cells. The objectives of this research are (1) to compare the
abundances and distributions of the flagellated form to that of the coccoid
forms in natural populations before, during and after blooms, (2) to establish
ploidy and the life history, and thus (3) to determine the role of the
flagellated form, and of sexual recombination, in bloom dynamics.
