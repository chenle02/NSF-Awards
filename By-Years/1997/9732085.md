Explosive growth of the internet and intranets is leading to explosive growth of
electronic transactions and electronic collaboration. In the future, we will see
vastly more need, and opportunity, for technology assisted collaboration on a
very large scale. The goal of this research is to help create a solid and
positive foundation for the development of future VLSC (Very Large Scale
Collaboration) systems. VLSC examples include enterprise wide workflows (e.g.
merged state and federal government procedures); electronic town meetings
(massive real time multimedia conferences); and on-line democracies (national
discussions and electronic elections). The approach consists of conceptual
modeling, architectural design, mathematical analyses, simulations, and
implementation of small scale prototypes. This allows us to pursue important
issues of architecture, high level design, and low level design, all in concert.
The results of this research will provide architectural principles and building
blocks for the creation of flexible evolutionary workflow systems in which
people can freely interact synchronously as well as asynchronously within
structured as well as unstructured environments.
