The Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology of the National Research Council
will carry out a comprehensive assessment of research opportunities and needs in
the field of polymer science and engineering. The field has evolved dramatically
in the ten years since the 1981 report, "Polymer Science and Engineering:
Challenges, Needs and Opportunities." There is a clear need to define the
current research frontiers, the matching research needs and opportunities for
chemists, chemical engineers, biologists, materials scientists, and the
corresponding funding priorities that will be essential for planning and
decisions by funding agencies. The proposed study will be carried out by a
committee of 15 experts established by the Board. It is estimated that the study
will take 12 months to complete at a cost of $200,000 of which $75,000 is being
provided by the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation
Divisions participating are the Division of Materials Research, Division of
Molecular Biosciences, Division of Chemical and Thermal Systems, and the
Division of Chemistry.
