9561380 Turpen The cost and availability of health care products based on
peptides currently limit access to treatments. New methods are needed to produce
pharmaceutical quality proteins such as subunit vaccines and antimicrobial
peptides for human use on a large scale. This Small Business Innovation Research
Phase I project will determine the feasibility of producing peptides in plants
fused to the surface of viral particles. The approach of the small business
Biosource Technologies, Inc. integrates the inexpensive synthesis of protein in
plant biomass under non-sterile conditions with the design of an abundant,
stable, and unique molecular structure that may easily be processed from plant
extracts. This project offers important social and commercial benefits: By
dramatically reducing production costs, this technology will enable vaccines and
antibiotic peptides to be more accessible to a larger fraction of the world
population who suffer from numerous infectious diseases. By making vaccines and
antibiotic treatments more affordable, substantial new markets will be created
world-wide for these low-cost, high-volume health care products.
