What drives ecological specialization in plants and caterpillars in harsh
serpentine soils?

The unique physical and chemical properties of serpentine soils (e.g. low
nutrient content and high levels of heavy metals) often result in the evolution
of unique plant communities with rare and endemic plant species. In turn, the
distinct physical and chemical properties of plants should affect herbivore
performance and specialization, however, little is known about the consequences
of plant specialization on serpentine soils for herbivore diversity. This study
will document the unique flora and insect fauna of Santa Elena Peninsula, Costa
Rica, and quantify the extent to which habitat specialization in plants and
Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) occurs on serpentine soils using
observational and experimental approaches. The Santa Elena Peninsula consists of
ancient serpentine soils surrounded by younger, volcanic and sedimentary
deposits and provides likely conditions for environmental specialization yet the
region is underexplored and the effects of plant differentiation on Lepidoptera
are unknown.

The results of this study will fill a significant gap in knowledge on tropical
serpentine ecology. This study will provide a baseline dataset for developing
future work as well as create new national and international collaborations in
this area. This study will provide post-doctoral training in plant and insect
systematics, soil and plant biochemistry as well as training in undergraduate
teaching. The insect specimens will be showcased in K-12 outreach programs at
UC-Davis and the study and results will be used to build interactive tools for
introductory, undergraduate ecology courses.
