This award will support a workshop to develop a historical gazetteer on Franz
Josef Land. Such a gazetteer is essentially a document of accurate place names
and historical data that will synthesize 139 years of expedition accounts into a
single source of historical geographic data. The workshop will bring together
key international researchers from the US and Europe, whose work has documented
the history of exploration in the islands of Franz Josef Land, to develop
international toponymic (place name) guidelines. Four undergraduate students
will also attend. Defining both the derivations of historical place names, as
well as identifying consistent practices in the use of current place names, will
contribute to the utility of scientific observations in this region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of the project is the development
of international standards for place names and historical geographic research in
the region. The project the participation of US undergraduates will contribute
to training the next generation of geographic scholars. The results of the
workshop will contribute to the development of a scientifically sound historical
gazetteer for use by future scientific researchers (geographers, ethnographers,
ethnohistorians, biologists, natural historians, archaeologists, etc.).
