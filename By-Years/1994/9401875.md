9401875 Haiman This award will support the attendance of three postdoctoral
fellows and three graduate students, including at least two women, at the
Algebraic Combinatorics Conference in honour of Adriano M. Garsia, to be held
July 26-29, 1994, in Taormina, Sicily, Italy. The purpose of the conference is
to advance the use of methods from algebra and algebraic geometry in
combinatorics, and particularly to provide exposure to these methods for
graduate students and researchers beginning their careers. The conference will
be small and highly focused, with a workshop- style format. It will be strongly
international, with participants from the U.S., Canada, six European countries,
and Israel. The speakers have been chosen for the influence of their innovations
in shaping present research activity in algebraic combinatorics; they represent
the leaders in the field. The conference is expected to result in an exchange of
new ideas and techniques. With the eventual publication of the conference
proceedings, this meeting could have a lasting impact on several parts of
mathematics. * * *
