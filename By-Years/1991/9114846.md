Cavity filling in die casting represents an example of free surface fluid flow
that is important in manufacturing. The investigators have developed a new
method for the numerical simulation of transient, two-dimensional,
incompressible, free surface fluid flow that introduces the use of surface
markers and micro cells. In this project, the validity of this new simulation
method will be demonstrated by comparisons of numerical solutions with real
fluid behavior. The cavity filling simulation will be extended to include heat
transfer and temperature dependent viscosity effects and to include surface
tension and to accommodate curvilinear geometry. The extended simulation will be
used in conjunction with the existing simulation and the flow visualization
results to investigate the influence of heat transfer, temperature dependent
viscosity, and surface tension on cavity filling.
