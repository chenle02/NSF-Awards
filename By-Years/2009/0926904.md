The International and U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability)
Project Offices (USCLIVAR PO) provide critical infrastructure support leading to
the coordinated planning and implementation of U.S. and international research
activities that address CLIVAR goals which are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-
describe and understand the physical processes responsible for climate
variability and predictability on seasonal, inter-annual, decadal, and
centennial time-scales, through the collection and analysis of observations and
the development and application of models of the coupled climate system, in
cooperation with other relevant climate-research and observing
programs;&lt;br/&gt;- extend the record of climate variability over the time-
scales of interest through the assembly of quality-controlled paleoclimatic and
instrumental data sets;&lt;br/&gt;- extend the range and accuracy of seasonal to
inter-annual climate prediction through the development of global coupled
predictive models; and &lt;br/&gt;- understand and predict the response of the
climate system to increases of radiatively active gases and aerosols and to
compare these predictions to the observed climate record in order to detect the
anthropogenic modification of the natural climate
signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the USCLIVAR PO staffing,
travel by U.S. scientists to participate in CLIVAR meetings, funds for open
science workshops, and costs associated with outreach and communications
necessary to communicate CLIVAR findings and opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal enables
development of new community-driven scientific plans, coordination of research
activity implementation, and provides assistance to U.S. research program
agencies so their programs more effectively contribute towards mutually
agreeable challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from
this proposed activity are that the scientific community identifies emerging
climate science research topics of interest to the community, sponsoring
agencies, and to the nation; assesses current activities to identify program
gaps; and catalyzes (interagency sponsored) research activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complementary co-support is provided by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
