Stratospheric ozone depletion in polar regions is of scientific and public
concern because ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun. UV-radiation
causes DNA damage. Dr. Yayanos proposes to quantify the effects of increased
solar UV-radiation at the sea surface. He will develop methods to measure the
amount of thymine dimers, one of the main photoproducts formed in DNA, in sea
surface microbial communities. In addition, attempts will be made to show that
there is a variation in the level of thymine dimers on a diel basis. The
concentration level of thymine dimers in the sea surface microbial community may
be useful in developing a global model of ecosystem damage resulting from
stratospheric ozone depletion. Furthermore, if the high performance liquid
chromatograph method or the method based on DNA processing enzymes works for
detecting thymine dimers, then it would allow for the search for thymine dimers
buried over geological time in sediments and in ice. The pilot studies proposed
will be conducted on samples collected from southern California coastal waters.
