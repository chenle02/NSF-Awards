9424023 Hoffman The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research tisit by Dr. Beryl A. Hoffman to work with Dr. Elisabet
Engdahl at the Centre for Cognitive Science in Edinburgh, Scotland. This project
will involve the investigation of the use of prosody and word order variation as
strategies to express the information structure of a sentence that describes how
a sentence relates to its context. The PI will concentrate on modelling the data
in Turkish and investigate the cross- linguistic generalizations that can be
made in other relatively free word order languages such as German and in fixed
word order languages such as English. She will include implementations that can
be integrated into a Turkish/English machine translation system. The proper use
of prosody and word order variation is of considerable importance in developing
practical applications in machine translation and speech generation. Machine
translation systems, especially those including spoken language generation are a
very active area of research in Europe, such as the recent ESPRIT POLYGLOT
project. ***
