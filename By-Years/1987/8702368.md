Anabaena in a filamentous cyanobacterium that responds to nitrogen deprivation
by elaborating along the filament semi-regularly spaced cells (heterocysts)
specialized for N2-fixation. The pattern of heterocysts is initiated amd
maintained by an inhibitory field emanating from developing and mature
heterocysts. Dr. Wolk has isolated mutants that are defective early in
development and have found cosmids that complement certain of these mutants. To
study spatial aspects of gene expression in the developing filament, he has
developed a vector that facilitates transcriptional fusions to luciferase (lux)
and their maintenance in Anabaena. He proposes to: 1. Further develop and
characterize the use of lux to monitor gene expression from individual cells. 2.
Identify a gene that is expressed early in development, specifically in cells
fated to become heterocysts. Candidate promoters will be fused to lux and light
emission along the filament monitored through the course of development. 3.
Subject Anabaena carrying the successful promoter/lux fusions to transposon
mutagenesis and antisense RNA phenotypic mutagenesis to search for genes that
regulate the expression of the promoter. Such genes will be identified by
altered light emission. Dr. Wolk will focus on mutants that respond to N-
stepdown by inducing light emission in all cells rather than only in developing
heterocysts. 4. Clone genes that affect the expression of the promoter and, by
fusing them to lux, localize their expression in time and space. Higher
eukaryotes develop from single cells to collections of cells of varied types and
functions, but inhomogeneous differentiation in prokaryotes is rare. Dr. Wolk
proposes to exploit the differentiation of the filamentous cyanobacterium,
Anabaena, to study these processes in a simple prokaryote where powerful genetic
techniques can be utilized.
