This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This is a study of the factors contributing to the incidence and
prominence of private pensions as well as the relation between private and
public pensions. Theoretical issues deal with the role of old age pensions in
the growth and transformation of the welfare state. Countries compared are
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the United States, and New Zealand. Analysis is based
on systematic qualitiative comparisons, case studies, and quantitative cross-
sectional data from 1960 to 1990. %%% This research will contribute to the
sociological understanding of the origins and effects of pension policies and
the changing nature of the welfare state. By examining alternative policies
adopted by different states and the implications that follow from these, the
findings should be useful to policy makers concerned about the growth of pension
entitlements. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of social scientists.
