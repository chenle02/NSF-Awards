9409666 Vin Recent advances in computing, networking, and storage technologies
promise to create an infrastructure in which computer systems will support a
wide range of multimedia services through interactive multimedia servers
distributed over highspeed networks. The main objective of the research is to
synthesize cost-effective system architectures for designing such multimedia
servers by developing: (1) efficient disk scheduling algorithms which minimize
the average access time to media blocks from disk, (2) novel admission control
algorithms that a multimedia server can employ to maximize the number of clients
being serviced simultaneously while assuring the quality of service requirements
of none of the clients are violated, and (3) algorithms for efficient placement
(including replication and distribution as desirable) of multiresolution
multimedia objects of disk arrays. Algorithms and protocols that are found to be
promising will be implemented and evaluated in a prototype distributed
multimedia storage server. ***
