The materials and the approach to teaching calculus developed at the University
of Iowa are being adapted, refined, and implemented throughout the calculus
sequence. A lecture approach is integrated with an interactive computer
laboratory component centered around Mathematica Notebooks. Many of the students
are future mathematics teachers.
