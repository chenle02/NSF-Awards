Under certain patterns of constraints used to identify latent variable models,
the quality of inference can be affected by peculiar properties of the
likelihood. The project will examine issues in maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation of latent variable models, including identification, convergence, and
standard errors of the parameters. The work will begin by studying simple factor
models and extend to more complicated models such as growth curves, behavioral
genetics models, and multi-method, multi-trait matrices. In a Bayesian setting,
some of the difficulties with ML estimation are avoided, but other problems
emerge that require new considerations. Specifically, researchers must ensure
that posterior means and variances are not biased by mode-switching. The project
will explore the effectiveness of various approaches to applying constraints and
prior information to ensure proper Bayesian
inferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latent variable models are commonly used to
model complex phenomena in psychology, sociology, economics, education, and
human development, and software for maximum likelihood based analysis is widely
available. The project will lead to recommendations for best practices for
estimation and inference in these models.
