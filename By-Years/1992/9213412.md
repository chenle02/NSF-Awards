This Minority Career Advancement Award provides funds for a study of the
structural conditions of communities that contribute to youth behaviors such as
dropping out of high school, delinquency, and teenage pregnancy. The study will
focus on two cities (Detroit, MI and Phoenix, AR) with high levels of poverty
and residential segregation but with distinctive ethnic composition and
socioeconomic environments. Neighborhood demographic and organizational
variables from the US census combined with information from local schools,
juvenile courts, and health departments will form the data for the study. This
study will contribute to our understanding of how community characteristics may
contribute to the reproduction of the underclass. The Minority Career
Advancement Award will also permit the investigator to expand her research in
new directions, and it will provide opportunities for several minority doctoral
students to participate in the research process.
