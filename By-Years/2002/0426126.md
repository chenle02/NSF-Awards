Under this award, the PIs will analyze videotapes, still camera images, and do
petrography of dredge, rock drill, and dive samples from 5 site survey cruises
to the Atlantis Bank Oceanic Core Complex on the SW Indian Ridge. They will
complete the shore based analysis of the field programs and synthesize the data
to publish a geologic map, and interpretive cross-sections documenting the
stratigraphy, and emplacement the complex. The site is located adjacent to the
Atlantis II F.Z. on 11 My old crust exposing a 400 km2 lower crustal gabbro
massif in contact with the mantle along the transform wall. It is the location
of 1.5 km deep ODP Hole 735B, the only deep hole in the lower ocean crust, and
the location of a pending IODP proposal for a new hole to 3 km. The work will
provide the geological context for the drilling and tests of ideas on the
structure and lithology of ocean crust.
