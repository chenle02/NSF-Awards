By the age of 4 or 5 children come to understand that other people have mental
states such as desires, beliefs, hopes, and fears. This understanding provides a
foundation for development of social knowledge and social skills. For example,
realization that other people are mental beings like oneself is prerequisite for
developing an understanding of why people behave as they do, and how to interact
successfully with others. This project investigates an important issue that has
received little attention: How do children use their understanding of mental
states in social interactions? Specifically, the project focuses on children's
ability to use mental state understanding in attempts at persuasion, and how
this ability develops between age 4 and adulthood. One study will examine
children's persuasion attempts in real-life situations through analyses of a
large database of children's speech. In other experiments children will be
presented with scenarios involving persuasion (e.g., a child attempting to
persuade a parent to buy an animal), and asked to create or select a persuasive
argument. The results should further our understanding of children's cognitive
and social development, and should also have implications for educating children
about people and the social world.
