&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic Production of Nanoparticles in Plasma
Microreactors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on using atmospheric
plasma micro-reactors for the generic production of semiconductor and metal
nanoparticles from gaseous precursors. Size control is accomplished by residence
time in the reducing-conditions reaction zone while simultaneously limiting
coagulation by particle charging in the micro-plasma. Narrowly-distributed nano-
particles in the 1-3nm size regime are produced, and their optoelectronic and
magnetic properties are characterized. Oppositely-charged nano-particles of
dissimilar materials are combined to form particle pairs with novel properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new synthesis technique is simple, inexpensive, and
yet it produces high quality nanoparticles. It offers easy access to a variety
of materials at the nanoscale with novel optical, electrical, and magnetic
properties. For example, Si nanoparticles can be made to produce red, green, or
blue light, promising integration with silicon electronics to increase
communication speeds. Also, nanoparticles with different properties may be
combined to produce nanomaterials capable of self-assembly with added
functionality, for example, magnetic-luminescent particle pairs.&lt;br/&gt;
