Professor Josef Michl of the University of Colorado at Boulder is supported with
a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) from the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program to study the possibility of utilizing molecular-scale turbines
to move liquids on a nanoscopic spatial scale. The idea is to tether a
propeller-like molecule to a surface and to measure the motion of the propeller
using polarized fluorescence as a probe as gas or liquid is flowed over the
surface. The challenge is to get the propeller to move unidirectionally. The
molecule will be a modified diethynyltriptycene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next
step is to use light pulses to drive the molecular turbines. The molecules could
act as pumps, with applications in analytical chemistry, separations science and
biochemistry.
