"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop the fundamental scientific and engineering principles that will form and
drive the development of k-space multifunctional acoustic wave devices as
potential components in telecommunication technology with high level
functionalities. The approach is based on the use of phononic crystals as parts
of acoustic wave devices that can produce transformative k-space (real space)
functionalities in addition to the more common spectral (temporal) functions.
These novel functions arise from properties of phononic crystals such as zero or
negative angle refraction as well as generation of phase locked multiple beams.
This research will combine theoretical-computational methodologies and
experimental techniques. The research objectives will be met by demonstrating
experimentally prototype functional structures and devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research?s intellectual merit resides in the k-space
functionality of the devices. In contrast to traditional spectral functions
these new functions will transform the field of acoustic wave devices by
enabling spatial filtering, beam multiplexing and logic operations in compact
structures and devices as practical miniaturized and integrated components in
acoustic wave systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct the
research in a global context and will expose graduate and undergraduate students
to international collaborations through exchange as part of a Centre National de
La Recherche Scientifique (France)-University of Arizona International
Associated Laboratory. The investigators will build on experience in the
development of Do-It-Yourself technology kits on audible phononics to support
outreach activities at high schools and science fairs with the aim of promoting
science and engineering education and careers among the ethnically diverse
Tucson community.
