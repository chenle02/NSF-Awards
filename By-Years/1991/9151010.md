A Far Infrared Fourier Transform (FTIR) Spectrometer is being utilized for
student research at Coe College. This capability complements that being acquired
by the College through its purchase of a mid-range FTIR spectrometer. Student
research is a major benefactor of this instrument through the college's well-
developed project on research into properties and structure of alkali borate and
borosilicate glasses and related crystals. In addition, several physics courses
also make good use of this instrument.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
