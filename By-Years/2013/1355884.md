This S-STEM project at Allegheny College is providing scholarships for fourteen
undergraduates in the Natural Sciences for four years. Through its support for
the education and training of academically talented, financially needy students,
the project is helping to meet local and regional employment needs in research
and technical fields, as well as serving as a source of lessons learned for
other institutions facing similar challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several
features of the project's implementation stand out. Eligible students are being
selected from a pool of high school applicants based on their interest in STEM
fields, academic potential, and financial need. Scholarship students receive
academic and cohort support, which builds on the College's existing support
structure. Academic support includes a co-advising component by which each
student has one of the principal investigators as an academic advisor in
addition to one of the full-time professional staff from the academic support
office serving as a co-advisor. Scholarship recipients are also participating in
a one-week academic enrichment program prior to the start of classes. Cohort
support is being structured around a Living and Learning Community (LLC), which
includes housing on the same floor of a designated residence hall, regular
lunches (biweekly during the first year and monthly thereafter) along with
presentations from support offices, career services, science faculty and
students, and other personnel. Each student is also having regular contact with
the Director and the Assistant Director of Allegheny College's diversity office.
These individuals also serve as members of the management team along with the
two principal investigators, the director of the academic support center, and
the director of financial aid.
