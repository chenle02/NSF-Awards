9360689 Waight The objective of this project is to improve the short-term
electrical load forecasts required for the efficient operation of an electric
utility by developing a technique to utilize a high resolution atmospheric
simulation model to generate information about the variation of meteorological
conditions over areas which use a considerable amount of electrical energy (i.e.
urban areas). The current electrical load forecasting techniques utilize very
low resolution information generated by subjective modifications of output from
relatively coarse resolution operational forecast models. The Phase I research
is designed to determine the ability of a high resolution atmospheric dynamical
model to provide the information about the variation of meteorological
conditions over an urban area that is necessary to explain a greater portion of
the weather-related variance in electrical usage that can be done by current
techniques. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that the
variations in temperature associated with the urban heat island should have a
large impact on energy use and electrical loads in large urban areas, which is
unaccounted for by current short-term load forecasting methods. The PIs propose
a technique for simulating urban areas at high spatial resolution which will be
able to objectively predict the distribution of atmospheric variables in an
urban area, correctly determining the magnitude of urban effects and
quantitatively relating them to energy use in a way which is operationally
useful to electric utilities. ***
