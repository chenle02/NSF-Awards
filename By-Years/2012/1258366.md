The San Jose State University (SJSU) Science Research and Teaching Scholars
program is providing an average of fifteen $8,700/year scholarships over this
four-year project to students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry,
Geology, Meterology or Physics/Astronomy. The primary objective being achieved
is the preparation of strong scientists capable of becoming high school
teachers, scientists in the workforce, or students pursuing graduate degrees in
STEM, each after completing their baccalaureate degree. The well-designed
program is improving the STEM workforce by enabling strong academic performance
of Scholars and by providing experiences that allow each Scholar to identify the
best career path appropriate to them. Vigorous campus recruiting efforts are
leading to a robust applicant pool from which Scholars are selected based on
their GPA, documented financial need, their commitment to a career as a
scientist, and letters of recommendation. Scholars are supported with Academic
Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation Courses, a Graduate School Preparation
Seminar, Research Techniques Workshops, on-campus research opportunities,
teaching apprenticeships, and faculty mentoring. Close involvement with local
industry includes seminars and workplace tours. SJSU has a diverse undergraduate
student population and serves Silicon Valley. As undergraduate researchers the
Scholars are enhancing research productivity at SJSU while enjoying their first
scientific work experience. Scholars are also gaining teaching experience by
service as facilitators for Academic Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation
courses, teaching lab courses, or through service learning programs like Tutor-
to-Teach. Successful Scholars are serving as role models for future STEM majors.
