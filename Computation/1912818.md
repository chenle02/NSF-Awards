The goal of this project is to push forward the principled use of data in
science and applications. By means of rigorous mathematical analysis, the PIs
intend to uncover the hidden unity of seemingly unrelated learning problems and
methodologies, facilitating the transfer of theoretical and computational
developments and unifying the growing applied literature. The proposed work
intends to partially satisfy the societal and scientific need to build paradigms
that combine data and complex mathematical models to obtain more accurate
predictions while accounting for uncertainty quantification.

The PIs intend to address some of the new challenges that the increasing
complexity of models and the growing size of data sets have brought to the
foundations of optimization and Bayesian approaches to machine learning and
inverse problems. This project will emphasize the connection between statistical
consistency and algorithmic scalability: consistent problems are often
computationally tractable, and a key principle for the design of scalable
algorithms is to exploit statistical consistency wherever present. The specific
research projects that will be pursued have five overarching themes: i) The
analysis of continuum limits of discrete objects defined on random data. ii) The
study of new regularization techniques. iii) The design and analysis of scalable
sampling algorithms. iv) The use of discrete approximations of complex models.
v) The quantification of uncertainty in the solutions. Contributing in a
substantial manner to this wide range of themes will require close collaboration
between the PIs.
