This project develops and tests a model of factors producing the transition
from feudalism to capitalism in fifteenth century Tuscany. The model
incorporates both demographic factors (such as population pressure) and social
factors (such as contracts between landlords and tenants). Results of the
analyses will help refine theories of modernization, including those em-
phasizing religion and bureaucratization (Weberian), those emphasizing effects
of population (demographic), and those emphasizing relation to the means of
production (Marxist).
