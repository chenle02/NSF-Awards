This project addresses the challenge of achieving extreme low latency in
datacenter networks for Online Big Data (OLBD) applications which are critical
workloads in datacenter computing. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), which is
a promising alternative to traditional TCP, significantly reduces datacenter
network latencies by about an order-of-magnitude. However, RDMA adoption poses
two major challenges as RDMA suffers from performance fragility under
congestion, and RDMA incurs either wasted memory or significant programmer
burden for typical OLBD traffic. This project develops two novel networking
technologies -- Blitz and RIMA -- which enable scalable datacenter networks that
achieve the low latency benefits of RDMA while avoiding its drawbacks
(performance fragility, programmer burden, and wasted
memory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitz addresses performance fragility by
decoupling edge-congestion and in-network congestion. Blitz handles edge-
congestion using receiver-directed congestion control (RDCC) unlike prior
approaches where senders have to infer sending rates indirectly from round-trip-
times and/or dropped packets. RDCC enables accurate and fast (within-one-round-
trip-time) convergence, which leads to lower latency and higher throughput.
Blitz handles transient in-network congestion by deflecting packets along longer
yet less-congested paths.&lt;br/&gt;Remote Indirect Memory Access (RIMA)
addresses the second challenge by enabling reactive, on-demand memory allocation
as opposed to RDMAs proactive memory allocation for the worst case, which
minimizes the memory footprint without programmer effort. Together, Blitz and
RIMA enable extreme low datacenter network latency for OLBD applications. The
project will extensively involve Ph.D, Masters, and undergraduate students in
cross-layer research activities. Results from the projects will be broadly
disseminated via publication in scientific conferences.
