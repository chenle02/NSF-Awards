This project will contribute to the national needs for a strong STEM workforce,
resilient STEM research enterprise, and a public that understands science and
technology. To this end, the award will support a series of public, online
workshops that will explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher
education, including undergraduate and graduate studies, STEM teaching, and the
STEM research enterprise. They will also identify potential best practices for
responding to the pandemic, thus providing a starting point for broader national
conversations. The Board on Science Education and the Board on Higher Education
and Workforce at the National Academy of Sciences will convene the workshops,
which will focus on sharing of challenges and responses among stakeholders.
These conversations will illuminate the areas of greatest challenge, including
challenge areas that disproportionately affect certain populations of students,
faculty, or types of institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the nation addresses
the immediate impacts of COVID-19, these workshops will provide an opportunity
to deepen understanding of the resiliency of the postsecondary education system
in the U.S. in terms of disaster preparedness, the ability to provide access and
accommodation for all students and faculty, and the ripple effects of this
public health event on the research enterprise. The workshops will provide an
opportunity for institutions to share strategies and lessons learned in the
early months of the pandemic. By providing a forum for institutions of all types
to come together and learn from each other, the workshops will make it possible
for institutions to modify their strategies in real-time and, thus, can have an
immediate impact on campuses across the country. Furthermore, the workshops will
examine how institutionsâ€™ responses might have differential effects on students
and faculty depending on their backgrounds (race/ethnicity, gender, SES), age,
disability status and other factors in their lives. These insights can help
institutions examine the impacts on their own campuses and adapt their responses
to better serve all members of the educational and research communities they
serve. This award is co-funded by the NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education
and the Division of Graduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
