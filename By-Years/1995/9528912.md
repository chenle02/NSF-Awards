Multigrid Methods are efficient algorithms used for solving a variety of
problems. Previous development of multigrid software by the PI was rather
specific. In this project a broader approach and design will be used. The PI
will implement a general object-oriented multigrid toolbar with the following
features: Versatile and fast access data structure; OOP and literate programming
philosophy; differential equation and variational inequality formulations;
graphical user interface; and will solve some non-standard target problems. The
toolbox will be used for the development of multigrid methods for the following
non-standard problems: Small wavelength-(indefinite system) Helmholtz equations:
variational inequalities and eigenvalue problems. These problems are hard from
the multigrid point of view. The PI will design parallel algorithms for the new
methods and for other problems which may rise.
