This study will provide an update of the National Research Council 1984 report,
Renewing U.S. Mathematics: Critical Resource for the Future. It will consist of
an evaluation of the progress to date on the recommendations of the 1984 report
together with an assessment of the current status of the infrastructure for
research, a brief description of the current scientific status of research, a
summary of the most exciting current research opportunities, and a set of
recommendations for the future research and personnel directions in the
mathematical sciences.
