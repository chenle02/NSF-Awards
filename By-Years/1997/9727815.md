The floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) is required for specifying reproductive
organ identify and for controlling a determinate floral meristem. According to
the ABC model for floral organ identify, AG is the only known gene required for
the C function. Previous work in this laboratory has contributed to the
demonstration that AG is also sufficient within the flower to confer C function.
More recent results from this lab have shown that AG is an important regulator
of floral meristem identity in that it controls the meristem under conditions
not favorable for flowering. In this proposal, Dr. Ma will focus on the further
characterization of AG function using genetic and molecular approaches. He will
characterize the phenotypes of two recently discovered weak ag mutants. Analysis
of these mutants will shed new light on AG function. He will test for possible
interaction between AG genes mediating control of flowering by light. This may
reveal how AG function my be regulated by light signals. He will identify new
genes that participate in AG function by isolating enhancer and suppressor
mutations. These new mutations should provide new entry points to a better
understanding of AG function. In addition, new constructs that provide inducible
AG function will be made to analyze the effective temporal and spatial ranges of
AG action, and to prepare for further studies of AG functions, such as the
identification of target genes. These studies will likely produce new insights
about AG functions, and about MADS box genes in general. In addition, the
genetic resources that will be generated during these studies will be valuable
tools to others in the community.
