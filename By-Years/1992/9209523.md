Potassium channels are one of the main groups of intrinsic membrane proteins
which are fundamental for the generation and coding of signals in the nervous
system to convert environmental information into a language understood by the
brain. The brain carries out a variety of distinct functions and, as such,
requires a large number of coding mechanisms. To provide for this the nervous
system has developed a variety of potassium channels, each type with specific
structural and biophysical properties related to its function. To analyze this
diversity, genes that give rise to the large structural diversity of these
channels are being identified and isolated to be reinserted into simple model
systems, i.e., oocytes (egg) of the frog, where they can be isolated and studied
in the absence of the complex functions of the intact nervous system which
normally complicates their study. This project explores the structure and
function of one type potassium channel that has been identified in higher
animals and humans but whose function is not known.
