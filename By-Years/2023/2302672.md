Research in number theory is motivated by deep questions regarding the structure
of the natural numbers. Such questions have fascinated mathematicians for
millennia and have found applications in a number of diverse areas, e.g.,
cryptography, signal processing and data analysis, communications. Some of the
most fundamental objects of study here are the prime numbers. The study of prime
numbers uses tools from sieve theory, as well as connections to the zeros of
L-functions. This award will enable the PI to further explore fundamental
questions about families of L-functions and prime numbers. Further, this will
support the PI as he continues to mentor graduate and undergraduate students,
organizes conferences and seminars, and participates in extra-curricular
outreach. The PI will study the distribution of values and zeros of L-functions.
We study statistics over quadratic characters with fundamental discriminants,
where prominent problems have intimate connections to arithmetic problems. We
extend results of Conrey, Iwaniec and Soundararajan on the critical line theorem
for Dirichlet L-functions by building on our previous joint work on moments. We
study the eighth moment of automorphic L-functions, which has already exhibited
novel features. We investigate the statistics of a large orthogonal family for
the first time, where we have a plan to “reduce the conductor”; this also leads
to simultaneous non-vanishing results. We attack subconvexity results for
certain L-functions in conductor dropping families, which builds on our previous
work on moments. Further, we study problems in counting prime numbers of a
special form, which is connected to foundational conjectures in prime number
theory.
