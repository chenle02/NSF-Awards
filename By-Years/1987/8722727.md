This equipment will be used to carry out an approved experiment to probe the
nuclear equation of state (EOS) by measuring triple-differential cross sections
for neutrons from high-multiplicity collisions of equal-mass nuclei as a
function of mass number and bombarding energy. Calculations indicate that this
experiment can probe the EOS with good sensitivity, and measurement of
collective flow of neutrons will provide information complementary to Plastic
Ball and Streamer Chamber measurements of charged particles. The wide dynamic
range of neutron energies from about 20 MeV to nearly three times the kinetic
energy per nucleon of the projectile, is in marked contrast to the Plastic Ball
measurements with energies from about 40 to 200 MeV/nucleon. The ability to
detect neutrons over this wide dynamic range of energies (and in many detectors
simultaneously) compensates for the reduced neutron detection efficiency.
