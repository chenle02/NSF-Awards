In this catalytic project, the Center for Educational Computing Initiatives at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is partnering with the Spanish
University of Distance Education (UNED) and the University of Deusto, Spain. The
first goal is the expansion and integration of MIT?s iLabs Shared Architecture
(ISA) with an open source learning management system (LMS) using SCORM
standards. The coupling of online labs with LMSs will allow a particular
experiment to be customized for multiple educational environments and for the
learning objectives of the lab experience to be carefully tracked and evaluated.
The second goal is to develop a specification for interoperability between two
remote lab architectures (ISA &amp; WebLab-Deusto) and create a plan for
infrastructure changes to both architectures to enable interoperability and
develop a proof of concept implementation. The increased interoperability
between different online lab architectures and learning management systems will
both lead to an increasing scalable ecology of online labs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online laboratories in general have the potential to
transform STEM education by enabling students to actively participate in global
collaborations through access to unique and exciting laboratories. They enable
new communities of researchers and students to explore phenomena, and jointly
engage in scientific inquiry with world-wide partners. This project contributes
by: 1) creating an interoperability specification that details the requirements
to enable the sharing of online laboratory across architectures and will
drastically increase the number of labs available; 2) creation of a shared
global resource of online labs and sharable curricular materials that students
have access to in the course of their academic careers; and 3) engaging students
in unique and exciting scientific experiments that will hopefully capture their
interest in science and engineering fields.
