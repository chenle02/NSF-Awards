9722239 Snoke The proposed CAREER program combines research and teaching on
contemporary topics of modern optics, or "photonics." The proposed experimental
research examines the spontaneous appearance of optical phase coherence due to
excitonic long-range order. The phase transition of excitons to spontaneous
coherence, which is exactly analogous to Bose condensation of atoms, will be
studied in two and three dimensions, namely, in semiconductor quantum wells and
in bulk semiconductors. The proposed teaching program involves creating a
photonics curriculum which prepares students for the growing job market in
optics and bioengineering, including tpaining in techniques such as time-
resolved spectroscopy and acousto-optic modulation, as well as introductory
courses which make modern physics more accessible to students of all kinds. %%%
The proposed CAREER program combines research and teaching on contemporary
topics of modern optics, or "photonics." The proposed research centers on novel
physical effects of "excitons," which are essentially photons in an optical
medium which act as though they have mass. Under proper experimental conditions,
these "heavy and slow photons" can self-organize into a coherent wave with a
wavelength hundreds of times less than ordinary light. The proposed program of
teaching involves working with other members of the University of Pittsburgh to
create a photonics curriculum which prepares students for the growing job market
in optics and bioengineering, as well as introductory courses which make modern
physics more accessible to students of all kinds. ***
