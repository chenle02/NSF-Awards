The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is a project to investigate the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) at high angular resolution that was constructed and
operated under NSF support over 2005-2010. The ACT facility - a 6m off-axis
Gregorian telescope, detectors, and infrastructure - has had two successful
seasons of science observations during 2008 and 2009. The awarded project is a
follow-on program, called ACTPol, to greatly increase the number and sensitivity
of the detectors, and to add linear polarization capability. ACTPol will upgrade
and extend instrumentation on the existing telescope, which is located on Cerro
Toco (17,030') above the ALMA site on the Chajnator Plateau in Northern Chile.
It will address important questions in both basic physics and astrophysics, and
if successful will perform transformative research. The program will run for
five years. A new bolometer camera with polarization sensitivity will be
constructed and used with the ACT for the following science goals: 1) Constrain
the initial conditions of universe and measure "running" of scalar spectral
index with k; 2) Measure spatial curvature of the universe and dark energy; 3)
Discover or constrain the sum of the neutrino masses; 4) Measure the amount of
primordial helium; 5) Determine the growth rate of structure; 6) Complement the
Planck satellite on smaller angular scales; and 7) Enable future large-scale
B-mode polarization measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTPol will continue to
pursue the types of broader impacts already successfully undertaken by the ACT
project. These include a commitment to training students and postdoctoral
researchers, continuing strong international partnerships, exchange of
technology and personnel with NIST, and outreach to teachers and middle school
students, among other activities.
