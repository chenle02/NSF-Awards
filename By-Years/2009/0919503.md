University of Miami proposes to support technical services on two research
vessels, one operated by the University?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) and one operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic
Institution (HBOI). Both are operated as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Ships to be supported
include R/V Walton Smith (RSMAS) and R/V Seward Johnson (HBOI). As part of their
basic operations they will provide one (Smith) or two (SJ) technicians on each
seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year
continuing grant.
