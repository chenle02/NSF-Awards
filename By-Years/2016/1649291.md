The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program is NSF's flagship
cybersecurity research program. With the increasing importance of cybersecurity
to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research area, improving
communication between program officers and researchers supported by NSF and
other government funding agencies, coordination among PIs from the different
perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community is
increasingly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SaTC program provides national
visibility with the participation of the NSF Directorates for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR),
Engineering (ENG), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Social,
Behavioral, and Economics Sciences (SBE). There are currently over 800 active
awards in the program. The PI meeting will be a large, major event for the
Foundation and the community, bringing together PIs with government and industry
representatives. For this event there is a pressing need to meticulously plan
and organize the technical program, the venue and conference logistics. This
grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including
conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.
