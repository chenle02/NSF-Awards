Malicious software (malware) has become a major threat to computer security and
will continue to be a central theme for computer security research for decades.
This project takes a binary and virtualization centric approach to effectively
and efficiently defeat malware using both online and offline analysis. Offline
malware analysis aims to extract knowledge about the inner-workings for a newly
discovered malware instance or software exploit, for the purpose of building up
proper defense against similar attacks. Online malware defense aims to build
efficient security mechanisms to effectively confine malicious behavior and
collect enough evidence for subsequent security investigation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;For offline malware analysis, a novel virtualization-based malware
analysis platform is used, on top of which new type inference techniques are
applied to malware decomposition and vulnerability diagnosis. For online malware
defense, new techniques for module-level sandbox and execution replay using
virtualization are cooperatively used to defeat malware.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The results from this research will be disseminated through both
peer-reviewed publications and software release. Based on this research, new
course materials, modular hands-on projects, and professional training tutorials
will be developed, to help future computer engineers and security researchers
gain in-depth knowledge about malware defense.
