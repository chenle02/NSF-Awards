Chief objectives of this bi-national workshop are to: exchange latest research
findings in vibration and noise engineering; invite industry to identify key
research questions and trends that must be urgently addressed; and form
collaborative teams and provide an opportunity for a closer interaction between
leading U.S. and Indian experts. The 3-day joint symposium will be held at the
Center for Automotive Research at The Ohio State University in the fall of 2001.
The symposium builds on a similarly focused small workshop that took place at
IIT Delhi, India in 1996. Pre and post workshop activities will include
industrial R&D visits and short courses. Technical topics include vibro-acoustic
analyses of structures, equipment and vehicles, machine dynamics, signal
processing and diagnostics, spatial domain measurements, non-linear problems,
computational techniques, dynamic design concepts, passive and active damping,
smart actuators and sensors, and the like. A special issue of the Journal of
Sound and Vibration will be published based on the articles presented at the
workshop. This symposium intends to identify common international interests and
priorities in the area of noise and vibration control and focus on important
relevant scientific issues.
