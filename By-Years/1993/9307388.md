9307388 Yamamoto The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular factor that
binds to a specific class of circulating hormonal steroids; this hormone-
receptor interaction triggers binding of the receptor to specific stress on DNA
and a subsequent change in the expression of nearby genes. Recent evidence
suggests that in addition to the hormone, certain other factors also interact
with the receptor and modify its activity; these include a heat shock protein,
phosphate addicts, and DNA itself. Dr. Yamamoto proposes that these other
interacting species may also convey signaling information to the receptor, and
that the receptor consequently serves to integrate signals from different
regulatory input pathways. He will investigate the nature and consequences of
these various receptor-ligand interactions, using a range of molecular, genetic,
biochemical and structural approaches. As signal transduction processes are
universal and fundamental for communication within and between cells, a better
understanding of the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway, and of the
mechanisms by which multiple signaling inputs may converge on a single factor,
could be generally significant for analyses of many transactions of biological
information. ***
