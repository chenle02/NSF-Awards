The PIs propose to develop theoretical and practical methods that can help
determine effective temporal pricing and allocation decisions. The reason this
is particularly important to many US industries is that unsold capacity at the
end of a sales horizon has negligible value. Therefore it is essential that
within each sales horizon temporal pricing and capacity allocation decisions be
optimal. The PIs propose a program of empirical studies which will involve the
participation of the Federal Department Stores.
