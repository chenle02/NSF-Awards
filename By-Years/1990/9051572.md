This project establishes a computer-aided engineering environment for students
doing computer designs and implementations in their undergraduate computer
architecture courses. The environment includes tools for combinational and
sequential network design and for automatic generation of netlist forms for
validation using digital simulation. The project will provide modern
workstations that will ensure the feasibility of doing realistic designs. These
designs include microprogrammed microprocessor design in the introductory
computer architecture course, and parallel processor designs in the advanced
term. The designs are validated using gate-level and functional simulation. This
project is significant in establishing a laboratory mode for computer
architecture that allows large and complete computer designs within a reasonable
amount of time. The workstations provide a stimulating interactive environment
for constructing and debugging computers.
