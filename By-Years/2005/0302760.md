The EU-US Task Force on Environmental Biotechnology obtained one-time support
for short-term transatlantic exchanges of early career scientists designed to
foster collaborative interactions and enhance the professional development of
the exchange fellows through the acquisition of expertise in microbial
biotechnology. Eleven participants have completed exchange experiences in EU
laboratories. These experiences have generated much enthusiasm for the program
and requests for its continuation.&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations and publications are
now in the planning stages. As a result of this momentum, we are seeking a
renewal of the grant funding to support a similar number of new exchange fellows
in the coming year.
