This project focuses on the role of symmetry in algebraic geometry, an area of
mathematics concerned with the study of the solution sets of systems of
polynomial equations. This topic has long played a central role in mathematics,
and it lies at the intersection of many fields of mathematics: the problems to
be studied relate to wide variety of areas of mathematics, including topology,
algebra, and number theory. The project will investigate a variety of situations
in which unexpected symmetries of equations make it possible to explore
otherwise difficult-to-understand geometric phenomena and to test a wide variety
of geometric conjectures in new settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular
emphasis of this project will be on the connections between algebraic geometry
and algebraic dynamics, the study of iterated rational maps, and the results
will include applications of each field to the other. On one hand, the
investigator will work to understand how ideas from dynamics can be used to
reveal a variety of otherwise obscure phenomena in higher-dimensional algebraic
geometry, and he aims to demonstrate that varieties admitting dynamically
interesting self-maps provide a fertile source of examples (and
counterexamples). Conversely, the investigator will also work to understand how
the methods of algebraic geometry (and the minimal model program in particular)
can be employed to understand the geometric properties of algebraic varieties
with very large groups of symmetries.
