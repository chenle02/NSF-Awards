9510513 Olson This work is supported by a Research Planning Grant for Women
Scientists and Engineers Award. The purpose of the proposed research is to shed
light on the behavior of mixtures of materials, particularly in cases where
anisotropy or nonlinear behavior plays an important role. Effective medium
theories and the self-consistent approximations have been successfully used to
pridict behavior of mixtures in linear and isotropic situations. New
approximations are proposed which circumvent some of the drawbacks of the
effective medium theories. An average energy approach rather than an average
stress approach will be used. The National Science Foundations mandate to ensure
the vitality of the Nations scientific enterprise includes concern for the
quality, composition, distribution and effectiveness of the human resource base
in science and engineering. Within this context, the Foundation is committed to
enhancing the current rate of participation of women in science and engineering
careers, in general, and as active participants in all of its programs. Research
Planning Grant awards are made: (1) to help increase the number of new women
investigators participating in NSFs research programs; and, (2) to facilitate
preliminary studies and other activities related to the development of
competitive research projeats and proposals by women who have not previously had
independent Federal research funding. Research Planning Grants are one-time
awards that may be used for preliminary work to determine the feasibility of a
proposed line of inquiry, and/or for other activities that will facilitate
proposal development.
