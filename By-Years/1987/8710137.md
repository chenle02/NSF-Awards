This research investigates the automatic generation of inference rules to
support intelligent data processing. For example, in knowledge-based systems,
production rules encode knowledge used for expert reasoning. In database
systems, inference rules encode integrity constraints used for semantic query
optimization. Such rule-based systems now depend on human experts to supply the
rules. This proposal focuses on a database application, developing a semantic
query optimization system that automatically derives and maintains rules, based
on database usage patterns and changes to the database state. The automatic
derivation of rules is a promising self-adaptive database optimization technique
that combines areas of research from both database theory and artificial
intelligence. The importance of this research is that it will lead to
improvements in the performance of many kinds of rule-based computer programs.
System-derived rules can be more flexible and efficient than a set developed by
a human expert. In addition, the criteria developed for automatic evaluation of
various rule sets may be of use to human experts as well.
