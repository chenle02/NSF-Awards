This project is in the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative (COLP) and
supported jointly by Chemistry and Biophysics. Fundamental studies of protein
structure-function relationships will be carried out. Iso-cytochrome c from
yeast is used to study how amino acid replacements and deletions affect key
parameters such as electron transfer rates, binding strength, specificity to
protein partners of cytochrome c, and protein stability. Detailed intracellelar
measurements will be made for comparison with the in vitro work, using growth in
lactate medium as a measure of relative specific activity. Specific mutations
have been generated for each of the studies. Along with the experimental work, a
variety of theoretical approaches are being developed to aid in the design and
interpretation of experiments. This project is a continuation of that previously
supported under the COLP Initiative.
