Dr. Judith Skog of George Mason University, working with her Smithsonian
colleague Dr. William DiMichele, has organized a day- long symposium of
botanists and paleontologists to synthesize morphological and genetic
information on the most ancient lineage of vascular land plants, the lycopods.
Modern-day pine moss and quillworts are among the surviving species of this
group, which in its long fossil history included large trees of the
Carboniferous and other forms contributing to the great coal beds of North
America. Paleontologists will analyze the patterns of diversification and of
extinction that characterize the group throughout its 400 million year history,
and botanists will describe the morphological and genetic variability present in
the world's living species and assess reasons for the current evolutionary
status of the group. Researchers from the U.S., Denmark, and Britain will
present papers at the symposium, thus representing the full range of current
study on these primitive land plants.
