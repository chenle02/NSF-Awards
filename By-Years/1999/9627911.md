9627911 VanderPluijm Work in recent years, particularly in young orogens, and at
high structural levels, has shown that extensional structures form during and
especially immediately following contraction. This project will follow
indications that extension was similarly involved in the Grenville orogeny of
the eastern seaboard. The Carthage-Colton shear zone marks the easternmost
boundary of the Grenville Metasedimentary belt and preserves evidence of the
late-stage extensional history. Results will not only clarify Grenville history
of the Adirondacks but are expected to offer insights into the nature of deep-
crustal processes doing orogenic evolution.
