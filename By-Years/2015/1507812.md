NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: From catalysis to photovoltaics, metal oxide surfaces
are commonplace elements of materials design. In catalysis, metal oxides are
employed as supports for catalysts. In photovoltaics, they constitute electrode
materials. A trend in current research efforts is to find inexpensive
modifications to metal oxides so that specific properties of the complex
material can be achieved. This goal is particularly important for the catalysis
industry, in which the oxide support can be orders of magnitude less expensive
than the catalyst. Enabled by state-of-the-art computer simulations and
imaging/spectroscopy techniques, this project aims at finding energy-efficient
and inexpensive modifications to aluminum oxide that can alter its electronic
behavior allowing it to become electron rich. Electron richness is an
interesting general property of materials which can be used to boost catalyst
performance as well as photovoltaic function. The research is carried out by
training university-level students under the supervision of the PI and co-PI,
and it is supported by an outreach program involving training high school
students in materials modeling and imaging from low-income backgrounds during
the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The goal of the project is
to devise simple ceramic engineering processes to fabricate electron-rich gamma
alumina surfaces. The goal is pursued in tandem by quantum-mechanical
calculations based on periodic density functional theory and by materials
synthesis, imaging, and spectroscopy. Alumina nanoparticles of different sizes
are being doped with phosphorus and nitrogen with the aim of placing the dopant
subsurface, sheltered from atmospheric oxygen. On the theory side, high-
throughput calculations are analyzing a large number of possible configurations
of the alumina surface and dopant location.
