A laser-doppler anemometer (LDA) will be used for measuring the instantaneous
point velocities in swirling turbulent jets, with two specific heat transfer
applications currently in mind: gas turbine can-type combustors, and active
cooling of electronic circuit boards. Swirling and recirculating flow fields,
which characterize these applications, are particularly susceptible to
alteration by intrusive probes, making non-intrusive optical measurements almost
a requirement. Results of the present study will be useful to design engineers,
who, at present, have little data upon which to optimize the heat transfer
between the fluid and the walls of gas turbine combustors and circuit boards.
