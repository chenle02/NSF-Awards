This is a project in which a new type of detector, will be used to analyze
diffracted X-rays from diamond anvil, high-pressure experiments. The new method
will increase the resolution by approximately an order of magnitude, which will
make it possible to determine the lattice geometry for low-symmetry phases. In
addition, the new detector will be more compatible with new generations of
synchrotrons now being planned. The new detector will be used to obtain the
first accurate structural information and equations of state of a variety of
low-symmetry, high- pressure phases of elemental solids, silicates, and oxides
under pressures characteristic of the lower mantle and core of the earth. The
data can then be applied to seismic and other studies of the earth's interior.
