The IEEE International Conference on Healthcare informatics (ICHI) is the
premier international forum concerned with the application of computer science
principles, information science principles, information technology, and
communication technology to address problems in healthcare, public health, and
wellness. The ICHI 2013 program includes several invited talks by leading
researchers in Health Informatics, contributed paper presentations, as well as
several workshops on emerging topics. ICHI 2013 is scheduled to be held during
September 9-11 in Philadelphia, PA, USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports
approximately 20 students from U.S. universities to attend the ICHI 2013
doctoral consortium, an event that is specifically targeted to Ph.D. students.
Special effort will be made to actively encourage women and members of other
groups that are currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines to participate.
The doctoral forum enables doctoral students to benefit from one-to-one
mentoring from senior researchers, and interactions with other students in
Health Informatics at a critical stage in their careers. The award contributes
to the education and training of the next generation of researchers and
educators in an increasingly important area. It also helps broaden the
participation of members of underrepresented groups and women in Health
Informatics research.
