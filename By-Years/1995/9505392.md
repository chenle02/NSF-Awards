One of the great challenges facing today's software engineers is the
development of reliable systems, which are known to perform correctly in all
circumstances. The most critical applications often involve concurrency and
real-time, which increase the difficulty of system development and validation.
Testing and debugging cannot prove a system is correct. However, they are
currently the most effective methods available for validating real applications.
This project investigates the use of oracles created from Graphical Interval
Logic (GIL) specifications in testing and debugging of real-time programs. GIL
is a visual logic for specifying and reasoning about properties of real-time
systems. The existing GIL tools allow mechanical checking that system
specifications guarantee critical correctness requirements. This project seeks
to produce a method for relating GIL specifications to real-time programs that
permits deterministic finite-state automata constructed from GIL specifications
to be used in verifying that executions of a program are correct. When an
execution violates a specification, the associated oracle would construct a GIL
formula describing a fault in the execution. This formula would be displayed
graphically, appropriately aligned with an execution trace, to help the user see
where in the trace the fault occurred and the nature of the fault. Formal
methods must be automated if software engineers are to use them in the
development of real systems. The implementation and experimental evaluation of
prototypes is therefore an important facet of this project, which combines
analytical research on formal methods with experimental research aimed at
assessing the practical utility of formal methods.
