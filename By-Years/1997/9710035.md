For many years women were excluded from or underrepresented in clinical
research studies. In the early 1990s federal policies governing women and
medical research were revised. Two agencies, NIH and the FDA, took the federal
guidelines and implemented very different and distinctive policies governing the
representation of women in clinical studies. This research focuses on why
different policy regulations were adopted by these agencies. In the detailed
case studies that are produced, two distinct models of policy making are tested.
Each model offers specific predictions concerning when alternative paths are
taken by agencies. This research provides a greater understanding of those
factors that influence public policy, the procedures by which they are developed
and the specification of alternative policy options within the U.S. political
system.
