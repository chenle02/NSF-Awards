This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel portable sensor array device, based directly on biological principles, for
rapidly detecting, identifying, and quantifying volatile compounds in the
environment. Lab and field tests show that this platform is sensitive enough to
detect and discriminate the vapor signature of buried TNT-filled landmines. This
SBIR Phase I project focuses on incorporating into the device a novel sensing
technology that uses dye-labeled DNA to directly detect volatile chemicals with
the use of state-of-the-art microarray equipment.

The commercial application of the product will be as a lightweight, low-cost,
hand-held volatile chemical detection system for use in security screening for
the rapid detection of explosives, chemical warfare agents, and other hazardous
materials. Other potential uses include medical diagnostics and environmental
monitoring.
