The main objective of this research is to enhance the similitude of steel
structures which can be attained using small-scale models. A second objective is
to reduce the cost of small-scale model construction. To attain these objectives
a series of tests on beams, columns, shear links, and an eccentrically braced
frame constructed using specially manufactured small-scale wide-flange sections
are proposed. Central to this project is a novel method of manufacturing wide-
flange sections from individual plates by welding in an extensive fixture. This
method, which has been found successful in a small pilot study, results in
straight sections with excellent dimensional accuracy. In addition, the
simulation of residual stresses similar to those found in prototype sections may
be accomplished. Successful completion of this project is expected to enhance
the use of small-scale models for testing novel structural systems and refining
existing ones. Use of small-scale models will enable researchers to test more
complete structures in order to better determine appropriate design procedures
and ensure that critical failure modes are not overlooked in analysis.
