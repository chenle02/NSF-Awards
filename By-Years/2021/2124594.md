The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in demonstrating a new laser used for
the complex computer networks of the high-performance computing (HPC) and data
communications industries. HPCs are critical for studying many complex
scientific phenomena. Likewise, cloud datacenters represent the backbone of the
pervasive connectivity that enables mobile computing, communications, and
networking. Both HPCs and datacenters are increasingly reliant on advanced
techniques to link hundreds of thousands of computers. The proposed project
enables new systems with improved performance, efficiency, reliability, and
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project will focus on optimizing the performance of novel semiconductor quantum
dot based multiwavelength laser sources. Multiwavelength lasers with adequate
output power and low noise for commercial applications have long proven
challenging due to gain competition between lasing modes and dispersion. The
designs and materials platform developed in this project address these
challenges directly. The quantum dot gain material provides stability against
the traditional barriers to multiwavelength laser performance. By optimizing
material properties and device designs, the gain competition between dot sub-
populations and the effects of dispersion will be minimized. This can be used
for various integrated circuit chips, including ethernet switches, graphics
processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
