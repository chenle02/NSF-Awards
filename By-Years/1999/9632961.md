9632961 Shuler The goal of this proposed research is to identify and investigate
the biosynthetic significance of an unknown taxane recently discovered in the
Principle Investigators laboratory while performing plant tissue culture
experiments with certain metabolic inhibitors. These experiments involved the
culture of Taxus species which produce Taxol, an important new anti-cancer drug.
It is currently generally accepted that baccatin III is the direct biosynthetic
precursor of Taxol. However, recent experiments by the PI indicate that baccatin
III could be selectively and completely inhibited without any significant effect
on Taxol production. Other inhibition experiments have shown the accumulation of
a single unknown taxane, which is not baccatin III, but which could,, in fact,
be the direct precursor of Taxol. This proposal outlines a multidisciplinary
approach to identify this unknown compound and investigate its biosynthetic
significance using knowledge of manipulation of Taxol production by Taxus cell
cultures, and established techniques in biosynthetic chemistry. ***
