Abstract This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award. Dr.
Eisenberg and his colleagues propose to use the methods of semiconductor science
to analyze electric current flow through ionic channels of known three
dimensional structure in biological systems. Ionic channels are protein
molecules found in all living cells and are of great technological and
scientific importance to both fundamental understanding of biology as well as
practical application of biological principles for product development in the
fields of health, energy, and environment . This research is based on the
concept that the mathematical models used to describe the properties of ionic
channels and semiconductors are nearly the same. This project is designed to
test that concept.
