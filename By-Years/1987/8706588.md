Ecological research at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station will be enhanced
through improvement of the experimental pond facility and the addition of an
image analysis system to the existing VAX computer. Nutrient-rich sediments in
nine of 18 experimental ponds will be replaced with a marl-sand mixture to
better reflect naturally occurring substrates in regional lake systems. The pond
liners will be replaced with 20 mil PVC, while the single reservoir will be
relined with UV resistant Hypolon (32 mil). The image analysis work station
augments the research support capability of the Station's VAX computer system
and provides for its further growth potential. These facility improvements
augment a long history of research, a resident scientific staff of high calibre,
an exceptional physical plant, and strong institutional support.
