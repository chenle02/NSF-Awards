The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to positively impact the
sales process by enabling easier, faster, and better access to previous sales
conversations and improving sales management oversight. These improvements, in
turn, will lead to increased sales efficiency and customer acquisition and
retention, and will enable companies to achieve a greater profit margin, while
maximizing customer satisfaction. The insights gained in this project may also
facilitate communication in other markets including interviews, counseling, etc.
The project will diversify the technical workforce by engaging women and
underrepresented minorities in research and development activities and will help
increase tech-related employment and talent retention opportunities.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to
significantly increase the productivity of sales representatives and their
managers by providing them with advanced technology to streamline their sales
processes. The platform developed in this project will significantly reduce the
time it takes a sales agent to process or recall their sales conversations,
decrease the sales training time through more effective management oversight,
and facilitate the transition between sales agents. The platform will use a
subscription-based Sofware as a Service (SaaS) business model that provides fast
and centralized development and maintenance, while also allowing for a broad
outreach. Specifically, this project will develop novel methods and tools to
process and analyze sales conversations by: (1) producing summary notes; (2)
extracting action items; (3) allowing for smart access to conversation content;
and (4) measuring engagement metrics. The project will leverage the recent
advances in natural language processing and a large database of proprietary
sales conversations that will allow the platform to learn the intricacies of
effective sales communication.
