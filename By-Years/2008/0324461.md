GOALI-Ultrafine Grained and Nanostructured Ceramics:&lt;br/&gt;Influence of
Processing, Grain Size and Strain Rate on Fracture
Characteristics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The focus of this project is to
investigate the processing-structure-property relationships in bulk ultrafine
grained (20-200 nm in grain size) ceramics that are rapidly consolidated to near
theoretical density using novel synthesis and processing methods. The rate-
dependent indentation fracture characteristics and the implications of these
results to material removal during high-rate processes such as impact, dynamic
wear and high speed grinding will be investigated. Based on the experimental and
microscopic observations, analytical and numerical models will be developed to
provide better insight into the effect of grain size on the mechanical response
of this unique class of materials.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed investigations are of
significant practical interest, because they will assist in optimal design,
successful use and exploitation of the full technological potential of these
ceramics in dynamic applications. Insight gained will facilitate exploration of
the 'nano-scale materials design space' for optimizing the grain size and the
properties to meet specific challenges. &lt;br/&gt;
