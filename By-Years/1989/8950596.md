This project involves introducing a nonlinear dynamical systems component to the
undergraduate laboratory experience at the introductory and advanced levels. At
the introductory level, a low frequency ac amplifier is used to magnetically,
drive an oscillating steel beam (hacksaw blade) into a nonlinear regime where it
displays bistability, hysteresis and jump behavior of the oscillator amplitude
versus the driving frequency. At the advanced level, the amplifier will be
supplemented with a digital storage oscilloscope and a computer to generate
signals to be amplified and to analyze signals proportional to the oscillator,
amplitude. In conjunction with equipment already on hand, this project is
increasing the knowledge and skills of undergraduate science and nonscience
students, particularly with regard to the growing field of nonlinear systems.
