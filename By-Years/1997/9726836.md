This research project seeks to contribute to the scientific foundation of
engineering design by developing a conceptual framework that can be used to
study, correlate and compare existing engineering design models, which may
obtain from widely different perspectives. The resulting framework will consist
of a design concept interchange language with rigorous mathematical evaluations.
This interchange language will be used to explain the rationales and correlate
the concepts used in different models. The mathematical evaluations will be used
to explicate underlying assumptions of various design models and to evaluate
their validity and limitations. Six to ten engineering design models will be
selected from engineering, decision theory, and artificial intelligence fields
for this research. The framework will be developed based on the critical review
of these selected design models. An interdisciplinary research team, including
engineers, mathematicians, and decision theorists, is assembled to develop this
framework for engineering design models. Design is the essence of engineering
profession; and engineering design has been a topic for researchers from
different disciplines. Some of them are from various engineering disciplines,
others from decision theory or artificial intelligence fields. Although a number
of engineering design models have been proposed to date, little cross reference
exists in these models and communication among the researcher has been
difficult. It is commonly recognized that the lack of communication among
researchers has become a major obstacle for the progress of engineering design
research. If successful, the results of this research project will provide a
common language and framework for engineering design researchers to share their
insights and results in order to identify gaps between the models and directions
for the future research.
