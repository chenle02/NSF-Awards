9501210 Canter This project will complete its original goal of demonstrating the
superiority of positron over electron diffraction for accurate semiconductor
surface structure determination The project will also carry out the most
sensitive to date examinations of nanometer scale open volume defects near metal
surfaces by using a positron re- emission microscope. Positron diffraction
measurements will be used for the observation of atomic hydrogen locations on
the hydrogen terminated (100) face of diamond with a sensitivity not possible
with electron diffraction. The position microscope is located at the Brookhaven
High Flux Breeder Reactor-based high flux positron beam in order to maximize its
resolution. %%% This project studies the physics of using positrons (anti-matter
electrons) to examine two of the most technologically important features of
materials: elementary defects which initiate fatigue in metals, and the surface
structure of semiconductors. The program has developed one of the world's most
precise positron-surface scattering systems for surface structure determination,
and the highest attainable magnification positron microscope to observe
subsurface defects in metals with a sensitivity that can not be attained with
conventional electron microscopy. ***
