Carnegie Mellon leadership is extremely supportive of this program and believes
strongly that SFS enables them to make a substantial contribution to the effort
to secure the Federal Government's information infrastructure. The University
desires to keep the number of students as close to current levels as possible,
and is sharing the costs of the program to achieve that goal. The University
contributes 25% of tuition costs per student, per year, a cost sharing that
totals some $850,000 over the life of the grant and makes the cost per student
proposal approximately $74,000, vs. approximately $87,000 in the original grant.
SFS scholarships are awarded to students in either of two masters' degrees, the
MS in Information Security Technology and Management, and the MS in Information
Security Policy and Management. The curriculum for both programs have been
certified pursuant to the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation Process of
the National Security Agency's National Infosec Training and Education Program,
and have been mapped against NSTISSI No. 4011 - National Training Standard for
Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Professionals.
