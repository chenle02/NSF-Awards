Professor John Harer plans to continue computing the homology of the moduli
spaces and related spaces. He also intends to pursue further the connections
between the Arbarello flag (and related flags) for a certain space of moduli and
the Schubert cells of the Grassmannians of Hilbert space. This project brings
together important objects from classical analysis, the moduli spaces of Riemann
surfaces of genus g, with important objects from topology, n.dimensional
manifolds and various associated groups. Results obtained can therefore be
expected to interest a wide audience of mathematicians.
