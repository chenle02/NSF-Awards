Professor Christophorou is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study electron attachment to electronically excited states
of molecules. These measurements are of interest in radiation chemistry, for
example. When ionizing radiation slows down due to interactions with matter it
produces an abundance of excited molecules or fragments of molecules and slow
electrons. The high probability of capture of slow electrons by excited
molecules is Professor Christophorou's important discovery. This project will
identify molecules which can be excited to superexcited states and determine
whether the observed extremely large cross sections for electron attachment to
low-lying excited states are common to all molecules. These measurements are
difficult because one has to first produce large numbers of electronically
excited molecules then carry out electron attachment measurements before they
relax back to the ground electronic state.
