This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will enable the
development of a lead free electrical conductive adhesive(ECA) with improved
mechanical and electrical properties. For the ECA to be electrically conductive,
the conducting constituents need to reach a percolation threshold value, such
that there is sufficient contact to form a conductive network path.

Due to the human health and environmental concerns from the use of tin-lead
alloy solders, electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs) are gaining use as an
alternative to solder technology in micro-electrical packaging. The successful
commercialization of this technology will allow the development of
environmentally friendly electronics.
