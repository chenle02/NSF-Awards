ABSTRACT 9501205 Iaizzo &amp; Sparrow This proposal is to fund innovative
exploratory research through a Small Grant for Innovative Research on the
temperature levels required for applying localized cooling for prevention of
pressure-induced biological effects such as ulceration, and applied localized
heating to aid healing. The work may lead to design criteria for thermal devices
to be used for the stated therapeutic purposes in the biomedical field. The
researchers will use modern but proven diagnostic techniques to monitor the
effectiveness of the localized heating and cooling to determine the most
effective temperature levels
