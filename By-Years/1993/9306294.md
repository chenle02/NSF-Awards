9306294 Bolt This research involves an investigation of morphological variation
in protoanthracosaur tetrapods from Paleozoic sites in Delta, Iowa, and
Goreville, Illinois. New fossil materials will be prepared, specimens will be
described, and new specimens will be named and illustrated. The preparation and
description of this material will increase by approximately 25% the number of
known Mississippian tetrapod genera. %%% The morphology and relationships of the
earliest tetrapods are poorly understood at present largely because there are
few well preserved and well prepared specimens available for study. Furthermore,
some of the best represented early tetrapod groups are highly derived
morphologically. The Delta fossils are the oldest terrestrial vetebrates ever
found in the United States and among the oldest in the world, as no more than a
dozen localities are known to be of equal or greater age. Both the Delta and
Goreville sites have produced exceptionally well preserved species of
terrestrial animals. The age, exceptional preservation, diversity and abundance
of specimens at both sites provide an extraordinary opportunity to learn about
early terrestrial vertebrates and morphological diversification among vertebrate
lineages.
