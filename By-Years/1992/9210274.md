The objectives of this Research Planning Project are to design, synthesize, and
characterize mixed-metal heterocyclic compounds, to study the ring opening
polymerization to yield polymeric compounds with M-P-S backbone, to investigate
the structure, composition, and properties of organometallic/inorganic polymers
and their decomposition to II-IV-V materials, to synthesize, characterize and
purify liquid trimethylsilyl-substituted phosphine compounds, and to study the
thermal decomposition of these compounds to elemental phosphorus. The results
from this research can find applications in devices such as light emitting
diodes, infrared detectors, and optical oscillators.
