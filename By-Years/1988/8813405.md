Electronic power switching devices are known to create power line disturbances
through the generation of harmonics, subharmonics, fractional harmonics and
other non-periodic voltage and current spikes. Most voltage and current
irregularities which result in a departure from the sinusoidal steady-state, 60
Hz wave form cause detrimental effects to the end users' equipment as well as to
distribution system operation and safety components. A method for modeling the
propagation and attenuation of harmonic energy in the distriubtion system is the
focal point of this research project. Experiments using a scaled-down network
will confirm the accuracy and versatility of the modeling techniques.
Understanding the phenomenon of harmonic current and voltage behavior will play
an important role in developing algorithms for the decoupling of the harmonics
from the fundamental power system frequency. This research will foster an open-
minded attitude towards new solid- state switching technologies, but at the same
time will make sure that the present-day power quality of distribution feeders
will not deteriorate.
