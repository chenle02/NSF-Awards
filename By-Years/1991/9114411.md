A combined theoretical/experimental study on the deformation behavior of high
strength polymeric solids is proposed. The mechanical testing machine capable of
exerting uniaxial as well as biaxial loading paths with controlled loading
rates. The time-dependent behavior manifested by creep, relaxation and rate
sensitivity is of great interest here. Initially we want to complete a uniaxial
study of high strength nylon and concurrent microstructural investigations such
as x-ray diffraction studies. A fixture to accommodate tubular specimens
subjected to axial, torsional and internal pressure loading will be designed and
built. Then a new test material will be chosen, preferably from the class of
polymeric, anisotropic, liquid crystals such as Xydar or Vectra, on which
uniaxial and biaxial testing and microstructural investigations are
contemplated. In the theoretical part we propose to model the finite mechanical
deformation behavior using state variable theories consisting of coupled
nonlinear differential equations. The aim of the research is to combine
synergistically phenomenological experiments, microstructural investigations and
continuum mechanics to arrive at a mathematical model of the polymeric solid.
