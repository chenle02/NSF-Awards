This project will study a methanogen with unusual physiological attributes--the
inability to produce methane from either carbon dioxide or acetate, but to do so
from methanol provided that hydrogen is present. Surprising is the fact that a
great deal of carbon of cell components is derived from acetate or carbon
dioxide and little from methanol; it is this latter aspect of biosynthesis that
is the focus of investigations that will use 13-C labelled acetate or carbon
dioxide, followed by high-resolution NMR studies, to elucidate key carbon-
entrance pathways using intact cells and cell extracts. Key enzymatic reactions
and coenzyme requirements of central reactions of the apparently unusual reduced
one-carbon biosynthetic pathway(s) will also be studied. The study of a
physiologically-unusual methanogenic archaebacterium, with the goal of
understanding the means by which acetate and carbon dioxide carbon are built
into cellular components is the focus of this project which involves
collaboration between microbiologists and chemists. //
