This research is an experimental program employing quantitative transmission
electron microscopy and theoretical analyses to clarify the mechanisms of
precipitate nucleation and growth in model alloy systems. The role of ternary
additions in affecting growth is emphasized. Defect density, solute segregation,
ledge growth, and precipitate morphology and spacing are analyzed to reveal
effects of systematic changes in ternary alloying additions and aging
treatments. In-situ high resolution electron microscopy is employed to show
atomic growth mechanisms based on dislocation ledges and to quantify interphase
boundary motion.
