The inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) is being used to
support elemental analysis for undergraduate chemistry, geology, technology, and
biology courses at James Madison University (JMU). The instrumentation gives
students from these disciplines experience with a commonly used, state-of-the-
art technique for trace metals analysis. The ICP-MS will be the keystone
instrument in laboratories for new course work in environmental chemistry and
technology and will significantly improve laboratory work in analytical
chemistry, geochemistry, and ecology classes. It will also be used extensively
for field and student research projects, especially summer research programs
involving students from JMU and other institutions. *
