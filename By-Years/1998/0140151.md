The research topic of this award is superstring theory, which is the most
promising candidate for a complete unification of the four fundamental forces of
Nature (electro-magnetic, weak, strong and gravitational) into a framework
consistent with all known physical principles, including quantum mechanics and
general relativity. Strings are one-dimensional extended objects which, under
time-evolution, sweep out fluctuating two-dimensional surfaces. The quantitative
understanding of the dynamics of superstring theory, for weak coupling, requires
precise mathematical methods for defining and calculating the quantum mechanics
of these fluctuating surfaces. The research carried out under this award
demonstrates how to overcome certain longstanding difficulties with both the
definition and calculation of these effects and leads to concrete and beautiful
quantitative formulas.

The above results have exciting applications, including the first reliable
calculation, at two-loop order, of a number of physically important quantities.
The first is the scattering amplitude of massless superstrings, one of the key
dynamical quantities of superstring theory. The second is the so-called
cosmological constant, which provides a possible modification of the equations
of general relativity, and whose effects interfere with the presence in the
Universe of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. String theory, being a theory of
quantum gravity, is expected to make the calculation of the cosmological
constant possible. D'Hoker's results show that the cosmological constant in flat
space-time must vanish, and provides a general expression in (more realistic)
non-supersymmetric models.
