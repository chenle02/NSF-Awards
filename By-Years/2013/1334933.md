The objective of this award is to develop theories and methods for the control
and optimization of bio-manufacturing systems. The research will address issues
related to upstream bio-manufacturing processes (where cell cultures secrete
proteins through fermentation) and downstream bio-manufacturing processes
(consisting of purification steps such as chromatography and filtration). At
each step, the yield, throughput, and quality of individual production runs are
subject to significant variability due to time varying nature of the cell lines,
complex nature of the underlying biological reactions, and stochastic failures
due to process uncertainty. The goal of this research is to integrate the
theories of the underlying chemical and biological processes with the principles
from uncertainty theory and optimization, and develop a knowledge base that will
enable improvements yield, quality and throughput of bio-manufacturing
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide
decision support to help bio-manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce timelines,
and costs. For the upstream bioreactor operations, new stochastic optimization
models will be developed to capture the trade-offs related to operating policies
and their impact on quality, yield, and total costs. For the downstream
operations, new performance evaluation models will be developed to analyze
trade-offs related to downstream parameters, such as, the quality of the batch,
the resin binding capability, purification cycle times, and efficiency.
Leveraging the functional relationships obtained from specialized models for
upstream and downstream operations, the research will develop mathematical
models for optimizing system design and production schedules. All models will be
validated with industry partners and insights obtained from this research will
be incorporated into practice. The methodologies developed in this research have
potential applications in other emerging areas of advanced manufacturing such as
bio-fuels and nano-manufacturing. The research will also train several students
and influence university curricula in related areas.
