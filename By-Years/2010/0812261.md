Despite recent successes in machine learning approaches to coreference
resolution, the performance of recently developed coreference systems is
plateauing. Progress on the coreference task is currently limited in part by the
over-reliance on morpho-syntactic knowledge sources, which has led to the
induction of overly simplistic coreference heuristics. To bring learning-based
coreference resolvers to the next level of performance, this work adopts a
knowledge-rich approach, investigating a variety of semantic and discourse
knowledge sources for coreference resolution. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, it
develops corpus-based methods for inducing semantic features, leveraging
publicly available lexical databases and advanced machine-learning and inference
techniques. In addition, it broadens the kind of discourse knowledge exploited
by existing learning-based coreference systems, generating features for
capturing not only the salience of a noun phrase but also the coherence of a
text, via the use of discourse segmenters and parsers that are grounded in
Centering Theory, Rhetorical Structure Theory, and Grosz and Sidner's discourse
theory. The main results of this work will be to demonstrate the benefits of a
knowledge-rich approach to learning-based coreference resolution, and to re-
introduce the linguistically motivated discourse theories developed in the late
1970s and early 1980s into statistical coreference resolution models. The data
sets produced in this research will be made available to the research community,
and the experimental results will be disseminated via publications.&lt;br/&gt;
