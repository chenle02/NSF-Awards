This is a request for partial funding for a workshop on "Ultrasound Transducers:
The Next Generation". The workshop is to take place on the Duke campus on Sept.
10- 11, 1990. The workshop is to include leading researchers both from the U.S.
and foreign countries, and will examine those areas where transducers still
hamper full utilization of ultrasound technology in biomedical applications. The
workshop is co-sponsored by the Duke ERC.
