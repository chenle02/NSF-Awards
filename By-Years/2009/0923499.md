0923499&lt;br/&gt;Edgar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested to support the
acquisition of a state-of-the-art field emission environmental scanning electron
microscope (FESEM) to improve the quality and expand the scope of the research,
training and education activities at Kansas State University (KSU). This
instrument offers higher resolution imaging, electron-beam-lithography (EBL),
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and a broader range of operating conditions
that will significantly enhance the research capabilities at the University. The
new FESEM will be housed in the central KSU Microscopy Laboratory which serves
as the core, multi-user microscopy facility for five Colleges, 20 Departments,
and a private company. This equipment is a critical part of a broader effort of
the University to improve its microscopy and imaging capabilities to provide a
well-equipped, integrated research and education environment. The FESEM-
instrument requested is the FEI NovaNanoSEM 230 with EDS &amp; EBL.
