The objective of this workshop is to evaluate the state of the art of
geophysical techniques for use in civil engineering applications, and to
identify areas that need additional development. Geophysical methods provide a
theoretically sound means of measuring the mechanical properties of soil and
other civil engineering materials. An attractive feature of these methods is
that they are nondestructive, and often non invasive. There have been several
important developments in geophysical methods in the past decade. Many recent
developments have been made possible by the increased power and availability of
computers. Three areas of focus are: (1) Existing analytical and numerical
methods for wave propagation in near-surface soils and other engineering
materials; (2) new applications of geophysical methods in civil engineering; and
(3) to summarize the availability, distribution and documentation of software,
so that engineers can benefit from recent software developments.
