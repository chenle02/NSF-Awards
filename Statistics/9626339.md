DMS 9626339 Marshall This research involves the study of life distributions from
the point of view of model selection. One phase involves methods for generating
parameters in families. Given a random variable with distribution and survival
functions, there are a number of ways to impose parameters, in some instances by
taking a function of the random variable, and in some cases by taking a function
of the distribution or survival function. The following are some examples: (1)
Location and scale parameters; (2) Frailty and resilience parameters; (3) Power
parameter; (4) Convolution parameter (for special families such as the gamma
family); (5) Geometric-extreme stable parameter. The investigators study order
relations for these parametric families. For example, for which parametric
families are the hazard functions ordered; for which families is there a
stochastic or convex ordering. The introduction of parameters and their
characteristics and their orderings is fundamental to an insight concerning how
to extend the results to multivariate distributions. Although the normal
distribution plays a central role in many applications and in statistical
theory, it does not serve as a model for lifetime data arising in industrial
applications such as manufacturing data, materials data, reliability data, nor
does it serve as a model for survival analysis or risk analysis in the health or
environmental sciences. This research focuses on how to generate non-normal
parametric families that will provide an insight into behavior patterns and
prediction for such data. In particular, the methods being developed serve to
upgrade risk and reliability analyses in engineering applications. A second
stage in this research is the development of multivariate versions that take
account of dependencies among measurements.
