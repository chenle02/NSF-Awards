two main parts. The first part concerns producing new smooth and symplectic
closed four-manifolds so as to address a variety of problems that range from
constructing non-diffeomorphic copies of standard four-manifolds with small
Euler characteristics to the symplectic geography problem for four-manifolds
with nontrivial fundamental groups, or from building new exotic families of
four-manifolds that are distinguished by their stable cohomotopy Seiberg-Witten
invariants to obtaining smoothly knotted but topologically unknotted embeddings
of surfaces. The second part of the project deals with generalizations of
Lefschetz fibrations and symplectic structures on smooth four-manifolds. In this
research, singularity theory and handlebody techniques are combined to obtain
new results on generalized fibrations on smooth four-manifolds, and to establish
a useful description of smooth four-manifolds in terms of broken Lefschetz
fibrations and moves between them, analogous to handlebodies and Kirby moves.
Determining which broken Lefschetz fibrations can or cannot support a smooth
four-manifold with nontrivial Seiberg-Witten invariant, and investigating the
diffeomorphism types of certain four-manifolds using broken Lefschetz fibrations
associated to them are two other problems contained in this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space and time combined, we live in a four
dimensional world. The goal of this project is to better understand the
intriguing nature of "four-manifolds", which are geometric objects locally
modeled on space-time. There is an immense literature in theoretical physics
related to the 'shape' of four-manifolds, and a great deal of mathematical
research dedicated to this very subject. When considered with certain additional
structures, four-manifolds exhibit numerous curious differences. For one,
"symplectic structures", which appear in various equations in classical
mechanics and string theory constitute a key theme of the proposed research. The
"Seiberg-Witten invariants" that arise from differential equations in quantum
field theory also play a key role. Using geometric and topological methods,
along with new structures, the PI studies similarities and differences of four-
manifolds.
