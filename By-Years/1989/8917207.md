This award provides support for pre-drilling activities connected with a
project whose ultimate objective is to obtain a nearly continuous, ordered
record of the output of an oceanic volcano over a long interval of its main
shield-building phase of activity. Only small fractions of the output and
history of any individual Hawaiian volcano are accessible through surface
exposures and it is unlikely that the interiors of these volcanoes will ever be
exposed except by deep drilling. The primary scientific questions to be
addressed concern the nature of hot spots, in particular, the composition and
origin of the "plumes" they may represent, and how the upwelling material
interacts with the lithosphere on time scales of 105 to 106 years. The specific
activities being supported by this award include: 1) finalizing the site
selection and evaluating permitting issues; 2) finalizing, with detailed
justification, the proposed hole depth; 3) reviewing and modifying, if
necessary, the drilling plan and downhole measurements plan to insure that the
proposed hole can be logged as necessary for the scientific objectives; and 4)
determining the makeup of the complete science team.
