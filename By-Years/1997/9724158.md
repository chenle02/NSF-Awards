This three-year award will support participation of US postdoctoral associates,
new faculty and graduate students in annual workshops in computational science
including the fields of atomic and molecular physics, plasmas, condensed matter,
materials science, quantum chemistry, and chemical engineering. The workshops
will be held at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon, France under the
sponsorship of CECAM (the European Center for Atomic and Molecular
Computations). CECAM is a consortium of nine Western European research
organizations. Its goal is to act as a catalyst for emerging research fields in
computational science through the organization of workshops on major, complex
research themes. The workshops take advantage of CECAM's unique resources and
provides international opportunities for US scientists at an early stage in
their careers. US participation in the 1997-98 CECAM workshops is funded by the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences, and the Western Europe Program, Division of International
Programs.
