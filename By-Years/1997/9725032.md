EEC-9725032 Goldsman, Neil ABSTRACT This award provides funding for a project
entitled GEMSTONE: An Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program Focusing on the
Implications of Technology, administered by the Institute for Systems Research
(an NSF Engineering Research Center) at the University of Maryland. The goal of
the Gemstone program is to give undergraduate students the opportunity to take
part in multi-year, inter-disciplinary research projects in some of the most
important issues affecting society today--issues that are driven by
technological change but with ramifications that go far beyond technology. These
research projects in such diverse areas as the environment, medicine,
telecommunications, and manufacturing will be part of an academic structure that
educates the participants about the issues linking technology to business, law,
politics, and social structures, while simultaneously giving the students a
chance to apply their new insight to important contemporary problems,
challenges, and opportunities.
