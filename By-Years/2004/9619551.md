9619551 Bertka The goal is to create a ten week summer program whose main
objective is to provide undergraduate students with a participatory introduction
to a research environment. By inviting students to join staff in their research
efforts over a concentrated time period, students will have a learning
experience that is normally unavailable at their colleges during the regular
academic year. A summer program also offers the advantage of exposing the
greatest number of students over the grant period to the challenges and rewards
of a career in scientific research. With a successful summer program, the
Geophysical Laboratory can contribute to science education through the realm of
science it knows best, fundamental research, and expand its present impact on
the education of graduate students and postdocs to undergraduates as well.
