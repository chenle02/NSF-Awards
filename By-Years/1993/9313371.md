9313371 Blakely Basic studies of materials growth and processing-- surface
diffusion, step interactions, epitaxy--will be conducted to understand and
control surface structural defects and the kinetics of surface morphological and
compositional changes in the crystal growth of silicon, germanium, and strained
layer alloy thin films; STM in combination with electron(LEED) and X- Ray
diffraction will be used to provide full characterization of surface morphology
as well as to study the dynamics of step rearrangement during growth. Patterned
substrates are developed and used as a way to control the distribution of steps
which allows an entire distribution of step densities to be studied
simultaneously instead of having to use multiple samples. Samples with a
distribution of step densities also have positive practical implications with
respect to preventing and/or controlling three-dimensional nucleation and
growth. %%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental
understanding of surface diffusion, and elementary features of epitaxial growth
and related processing of germanium and silicon. An important feature of the
program is the education and training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials science and engineering. This
research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications. ***
