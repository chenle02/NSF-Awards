The Coleoptera, or beetles, constitute the most diverse order of living
organisms. They make up some 40% of all animal species, and occupy virtually
every trophic position. They are important as pests, biological control agents,
pollinators, and vectors of disease. They contribute to soil building and the
recycling of plant and animal materials. Yet, it is impossible to find general
works that allow the identification of the species of beetles occurring in any
area of the New World tropics. Under this project, material will be collected
and processed towards the eventual goal of a guide to the estimated 1,200
species of beetles in the Virgin Islands. In addition to new collections, a
database will be built of all known material, and publications describing new
species will be published.
