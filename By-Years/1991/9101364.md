This project is concerned with the optical spectroscopy of rare earth ions in
solids which exhibit upconversion, namely the process of converting low energy
photons into higher energy photons. These materials are of current interest
because of recent developments in upconversion-pumped lasers. The focus of the
work will be on the evaluation of potential new laser systems. The concentration
dependence of energy transfer upconversion in yttrium aluminum trioxide doped
with erbium ions will be studied by measuring the infrared to visible conversion
efficiency. In addition similar measurements will be performed on yttrium oxide
doped with erbium ions. The latter material has not yet been demonstrated as an
upconversion laser material. A third material that will be studied is barium-
yttrium fluoride doped with erbium ions.
