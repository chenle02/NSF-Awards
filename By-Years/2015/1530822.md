The Measurement Techniques for Solar and Space Physics Conference will be held
in Boulder,Colorado, on April 20 - 24, 2015. The workshop addresses and
describes the measurement of techniques and technology development needed to
advance high priority science and provide a survey of techniques for the situ
measurement and remote sensing of space plasmas. This award supports the UCAR
Visiting Scientist Programs (VSP) to provide planning and logistical support,
including registration, creation and publication of agendas and schedules, and
on-site support while the workshop is in session. The workshop will be organized
with four areas of measurement techniques: particles, fields, photons, and
ground-based. Additionally, a broad survey of the current technologies will be
provided to serve as reference material and as a basis from which advanced and
innovative ideas can be discussed. Instrumentation and techniques to observe the
solar environment from its interior to its outer atmosphere, the heliosphere out
to the interstellar regions, geospace and planetary magnetospheres and
atmospheres are included.
