This project aims to create a systematic framework with novel approaches and
techniques to defend against current and next generation botnets. A botnet is a
network of compromised computers (bots) that are under the control of an
attacker (botmaster) through some command &amp; control (C&amp;C) channel. In
recent years, botnets have distinguished themselves from previous generation
malware as the primary platform and root-cause for most Internet attacks and
illegal activities. With the magnitude and the potency of attacks afforded by
their combined bandwidth and processing power, botnets are now considered as the
greatest single threat to Internet security. As botnets involve both host-level
and network-level activities, a systematic defensive framework should consider
both host- and network-level information. We can achieve better defense by
utilizing host-network coordination, community-based intelligence, and a cross-
layer view, instead of relying on a single (or a set of separate) host- or
network-level information source(s). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
establishes a host-network coordination- and correlation-based framework for
systematic botnet defense in depth. It addresses three major questions covering
detection, prevention, and attribution of botnets: How to detect the existence
of botnets in an efficient, accurate, robust, fast, and automatic way? How to
prevent botnets from penetrating into a protected network? Where does the
command and control (C&amp;C) actually originate from? The methodology and
techniques proposed in the project can have a profound impact on future malware
defense in terms of improving its effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.
