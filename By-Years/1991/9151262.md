Modern scientific investigation is highly instrumented, with computers playing a
major role in most of experimental science and much of the theoretical, as well.
The introductory courses in physics, besides teaching basic physics and problem
solving, should give the student an introduction to the way that scientists work
and the modern instrumentation that is used. Because of budget constraints,
however, it is difficult for a physics department to move out of the laboratory
mode developed in the late l960s and early 70s into an instrumented laboratory
environment, but it is nonetheless important to do so. This project is helping
the Indiana State University Physics Department make that leap by instrumenting
the introductory laboratories with computers interfaced to a variety of
equipment to help students in data taking and analysis. The project is providing
computers and interfaces to instrument 12 lab stations to be used in both the
calculus-based, and non- calculus physics courses. Along with well-designed
laboratory exercises, the proposed instrumentation is making possible a
significantly enhanced experience for students in the two introductory physics
courses.NSF funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
