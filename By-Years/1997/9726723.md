This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
the aggregation, solubilization behavior, and environmental applications of
novel surfactants. Surfactants form a class of chemicals finding the widest use
in every day life. The collaboration involves the research groups of Ramanathan
Nagarajan of Pennsylvania State University and Armand Lattes of Paul Sabatier
University in Toulouse, France. The novel surfactants for this project will be
developed by the French and studied as media for chemical reactions in preparing
new materials, and in pharmaceutical applications. The US investigators will
conduct theoretical and experimental studies on the aggregation of these
surfactants into micelles and vesicles and their ability to solubilize solutes
of varying polarity. The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise
in theoretical modeling and chemical engineering applications of surfactants.
This is complemented by French expertise in synthesis and chemical reactivity
studies of surfactants.
