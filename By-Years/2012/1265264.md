Researchers intend to further develop a static program analysis tool chain. The
analysis chain is comprised of the following tools:&lt;br/&gt;- A static
analyzer for MATLAB models&lt;br/&gt;- A static analyzer of Android
programs&lt;br/&gt;- A static analyzer for detecting program
termination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort may lead to wider
availability of a high performance static analysis toolkit for embedded software
that outperforms existing tools in (1) being able to uncover software flaws
resulting from deep logical errors, (2) having lesser percentage of false
positives, (3) providing on-demand property-specific checkers, (4) bridging the
gaps between the various abstraction levels in the software design cycle - from
requirements (application-dependent checking) all the way down to code
(application independent checking), and (5) providing correctness proofs for
successfully checked code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed
effort can lead to wider acceptance of static program analysis tools in the
mainstream embedded systems programming community. It could lead to better
understanding of usability issues concerning static program analysis tools among
less mathematically sophisticated users. The wider deployment of high-
performance static program analysis tools as a result of the proposed effort can
lead to development of safer and more secure embedded systems. It may lead to
close interaction between academia and industry.
