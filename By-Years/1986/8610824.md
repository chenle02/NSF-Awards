Amorphous metal alloys produced by rapid solidification are finding increasing
applications in electrical and electronic applications. The limitation of the
current techniques is the inability to produce bulk materials. This research
involves a novel method--namely, electro-discharge compaction of rapidly
solidified powders and the synthesis of high-temperature micro-composites. The
method involves the use of an extremely short duration pulse (5-10 micro
sceonds), high voltage (30 KV), and high current density (1kA/mm2) energy to the
powder aggregate to rupture the oxide film on the particles for enhanced bonding
and retain the unique amorphous structure of the rapidly solidified powder which
otherwise would be degraded by long exposure to high temperatures, as in HIPing
or vacuum hot pressing.
