Major successes of applied mathematics are in population dynamics and in
neuroscience. Population dynamics includes demographics, genetics, epidemics,
and ecology. It is studied to manage growth, improve health and quality of life,
and understand transmission of disease and information. Neuroscience studies our
brain to manage disease, to understand storage and recall of memory, to engineer
brain-machine interfaces, and to develop new paradigms for electronic
computation. Population biologists and neuroscientists seem rarely talk to each
other.

Applied mathematicians have created new fields for studies in these separate
areas, including random processes; statistics and data mining; and, modeling,
analysis, computer simulation and visualization. Mathematics classifies
structures, so it is not surprising that a model derived in one area for one
problem is discovered in an entirely different area for another. For example,
epidemics have thresholds of propagation that are comparable to those in neuron
populations, and both are like explosion limits in combustion. Mathematical
modeling provides a common ground between these areas. The conference, Dynamical
Systems in Biology, brings together workers in mathematical population biology
and neuroscience with other mathematicians, scientists and engineers, recent
Ph.D.s and students to further develop this common language. The conference will
focus participants' diverse backgrounds and interests on posing and addressing
important problems of common interest.
