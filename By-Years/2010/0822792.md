This is a transfer of funds to the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program for
accommodations and launch services for an auxiliary payload carrying a NSF-
sponsored spacecraft on the STP-S26/Minotaur-IV launch scheduled for December
2009. The NSF sponsored nano-satellite will be a "triple (3U) cubesat" and will
utilize the Poly-Picosat Orbital Deployer (P-POD) system. The purpose of the NSF
nano-satellite mission will be space weather research. The selection of the
mission will be done following a solicitation for proposals and scientific and
technical review of the proposals. This will be the first project under a new
NSF initiative titled: "CubeSat-based Science Missions for Space Weather and
Atmospheric Research."
