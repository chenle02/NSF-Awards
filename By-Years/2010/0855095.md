Identical designs of electronic circuits in deep-submicron technology show small
parameter variations among different instances implemented on a die or in
between dies. The resulting circuit variations have a strong impact on the
quality of the design. This project plans to create an infrastructure for
characterizing the circuit variability on a large population of Field
Programmable Gate Array devices. The proposed infrastructure includes a small
population of FPGA kits, as well as a web-based data-collection setup to support
variability-experiments on hundreds of FPGAs at the same time, in collaboration
with undergraduate students. The project will drive research into innovative
applications of circuit variability, in particular into physically unclonable
functions (PUF). In addition, a unique education opportunity is created to teach
undergraduate students about the impact of variability on their design by making
them participate in the experimental data collection. The proposed
infrastructure will not only significantly enhance the PI's research in
trustworthy circuit design, but also provide valuable variability data for the
broader research community.
