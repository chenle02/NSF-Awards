Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will develop a limit
state design methodology for reinforced masonry under seismic loading. The
methodology will first define the principles which form the assumptions upon
which the methodology is based. Second, it will describe the procedures that are
to be used for the implementation of the principles. Development of the limit
state design methodology will provide reinforced masonry construction with a
modern and economic tool comparable to those available for reinforced concrete
and cold-formed steel.
