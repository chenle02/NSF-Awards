9420140 Richardson Initiated in 1954, the annual Systematics Symposium sponsored
by the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, and held in October of each year,
has highlighted significant research, training, and policy issues in biological
systematics throughout its impressive duration. Topics of interest both to
botanists and zoologists have been emphasized, and efforts made as well to
involve scientists in under-represented groups. The 1995 symposium addresses the
role of systematists in the National Biological Service, and features speakers
from academe, government, and private organizations. Future symposia cover
biogeographic, paleontological, molecular phylogenetic, and technological
aspects of modern research in biological systematics. The symposium proceedings
are typically published in the Annals of the MBG, and in timely manner, and thus
the impact of the presentations and discussions extends throughout the
profession and beyond. Complementing the symposium presentations and
discussions, participants, usually numbering 400 or so, make use of the rich
herbarium and library resources of the Missouri Botanical Garden, and the mix of
graduate students, young investigators, and senior researchers ensures a
productive exchange of viewpoints. ??
