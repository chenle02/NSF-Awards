9602223 Wessler This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary
training research training program focused on the mechanisms of plant evolution.
The program, a joint effort of 9 faculty from three departments, aims to educate
and train students in plant systematics, population biology and molecular
genetics. Following three lab rotations and appropriate coursework, graduate
students undertake interdisciplinary thesis projects that are meant to span at
least two of the three focal areas. Advanced students are required to undertake
an internship with a participating faculty member whose expertise is
complementary to that of their thesis advisor. This internship occurs during the
period when thesis research is underway, and is meant to include studies
integral to the thesis., thereby facilitating interdisciplinary projects. In
addition, the program provides training of undergraduate students through a
summer intern program targeted at students at the University of Georgia and
nearby colleges.
