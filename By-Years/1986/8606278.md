The objective of this workship is to identify promising areas of research and to
review recent results in the areas of modeling and control of distributed
parameter systems. In particular, the following subjects will be addressed by
experts in the field: (1) What recent problems and issues have emerged in
control of distributed parameter systems? (2) What progress has been made
recently? (3) How suitabel and effective is the interplay between applied
mathematics and engineering in the discipline of control of distributed
parameter systems? (4) What "adjunct" disciplines have ideas and methods to
offer? (5) What innovative ideas have not been tried?
