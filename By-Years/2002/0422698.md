San Jacinto College (an Hispanic-serving institution), NASA-Johnson Space
Center, and their partners propose a three-year comprehensive project targeting
middle grades science, mathematics and technology teachers and students. The
National Middle School Aerospace Scholars Program (NaMAS) will increase
opportunities for teachers and students in eight states to learn about and
experience Information Technology as utilized in the aerospace industry. Many
students and teachers have limited opportunities to learn about and experience
IT. Two dramatic events of 2004 -- the Mars rover mission and the President's
space agenda speech -- captured the imagination of America's youth, making this
an ideal time to use space exploration as a hook for technology education. NaMAS
provides a way to leverage this excitement. One hundred and fifty teachers will
each receive 120 hours of professional development and mentoring in IT concepts,
skills, applications and pedagogical strategies, all tied to state/national
standards. More than 18,000 students will be impacted and approximately 1,500
middle grade students will receive additional instruction through a summer
robotics experience. Working in pairs, teachers will participate in four
workshops (three at the Johnson Space Center and one online) and facilitate two
distance learning events at their schools; they will then integrate their
experiences with their classroom instruction. This broadly disseminated,
extensively evaluated project will increase teacher and student understanding of
STEM activities and careers. The project will also enhance diversity by
specifically targeting schools with high numbers of underrepresented students.
The ultimate benefit to society is a more knowledgable and capable workforce
that will help ensure a healthy economy and an enhanced quality of life.
