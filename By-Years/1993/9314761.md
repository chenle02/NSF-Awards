9314761 Vasconcelos This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Wolmer
Vasconcelos of Rutgers University in collaboration with Professor Rafael
Villarreal of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico City. The researchers
intend to work on theoretical aspects of commutative algebra and applied links
to combinatorics and computational algebra. More specifically, the project will
focus on studying graded rings associated to ideals of combinatorial interest,
Gorenstein algebras, the Cohen-Macaulayness of certain toric varieties and the
role they may play in the theory of Grobner bases. Both investigators are
interested in central questions in commutative algebra, particularly the aim of
finding the solution of, and detecting Cohen-Macaulay structure in, systems of
polynomial equations in a large number of indeterminates. The investigators
intend to carry out this research through e-mail and telephone contact, by
attendance to meetings and through a program of regular visits that will involve
graduate students and their collaborators in other countries. ***
