The Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) is a unique study of the distant
universe with intensive focus on the peak era of galaxy growth that occurred
10-12 billion years ago, over the cosmological redshift range from 2 to 3. KBSS
measures the masess, star formation rates, stellar populations, chemistry, and
gas flows in forming galaxies and the intergalactic gas surrounding them. The
interface between the two, the circumgalactic medium (CGM), is the region where
feedback processes will produce measureable response due to injected energy,
momentum, gas, and metals. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have
previously obtained extensive optical spectroscopic data on approximately 2300
galaxies in the survey fields, each of which is centered on a hyperluminous
quasar. They now propose to observe these same fields with the new, NSF-funded,
Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE), which their team
designed and built for the Keck I telescope. With the new data, the team plans
to obtain vastly improved measurements of redshift and gas kinematics for a
wider range of galaxy types than previously probed, measurements of star
formation rates and dust attenuation (extinction), and elemental abundances and
physical conditions in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. The PI, as
Project Scientist for MOSFIRE, and graduate students supported by this project
will work to assist the broader astronomical community in using the instrument.
The graduate students will also lead an astronomy outreach program, working with
the Pasadena Unified School District to bring their enthusiasm and knowledge
into 5th-8th grade classrooms.
