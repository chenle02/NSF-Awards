This project further develops, evaluates, and disseminates a pilot project for a
Java-based, interactive, self-paced learning module entitled "Product Design for
Injection Molding." This module was identified from a group of seven pilot
modules for freshman engineering design as the project with the greatest
likelihood of success as an on-line, multimedia learning tool and the most
potential impact beyond the Columbia courses in which it will be used. The
module strategically uses multimedia technology to enable users with little or
no engineering background to learn and begin to apply basic mechanical design
principles to reverse engineering problems and their own designs, both for
injection molded parts and parts using related design principles. Educational
institutions and companies can use the module to train students and new
employees. The module also provides useful computational design tools that can
be used on a day to day basis by practicing engineers. This is a collaborative
effort among Columbia University, industrial partners (Texas Instruments, Inc.
and Symbol Technologies, Inc.), and several NYC high schools. The criticism, use
and evaluation of the module by this diverse group helps to direct and focus the
development of the module. The different computer platforms and skill levels of
the team members will also ensure that the module is universally portable and
useable. Formative and summative evaluations of the module will be conducted by
experts from Columbia's Teachers College with an emphasis on the effectiveness
of the module in attracting, motivating, and retaining students of all
backgrounds in engineering. A substantial fraction of the high school students
have backgrounds that have been traditionally disenfranchised from professional
engineering. Dissemination to industry, academia, and high schools will leverage
the resources of the Society of Plastics Engineers and a coalition of 80 NYC K-l
2 schools fostering technology enabled education.
