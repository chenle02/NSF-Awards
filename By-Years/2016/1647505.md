WORKSHOP: Qualitative Research Ethics in the Big-Data Era

This workshop will be a one-day workshop on the ethics of qualitative research
in the era of big data to identify what research has been done on this topic,
and where additional research is needed. The workshop will yield a set of
guidelines from existing research to guide university institutional review
boards, research funding organizations, and data aggregating organizations. The
workshop will bring together invited participants from academic institutions,
international aid and research organizations and data aggregating organizations.
The workshop will facilitate an international discussion about necessary
guidelines and organizations dedicated to promoting responsible conduct of
science for qualitative research and big data.

The workshop will contribute to improved understanding of issues arising from
ethical management of big qualitative datasets in academia and in other national
and international institutions that finance and conduct qualitative research.
The workshop will advance a set of recommendations and guidelines for
accountable management of qualitative data, providing a strategic resource for
qualitative research managers worldwide. It will also buttress continued
production of robust evidence and in-depth knowledge that contextual qualitative
research strategies are designed to provide. The workshop will generate at least
three outputs: (1) a white paper on the challenging issues and guidelines, (2) a
special issue journal and (3) teaching resources for qualitative researchers.
