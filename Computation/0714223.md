Geometric integration is concerned with the construction of numerical methods
that preserve the geometric structure of a continuous dynamical system. Many
problems arising in science and engineering, such as solar system dynamics and
molecular dynamics, are highly nonlinear, sensitive to small perturbations, and
have underlying geometric structure that affects the qualitative behavior of
solutions. The chaotic properties of these dynamical systems render
prohibitively expensive the accurate computation of particular trajectories for
long-time integration. As such, it is instead desirable to study numerical
methods that preserve the geometry of a problem as they yield more qualitatively
accurate simulations. The goal of this project is to generalize variational
integrators based on a discrete Hamilton's principle to larger-scale problems
arising from astrodynamics, molecular dynamics, and computational mechanics.
This will involve incorporating methods from large-scale scientific computation,
such as adaptivity, spectral methods, multi-resolution hierarchical techniques,
and domain decomposition, while retaining the geometric preservation properties
of variational integrators for Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs.

Computer simulations of complex physical systems have become an increasingly
important complement to traditional experimental techniques as a tool for
validating and guiding theoretical developments in science, as well as practical
advances in technology and engineering. This research will improve our ability
to accurately and efficiently compute the long-time behavior of complex systems,
which is a fundamental aspect of the rational design of pharmaceuticals and
high-performance composite materials. In addition, it has the potential to
accelerate the pace of technological development by allowing the rapid
prototyping of new and innovative industrial designs directly on the computer.
