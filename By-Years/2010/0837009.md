Engineering Mechanical -(56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing engineering students
with an understanding of how to prevent and control equipment failures is
critical to the future success of many businesses. This project responds to this
need through the creation of a laboratory-based undergraduate course in
structural engineering failure mechanisms, tailored with an emphasis on the
aerospace industry. Learning modules covered in the course and laboratory
include: fatigue and fracture, thermo-mechanical failure, fastener failure,
wear, corrosion, and impact, composite materials failure, statistical analysis
of failures, non-destructive evaluation, and structural health monitoring. Both
junior and senior level students in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering benefit
from the new material covered and the interactive format of this laboratory
experience.
