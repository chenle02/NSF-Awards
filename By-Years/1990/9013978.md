With the possible exception of the Sun, pulsating white dwarfs show the greatest
potential for probing the interior structures of stars by experimental means. A
rich variety of vibrating waves, visible at the surface by their change in the
star's luminosity, are excited in these stars that interfere with one another
throughout the star's interior. The pattern of interferences can be used to
infer the amount of material each wave travels through, and hence the
distribution of material through the star can ultimately be determined. These
principles, similar to those used for decades by seismologists on the Earth, are
now being applied to distant stars for the first time. The white dwarf stars are
the best candidates not only because they exhibit so many vibrations but because
their periods are short enough that many wave cycles can be followed by
observing the stars' light variations. The Principal Investigator has spent most
of his research career designing and building photometric instrumentation to
make accurate light measurements. In a previous NSF award, the PI and his
collaborators found that a prototype three-channel photometer they had
constructed (one channel for the program star, one for a constant "standard",
and one for a starless "sky") increases the amount of time during a night that
an astronomer can spent actually collecting data. The new award will permit the
PI to construct two portable duplicates of this prototype. These instruments
will be transported by his colleagues to observing sites around the world. As
part of an "observing campaign", target stars will then be observed in tandem by
each of these observers as the Earth rotates. Following this campaign the data
will be combined and a continuous several day-long string produced that is
necessary for the analysis of interior properties of white dwarf stars.
