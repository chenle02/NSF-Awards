This award funds a one-year Bridges for Engineering Education planning grant at
the University of Arizona. Pre-service K-12 teachers will construct ant
implement performance assessments on engineering students enrolled in freshman
engineering design classes. The primary purpose of this planning grant will be
to analyze what engineering students are learning in order to improve
pedagogical techniques, and to expose pre-service teachers to a broad
engineering content while actively learning performance assessment. It is
anticipated that this project will serve as a pilot study to develop an approach
to institutionalize collaborations between the College of Education and the
College of Engineering and Mines at the University of Arizona that will benefit
education students and engineering pedagogy.
