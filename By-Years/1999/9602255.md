This award renews support for a multidisciplinary training research training
program focused on the biology of plant roots, extending from the physiology of
roots to the ecology of the rhizosphere that surrounds them in the soil. The
program represents a joint effort of 15 faculty drawn from 8 departments. Groups
of trainees at the undergraduate and graduate level will work with faculty teams
as they design and implement research and training initiatives. Trainees will
participate in formal courses, retreats, workshops, and a seminar series. At the
same time as they acquire the skills and understanding required to pursue
original research, trainees are expected to develop professional skills in
teamwork, resource allocation and management, teaching, mentoring, and outreach
as a direct result of the training.
