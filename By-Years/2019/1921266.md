The Enabling Discovery through Genomic Tools (EDGE) program was established in
2016 to provide tools, approaches and associated infrastructure that are
critically needed to directly test gene function in diverse non-canonical model
organisms. Funds are provided to support the participation of the scientific
leaders and key personnel of currently funded EDGE projects in a one-day EDGE
awardee meeting to be held on April 29, 2019 in Alexandria, VA. This inaugural
meeting offers opportunities for EDGE project personnel to network and discuss
the progress, pitfalls and long-term scientific and societal implications of
these important resource development projects. In addition, participants will
learn about and discuss novel strategies and best practices related to rapid and
efficient dissemination of resources and knowledge gained from their respective
projects. As all these projects have the common theme of potentially catalyzing
larger communities of investigators with new techniques, this meeting will also
provide an opportunity for participants to discuss how best to engage with and
communicate project outcomes between research communities and to a broader
public audience. It is the hope that this meeting will initiate a long-term
dialog about the consequences of the use of novel techniques in non-canonical
model systems, both for greater scientific insight as well as potential broader
impacts for society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
