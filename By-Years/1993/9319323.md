ABSTRACT -- CTS-9319323 Pitz The PI has proposed a very ambitious experimental
program to use non-intrusive laser diagnostic techniques to investigate the
effects of stretch and flame curvature on the structure and extinction of 2D
laminar partially premixed flames. This will be carried out in collaboration
with Prof. Mitch Smooke of Yale University who will be concerned with the
numerical modeling of these flames; this latter effort will be supported by the
Gas Research Institute. Three flame configurations will be investigated: (1) an
axisymmetric opposed flow flame in the absence of flame curvature, (2) a
cylindrical flame undergoing pure curvature, and (3) a co-flowing axisymmetric
jet undergoing both stretch and curvature. Effects of gas reformation and
radiation on the structure and emissions will be studied by adding H2 and CO to
the methane fuel or infrared radiating gases such as CO2 to the fuel or air. The
objective of this experimental investigation is to produce a flamelet library of
stretched cylindrical and stretched co-flowing flames for input to more complex
transitional and turbulent flamelet models found in practical combustors.
