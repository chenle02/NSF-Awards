This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the State
University of New York College at Cortland, in collaboration with the Hormel
Institute at the University of Minnesota and Ithaca College, will support 10
students for 12 weeks of virtual research training and professional development
during the summer of 2021. In this fully online program, students take part in
guided independent research as part of an online community of peers to analyze
and predict the relationship between structure and function in biomolecules. To
foster community and to strengthen communication skills, students will also
participate in weekly informal social events, professional development
activities, and meet for an in-person capstone research symposium at the end of
the summer. The inherent flexibility of this virtual format make this program
broadly accessible to a wide variety of students, including those who would not
otherwise be able to access on-site REU programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this program will learn about molecular
interactions and explore structure-function relationships in an environment that
is supportive and flexible, guided by a team of faculty and peer mentors. The
independent research conducted by the summer research students aims to advance
our understanding of enzyme function, primary and secondary metabolism, and may
help to provide foundations for improvements in biosynthetic pathway
engineering. By pairing relevant and independent research projects with
professional development and community building, this program seeks to provide a
positive, authentic research experience to a diverse group of students early in
their academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
