This project provides support for U.S. undergraduate and graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty to participate in the Transatlantic
Joint Conference of the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European
Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology. The conference is being held
in Krak√≥w, Poland, June 28 - July 2, 2011. The meeting is a forum for
established researchers to discuss and highlight existing gaps in the state of
the art and for junior faculty and students to delineate areas where they can
make successful contributions in the future. The conference also promotes
collaboration and development of both experimental and theoretical studies of
biological systems and to expose undergraduate and graduate student,
postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty to problems in mathematical and
computational biology. This joint transatlantic conference also encourages
scientific exchange and collaboration between mathematical biologists in the
U.S.A. and Europe.

The conference is organized specifically to provide interactions between senior
researchers, junior faculty, and graduate students. The poster session plays a
key role in facilitating such interaction. In addition, the conference has a
mentoring scheme that aims to improve the educational and professional
experience of scientists at the conference by introducing junior and senior
scientists with similar research interests. Travel Conference awardees
participate in the conference mentoring program where they have a unique
opportunity to learn how scientific research and academic professional growth
occurs in Europe.
