This action represents an interagency transfer of funds from the National
Science Foundation (NSF) to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).
These monies, along with monies from the NEH, will provide for completion of the
project, "Development of a Curriculum Data Base for Undergraduate Education," to
be conducted by the Association of American Colleges (AAC). NEH will let a sole-
source contract to AAC to undertake this effort. NEH will also administer the
contract for NSF and itself. The project will provide transcript, demographic,
and academic information, in the form of an accessible data base for NSF
researchers, on about one million of the nation's undergraduates. NSF's funds
are to allow for inclusion of those data which apply to science and engineering
(S/E) majors, as well as those students who are not majoring in S/E but take
courses in science and engineering.
