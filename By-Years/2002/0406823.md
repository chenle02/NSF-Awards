ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Quillen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is providing a detailed interpretative framework within which
sophisticated protoplanetary debris/accretion disk models can be compared with
the expanding database of high quality optical, infrared and submillimeter
ground based observations, as well as with infrared observations from space.
This is enabled by a combination of advanced adaptive mesh numerical tools for
magnetohydrodynamics, analytic theory, and Monte Carlo radiative transfer models
to produce synthetic scattered light images and spectral energy distributions.
There are three separate, but interrelated, lines of inquiry concerning
observational diagnostics for disk-planet interaction: 1) radial structure in
the form of disk gaps cleared and maintained by proto-planets; 2) azimuthal
structure in the form of disk spiral waves/warps excited via embedded planets or
external flybys (binary companion, unbound star or brown-dwarf); and 3) vertical
structure in the form of disk scale heights as a proxy for protostellar disk
turbulence. The disk scale height study will characterize turbulence generated
in disks which governs when and how planetesimals accumulate to form planets.
Further they are providing observational diagnostics for planets which maintain
disk edges, and disk structure truncated by or excited by bound perturbers and
stellar flybys. The work provides model predictions for the evolution and shape
of proto-planetary systems which then can be tested from the observations of
individual objects and the statistics of disks in clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposers? efforts to
create links between analytic theory, numerical simulations, and observations
play directly into their outreach strategy which has both a local and national
focus. Their previous outreach efforts have led to the creation of a Rochester-
based education and intern program for local high school seniors. They are
adding to that here by actively increasing the presence of inner city children
in the sciences by involving them directly in their research program. The work
is also creating striking visual images and movies that can be used to tell the
story of planet formation in ways which can engage both students and non-
scientists. They are developing simulation-based web outreach modules
distributed on a national level by placing the modules on the websites of major
science magazines.
