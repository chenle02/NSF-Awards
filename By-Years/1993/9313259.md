Horizontal gene transfer has been proposed to account for patterns of expression
of mobile genetic elements among non- interbreeding species. Until recently no
multi-celled organism could be targeted as a potential agent of such transfer.
There is now, however, biochemical evidence that implicates the mite
Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon as such a transfer agent for one class of mobile
elements (P elements) among species of Drosophila. Little is known about the
evolution of P elements, and empirical evidence is completely lacking concerning
the frequency of horizontal transfer of any mobile element. The Drosophila-
Proctolaelaps interaction is the first system in which such questions can be
experimentally addressed. %%% The overall objective of this proposal is to
experimentally verify that this interspecific transfer can indeed occur in an
observable manner under laboratory conditions, using the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis. If successful, this initially high-risk
endeavor will open the door to a research program involving controlled
laboratory manipulation of a previously intractable area of valuable research
which has far-reaching implications for understanding novel mechanisms of
inheritance, the phylogeny of Drosophila, the innovation of new species, and the
evolution of host-parasite and predator-prey interactions.
