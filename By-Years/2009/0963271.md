This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This project is for the renovation of networking and electrical infrastructure
in the C-Wing of Iacocca Hall at Lehigh University. It includes the installation
of several hundred gigabit network connections, cabling, switches, and required
backbone interconnections, to establish a high-speed network infrastructure in
the laboratories that make up this wing. This will replace an existing network
that dates from the late 1980s. Typical connections will be upgraded from 10Mbps
to 1Gbps switched network. The research programs that will benefit from the
renovation are Chemical Engineering, Biosciences, and Bioengineering.

The renovation will improve access to remotely stored data, remote high-
performance computation resources, and visualization capabilities. This will
have a positive impact on research in areas that include the following: protein
stability and binding kinetics, interactions between biological molecules and
nanomaterials, the optimal design of functionalized nanoparticles, large-scale
computation of brain dynamic networks, and genomics.

The renovation improves infrastructure for research, including research by
faculty members, graduate students and undergraduates. The renovated
infrastructure will also be used by students participating in Packer Campus
Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs which draw domestic and
international students from outside the university. The network will provide
access to interactive research modules for incorporation into educational
outreach programs at Lehigh University.
