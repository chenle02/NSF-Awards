9311687 Mishler This research involves the derivation of a detailed phylogeny of
the aquatic fern family Marsileaceae using both morphological and molecular
characters. This phylogeny will be used to examine the role of heterochrony as a
means of generating morphological variation in ferns. %%% This family of ferns
is unique in the development of leaf structures, and a detailed phylogeny will
allow one to examine the details of developmental processes associated with leaf
development. At the same time, the developmental information obtained from this
study will serve as a case study for a general evaluation of relationships
between developmental processes in ferns and fern phylogenies. ***
