This project will continue work on the development of catalyst screening methods
that employ enzymes as the analytical sensors. This approach has been labeled In
Situ Enzymatic Screening (ISES). While chromatographic screening methods are
established, these are normally run as serial, time point assays, requiring
aliquot removal and work-up, prior to analysis. The ISES method offers the
possibility to obtain parallel, real time estimates of relative reaction rates
and, in ideal cases, sense and magnitude of enantio-induction, without the need
to install a chromophore or mass tag in the substrate. A key goal of the next
cycle of this project is to enhance the throughput of the ISES screening, such
that larger matrices of potential catalytic combinations may be screened. Also
important will be to further develop the most interesting catalysts uncovered in
the last cycle, including carbohydrate-based chiral salen ligands, and new
combinations of late transition metal halides for formal halocarbocyclization
processes. In addition, further expansion of the scope of chemistry that is
amenable to screening via ISES will be investigated.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor David B. Berkowitz in the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Nebraska. Professor Berkowitz's research efforts include the
development of useful new catalysts for the stereo-controlled opening of small
ring compounds, and for carbon-halogen and carbon-carbon bond formation.
Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in
both the academic and industrial communities, the latter particularly in the
combinatorial catalysis and pharmaceutical process areas.
