9407849 Neckameyer ABSTRACT Synaptic transmission is critically dependent on the
concentrations of neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft. Upon release of the
neurotransmitter at the cleft, neurotransmitter transporters contribute to the
removal of transmitter into the presynaptic terminal. This limits the duration
of the neurotransmitter action, and is thought to play a major role in
maintaining neurotransmitter availability at a variety of synapses. The precise
molecular mechanisms which regulate the activity of the neurotransmitter
transporters are only beginning to be elucidated. Moreover, such work has not
yet addressed the developmental and functional significance of perturbing these
mechanisms in vivo. This application proposes to build upon our recent cloning
of Drosphila neurotransmitter transporter cDNAs to examine the regulation of
these important proteins. The choice of Drosophila enables us to bring to bear
some of the unique advantages of this model system (such as the facility in
generating both transgenic animals as well as mutations specific to genetic
loci) on these important questions. These studies will take advantage of
recombinant DNA methodology to (1) identify the specific neurotransmitter
substrate for each of the transporters isolated thus far, and (2) to initiate a
molecular genetic analysis of the transporter loci. These initial studies will
lay the groundwork for future experiments that will assess the developmental and
functional consequences in vivo of perturbing reuptake regulatory mechanisms by
introducing altered transporter genes into the genome of Drosphila. These
studies will increase our comprehension of the role that neurotransmitter
transporters play in synaptic transmission.
