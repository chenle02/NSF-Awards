To address the growing complexity of societal and global challenges, research is
increasingly conducted by interdisciplinary teams of researchers, research
centers, and institutes. The Science of Team Science is a new interdisciplinary
field that empirically examines the processes by which these collaborations
organize, communicate, and conduct research to achieve scientific breakthroughs
that would otherwise not be attainable. The National Research Council, via its
Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences, will conduct a consensus
study and appoint a committee of experts to assemble, synthesize, and
communicate important findings from the Science of Team Science and related
fields such as social psychology, science policy, organizational/business
management, human resource development, organizational studies, social
cognition, and industrial/organizational psychology. The project will include
two public workshops to gather information on team dynamics, team management,
and institutional structures and policies that affect large and small science
teams. The committee's final report will provide conclusions and recommendations
to strengthen the efficiency and productivity of science teams in order to build
their capacity for major scientific and technological advances. The report will
both contribute to the advancement of research on science teams and inform those
who conduct, fund, and manage interdisciplinary research collaborations in
research universities, federal agencies and industry.
