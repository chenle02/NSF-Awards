Distant quasars observed less than one billion years after the Big Bang are
ideal tracers for studying the birth of the earliest supermassive black holes,
the assembly of the first massive galaxies, and the buildup of the large-scale
structures seen in the early Universe. The PIs will perform a detailed
characterization of 25 such quasars by analyzing a legacy multi-wavelength
dataset collected from the world's largest telescopes, covering a wavelength
range from X-ray to radio. This program will advance our understanding of the
growth of the first supermassive black holes, their interactions with quasar
host galaxies, and the large-scale structures surrounding them. Additionally,
they will collaborate with the Flandrau Science Center & Planetarium at the
University of Arizona to develop a "fusion-camp" summer program that will have
broad impacts on outreach and education.

Theoretical models predict that the earliest billion supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) form in massive galaxies and inhabit massive dark matter halos. The PIs
will analyze a suite of multi-wavelength datasets collected from ALMA, VLA, and
ground-based optical and infrared telescopes for a sample of 25 quasars in the
epoch of reionization. These data, combined with data that is being collected
from JWST, Chandra, and HST, will enable the team to resolve the long-standing
question of whether the earliest SMBHs reside in the most massive dark matter
halos and inhabit emerging large-scale galaxy overdensities. This program will
also allow them to study the assembly of quasar host galaxies, understand the
connection between AGN feedback and early massive galaxy formation, and
constrain cosmic reionization and metal enrichment in the early Universe.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
