This project addresses research in storage management for high performance
computer architectures. There is need for technology for comparing storage
managers relative to a given workload characterization to determine which will
perform best. Research techniques to accomplish this are based on a combination
of analysis, simulation, and prototype implementations. Applications such as
audio and video are imposing new requirements for performance and guaranteed
response times. The introduction of object oriented systems introduces new and
different request patterns. This illustrates the direction of new hardware
technology and new application demands that will provide a focus for the
research.
