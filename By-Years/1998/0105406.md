This research is concerned with the development, analysis &lt;br/&gt;and
empirical evaluation of algorithms for information &lt;br/&gt;retrieval and data
mining, primarily using spectral analysis. &lt;br/&gt;A partial list of the
fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;being addressed are: How should data be
stored,&lt;br/&gt;organized and processed so as to allow the most effective
retrieval of&lt;br/&gt;information? How can ``important'' structure and
``meaningful''&lt;br/&gt;patterns be found within a large data-set? How and when
can this&lt;br/&gt;hidden structure be used to facilitate determination of
missing data&lt;br/&gt;or to ``clean'' data that is imprecise or partially
incorrect?&lt;br/&gt;What are appropriate models for data generation, and how
can&lt;br/&gt;these models be used to improve the design of data mining
algorithms?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are studying applications that
have already &lt;br/&gt;received a great deal of attention and on
which&lt;br/&gt;empirical success has been achieved, including
object&lt;br/&gt;clustering and web site ranking. In addition, they are
designing &lt;br/&gt;and analyzing algorithms, and developing and analyzing
models &lt;br/&gt;for newer data mining problems, including collaborative
filtering, &lt;br/&gt;topic distillation, spam detection and prevention, and
hierarchical&lt;br/&gt;clustering. Matrix perturbation theory is the foundation
for the &lt;br/&gt;development of theoretical results. The researchers are also
studying&lt;br/&gt;new techniques for speeding up the computation of the
SVD.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical research is being complemented
by&lt;br/&gt;experimental evaluation on real data sets.
