Research in this project will include: application of quantum electrodynamics
to many-electron atoms; neutrino physics calculations; weak interaction
problems, including issues in non-conservation of the charge conjugation-parity
product; cosmology questions such as large-scale structures and complex
"inflationary" scenarios; and effective Gaussian potentials in quantum field
theory. Some of these topics (for example, many electron atoms, weak
interactions) relate closely to interpretation of ongoing or planned experiments
in this country or abroad. Others (such as effective Gaussian potentials)
address purely theoretical questions that may in the future lead to experimental
tests. Overall the work is directed toward better understanding of the
constituents of all matter (protons, neutrons, quarks, mesons, electrons, etc.)
and their interactions.
