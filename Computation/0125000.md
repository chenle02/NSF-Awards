Sumners 0125000 The investigator and his colleagues in the Program in
Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB) organize an international conference on
the subject of multiscale phenomena at the interface of the biological and
mathematical sciences. This meeting includes a broadly multidisciplinary set of
participants, students and researchers active at the interface between
mathematics (broadly defined) and biology. This project supports the
participation of approximately 15 domestic students and young scientists,
selected from a national pool of applicants generated by web and journal
advertisements for the meeting. An unusual feature of the meeting is an opening
day of tutorials, which prepare the attendees for the lectures, with
mathematical scientists introducing basic principles to biologists and
biologists giving tutorials for the quantitative scientists. Two sessions focus
on issues of importance to students working at the interface between the
computational sciences and biology. Students are especially welcome to attend
the meeting and present posters on their work. The Program in Mathematics and
Molecular Biology (PMMB) conducts research at the interface between molecular
biology and the mathematical sciences and trains students and postdocs in this
area. An essential part of this effort is a series of conferences on mathematics
and molecular biology. The meetings provide a comfortable but challenging
environment where students and scientists from each discipline can learn about
the other discipline and about multidisciplinary approaches to the solution of
important problems in modern biology. This fosters interdisciplinary training,
catalyzes new interdisciplinary collaborations, and in an important scientific
area helps develop more people with both mathematics and biology expertise. The
project supports students and junior scientists.
