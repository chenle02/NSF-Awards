This award supports the research of Professor E. Izadi to work in algebraic
geometry. She will work on low dimension principally polarized varieties and
their moduli spaces using techniques involving theta divisors. Problems to be
studied include questions on cycles in Abelian varieties in dimension 4 with
rank greater than one. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
