The principal investigator will study combinatorial models of categories of
perverse sheaves on spaces which carry important combinatorial and
representation theoretic information, mainly flag varieties and toric varieties.
The models use data obtained from natural symmetries on these spaces via the
moment map. These methods will be applied to problems in representation theory,
including Lusztig's conjecture on modular representations and Beilinson,
Ginzburg and Soergel's theory of Koszul duality for Lie algebra representations.
The PI and his collaborators will develop computer algebra software to do
computations with these models.

This project involves geometry related to representation theory. Representation
theory studies ways to present a given algebraic object, usually a group of
symmetries, as a collection of linear transformations. It has applications to
many fields, from number theory to mathematical physics. An important thread in
modern representation theory involves extracting algebraic information from the
geometry of an associated space, which is generally also intrinsically beautiful
in its own right.
