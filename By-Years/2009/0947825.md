Modern scientific research is increasingly dependent on simulation and analysis
requiring high performance computers, distributed large-scale data and high-
speed networks. This project, Strategies for Remote Visualization on a
Dynamically Configurable Testbed, will use an integrated, application-oriented
design and development approach to build highly-optimized distributed
applications. These applications will use network services as first class
resources, together with distributed compute, storage, and visualization
resources. In particular, the project will investigate new strategies for
distributed visualization of large data, prototyping an advanced distributed
volume rendering system combining user-controlled network services,high-speed
data streaming, high-quality video streaming and parallel GPU-accelerated
interactive rendering. Working with distributed national (LSU, NCSA, ORNL, TACC)
and international (Masaryk University) collaborators, as well network providers
(Internet2, LONI, OmniPop, ESNET) the project will build a real-world testbed
for implementation and evaluation of
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project
simultaneously addresses issues in distributed computing and computational
science, and is fundamentally targeted at the development and enhancement of a
national cyberinfrastructure to enable scientific discovery on increasing large
and complex computing environments such as provided by the NSF's TeraGrid, XD,
Blue Waters and DataNet programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;The real-world testbed, utilizing Internet2's Dynamically
Configurable Network service, will provide a persistent experimental environment
that will be used by a range of application groups to prototype and experiment
distributed applications. The testbed will be available to over forty students
and postdocs working in the cyberinfrastructure component of Louisiana's NSF
EPSCOR Research Infrastructure Improvement award.
