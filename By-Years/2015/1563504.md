Stochastic programming aids in solving difficult problems with many unknown
factors. It does so by relying on probability distributions to mathematically
represent and predict uncertain events. However, probabilities of possible
outcomes are rarely known in real life. Distributionally robust optimization
aims to obtain solutions in the presence of such distributional uncertainties.
There are a variety of ways to form distributionally robust stochastic programs.
However, which type of model to use for which type of data, system, or decision
maker is not well understood. This award supports research to have a deeper
understanding of this fundamental question and to explore multi-period
uncertainties. The project considers long-term water resources management
problems that take various sources of input including climate data, hydrological
simulations, expert opinions, and so forth. The results, if successful, will
yield improved water management, benefitting the U.S. society and economy. The
research findings will be incorporated into educational materials on stochastic
optimization. The project will therefore contribute to educating students. The
water application will be used to demonstrate the societal impact of our field
and to attract women to engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the problem
of effective modeling, the project will attempt a classification of models in a
way that highlights how different sources of data and problem characteristics
may require differing problem formulations. This research task will use
probability theory, statistics, and risk theory to make recommendations. It will
then utilize these results to improve modeling and data collection and devise
sampling schemes. To address the problem of uncertainty revealed over time, the
project will investigate data-driven multistage distributionally robust
stochastic programs. This research task will examine how to translate multi-
period uncertainties into the model and investigate the resulting model
structure and properties. To effectively solve these models, decomposition-based
solution methodologies will be explored. In addition, the project will examine
the value of data and the effect of different scenarios on optimal solutions and
values. Finally, the project will implement the modeling, algorithmic, and
theoretical findings to solve real-world multi-period water allocation problems.
If successful, the results are also applicable to other problems in energy,
transportation, and finance with complex multi-period uncertainties.
