This research is concerned with the processing of visual information captured by
a video camera. To date, image sequences have been typically analyzed and
processed in groups of two frames; by differentiating one frame from another,
short-term image dynamics can be measured, such as changed areas (e.g.,
occlusions) or pixel displacements. Although the approach has been very
successful to date (e.g., MPEG compression standards), further gains are
difficult to attain based on two image frames only. This research project offers
a different approach to the analysis of image sequences - one based on a joint
processing of multiple image frames at a time. This joint treatment of, for
example, 10 or 20 frames is expected to result in new gains in video
compression, more reliable video database querying, and more accurate detection
of innovations (occlusion and exposure areas) that are of interest in
surveillance applications.

The primary problem attacked in the project is the joint space-time segmentation
of an image sequence into "object tunnels", i.e., 3-D volumes carved out in the
space of horizontal, vertical and temporal coordinates by a moving object. The
estimation of object tunnels is approached as a volume competition problem, and
solved using active-surface evolution equations embedded into the level-set
solution framework. In order to model motion of points within each object
tunnel, a new spatially-parametric, temporally-quadratic motion model is
studied. Various cost functionals relating object-tunnel intensities to the
underlying motion are investigated. Since the standard volume competition can
only extract a single moving object from background, an extension to more
objects by means of multiple "repelling" surfaces evolving simultaneously is
studied as well.
