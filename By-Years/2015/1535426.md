Central African forests, the driest and second largest on Earth, have
experienced a long-term drying trend. A recent study detected a widespread
decline in forest photosynthetic capacity over the Congo Basin and attributed
this large-scale decline, at least partially, to this drying trend. Persistent
drought in the region could alter the Congolese forest composition and structure
in a manner that might favor the spread of drought tolerant species and thus
impact biodiversity, carbon storage, and the global water cycle. Understanding
the nature and cause of this drought and assessing its impacts on the forests
are of significant societal, environmental, and economic importance.
Understanding of climatic variability in the Congo basin is greatly hindered by
a lack of observations and resources due to political, economic and historical
factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this project, a combination of
observational and modeling studies will be undertaken to investigate the nature
and cause of the Congo rainfall variability in the 20th century. The role of
global sea surface temperatures will be examined. For the observational
component, observations and reanalysis data will be utilized to identify major
patterns and drivers of the variability. For the modeling component, the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations and idealized climate model
simulations will be examined to investigate the physical mechanisms for the
Congo drought. The relative contribution of anthropogenic versus natural forcing
on the observed rainfall decadal variability over the Congo Basin will be
investigated.
