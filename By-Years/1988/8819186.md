The objective of this research is to study the development and the
mechanical/physical property effects of crystallographic texture in aluminum
oxide, silicon nitride, and zirconia ceramic materials. This work will involve
fundamental studies of: texture development mechanisms during densification,
including stress-assisted densification; evaluation of the mechanical and
physical properties of the densified materials as a function of texture; and,
modeling of the texture development mechanisms and textural effects on
properties. This work will involve extensive processing (hot forging and hot
extrusion) and characterization (microstructural: x-ray pole figures, optical,
SEM, and TEM; and mechanical property: fracture toughness, elastic modulus,
fatigue crack growth) studies.
