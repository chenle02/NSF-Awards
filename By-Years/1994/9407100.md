9407100 Balazs The focus of this theoretical research is to determine the effect
of polymer architecture on the properties of macromolecules in solutions, in
blends and at surfaces. In these studies the focus is on combs and branched
polymers. The aim of the research is to determine how the entropic, as well as
energetic, contributions to the free energies of mixing are affected by the
architectural complexity of the macromolecules. In particular, the formation of
micelles from comb copolymers in solution will be studied, as well as the
creation of miscible blends with combs and linear or other comb copolymers. An
additional goal is to tether linear and comb copolymers onto surfaces and create
interfaces which mimic biological systems. The objective is to design channels
from synthetic polymers that can display simple gating and switching behavior or
act as receptors for certain chains in solution. %%% This largely computational
study will investigate the properties of mixtures of polymers which are shaped
like combs. These type of polymers have unique properties, especially relating
to adhesion, enable a variety of structures to form. Applications to biomimetic
systems which will simulate simple electronic behavior will be studied. ***
