Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires understanding what information people
have about the disease and how officials can improve public knowledge and
encourage behaviors that will protect public health. By measuring COVID-19
beliefs and attitudes, this study provides insights into public beliefs about
COVID-19 and the efficacy of government and health messaging about the pandemic,
and how those quantities change over time. In addition to measuring respondents’
knowledge about COVID-19, the research team assesses how people’s online media
consumption is related to their patterns of knowledge. Finally, the study
provides information about the effectiveness of public health messages on
respondents’ knowledge about COVID-19 and support for public health policies.

The research team is collecting behavioral and survey data from Americans in a
multi-wave nationally representative survey. This survey includes oversamples of
respondents who live in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases and who have
voluntarily agreed to provide data on their online browsing activity. Each wave
measures both the prevalence of different types of beliefs about COVID-19 and
reported support for and adherence to recommendations from public health
authorities. To evaluate responses to information from public health officials,
the second survey wave includes a randomized experiment evaluating the effects
of messaging from health and medical authorities. Finally, the study
characterizes the information people consume online about the pandemic by
analyzing the behavioral data provided by respondents using a combination of
human-coded and machine learning approaches.
