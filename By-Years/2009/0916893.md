CCF-0916893 SHF:Small: IMUnit: Improved Multithreaded Unit Testing PIs: Darko
Marinov and Grigore Rosu

Computing is going through a paradigm shift from a mostly sequential worldview
to a mostly parallel worldview. The currently dominant programming model for
parallel code is that of shared data, where multiple threads of computation
communicate by accessing shared data objects. Unfortunately, developing and
testing multithreaded code is very hard. To significantly improve testing of
multithreaded code, this project develops a set of new techniques and tools for
multithreaded tests. A multithreaded test is a piece of code that creates and
executes two or more threads. Executing a test follows some
schedule/interleaving of the multiple threads. The key of the new approach is to
allow the explicit specification of a set of relevant schedules for each test,
while traditional tests implicitly specify all possible schedules. This project
addresses three important challenges for multithreaded tests: (1) How to
describe a set of schedules and which schedules from a given set to explore? (2)
How to automatically generate multithreaded tests, especially schedules, for
given code? (3) How to select and prioritize rerunning of the multithreaded
tests when the code changes? Improved unit testing of multithreaded code has the
potential to substantially increase the quality of developed code.
