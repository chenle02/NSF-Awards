A scientist from the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Science, will make high quality chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6) measurements during the 2013 GEOTRACES cruise to the Eastern
Tropical South Pacific Ocean. These measurements will provide an overall
oceanographic context for the cruise, as well as contribute to the
interpretation of GEOTRACES trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs) by
characterizing the physical processes which can affect their speciation and
internal cycling. In addition, for the low oxygen waters in the oxygen minimum
zone (OMZ), the researcher will distinguish water that is old as a result of
physical circulation processes from recently renewed, yet low oxygen waters due
to biochemical processes. Tracer ages will help constrain the residence times of
the OMZ layers. Secondly, rates of biochemically important processes such as
apparent oxygen utilization and denitrification in upwelling areas, the OMZ, and
low nitrate regions will be compared with estimates from historical data.
Lastly, ventilated thermocline and intermediate water masses within which TEIs
reside will be identified and their effective time scales of circulation from
the source regions will be estimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the
broader impacts, the scientist will continue her active participation in the
National Science Foundation ADVANCE program, as well as the Mentoring Physical
Oceanography Women to Increase Retention (MPOWIR) program. One graduate student
will be supported and trained as part of this project.
