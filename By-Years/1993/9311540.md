Gage 9311540 Tropical forest destruction and ecosystem degradation due to human
modification of the environment is ultimately a function of population size and
growth. However, the rates of environmental degradation, and tropical
deforestation in particular, are mediated by prevailing land use and land tenure
systems. This pilot project for a long term multidisciplinary and multifaceted
study will investigate the factors that underlie tropical deforestation in the
rural township of Buenos Aires, Costa Rica. The objectives of the current pilot
project are two-fold: 1) to evaluate the utility of the data currently collected
by the C.R. Ministry of Health and those housed in local health clinics, and 2)
to collect preliminary data concerning the agricultural economics and ecology of
the region. The general goal is to collect the background information necessary
to develop a more extensive project concerning the interrelationships of
ecology, micro-demography, agricultural economics, and tropical deforestation in
detail. ical deforestation in detail. *** P\anthro\jfried\9311540.abs e u ~ e
