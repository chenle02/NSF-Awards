With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Bates College will acquire two gas chromatographs,
one with mass spectrometric detection and one with flame ionization detection.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) the study
of molecular mechanisms of metalloenzyme-mediated alkane transformations in the
environment; b) studies of tributyl tin levels in organisms and their effects on
gross morphological changes in snails; and c) the analysis of biomolecules
(lipids, lignin, phenols, amino acids) in the sedimentary and fossil record for
paleoenvironmental applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatograph with
mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) or gas chromatography with flame ionization
detection (GC-FID) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation
and analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research within the multidisciplinary Environmental Studies program
at Bates College, and will also encourage collaboration between researchers in
Chemistry, Biology, and Geology.
