This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I will develop a novel,
nanotechnology-based cancer therapy. This therapy, nanoshell-based thermal
ablation (NBTA), holds the promise as a significant new therapeutic tool for the
treatment of otherwise inoperable cancers or neoplasms where surgery is
accompanied by a high probability of morbidity or mortality. The therapy will
utilize proprietary nanoshells to convert externally applied near-infrared (nIR)
light into localized heat to destroy targeted cancer cells, minimizing damage to
surrounding tissue and avoiding the long-term effects of radiation therapy or
chemotherapy. Specific goals of this STTR project include (i) understanding
biodistribution and clearance of nanoshells, (ii) understanding tumor uptake of
nanoshells, and (iii) assessment of the survival time of animals with cancers
that have been treated with nanoshells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project will be in cancer therapy. NBTA will lead to an FDA
regulated device comprised of nanoshells and a light delivery system (laser).
The company will partner with a laser manufacturer, and with a marketing and
sales partner, for distribution of the product.
