The principal investigator will study the thermal evolution of aureoles
associated with contact metamorphic zones, using petrologic and modelling tools.
This will provide important clues regarding the type(s) of heat transport
operating around such bodies and will give geologists critical information
needed to interpert the geologic histories of these zones.
