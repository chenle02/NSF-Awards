It is now believed that many stars with surface temperatures like the sun's and
less have magnetic activity cycles similar to the 11-year cycle of the sun. One
group of such stars are the so-called RS CVn stars, whose active regions are
thought to be associated with cool, circular starspot regions. The Principal
Investigator (PI) proposes to use archival and newly obtained photometric data
for the investigation of eclipsing RS CVn stars. The goal is to determine
whether the long-term trends in sizes and locations of the active regions of
these stars will reveal magnetic activity cycles similar to the solar cycle. In
addition, the PI proposes to determine the temperature of the stars' spotted
regions relative to their photospheres.
