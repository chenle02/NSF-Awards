L. C. Evans will deliver a series of ten lectures on the general topic of "Weak
Convergence Methods for Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations", with special
emphasis on the newly developing theories of (a) quasiconvexity methods in the
calculus of variations, (b) concentrated compactness, (c) compensated
compactness, and (d) maximum principle/viscosity solution techniques. His
primary aim will be to explain in the clearest and simplest settings the basic
ideas underlying and relating the various current theories for studying
nonlinear PDE using the tools of weak convergence. Moreover, the lectures will
provide, for the first time, a single unifying source for these results and
their applications; now mostly available only to experts in widely scattered
research journals.
