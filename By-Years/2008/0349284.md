In this project, co-funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division and the Biomolecular Systems Cluster of the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Prof. Haw Yang of the University of
California, Berkeley will conduct experiments to probe the conformational
flexibility of biomolecules using single-molecule spectroscopic techniques
combined with systematic mutation of a ubiquitous prototype system - - the
adenylate kinase family of enzymes. Experimental and theoretical approaches will
be combined to gain an understanding of: the molecular motions that lead to a
catalytic event, the conformational gating of enzyme reactions, and the free-
energy landscapes of enzyme-substrate systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides
building a research program that will provide insight to the understanding of
the motions of biomolecules, Prof. Yang's research will provide research
opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral researchers.
Additionally, Prof. Yang will work on developing new web-based materials, new
curricular materials, and a research monograph to bring the results of his
single-biomolecule research to a larger audience.&lt;br/&gt;
