Objective and Relevancy: This project supports 12 U.S. scientists to attend a
workshop on advanced laser Raman spectroscopy to provide state-of-the-art
knowledge and background on significant developments in the field through
presentations and discussions. The meeting will provide young scientists from
India and neighboring countries an opportunity to meet their counterparts from
developed countries to discuss research problems of mutual interest. It is
expected to emphasize the role of young scientists in research and development
in the branches of interdisciplinary field encompassing physics, chemistry,
materials science, biology, medicine, and industrial fields. Participants are
expected from Western Europe, USSR, and Japan. Merit: The P.I. is an eminent
scientist who has considerable experience in the field of Raman spectroscopy and
in India. He is collaborating on a joint research project with scientists at the
Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur where the meeting is to take place. The
Indians are particularly active in this field and it is likely that further
collaboration will result from this meeting. Funding: None other than this
action.
