A detailed study of the enzyme-catalyzed preparation of polymers will be
undertaken in two general areas: (1) exploration of the factors which determine
the molecular weight of (AA-BB)x polyesters formed by hydrolase-catalyzed
transesterification in organic solvents; and (2) exploration of the scope and
limitations of enzyme-catalyzed polymerization method. In examining the factors
affecting molecular weight, variations will be made relative to a standard
polycondensation, the porcine pancreatic lipase catalyzed reaction of bis(2,2,2-
trichloroethyl) glutarate with 1,4-butanediol in anhydrous ether at combient
temperature. Among the factors to be varied in a systematic fashion are the
stoichiometry of the monomers, the concentratins, of the reactants and the
catalyst in the solvent, the length of the monomers, the leaving group lost in
the transesterification, the solvent, the reaction temperature, and the enzyme
catalyst. The scope and limitations of enzyme-catalyzed polycondensations will
be explored in five areas: (1) preparation of (AA-BB)x polymers form a variety
of different diester (or diacid) and diol monomers and examination of the early
intermediates formed during the process; (2) extension of the process to the
formation of of (A-B)x polymer; (3) development of additional examples of
optically active polymer formation using the method; (4) application of enzymes
in the preparation of stereoregular monomers; (5) examination of the ability of
enzymes to make polymers other than polyesters such as polyamides
polycarbonates.
