Title: Conference on State Strategies for Improving Teacher Preparation and
Certification Consistent with Science Education Standards A national conference
is being held to focus attention of state education leaders on the implications
of the recently released National Research Council (NRC) Science Education
Standards and other national and state standards for K-12 science content for
the preparation of science teachers. Three important factors inform the
preparation of science teachers: 1) state policies; 2) teacher preparation
programs designed by schools of education; and 3) undergraduate science
curricula. Leaders from each of these areas will be speakers and/or panelists in
several plenary sessions. Conference participants will be state education and
science leaders who will attend as teams to facilitate: 1) discussion of the
need for improving science teacher preparation in light of the new standards; 2)
consideration of various models and approaches toward improvement; and 3)
initiation of intra-state strategies for co-ordinated reform of policies and
programs of science teacher education.
