9350711 Smith This project proposes to update and enhance the anatomy and
physiology laboratory experiences of introductory-level biology students. We
will accomplish this objective primarily with an infusion of computer-interfaced
equipment that will foster an interactive approach to physiology. The two
courses targeted for this new equipment are Human Anatomy and Physiology (year
sequence; Biology 111-112) and introductory biology for non- majors (Biology and
Society: Biology 103). Both these courses serve to satisfy Core Curriculum
requirements. Both courses deal, at least in part, with human anatomy and
physiology; both courses enroll future teachers. These courses serve about 400
students each year.Our students will be able to collect physiological data on
themselves, display the data and analyze it. They will be able to make
microscopic observations, conduct experiments at the microscopic level
(permeability of RBC's, digestion in food vacuoles) and display the results for
the entire class. The videodisc capability will make available thousands of
images of human cells, tissues, organs and pathologies to our students. The
computer-laserdisc link will be used interactively with students. This equipment
will be the nucleus around which we will build a course to train our graduate
teaching assistants, part of the next generation of secondary and university
teachers. ***
