This project represents a cooperative effort between researchers at Tuskegee
University and Purdue University. Faculty and students in the Electrical
Engineering, and Computer Science at Tuskegee University, and Computer Science
at Purdue University have performed considerable research in the proposed field
over the past decade. The faculty of Tuskegee University will work together to
establish the research and M.S. degree programs at Tuskegee University as their
primary goal, as well as to further develop research at Purdue. The result of
this project will be the establishment of a research program in Computer Science
at Tuskegee University that will attract and train minority graduate students,
thereby increasing the pool of available minority students qualified for
research positions in industry. It is anticipated that some of the graduates of
this program will continue on to PhD degrees at Purdue and other universities,
increasing the number of minorities in high-level research positions both in
industry and academia. However, these benefits notwithstanding, the anticipated
results of the proposed research will be valuable in the development of parallel
algorithms in various fields of science and engineering.
