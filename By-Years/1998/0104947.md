Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), a common rangeland grass, is
frequently infected by a fungus (Atkinsonella texensis) that sterilizes the
plant. Infected plants, however, may grow faster and be more likely to survive
than uninfected plants. This study will determine whether this is true, by
testing three different hypotheses: (a) The fungus may directly cause infected
plants to grow faster and be more likely to survive. (b) Infected plants may
recover from being eaten by insects better than uninfected plants, perhaps
because they are larger. (c) Infection may make a plant less likely to be eaten
by insects, perhaps because the fungus produces distasteful chemicals. This
study will also test whether fungal infection affects a plant's ability to
compete with other plants for light, water, and nutrients. Although fungi
probably play very important roles in natural ecosystems, their roles are poorly
known; this study will help fill this gap.
