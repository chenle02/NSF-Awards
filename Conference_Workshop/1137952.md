This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Texas
Christian University in the summer of 2012 on the topic of Hodge theory, complex
geometry, and representation theory. The principal speaker will be Professor
Emeritus Phillip Griffiths from the Institute for Advanced Study. This award
will support 30 participants at different stages of their careers.

This conference will describe recent progress on automorphic cohomology beyond
the classical cases. The material involved is at the confluence of several parts
of mathematics: Hodge theory, representation theory, and complex geometry. The
main lectures will describe new breakthroughs due to Carayol and others and will
build upon the recent work of Griffiths and his collaborators on Mumford-Tate
groups and domains. The lectures will focus on two main examples and are
intended to be accessible to a wide range of participants.
