The University of Michigan College of Engineering, Center for the Education of
Women, and Women in Science Program will collaborate in this model project. The
goal is to increase the number of women in academic research and related careers
in engineering. Fifty sophomore women will be selected and given a two year
training program of seminars, internships, and symposia to prepare them for
graduate school, or employment as engineers. Women graduate students in
engineering will serve as role model-presentors for the seminars. The symposia
will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of research findings and
matters related to preparations for graduate school. The project has strong
financial support from the University and from industry.//
