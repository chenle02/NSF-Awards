The proposed research addresses the generation, analysis, and evaluation of
alternative reaction routes. These ideas, which complement those recently
developed by chemists, are to be applied to the synthesis of chemical processing
systems where raw material costs, energy comsumption, and other economic
variables are important considerations. The characteristics of chemical reaction
paths will be investigated for the purpose of selecting and evaluating promising
reaction routes and intermediate chemicals for the design of closed cycle
reaction sequences for identifying feasible paths of difficult overall
reactions, chemical reaction heat pumps, and solar energy storage systems.
