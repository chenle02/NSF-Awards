The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to
enable cost-effective deployment of multiple small satellites, which can provide
greater utility than a small number of large satellites. Lack of launch capacity
has created a substantial and rapidly growing backlog of unlaunched small
satellites. Providing low cost and increased capacity for launch of miniaturized
satellites will enable important scientific and communication capabilities that
larger satellites are unable to cost-effectively perform. These include low data
rate communications, network constellations to gather data from multiple points,
in-orbit inspection of larger satellites, and university related research. This
will enable more university atmospheric-based research and, since low-orbit
satellites pass over a specific geographic area more frequently than large
satellites, they can be used for rapid response to disasters or to gather timely
information relating to telemedicine, environmental management, and asset
tracking. as well as enhanced communication capability in remote regions.

This I-Corps project will contribute to addressing the technical and logistical
challenges associated with the deployment and altitude control of balloons as
platforms for launching small satellites. The architecture is broken into key
subsystems. Initially, research and development was focused on the Launch
Orientation and Control System (LOC). Subsequently, development focused on
building and testing several subsystems that can execute suborbital launch. This
includes the continued development of the LOC System, design and integration of
a wireless communication system, and a robust flight system capable of testing
at low altitudes under tethered control. Two successful tests were conducted,
including a tethered flight integration test and third launch test. The team
will continue address technical hurdles have yet to be resolved, including safe
tethering connection and handling of the rocket, a semi-controllable buoyancy
system, quick deflation method, central skeletal structure integration, and
remote communication.
