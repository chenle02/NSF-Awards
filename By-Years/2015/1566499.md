Understanding the computational hardness of securely realizing cryptographic
primitives is a fundamental problem in cryptography. One such vital
cryptographic primitive is oblivious transfer and understanding the essence of
implementing it has significant consequences to cryptography, like bringing
secure multi-party computation closer to reality. This research develops a new
theory to explore this broad concept, namely the theory of computational
correlations. This project defines an appropriate notion of computational
correlations, leverages security guarantees to argue computational hardness
results, and introduces the concept of computational channels in design and
analysis of practical obvious transfer protocols.

The theory of computational correlations is, among various other applications,
useful to exhibit necessity of oblivious transfer to achieve certain notions of
security and design rate optimal oblivious transfer protocols in the
computational setting. Training the next generation of cryptography research and
security professionals is a central goal of this project. This includes the
design and development of new courses and course materials for undergraduate and
graduate courses, development of active learning materials for the dissemination
of knowledge, and engagement of minority and women students in research.
