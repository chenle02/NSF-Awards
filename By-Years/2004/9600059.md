Fulton The research in this proposal concerns a variety of topics in algebraic
geometry and related fields, including: topology of algebraic varieties;
degeneracy loci and classical groups; configuration spaces; curves on Calabi-Yau
threefolds; compactifications of moduli spaces; intersection theory, Chow
groups, and relations with K-theory; p-adic Hodge theory; representation theory,
including Langlands dual group; group cohomology and Koszul algebras; conic
bundles and Mori fibrations. Algebraic geometry has a long and important history
in mathematics, particularly because it interacts with so many other fields of
mathematics, such as topology, analysis, algebra, and number theory. It has
flourished during the last half of the twentieth century, especially in this
country. The recent interactions with physics have brought a new energy to the
field, since we have learned that very classical problems - like counting the
numbers of plane curves passing through a given set of points - are intimately
related to ideas like mirror symmetry in modern physics. This is another example
of a problem that seemed to be of purely theoretical interest in mathematics
that has turned out to have unexpected connections with another subject, to
their mutual benefit. At its simplest and most fundamental level, algebraic
geometry studies sets defined by polynomial equations; such sets arise in many
problems in computer science and robotics, and there is increasing interaction
between algebraic geometry and these fields.
