9358406 DePablo The project focuses on developing a theoretical understanding of
the structure and equilibrium thermodynamic properties of complex fluids. The
transport properties and non-equilibrium behavior is also explored
theoretically. An experimental component aimed at validating the results of the
theoretical work is also included in the project. The complex fluids include
polymer melts and polymer solutions, especially in confined geometrics such as
in porous media or as in model biological membranes. In the theoretical
investigations, efforts will be made to develop further improvements in pair
distribution functions for the highly asymmetric mixtures of polymeric fluids.
Efforts are underway to ameliorate existing integral-equation methods for
polymers. The project also involves studies to develop stochastic methods to
mimic the motion of flexible molecules as they travel through dense media, e.g.
dense polymers, underground reservoirs. Another line of investigation deals with
cryopreservation of food, plants, and pharmaceuticals through addition of small
amounts of cryoprotectants (e.g. disaccharides or polymeric molecules) in dilute
electrolyte solutions. ***
