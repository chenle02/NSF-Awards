Symmetries have played an important role in sciences and arts and are described
in terms of group theory. Two important types of groups are discrete groups and
Lie groups. Lie groups are closely related to homogeneous spaces. An important
class of homogeneous spaces consists of symmetric spaces, a very distinguished
class of special Riemannian manifolds. Examples of symmetric spaces include the
Euclidean spaces and the spheres in them. Another type of symmetric spaces is
given by hyperbolic spaces, in which there are infinitely many nonparallel lines
which do not intersect with each other. Discrete groups acting on symmetric
spaces give rise to locally symmetric spaces; for example, surfaces with
constant curvature are locally symmetric spaces. The interplay between the
topology, geometry and group theory of discrete groups, Lie groups and locally
symmetric spaces has been intensively studied in mathematics.

In this proposal, the PI proposes to study the Novikov conjectures for
arithmetic groups using the large scale geometry and compactifications of
symmetric spaces of noncompact type. Specifically, an important invariant of the
asymptotic geometry is the asymptotic dimension, the finiteness of which is
closely related to the Novikov conjectures. For a torsion free arithmetic
subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group, the partial Borel-Serre
compactification of the associated symmetric space is the universal covering of
the classifying space of the arithmetic group. For applications to the Novikov
conjectures, we need a large compactification of the partial Borel-Serre
compactification. To study S-arithmetic subgroups, a generalization of
arithmetic groups, we also need compactifications of Bruhat-Tits buildings.
Compactifications of symmetric spaces and buildings are also important for other
purposes.
