This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to R.J. Cody Markelz is "Develop a systems level model of
resource allocation and partitioning in Brassica rapa to predict growth across
multiple genotypes and environments". The host institution for the fellowship is
the University of California, Davis and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Julin
Maloof and Daniel Kliebenstein.

If successful, this project will significantly advance classical plant growth
modeling by connecting it to quantitative genetics and metabolic network
modeling. Training objectives include statistical genetics, mathematical
modeling, metabolic network reconstruction, and systems biology. Broader impacts
include training undergraduates and high school students through small, hands-on
QTL mapping projects. Additionally, a module for middle school teachers about
shade avoidance will be developed for inclusion in the Plants iView outreach
program. This module will include a detailed lesson plan, the key biological
concepts and national education standards addressed, and a practical guide for
teaching the lessons in the classroom.

The research will take a systems biology approach to investigate the
interactions among genotype, response to shade, and response to nutrient
availability. This project will be conducted in a genetic mapping population of
Brassica rapa, which is segregating for the response to shade and nutrient
availability. The objectives are to: (1) determine if shade-induced changes in
nutrient use efficiency are genetically controlled; (2) link tissue-level
physiological traits with the underlying metabolic networks; (3) integrate
quantitative trait loci (QTL) and metabolic networks into a mathematical model
of whole plant resource partitioning. The model will then be used to predict
genotype-specific growth and yield responses to shade and nutrient availability.
The model will be validated against datasets collected by undergraduate
researchers. The whole-plant systems level dataset will be made available
through a relational database that will be linked to an open-access data
analysis workflow utilizing the free cloud computing resources at iPlant
Collaborative.
