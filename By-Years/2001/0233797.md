This grant supports a workshop to be held on October 14-16, 2002, at Georgetown
University and the National Science Foundation. This Workshop on Opportunities
in Materials Theory will focus on scientific areas identified by members of the
materials theory community as fields in which there is high potential for
significant progress and impact. The workshop will highlight some of these
areas. Travel stipends will be provided to assist young faculty and postdoctoral
associates in attending the workshop. Sessions will also be held, particularly
for young researchers, on opportunities for funding and on proposal preparation
and evaluation. A public lecture is also planned.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This
