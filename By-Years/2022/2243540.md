This project will analyze molecular hydrogen (H2) in an ice core from Summit,
Greenland to reconstruct atmospheric changes in H2 over the past millennium.
This will be the first record of past atmospheric H2 prior to the onset of the
industrial era. The results will reveal the natural variability in paleo-
atmospheric H2 and how it relates to climate change. The resulting data will
provide a baseline for assessing how human activities have influenced
atmospheric H2 since the preindustrial era. The results of this study will
inform global assessments of how the future hydrogen economy will affect
atmospheric composition and climate. The project will provide training for a
postdoctoral scholar and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research involves drilling a new ice core at Summit, extracting air from the
samples in the field, with subsequent analysis for H2, Ne, and CH4. Paleo-
atmospheric levels of H2 will be inferred from the observed H2/Ne ratio to
account for pore close-off fractionation during firn air entrapment and possible
gas loss during drilling/sampling. This study will generate the first millennial
scale atmospheric history of H2 and examine centennial scale variability
associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. Climate-related
variability in H2 is expected because the major loss mechanism is microbial
uptake in soil, a process that is highly sensitive to hydrological conditions.
The Summit paleo-atmospheric H2 record will therefore provide new constraints on
our understanding of the global biogeochemical cycling of H2 and an important
test for global models used to assess the climate sensitivity of future H2
emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
