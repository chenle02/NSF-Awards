This award is for an Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for next
summer at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The program will use chaotic
sequences to introduce eight undergraduate students to mathematical research.
The students will initially be given some elementary definitions and examples.
They will then be expected to generate their own theorems and proofs and further
examples and definitions. After becoming familiar with chaotic phenomena, they
will do a library search for articles on discrete chaotic dynamical systems.
This search is to include articles written for laymen, articles on applications
and research and survey articles. They will present this material to the other
students. Each student will select a topic from the material presented upon
which to prepare a written paper. Computers will be used to quickly generate
large numbers of examples so that similarities and differences may be more
easily detected.
