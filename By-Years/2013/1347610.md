This project will build on well-documented evidence-based teaching practices to
improve STEM education at this college through extensive professional
development and support for STEM faculty members. The focus of the project is on
redesigning eight gateway courses. The project will offer similar professional
development and support to K-12 STEM teachers from eight partner school
districts. These activities are in support of the ultimate goal of developing
partnerships with business, higher education, and research institutions
regionally to improve STEM education outcomes in its service area and to
consolidate the regional STEM network. This connected approach to institutional
transformation is novel. Within the local pipeline of STEM interested students,
it has the promise of smoothing the transition for students from high school
(where they will be better prepared for college) into highly effective lower
division courses in college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will assess the
impact of these project on student success in STEM courses.
