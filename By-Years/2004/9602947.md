9602947 Mischaikow This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
project between mathematicians from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), on a study of theoretical and
numerical problems in differential equations. Leaders of the groups are Dr.
Konstatin Mischaikow for the U.S. and Dr. Gilberto Flores for Mexico. A broad
array of mathematical problems will be investigated in the areas of ordinary and
partial differential equations, including theoretical and approximation aspects
on inverse problems, approximation techniques in integrable Hamiltonian systems,
elliptic equations with critical Sobolev exponents, existence of periodic
orbits, and traveling waves phenomena. Both institutions involved in the project
have complementary strengths in the areas of analytical and numerical aspects of
differential equations. As a result of the collaboration a broadly based
scientific exchange between the two institutions will be established that will
significantly contribute to the training of graduate students. ***
