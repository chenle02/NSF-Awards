The Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science (CARFS) will be based at
Iowa State University as the lead institution. The mission of the proposed
Center is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for advancing research and
innovation in forensic sciences, enhancing education in relevant scientific
disciplines, and improving the interpretation and ethical communication of
forensic practitioner findings. CARFS will address the human, analytical, and
statistical foundations of forensic science evaluations, including topics such
as human observer biases and the interpretation of evidence, assessment and
innovation in forensic analysis to include computational and technological
innovations, and statistical sampling and measurement approaches for improving
the validity of inferences drawn from forensic evaluations.

The proposed multidisciplinary Center will offer important opportunities for
training new scientists and provide environment for cross-disciplinary
engagement. Coordination with Iowa State University's Science Bound Program will
facilitate important research and mentorship experiences for underrepresented
high school and undergraduate students. The CARFS research team is distributed
across key disciplines in science, social science, education, engineering, and
statistics, with interests that will directly contribute to forensic practice in
a number of important disciplines including toxicology, firearms and toolmarks,
questioned documents, trace evidence, controlled substances, biological
screening, fracture patterns, impression evidence, and bloodstain pattern
analysis. The Midwest Forensics Resource Center at Iowa State University will
also provide support to this I/UCRC effort by enabling scientist-practitioner
collaborations and ensuring important opportunities for the dissemination of
findings through an established network of practitioners.
