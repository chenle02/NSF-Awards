The central problems in the random media theory are connected with the ideas of
localization and intermittency which were popular in the physical and
mathematical literature during last decade. Recent progress in the lattice
localization theory makes the continuous models more realistic physically,
especially spectral problems for the random domains, manifolds, etc., and
localization for the electromagnetic waves. Another issue is the asymptotic
behavior of magnetic fields in turbulent flows, i.e. the solutions of the
Maxwell equations with random and non-linear terms. This set of problems is
important in astrophysical applications (non-linear solar dynamo,solar wind
etc.) Random media theory is a new branch of probability theory closely
connected with the modern mathematical and theoretical physics. The basic
problems on this area come from the natural sciences: disordered solid state
physics(including the theory of semiconductors), astrophysics,in particular the
theory of solar magnetosphere and solar wind, and geophysics, mainly the theory
of seismic waves in lithosphere blocks with cracks.
