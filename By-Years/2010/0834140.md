This CBMS Conference on Algebraic Topology in Applied Mathematics will present
10 lectures by Robert Ghrist focusing on very recent applications of algebraic
topology and its methods to problems in modern technological areas. Specific
applications include (1) coverage problems in sensor networks; (2) sensor fusion
and data aggregation over networks; (3) statistics of (large) data sets with
coarse (or coordinate-free) geometric correlation; (4) synchronization and
consensus of systems; (5) robot motion planning and coordination; and (6)
rigorous interpretation of experimental dynamics. Many of these problems are
imperative systems engineering challenges of direct impact in security, defense,
manufacturing, and commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series will be structured
in a manner that prepares students with regards to the algebraic topology, the
various direct applications, and, most importantly, the global perspectives that
will allow and encourage students to find new applications.
