The Purdue Schools of Chemical, Electrical, and Materials Engineering, which
have been sharing undergraduate courses as well as research on electronic
materials and processing for several years will participate in a REU site in
microelectronic materials and processing. The focus of the REU site is the
synthesis, processing, properties, structure, and performance of microelectronic
materials, and the interrelationships among these aspects. Specific projects
include anisotropic etching of microelectronic thin films, selective epitaxial
growth and three- dimensional integration, processing on patterned substrates of
electronic materials, fundamentals of metal contacts to semiconductors, and 'a
priori' predictions of physical and chemical properties of microelectronic
materials as functions of their synthesis and processing. The goals of the REU
will be to introduce students to independent research on these materials and
device fabrication, to develop and enhance the students' creativity and
originality, to develop outstanding candidates for graduate programs, to
demonstrate the excitement and rewards from successful research, and to prepare
B.S. graduates who will excel in industrial research and development
environments.
