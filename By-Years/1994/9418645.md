9418645 Kepezhinskas We propose to carry out two geological and geochemical
transects across the volcanic arc of the Kamchatkan Peninsula. The transects are
located on different basement terranes, although both are of largely oceanic
affinity. Comparison of volcanic rocks of different ages at a given location
will permit us to study changes in the compositions of magmas through time.
Comparison between the transects will allow is to constrain the effects of
lithospheric modification (contamination, etc.). Comparison along the trends
will allow evaluation of subduction-related effects. The variable depth to the
Benioff zone along each transect may result in variations in the nature and
amount of the slab-derived component, and concomitant differences in the degree
of partial melting. The occurrence of very primitive lavas and mantle xenoliths
among the volcanic rocks of the region will help us to better understand source
compositions and processes. This study will significantly advance our
understanding of the magmatism and tectonics of the Kamchatkan arc, and of
subduction-related magmatism in general.
