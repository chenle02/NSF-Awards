Darwin?s Finches of the Galápagos Islands are one of the most famous examples of
evolution by natural selection. Unfortunately, several species of these
evolutionary icons have recently come under serious threat from an introduced
species of parasitic fly (Philornis downsi). This pest, which was probably
accidentally introduced from mainland Central or South America, may have
devastating effects on host reproductive success. The endangered Mangrove Finch
and other species may be at risk of extinction if a way to combat the fly is not
found. The goal of our study is to carefully measure the impact of this invasive
parasite on Medium ground finches, and test whether the birds are able to mount
immune responses to the flies, or defend themselves in other ways.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide critical data to inform decisions
by management personnel of the Galápagos National Park, which is responsible for
the welfare of Galápagos native fauna and flora. The project will provide
interdisciplinary training for a postdoc, a Ph.D. student, Ecuadorian
volunteers, and several undergrad students in host-parasite evolutionary
ecology, behavior, immunology, and conservation biology.
