9612367 Gronostajski Nuclear Factor I (NFI) is one of a class of
phylogenetically-conserved site-specific DNA-binding proteins that play an
essential role in fundamental cellular processes including organismal
development. These studies examine a simple developmental system in a organism
containing a single NFI gene. The function of the NFI in the growth and
development of C. elegans will be studied by the generation of deletion mutants
in the NFI gene using Tcl targeted mutagenesis. The phenotype of homozygous
null-mutants, and of organisms expressing specific mutated forms of NFI will
yield important insights into how this family of evolutionarily-conserved DNA-
binding proteins function in C. elegans and other organisms. The phenotype of
this deletion mutant will be analyzed in respect to cell viability, embryonic,
and post-embryonic development. If the null-allele generates an early lethal
phenotype, it will be carried in a strain containing an extrachromosomal array
of the wild-type gene which will allow the generation of homozygous deletion
animals by partitioning of the array. This "reverse genetic" approach to
understanding NFI function during C. elegans development will also allow testing
whether the vertebrate NFI genes can complement the C. elegans gene and thus
assess how useful C. elegans mutants may be in the analysis of other multigene
families involved in vertebrate development. ***
