In the past decade, the Web has become one of the most used and transformative
social applications in the history of human communications. Our everyday use of
the Web depends on fundamental developments in computer science that took place
long before the Web was invented. Today?s search engines, for example, are based
on developments in information retrieval with a legacy going back to the 1960s.
The innovations of the 1990s provided the crucial algorithms underlying the
modern search engines that are so fundamental to Web use. Many interesting
aspects of Web use, such as social networking, tagging, data integration,
information retrieval, and Web ontologies, have emerged as ?social computing? at
some of the top information schools and computing programs. However, in too many
cases the Web is studied exclusively as a technical or social artifact rather
than as an object of study in its own right, whose architectural properties
actively shape the human interactions it supports. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of this project will define interdisciplinary methodologies that can be
used to help develop the critical science, technology, and eventually curriculum
at the heart of the emerging interdisciplinary field of Web Science. We will
focus on establishing the methods of understanding and developing systems that
allow large numbers of users to work together to form communities to solve
scientific and social problems.&lt;br/&gt;
