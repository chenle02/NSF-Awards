This project proposes to examine the involvement of thyroid hormones in
regulating aerobic energetic capacities to sustain locomotor activity in
reptiles. As endothermy evolved independently in mammals and birds along
essentially parallel lines of reptilian ancestry, these studies on extent
reptiles may provide insight into non-thermoregulatory roles of thyroid hormones
in the ancestral conditions that led to modern endotherms. Three complementary
lines of research will be conducted. Firstly, natural seasonal cycles in total
and free levels of thyroid hormones and correlated changes in physiological and
behavioral factors will be analyzed to provide the interpretational framework
for experimental work. Secondly, laboratory experiments will employ new methods
to induce physiological alterations in levels of thyroid hormones in regulating
particular processes. Thirdly, field experiments will be done to regulate levels
of thyroid hormones in field-active lizards and to test the involvement of
seasonal hormone cycles in regulating particular processes. The research is
expected to yield new information on the regulation by thyroid hormones of
physiological processes that support activity and may help to clarify the
adaptive significance of these processes in relation to natural activity.
