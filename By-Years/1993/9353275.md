9353275 Smith The NSF Longitudinal Retention Survey is designed to collect
information on retention and graduation rates of first-time freshmen in the RCMS
institutions (Appendix 1). The purpose of this survey is to assist the RCMS
Project Director in reviewing annually the retention and participation of RCMS
institutions' student population in general, and subgroups of women,
underrepresented minorities and SEM (science, engineering and mathematics)
majors in particular. The survey tracks the longitudinal retention and
graduation rates of each year's total first-time freshman population and its
subgroup of SEM majors for a period as long as six years. These two groups are
further divided into subgroups of males, females, Black males, Black females,
Hispanic males, Hispanic females, American-Indian males, and American-Indian
females. The data elements surveyed for each year's first-time freshman cohort
subgroups include: headcount of each subgroup, retention rates after one and two
years, and graduation and continuation rates within four, five, and six years.
In the first year, the survey will include the fall 1985 to fall 1991 first-time
freshman cohort groups. The data collected initially will establish six-year
trend statistics of retention and participation in the RCMS institutions. These
trend statistics can be updated annually through continuous survey efforts in
the future.
