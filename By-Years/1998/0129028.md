The research is for a continuation of a computational study of the effects of
complex magnetic fields on bulk crystal growth processes. In the project the
investigators are focusing on several stability problems that are important for
the growth of compound and solid-solution semiconductor crystals. There are
really two distinct, but highly synergistic, application areas are involved: (1)
Study the effects of rotating magnetic fields on vertical Bridgman or vertical
gradient freeze growth of solid-solution crystals such as alloys of germanium
and silicon. The investigators will develop the first stability analysis for a
RMF including the effects of the buoyant convection and the free surface that
are present in the actual process. (2) Study thermoelectromagnetic convection
(TEMC) for the magnetically stabilized growth of compound semiconductor
crystals. The investigators will develop a linear stability analysis to predict
the transition from steady to periodic melt motions with buoyant convection,
forced convection and TEMC. Both problems to be studied have the potential to
contribute to improved quality and sizes for advanced semiconductor crystals
that are important for optical and wireless technologies.
