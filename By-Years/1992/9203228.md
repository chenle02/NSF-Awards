The principal investigator will attend the IVth International Conference on
Fundamentals of Adsorption, Kyoto, Japan, May 17-22, 1992, to present a paper
entitled, "Effect of Combined Adsorption and Adsorption in Migration of Soil
Contaminants." This paper proposes a novel approach to understand and analyze
quantitatively the movement of soil contaminants in partially-wet soils. While
in southern Japan the Principal Investigator will also visit research colleagues
at Yamaguchi University, Kumamoto University, and University of Tokushima to
discuss adsorption-desorption processes that apply to environmental and
separations engineering. A report of this trip will be submitted to the
Interfacial, Transport and Separation Processes Program of the National Science
Foundation.
