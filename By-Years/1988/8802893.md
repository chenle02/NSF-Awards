This research focuses on the development of models and methods for statistical
analysis of biased, or incomplete, data. Problems will be tackled in three
different general research areas: (1) Estimation in Renewal Processes, (2)
Semiparametric Models in Selection Bias, and (3) Statistical Models for Cross
Sectional Sampling. This work in statistics aims at improving the tools
available for handling sampling bias and incompleteness in data acquisition. The
recent spread of the AIDS epidemic, and the behavioral issues involved in
sampling, diagnosing, and identifying patients present a pressing need for the
development of such methods for a variety of complicated biased-sampling
schemes. In developing the statistical models and methods, these issues will be
addressed.
