A preponderance of evidence suggests that chemsensory differences underlie the
behavioral isolating mechanisms which characterize related and evolving species
in the Drosophila mulleri complex. Behavioral observations have eliminated the
possibility of a major role of other sensory modes and strains of D. mojavensis
exploit the expected differences in cuticular hydrocarbons which are known to
function in courtship in other Drosophila species. Our understanding of the
reproductive isolation evolving between the different populations of D.
mojavensis will not progress until a fresh approach is developed. Dr. Markow
proposes to investigate this problem at a new level by characterizing the
cuticular lipids and evaluating the nature of what all present evidence strongly
suggests is their extensive involvement in the evolution of the mate recognition
systems in these species. Research activities will include a complete
characterization of the cuticular lipids of D. mojavensis with respect to their
ontogeny in adult males and females from two populations, and an assessment of
the influence of particular lipid classes on sexual behavior.
