The long-term goal of this project is to reveal how neuronal activity produces a
lasting change in synaptic transmission and subsequently alters the electrical
signaling in a neuronal network. One fundamental feature of the central nervous
system is that neuronal activity can modify the characteristics of the
postsynaptic response. This use-dependent change in synaptic strength may alter
information processing in a neuronal circuit and information storage within the
brain.

One of the proposed mechanisms for synaptic plasticity is that AMPA-type
glutamate receptors present in the postsynaptic membrane undergo dynamic changes
in response to alterations in synaptic activity. Alterations in the number of
AMPA receptors and in their phosphorylation state can change the amplitude of
the synaptic current and thereby alter the postsynaptic response. Recent work by
Dr. Liu and her colleague has shown that the repetitive synaptic activation of a
subset of AMPA receptors that are permeable to Ca2+ results in the rapid
appearance of Ca2+-impermeable synaptic AMPA receptors in a cerebellar
interneuron, the stellate cell. This switch not only reduces the amplitude of
the synaptic current, but also prolongs the decay time course of the synaptic
current. Interestingly, the reversal of this process, changing from
Ca2+-impermeable to Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, occurs after epileptic
seizures. This change may be involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced
neuronal death.

With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Liu will study the physiological
consequences of the activity-dependent switch in AMPA receptor subtypes. This
investigation could further our understanding of how synaptic plasticity may
alter input-output relationships within a cerebellar neuronal network that is
essential for several forms of well characterized motor learning. This study may
also increase our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying neurological
disorders associated with excessive activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors.
