The Department of Mathematics is developing a modern, shared computer classroom.
Improvement in students' understanding of mathematics, physics, and related
engineering problems is sought by taking advantage of the fabulous developments
that have occurred in computer technology. The principal means of achieving this
purpose are (1) the employment of technology- assisted learning throughout the
calculus sequence, within differential equations, and in selected upper-division
courses, (2) a fully integrated math/physics curriculum, coordinated with the
various engineering departments, and (3) an environment of cooperative learning
and, where courses are integrated, the use or team teaching.
