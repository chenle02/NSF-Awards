A short course in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry and Mass Spectrometry
will be offered to 20 undergraduate faculty. Participants will be chosen from
institutions which have recently purchased, or are in the process of purchasing,
this instrumentation. These techniques are the most widely used methods for
determining molecular structure in the modern laboratory. Often the faculty have
inadequate experience with the techniques and are unable to take full advantage
of the instruments in their curriculum. This course is designed to provide the
participants with indepth knowledge of the fundamentals and applications of this
instrumentation. The participants will be encouraged to utilize their experience
through the development of curricular modules. The curricular modules may be
used to enhance undergraduate education at their home institutions in these two
important chemical instrumentation techniques. Montana State University is
superbly equipped to offer this course. We have four fourier transform
superconducting nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers and five mass
spectrometers. The instructors have many years experience in teaching the
technical applications of these instruments.
