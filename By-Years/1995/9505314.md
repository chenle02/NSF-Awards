9505314 Kuzyk This proposal seeks partial funding for an international
conference on the topic of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters at
Kusatsu, Gunma, Japan, July 23-26, 1995. Travel funds are requested to support
U.S. invited speakers and Ph.D. students. The purpose of the meeting is to bring
together top researchers - whose expertise spans material design, material
characterization, device fabrication, and integrated device architectures - to
the intimate setting of a small town to discuss and assess progress in the
field. This upcoming conference is motivated by two previous NSF- supported
conferences that were held in Pullman, Washington in the summer of 1992 and in
Val Thorens, France in the Winter of 1994 (ICONO'1). This proposed meeting would
be the third in the series of meetings that we plan to hold every 18 months. The
demand for such a meeting was evidenced by full-capacity attendance of ICONO'1.
The strategy is to hold this meeting in those countries that are active in this
field. At the ICONO'1 meeting, U.S. and other non-European attendees had the
opportunity to learn about a large array of European research activities that
are normally not represented at U.S. conferences. ***
