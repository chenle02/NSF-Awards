9316435 Gilbert This research is the application of new modeling strategies to
problems in global seismology which have proven difficult to solve using
conventional techniques. The problems of concern are highly nonlinear and/or
have multiple solution minima, which makes gradient techniques unusable and
general search techniques prohibitively expensive. Developments based on
analogies with optimization in naturally occurring systems are leading to
practical algorithms which can efficiently search model space. This class of
algorithms includes simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary
programming. The algorithms will be applied to two specific problems:
spherically symmetric earth models from datasets of free-oscillation
measurements, and waveform modeling of 1-D and 3-D structure. ***
