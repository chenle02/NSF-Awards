This grant supports a study of small, compact features in quasars and other
active galactic nuclei through a series of multi- frequency observations
extending from the radio to gamma-ray emissions. This research will increase our
understanding of the mechanisms that govern quasars, the most distant and
energetic power sources in the universe. The grant also supports monitoring of
nearby clouds of molecular gas to search for variability in their brightness at
certain wavelengths that is expected as the interstellar medium of our own
Galaxy moves between us and background sources of radio emission. This study
will increase our understanding of the content, structure and distribution of
the gas in the Milky Way. This work, led by Drs. Alan Marscher and Thomas Bania
of Boston University builds the educational and research infrastructure of
astronomy by training new scientists in the technical skills needed to
effectively use the new VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array), which is now near
completion.
