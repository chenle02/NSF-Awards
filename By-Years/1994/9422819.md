The PIs propose to investigate risk perception and decisions under risk,
ambiguity and uncertainty in the United States, Poland, Hong Kong, and the
People s Republic of China. The investigation will occur at two different
levels. First, at the general cultural level, an analysis of proverbs and movies
will be performed in order to determine the overall cultural attitude toward
risk and the components of decision making, such as probability, outcomes, or
dread. Second, at a specific behavioral level, the PIs will examine managerial
decision tasks. This portion of the research will include the examination of
personality traits and situational factors which influence risk perception and
decision making. Scenarios will be included that cover a broad range of risk and
decision tasks, including financial, social, and political situations.
