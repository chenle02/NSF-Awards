This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Random Number Generation and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods". This
conference will be held at the Fairbanks campus of the University of Alaska
August 13-17, 1990. The principal lecturer is Harald Niederreiter of the
University of Vienna. His ten lectures will concentrate on (i) the theory of
quasi-random points and its application to computational problems in numerical
analysis; (ii) the theory of uniform pseudo-random numbers and its applications
to Monte Carlo methods; and (iii) the theory of linear complexity for pseudo-
random sequences of bits and its applications to cryptography. There will be an
overall emphasis on recent developments from these rapidly developing areas.
