This project, to be conducted by researchers at Florida International
University, will extend the research base and theory behind Modeling Instruction
(MI), a curriculum intervention for college-level physics. The project is based
on the idea that different teaching approaches in physics (MI versus traditional
lectures) will lead to different student knowledge, which leads to observable
differences in brain structures associated with physics reasoning. The project
will also examine gender differences in physics learning. This project will
advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in
studying the neural and cognitive basis of STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics) learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
use fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain activity,
focusing on brain regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus (all associated with fact
retrieval), medial and lateral prefrontal cortices and medial and right
posterior parietal cortices (all associated with reasoning). Additional neural
measures will assess functional brain connectivity, as a measure of neural
efficiency of reasoning. The project will also employ behavioral and educational
measures of intelligence, anxiety, and physics knowledge, including the FCI
(Force Concept Inventory).
