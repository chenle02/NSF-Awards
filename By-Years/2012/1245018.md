This award will support the development of innovative image analysis algorithms
for the direct detection of faint exoplanets in the presence of scattered
starlight from the host star. The research team will try a new interdisciplinary
approach, using ideas from computer vision experiments, with the goal of
reducing systematic errors resulting from incomplete modeling of background and
scattered light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to result in the
creation of a flexible pipeline for the analysis of exoplanets and other
objects. Codes from this project to the public will be released under open-
source licenses.
