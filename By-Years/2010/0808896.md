Title: Uncertainty-Aware Data Transformation for Collaborative Reasoning PI:

Abstract:

The ability to obtain insight from massive, dynamic, and likely incomplete
digital data is absolutely essential to those who collect these data for time-
critical decision-making. This research is developing mathematical formulations
for the quantification, propagation, and aggregation of such data to support
collaborative reasoning using visual means. The fundamental importance of this
research is to give analysts a more trustworthy view of data with the
consideration and incorporation of uncertainty due to data transformations and
the propagation of that information to the reasoning stage.

The process of visual analytics can be viewed as a series of data and visual
transformations. The investigators are studying the transformations that help
analysts discover structural relationships in large data repositories. These
relationships can express aspects of the data such as membership, inclusion,
overlapping, and bijective mappings between different data elements. Both data
collection and transformation steps, however, incur certain degrees of
uncertainty, some due to the transformations, and others inherently present in
the source data. Uncertainty can degrade the quality of the information.
Understanding and quantifying this uncertainty is crucial to collaborate
reasoning, which is the product of the aggregation of confidence levels from
several analysts. This research models such transformations and uncertainties as
a Bayesian network. Nodes in this network represent the transformations and
their associated uncertainty, and also represent the confidence levels of
different collaborating analysts. Aggregation of uncertainty between
transformations and among analysts is modeled using propagation laws and
conditional probabilities. Such a model results in a visual analytics framework
providing an explicit representation of uncertainty to enable analysts to assign
confidence levels to the gained insight. This framework effectively helps
alleviate the complexity of sense-making and visual reasoning.
