In this project, Dr. Czeslaw Jedrzejek of the Institute of the Jagiellonian
University, Krakow, Poland, will cooperate with Dr. Wiley P. Kirk of Texas A&M
University under the U.S.- Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research
"Transport and Structure Properties of Semiconductor Superlattices." The
researchers propose experimental and theoretical studies of GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs
superlattices and GaAs structures grown on silicon. In addition to the theory of
magnetoconductivity, they will do theoretical studies of GaAs and CaF2 epitaxial
growth on silicon, and a calculation of the diagonal conductivity for a strictly
2D system and the Hall conductivity for a superlattice in the quantum Hall
regime. This project in physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
benefit.
