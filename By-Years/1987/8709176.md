Soot generation in a turbulent flame is a simultaneous process of formation and
surface oxidation. It is difficult to understand this process unless these two
phenomena are studied separately. This study considers the behavior of a known
soot sample in a non-reacting turbulent medium. LDV, absorption and Schlieren
measurements will monitor the history of the soot in a typical propane
combustion experiment. The project should illuminate the soot generation process
in a variety of generating conditions such as different fuels, mixing ratios and
turbulence levels. This new understanding would facilitate fire detection and
control, as well as a combustor design.
