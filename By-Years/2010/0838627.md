In partnership with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the National Academy
of Sciences (NAS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
will convene two roundtable meetings in conjunction with the ACS National
Meetings in 2008 and 2009. The meetings will promote continued, multinational
dialogue on establishing effective programs for funding international
collaborative research projects in chemistry; and will also deepen the
engagement between the U.S. chemical sciences community, the ACS, and the
international Union.

These meetings will stimulate the further development of productive
collaborative activities between international research communities and help
advance the development of more effective mechanisms for international
collaborative research in chemistry. The meetings will be of widespread and
enduring benefit to the community.
