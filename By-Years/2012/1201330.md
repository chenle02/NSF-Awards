The PI will apply the theory of zeta functions associated to prehomogeneous
vector spaces to study the distribution of field discriminants. Research on
counting field discriminants dates back to 1857 work of Hermite, and is the
subject of recent breakthroughs by Bhargava and his collaborators. Bhargava's
work is essentially geometric in nature, and the PI will develop an alternative
approach, using Shintani zeta functions and analytic number theory. Although the
zeta function approach is not new, the PI and his collaborator Takashi Taniguchi
have developed a method which circumvents a technical difficulty with this
approach. This led to a resolution of a well-known conjecture on cubic fields,
among other results. The PI will further develop this method to study related
questions, including the distribution of quartic and quintic
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauss said that "mathematics is the queen of the
sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Number theory has
inspired and spurred on the development of many areas of mathematics, and has
also seen practical applications, for example in cryptography. Number fields are
a foundational object of study in algebraic number theory, which explains the
strong interest in studying their discriminants. In contrast, Shintani's theory
of zeta functions seems to have received inadequate attention, especially
outside Japan. The PI's work will further develop Shintani's theory, with an eye
towards solving open problems of broader current interest, and it will also help
to bring an active area of Japanese mathematics to the attention of researchers
in the United States.
