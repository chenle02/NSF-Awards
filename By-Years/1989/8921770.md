This new research program in computation physics will utilize the powerful new
computer architecture of the connection machine to develop new computer
algorithms to solve the Einstein equations for gravitation. Dr. Ove will use
these tools to study a variety of questions which arise in the dynamical
analysis of Einstein's theory of gravity. These questions generally involve the
relationship between initial data for solutions of Einstein's equations and the
behavior of the spacetime development of the data: Do singularities form? Do
horizons develop? Can the solution be sliced by well-behaved hypersurfaces near
singularities? Do solutions exhibit "chaotic" behavior? While these questions
are extremely difficult, they are of high interest to researchers in this field.
Ove's research will pioneer methodology for exploring these issues.
