This project is on the interface of probability theory and rigorous aspects of
statistical mechanics. The proposed activity aims at investigating the evolution
of systems with complex interactions, such as particles moving in a disordered
environment, cars navigating their way through traffic, the surface of a growing
crystal, or the boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the
randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact
or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim
of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To
have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads
in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of
getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is
known as the Law of Large Numbers.) Besides its impact on probability theory and
mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct
impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in
random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide
implications for science and engineering and thereby for
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is on the subject of random
motion in random media. Models in this field have been intensely and
concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists,
and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to
the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality
class. The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced
solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In
particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the
growth model with general weight distribution. The PI will work on generalizing
this existence result to positive temperature polymers, random walk in random
environment, higher dimensional models, and to the continuum setting of the
stochastic heat equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
