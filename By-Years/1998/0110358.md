&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will
develop a compact cloud spectrometer and impactor (CSI) for the measurement and
study of condensed water in the atmosphere. Condensed water includes cloud
droplets and ice particles. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of integrating
a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) for condensed water content (CWC)
measurement together with a new forward scattering spectrometer system for
measurement of the cloud droplet size distribution. This combined airborne
instrument will be considerably lighter than previous versions of the two
separate instruments, and easier to use. The objective of Phase II is a
commercial, integrated instrument for the study of atmospheric condensed water
content and droplet size distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accurate
measurement of these parameters is important in weather prediction as well as
understanding global climate change. This instrumentation will have worldwide
application, and the users will be government, university, and commercial
atmospheric research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
