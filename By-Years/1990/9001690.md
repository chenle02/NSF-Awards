The research objective is to improve the fabrication of optical fibers
(waveguides), by using aerosol doping. The proposed method involves the
transport and evaporation of an aerosol of solution droplets in the MCVD
(Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) and OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition)
techniques. The focus of this research is on the modelling fluid mechanics and
heat transfer aspects. The results will be included in previously developed
computer codes for the MCVD process. This work will be done in collaboration
with the experimental effort carried out at Brown University. The novelty of the
proposal consists in the way in which the mist is created by an ultrasonic
nebulizer and transported to the deposition surface. The new techniques for the
doping of non- volatile dopants into optical fibers have particular relevance to
the fabrication of fiber laser amplifiers for telecommunications purposes.
