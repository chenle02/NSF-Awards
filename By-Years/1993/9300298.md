The REU award provides support for three undergraduates working under the
principal investigator's supervision on problems related to differential
equations and numerical analysis. They will focus on oscillation theory of
differential equations with deviating arguments and on interative methods for
the numerical solutions of nonlinear systems of algebraic equations. Students
will be expected to write up their work and present it at professional meetings
where appropriate.
