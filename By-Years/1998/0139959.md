0130059&lt;br/&gt;Tabakin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research on predicting spin
observables in the photoproduction of mesons led us to an interest in the
general dynamics of spin, which is an integral part of the new field of quantum
computing. Examination of strong interaction dynamics led us to the subject of
nonlinear interactions. Therefore, the focus of our research evolved into two
directions; (1) the application and development of a new approach to solving
nonlinear equations and (2) the study of the behavior of qubits (typically an
atomic or nuclear spin system) and their role in quantum computing and
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel quasilinearization method has already
been shown, with Prof. Mandelzweig (Hebrew University), to yield rapid
convergence for a wide range of nonlinear Physics problems. We plan to combine
that method with a wavelet basis approach to examine nonlinear shock-wave and
soliton problems. Development of methods for treating nonlinear dynamics has
broad applications in many other fields, such as in biology and economics, where
effects are enhanced by dependence on higher powers of
interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Computing hopes to use quantum spin
effects to perform otherwise impossible computational feats. We will focus on
developing a computer simulation of a quantum computer. The time evolution of
the spin density matrix for a quantum computer will include quantum gates and
error corrections, plus the effect of the environment. The goal will be to study
the stability of a quantum computer under the influence of loss of quantum
coherence and entanglement. This will indicate the feasibility of producing an
actual quantum computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student researchers will
work in both of these activities, which provide excellent and broad training
that will lead to opportunities for them in many
directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
