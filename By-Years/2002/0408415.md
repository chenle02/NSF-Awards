In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. John T. Gerig of the University of California, Santa
Barbara will conduct research with his student and postdoctoral colleagues,
studying the interactions of small molecules with peptides, and the ways in
which these small molecules drive conformational changes in the peptides. The
research will be carried out through nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of
intermolecular NOE signals, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations.
Ultimately, the data garnered in these studies may fing applications towards
extending the shelf-life of peptide based drugs (e.g. insulin) and in industrial
processes that employ enzymes.

Besides the broader scientific impact of the research, the research will result
in the training student and post-doctoral researchers in a combined experimental
and theoretical research program. Results of the research will be made available
to the public on a website.
