Molvray 9629231 Understanding relationships among living things is useful to any
discipline associated with biology. Once relationships are known, properties of
poorly known organisms can be predicted from their better known relatives. Such
basic information is used in forestry, agriculture, and medicine. Relationships
among Gastrodieae, specifically, are of interest for two reasons. The first is
that relationships in the tribe are very difficult to reconstruct, and solving
this puzzle will increase our knowledge of good methodologies for phylogenetic
reconstruction generally. The second is that Gastrodieae occupy a critical
position at the base of the orchid family tree. Depending on the correct
position of those basal branches, higher branches in the tree_including
horticulturally important genera_may be realigned, thus providing us with a more
accurate picture of the evolutionary sequences in this important group.
