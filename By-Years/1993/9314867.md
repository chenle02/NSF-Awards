9315416 Sebo This awards supports the participation of seven U.S. scientists and
engineers in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Electromagnetic Field Effects Caused by
High Voltage Systems, scheduled for June 1994 in Sapporo, Japan. The co-
organizers are Professor Stephen Sebo, Department of Electrical Engineering,
Ohio State University, and Professor Katsuo Isaka, Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan. In addition
to the U.S. and Japanese participants, scientists from Malaysia and Sweden will
take part in the seminar. The seminar deals with a fundamental, complex,
scientific subject. Many key elements of highly advanced social systems are
sensitive to electromagnetic interference. The electric power generation-
transmission-distribution systems, computer-communication-information-control
systems of any kind, radio and television stations, national security, and
social institutions are examples for such elements. Electric power systems
themselves are also causes of electromagnetic interference. The seminar will
address these main subjects: (1) modeling, characterization, and evaluation of
the electric power system related to electromagnetic fields; (2) studies related
to the environmental effects of high voltage transmission systems, including
possible biological effects, human perception, and telephone system performance;
and (3) measurement techniques of electromagnetic fields covering a broad
frequency range, including procedures and standardization. ***
