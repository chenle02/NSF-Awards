Koch It is proposed to study simple atoms, hydrogen and helium, in strong
electromagnetic fields consisting of one frequency or two frequencies, without
or with added stochastic components (noise). Its objective is to understand
periodically driven quantal systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic, thus
addressing questions in the interdisciplinary area of quantum chaos. New
experiments will make a detailed investigation into the effect of stochastic
components (noise) added to the strong oscillatory microwave fields. A new
program of research will investigate the detailed behavior of low-pressure, dc-
biased, radio-frequency gas discharges as a nonlinear dynamical system.
