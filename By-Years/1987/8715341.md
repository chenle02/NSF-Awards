Salamanders use their cloacal glands to transport and store sperm during mating
and to produce pheromones used in interindividual communication. This research
represents the first comprehensive survey of the histology of cloacal glands.
Using novel methods of computer analysis, the results will elucidate ways sperm
maintenance and chemical communication have evolved in a group of vertebrates.
