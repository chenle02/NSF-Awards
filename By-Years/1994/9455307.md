9455307 Hartley Problem: Sending students to a local copy center to get copies
of class handouts is an inefficient, high cost method of distributing class
handouts. In addition, the full impact of algorithm animations cannot be
captured in snapshots on paper. Solution: This project is to transform some
operating systems and concurrent programming handouts into a hypermedia
laboratory manual residing in files accessible by Drexel students from any
network location. The files are written in Hypertext Markup Language and contain
hyperlinks to program source code, screen snapshots, and movies of algorithm
animations in MPEG or Quick Time format. Students use the Mosaic World-Wide Web
browser program to access the lab manual via Hypertext Transmission Protocol.
Since the Drexel dormitories are on the network, students are able to access the
lab manual from their rooms using their Macintoshes. Impact and Significance:
This is an innovative use of the university computers and network to make
handouts and other documents available to students in an efficient, low cost
manner. Students and faculty at other institutions on the Internet will also be
able to access this hypermedia operating systems lab manual.
