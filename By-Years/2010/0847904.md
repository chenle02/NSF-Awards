&lt;br/&gt;A National Science Foundation award has been made to the University
of Alaska Museum Insect Collection under the direction of Dr. Derek Sikes. This
award will provide funds to replace the insect collection?s aging compactor
units and unsound cabinets, providing a 25% increase in available collection
space. This upgrade will virtually eliminate dangers to specimens from pests,
relieve overcrowding, enable a consistent organization of the entire collection,
make specimens safely accessible, facilitate specimen data-basing and digital
photography efforts, and provide significant room for future growth.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Insects are fundamental to non-marine ecology, of incredible interest
to children and the public, and considerably impact human welfare. The insect
collection is a key component of the Museum?s public and educational outreach
program and is being increasingly used to understand Alaska?s poorly known
insect fauna. The collection has recently been used to support the development
of a field guide to the Insects of South Central Alaska and interactions with
the public have grown significantly since the hiring of the Curator of Insects.
This award will significantly enhance the value of this collection for both
science and education. One graduate student and two or more undergraduate
students will be hired and trained in collections-based entomology and public
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;
