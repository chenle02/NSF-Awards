This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Exchange of Genetic Material Among Plant Viral RNAs". The
Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in
traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training in new
techniques and to those trained in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to
gain experience working with plants. These fellowships are designed to increase
the number of outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
