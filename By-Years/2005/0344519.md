Most flowering plants depend on pollinators for reproduction, yet understanding
of plant-pollinator interactions in many plant communities is limited. In East
African woody savannahs dominated by several species of acacia tree, each acacia
species releases its pollen at specific, but different, times during the day and
insect pollinators closely track the pollen release patterns of the trees. The
goal of this study is to determine whether natural selection is acting to
structure pollen release times in acacia communities in response to competition
for pollinator services. The study will focus on one acacia species within the
larger community and will combine genetic analyses and field experiments in
Kenya to determine (i) the effect of different pollen release times and
pollinators on seed production, (ii) the importance of self-fertilization to
reproduction, and (iii) the distances over which pollinators carry acacia
pollen.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will enhance
understanding of how plants adapt to their biotic environment and how plant-
pollinator interactions could contribute to the formation of new plant species.
This study will bolster understanding of these interactions in a widespread and
understudied ecosystem that has great ecological and economic importance in East
Africa. The study will significantly enhance education of undergraduates in
ecology, genetics, and evolution at the PI's home institution, and in
particular, will broaden research opportunities for women and students of middle
to low socioeconomic status, who make up a majority of the PI's
students.&lt;br/&gt;
