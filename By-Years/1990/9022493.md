In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Meyer will continue fundamental studies of the
photochemistry of transition metal complexes. This work may provide a framework
by which our understanding of natural processes such as photosynthesis will be
enhanced. The principal goal of the work is to gain insights into the
fundamental details of how electron and energy transfer occur following MLCT
excitation and how they can be controlled by synthetic design. Studies of
electron transfer in the inverted region, including a detailed study of
temperature and medium effects, will be continued. New intramolecular redox
systems will be prepared which contain a variety of both electron transfer
donors and acceptors. A systematic study of the redox separated states formed by
the photolysis of these complexes will be directed toward the goal of maximizing
quantum efficiencies and lifetimes. Chemical systems will be assembled that
feature intramolecular time delays, in which the interconversion of two states
is mediated by a third, higher energy state. A final goal is the preparation of
a family of extended, ligand-bridged complexes which will provide a means for
studying electron transfer over very long distances.
