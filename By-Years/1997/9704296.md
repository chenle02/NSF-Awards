9704296 Dai This project deals with a variety of problems in the area of
spectral geometry and geometric invariants. The investigator is to study
manifolds with conical singularity with a view towards defining and
understanding certain geometric invariants such as analytic torsion in a more
general setting; to study the spectral geometry of degenerating metrics under
various processes including the adiabatic limit, and Riemannian collapsing; to
study geometric invariants and their behavior under surgery. Spectral geometry
is an area where often analytic techniques are used to study geometric objects.
This project in particular deals with defining certain geometric invariants via
heat equation techniques - the heat equation is among the more well-known
partial differential equations, describing the heat flow phenomenon, and much is
known about the equation.
