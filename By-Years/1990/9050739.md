The objective of this proposal is to construct a multi-purpose facility which
allows instructions in computerized measurement techniques through fundamental
experiments in fluid mechanics. The facility is a water channel whose design
allows for the study of external flows such as the flow around bluff bodies and
familiar airplane shapes. The design also allows study of internal flows such as
diffusers and nozzles through the insertion of false walls. Two measurement
systems will be initially used on the channel: hotfilm anemometry and laser
doppler anemometry. Both of these systems will incorporate computer-controlled
data acquisition and reduction. The selected computer system uses symbolic
programming in a language which is both powerful in application and simple to
learn. This facilitates simple modification of both the acquisition and
reduction modules by the students so that they may design their own experiments
and easily adapt the classroom experiments.
