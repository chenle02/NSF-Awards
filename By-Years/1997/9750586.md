This award equips a molecular modeling and computational facility that enhance
lectures, conferences, laboratories, and homework assignments throughout the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum: General Chemistry (Accelerated), Organic
Chemistry, Physical Chemistry (Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Chemistry),
Inorganic/Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Advanced Mechanistic Organic Chemistry,
and Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. In these courses, calculations are carried out
at one or more levels-semi-empirical and ab initio-depending on the course and
the complexity of the problem. In addition, the facility is used for several
research projects, involving collaboration between undergraduate students and
faculty who have theoretical components to their research. *
