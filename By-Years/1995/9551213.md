The aim of this project is to create a Computational Chemistry lab and to
introduce computational chemistry throughout the curriculum, via lab experiments
and problem-set assignments. The college is the purchasing a Silicon Graphics
workstation, eight Macintosh computers, a printer, and molecular modeling and
computational software. The lab experiments demonstrate computational chemistry
applications in general, organic, biochemistry, and physical chemistry. This
curricular innovation allows the college to expand the scope and depth of its
laboratory program, thus enhancing the level of preparation for science
students. An essential aspect of the curriculum revision includes the use of the
equipment in courses for non-science-majors and for lectures and demonstrations
in local primary and secondary schools. Curricular developments will be shared
with other institutions through lab manual exchanges, faculty interactions,
publications, and presentations at scientific meetings.
