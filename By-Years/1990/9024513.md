Professor Lim is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study the structure and spectra of van der Waals dimers, excimers,
and bicimers (doubly excited) of aromatic hydrocarbons for the purpose of
deducing the dependence of the structure on the nature of the electronic state.
Experimental techniques will include time- and energy-resolved spectra in
absorption and/or emission. A comparison of these intermolecular dimers with the
corresponding diaryl alkanes which are their intramolecular dimer counterparts
will provide spectral and temporal characteristics from which can be deduced
structural features and energetics of vibronic transitions for the three classes
of molecular dimers. Theoretical studies of the two interacting molecules as a
function of their relative orientation will be combined with the experimental
studies for a detailed characterization of these species. %%% The combination of
experimental and theoretical approaches is expected to lead to an understanding
of the dependence of the structure of the dimers on the nature of the electronic
state of the hydrocarbon and contribute to our understanding of energy flow in
these systems and the intermolecular forces that hold the pair of molecules
together.
