Mapping class groups and moduli spaces can be approached from several very
different directions: through geometric geometry, 3- dimensional topology and
hyperbolic geometry; through algebraic geometry (specifically the theory of
algebraic curves); and through mathematical physics via conformal field theory.
There are also interesting connections with arithmetic groups and representation
theory. There is often little communication between the various groups working
in this area, and the techniques and proofs of one group are often not well
understood by those in another. This grant will partially support a conference
whose aim is to assemble experts in these fields, together with graduate
students and young mathematicians from the various fields, so that the
participants can deepen their understanding of this area. This should result in
a good deal of cross-fertilization and progress in algebraic geometry. The
conference will be held in August, 1991, at the University of Washington.
