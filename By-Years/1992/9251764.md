The equipment augments a course which has two goals: to introduce students early
in their career to the nature of the scientific process, and to decrease
reliance on vertebrates in physiology laboratories. The unique invertebrate
experiments demonstrate essential basic principles and in some cases allow
students to see phenomena which cannot be easily demonstrated in vertebrates.
The exercises are designed to enhance critical thinking and quantitative skills,
introduce the use of micro- computers in the laboratory, and teach scientific
methodology. Students design many of the experimental protocols within
guidelines provided by the lab manual. Students write their reports as
"scientific papers" to acquaint them with the standard format of the scientific
literature and to enhance their written communication skills. An innovative
approach has been designed for distribution of the new physiology laboratory
exercises; instead of a traditional student lab manual, the material will be
disseminated via a combination of published papers, posters at national
meetings, and computer programs. Instructors can then modify the exercises for
their laboratory situations and create personalized student manuals suited to
their student populations and available resources. The equipment includes a sea-
water and environmental chamber, spectrophotometers, microscopes, osmometer,
centrifuge, oxygen monitors, recorders, myographs, pre-amplifiers, and computers
with printers and software.
