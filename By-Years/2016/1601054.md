The award supports the principal investigator's research in arithmetic geometry.
Arithmetic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies integer solutions of
polynomial equations and has played a central role in solving many outstanding
problems in number theory, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell
conjecture concerning the number of rational points on a curve. The main objects
of study in this research project are Shimura varieties, which are higher
dimensional analogues of modular curves that parametrize families of Riemann
surfaces. The study of Shimura varieties is at the interface of algebraic
geometry, number theory, and representation theory and has broad applications to
a number of far-reaching and influential conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
of the main topics of this research project concerns the arithmetic of Shimura
varieties. One part of the work aims to relate the Hasse-Weil zeta function of a
certain class of Shimura varieties -- those of Hodge type -- to automorphic
L-functions, establishing a conjecture of Langlands. Another aims to study the
structure of special points on these varieties and to show that, in certain
situations, every mod p isogeny class contains the reduction of a special point.
Other directions in the project include the Grothendieck-Katz p-curvature
conjecture, as well Diophantine methods for constructing algebraic cycles.
