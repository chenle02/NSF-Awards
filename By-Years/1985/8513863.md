This research program uses the combination of a sensitive, pulsed IR laser
spectrometer developed at IBM and a thin-layer electrochemical cell under fast
potentiostatic control to be constructed at Portland State University. With this
combination of instrumentation, it will be possible to measure vibronic spectra
of molecules adsorbed on electrode surfaces by using a grazing angle reflectance
technique. Changes in spectra following a step-change in electrode potential
will allow a detailed examination of kinetics of oxidation or reduction of
adsorbates as well as identification of intermediates. Time resolution of the
measurements is expected to be less than one microsecond (which is about one
million times faster than present-day instrumentation).
