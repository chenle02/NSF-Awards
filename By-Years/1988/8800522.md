This project will complete an international experiment started about seven
years ago, in which four physical models of the Aylesbury Experimental Building
in U.K. was tested in eleven wind tunnels from around the world. Ten more
facilities have now agreed to conduct additional tests, and all these
calibration tests will provide for the first time, a comprehensive evaluation of
the various techniques for physically modeling low rise structures, and give
estimates of the accuracy of predicting the various parameters used in
developing building codes for such buildings.
