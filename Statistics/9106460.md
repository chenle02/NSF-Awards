Traditional Bayesian inference has followed the paradigm of expressing
information and degree of uncertainty about the information prior to the
gathering of data, and then reexpressing the collective information and
subsequent degree of uncertainty after incorporating the data. Much of the
Bayesian research on a wide variety of statistical issues has used parametrized
functions in this paradigm. The extension of statistical theory and methodology
to broader classes of functions, or even to procedures, which are no longer
simply characterized by small numbers of parameters, requires extension of this
Bayesian paradigm. This research addresses several specific extensions of this
kind: monotone densities and monotone hazard rates and their extension to
spherical distributions, bootstrap procedures, and infinite-dimensional
parametric problems.
