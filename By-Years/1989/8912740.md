The objective of this project is to understand hydrothermal circulation at
young sedimented flanks of mid-ocean ridges. The program involves numerical 2-d
steady state modeling of circulation using different permeability values and
structures to attempt to model data collected from the Juan de Fuca Ridge in
1988, and participation in Canadian cruise in 1990 to get more heat flow and
pore pressure data in an nearby area of remarkably low basement relief. The new
data will then be integrated into numerical models. %%% Hydrothermal circulation
is a major factor in determining the heat and chemical fluxes through the
oceanic crust. The effect of basement relief on the circulation patterns is not
well known and this integrated program of modeling and field investigation of
the heat and chemical transport in this area will help clarify this
relationship. The principal investigators have already been involved in a
preliminary study in this area, and this is a logical extension of their work.
