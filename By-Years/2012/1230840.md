The proposed research seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for how to
collect and assess degradation data over the product lifecycle from design to
usage phases. The proposed framework will enhance both data-driven modeling and
physics-based modeling techniques outlined in previous prognostic research. By
using the coupled model scheme, the requirements for data quality and complete
product design information can be reduced. The scheme can be validated on a
critical rotary machinery component, such as a bearing, as well as for more
complex components and structures, such an electrical vehicle battery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work on developing a combined data driven and
physics driven model for fault prognostication has the potential to yield
significant cost reduction in manufacturing systems and processes. The work is
supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members
of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio. The center
has actively involved minority and female students in its research through
Research Experiences for Teachers and Undergraduates (RET and REU) projects and
will continue to do so through the proposed effort.&lt;br/&gt;
