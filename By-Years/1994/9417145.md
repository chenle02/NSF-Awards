9417145 Moody The goal of this research is an understanding of the role of
meteorological influences on the physical, chemical and radiative properties of
aerosols in the atmosphere. This is a collaborative effort involving a team of
atmospheric chemists and meteorologists who will study the behavior of aerosols
in the North Atlantic Ocean atmosphere using surface-based and remote sensing
techniques. This work entails analyses to quantify the continuous and dynamic
influence of transport and removal processes. We will prepare isentropic
trajectory analyses and will be prepared and combined with the chemical and
physical observations using cluster analysis and other statistical techniques.
This is part of an effort to relate the observed chemical and physical
characteristics to specific sources and source types. Remotely-sensed rainfall
and aerosol optical depth estimates prepared operationally will be used to
understand the sources and variability of aerosols in the North Atlantic area.
