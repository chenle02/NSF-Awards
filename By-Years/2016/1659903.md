Predictions of effects of natural and human emissions require global atmospheric
chemistry models. While such models are available they have not been tested or
validated with observations in sufficient detail. This travel support for
students, early career and senior experimental scientists will create a forum
for modelers to learn from observational experts on how best to evaluate and
refine atmospheric chemistry models. It promises to create a community where
modelers and experimentalists work synergistically to further the predictive
power of atmospheric chemistry. This strategy represents a paradigm shift from
the past where the two communities have been working independently. This project
will create a meaningful observation-modeling interaction that will enrich the
broader atmospheric chemistry community and also showcase and connect research
supported by NSF's atmospheric chemistry program. By bringing together senior
experimentalists and junior modelers in a targeted manner the meeting will serve
to foster scientific training and networking opportunities for the younger
scientists, thereby greatly enhancing their career development.
