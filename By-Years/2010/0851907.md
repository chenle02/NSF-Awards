This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry at the University of Southern Mississippi will provide a
diverse range of undergraduate research experiences ranging from nanomaterials
to organometallic chemistry to the biochemistry of carbon fixation. Recruitment
efforts will be both within the state of Mississippi and adjoining states with
special emphasis on attracting minority students. During the summer there will
be weekly research presentations and discussions of ethics in science, graduate
school and GRE preparation. Some professional development and social activities
will be shared with students from the NSF Alliance for Graduate Education in
Mississippi (AGEM) summer program for African-American undergraduates. The final
week in the summer will include submission of a formal report and a mini
symposium. A reunion of participants and mentors will be held the following
spring.
