9505595 Hautala In this project, the PI will collaborate in the deployment of
shallow pressure gauges in three straits of the Indonesian Archipelago, Lombok,
Alor, and Timor, in order to measure the throughflow transport, its temporal
variability, and surface temperature, and salinity. Work will be carried out on
an Indonesian research vessel in collaboration with Indonesian scientists. In
addition to the pressure gauges, a survey will be carried out using a towed ADCP
(Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) to level the pressure gauges and measure
ocean currents along the ship track. The work will be done in collaboration with
that to be proposed under ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for "Throughflow"), a
joint US/Indonesian study of the Indonesian Throughflow. ***
