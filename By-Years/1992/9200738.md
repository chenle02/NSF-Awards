This project involves basic theoretical research on electrical networks having
infinitely many branches. Presently there are far more unanswered questions than
established results in this area. The theory of transfinite networks - networks
obtained by connecting many infinite networks at their infinite extremities -is
in its infancy and requires further development. A method for solving linear
infinite grids with n-dimensional nonuniformities (n . 2) is needed. There is
presently no efficient way of analyzing infinite nonlinear resistive grids. The
same is true of infinite LRC networks, not to mention nonlinear ones. These and
other problems, if solved, would contribute to the advancement of our meager
knowledge of infinite networks, but will also have impact in several other
fields, such as exterior boundary value problem, discrete harmonic analysis,
classification of Riemann surfaces and operator theory.
