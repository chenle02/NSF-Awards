Neutrinos play an important role in many astrophysical scenarios. Neutrino
transport and dynamics is important in understanding supernova explosions as
well as the behavior of accretion discs which surround black wholes. This
proposal looks at how neutrinos behave when they are interacting in the presence
of a dense media. The PI proposes to investigate two main topics: (i) the
physics of neutrino flavor evolution in dense neutrino systems and (ii) the
physics of neutrino transport in accretion disks around black holes. The PI has
discovered the importance of flavor exchange forward scattering processes in the
presence of correlations of velocity and flavor distribution which can
significantly speed up flavor exchange in supernova simulations. The PI intends
to calculate the effects his new ideas about the physics of neutrino scattering
on supernova theory. The PI will also investigate how neutrino physics affects
hyper accreting disks in situations where Black wholes are gobbling up remnants
of stars.
