Improvements in numerical weather prediction are focused on two basic areas:
improvements in the model simulations and improvements in the initial
conditions. Initial conditions are derived from the observational database using
data assimilation techniques. Data assimilation requires observational error
statistics of the global atmospheric variables in question as well as forecast
error statistics. This research will focus on the part of the total observation
error that is due to the sampling pattern of the measurement related to the sub-
grid turbulence. Data from a 20 km horizontal resolution numerical weather
prediction model archive will be used to study the contribution of turbulence to
the variability of the error statistics for various measurement systems with a
view to replace current techniques that assume constant observation error
statistics with "adaptive" ones that are state-dependent.
