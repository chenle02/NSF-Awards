9424210 Sargent Faculty from Furman University and the University of South
Carolina-Aiken will cooperate to provide a nine-week research experience for
eight undergraduate geology majors each year. Students will be drawn from two
consortia of predominantly undergraduate schools in the southeast. All of the
research projects deal with some aspect of southeastern Appalachian geology. Two
involve geologic mapping in the Inner Piedmont and Carolina Arc Terranes, both
complex and poorly understood areas. The third tackles the problem of provenance
of the Middle Ordovician Bays Formation in east Tennessee and the history of
terrane accretion in that area. Although the filed areas are somewhat dispersed,
the students will meet at regular intervals to visit field sites, share research
ideas, build a common understanding of Appalachian geology, and discuss readings
in scientific philosophy and ethics.
