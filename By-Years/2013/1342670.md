The 2013 Maine/Québec Number Theory Conference will take place on
October&lt;br/&gt;5 &amp; 6 at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference
is held annually, at Université Laval in Québec in even years and at the
University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from
New England, Québec, and beyond to present and discuss their research, the
conference promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American
number theorists. The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees)
makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to
interact with leading researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website
