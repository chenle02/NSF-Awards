9401981 Robertson This award supports the research of Professor G. Neil
Robertson to work in combinatorics. Professor Robertson will continue his work
on the graph minors project in an attempt to provide better information on
finite graphs. The work will include an investigation into questions of
coloring, surface embeddings, finite structure, and connectivity of graphs. The
research is in the general area of combinatorics, in particular graph theory.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections can be organized. Graphs are arrangements of points connected by
lines. The behavior of discrete collections like graphs is extremely important
in modeling systems and plays a role in modern computing, communications and
operations. For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,
and the design of algorithms in computer science all use graphs in their
development, and make use of combinatorial research.
