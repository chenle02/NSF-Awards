Professors Epstein and Kustin are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue their research in the area of
oscillating chemical reactions. Reactions of this type are not only of an
academic interest, but are also of key importance in biological processes such
as those involved in heart function. Epstein and Kustin will conduct research in
four primary areas including: 1) The design of oscillatory reactions involving
new chemistry not typically found in current day oscillating reactions; 2)
Mechanistic investigations of oscillatory systems conducted both by experiment
and by computer simulation; 3) The probing of complex dynamical phenomena in
excitable media including spatial wave propagation, spatial pattern formation,
and light induced oscillatory behavior; and 4) The study of coupled oscillatory
chemical reactions. Professors Epstein and Kustin also plan to host Professor
Anatol M. Zhabotinskii from the National Scientific Center of Hematology in
Moscow, USSR, during the first year of this grant. Dr. Zhabotinskii is one of
the co-discoverers of the famous Belousov-Zhabotinskii (BZ) oscillating chemical
reaction which forms the basis for much of the experimental research in this
field.
