Britt Thomas of the University of Wyoming is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to investigate phospholipid tubule self-assembly and
phospholipid membrane-protein interactions using X-ray scattering techniques.
The self-assembly studies will explore the roles played by molecular tilt,
twist, conformation, and chirality in tubule formation. A comparative study of
various genetically-engineered, membrane-bound proteins will extend the X-ray
diffraction techniques used to elucidate characteristics of these more complex
systems. The education plan of this CAREER award involves the creation of an
interdisciplinary teaching program, in which two complementary upper level
courses are developed and added to the Chemistry and Molecular Biology
Department curricula. The hallmark of nearly all technologically useful
biomaterials is the self-assembly of highly-ordered supramolecular structures
from simpler components. Phospholipid membrane structures serve as the stage
upon which some of the most important processes of life occur, including many
catalytic reactions, protein production and folding, and photosynthesis. Results
from this study will be used to improve the understanding of lipid membrane
properties, and could subsequently impact the technological development of
membrane-based optical switches, molecular electronics, molecular sieves, and
chemical/biological sensors. The educational component of this award will
encourage collaboration among students and faculty in two separate academic
departments at the University of Wyoming, by enhancing cross-disciplinary
teaching and research efforts.
