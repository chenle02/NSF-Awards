The STEM Scholars (S2) Program is supporting approximately 125 scholars over a
five-year period. Students are receiving mentoring from senior-level STEM
students, career counseling and a hands-on undergraduate research experience.
All S-STEM scholars also have the opportunity to conduct outreach events to high
school students at several Houston Independent School District Science Magnet
Schools. The goal of this STEM-awareness initiative is to increase the numbers
of students enrolling in STEM fields at the college-level by providing role
models to underrepresented students. All program participants have access to
student counseling, financial aid, tutoring, and other supportive services.
Finally, all STEM scholars interact with professionals in the STEM fields by
visiting professional laboratory environments, attending professional society
meetings and receiving academic lectures from STEM professionals. The program is
being professionally evaluated, and program results disseminated through NSF,
the University and STEM-related channels.
