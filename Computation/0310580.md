This project seeks to develop a new class of higher order decomposition, or
split operator algorithms for solving both time-reversible (Hamilton,
Schreodinger, Gross-Pitaevskii) and time-irreversible (finite temperature,
Fokker-Planck, Navier-Stokes) evolution equations. For time-reversible systems,
these algorithms are automatically symplectic or unitary. Up to now, it has not
been possible to develop similar algorithms for solving time-irreversible
systems beyond second order because conventional higher order decomposition
algorithms all have negative time steps not implementable in time-irreversible
systems. Fourth and higher order forward time step algorithms developed in this
project can solve both types of equation with very large time steps, allowing
much longer time simulations of classical, stochastical and quantum dynamical
systems. The success of this project will provide a set of fundamentally new and
very powerful numerical tools for scientists and engineers to solve a variety of
problems with greater precision and longer simulation time than before. This can
impact the long term prediction of satellite motions near earth, the long time
dynamics of pharmacological macromolecules in solutions, the propagation of
electromagnetic wave in fibra cables, the response of atoms to extremely short
and intense laser pulses, the understanding of superfluid behavior in finite
systems as the temperature is lowered, the theoretical design of new materials,
and the use of Bose-Einstein condensate as a magnifying, detection, or quantum
device.
