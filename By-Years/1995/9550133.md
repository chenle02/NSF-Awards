The research consists of coordinated imaging and spectroscopic observations of
comets during perihelion passage. Images at 5-25 microns and spatially resolved
long slit spectra of cometary dust will be acquired with the mid-IR camera at
the Mt. Lemmon Observatory 1.5 m telescope, and with the new Long Wavelength
Spectrometer at the 10 m Keck telescope. Such a compete set of data has never
been obtained for any comet. The superior capabilities of the LWS at Keck will
allow us to observe the pattern of the dust emittance in close proximity to the
nucleus which determines the morphology of the whole coma. At Mt. Lemmon we can
study a larger field of view with longer temporal coverage which is important
for better understanding of the physical characteristics of nuclei and comae. We
expect to learn new details of the dust optical properties, composition, size
distribution and, finally, of cometary nuclei themselves. Interactive activities
include teaching of a high enrollment lower division Physics class, and upper
division course on a Solar System Formation. Other interactive commitments
include: inviting female speakers to participate in the astrophysics seminar
series, and initiating a new program using UCSD TV which broadcasts to 10.6
viewers over the local area. Interviews and panel discussion will allow resident
women scientists and visitors to discuss their research and other issues
relating to women in science.
