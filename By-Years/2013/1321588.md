This project is a geochemical study of volcanic rocks from the West Antarctic
Rift system. Its goal is to understand the link between mantle composition and
the diverse, regional geodynamic processes, which include uplift, rifting, and
volcanism. This project uses argon dating to time the processes, and isotope
geochemistry and melt inclusion studies to determine whether the area is
underlain by hot or wet mantle. The main broader impacts are support for a woman
graduate student, undergraduate research, and research infrastructure.
