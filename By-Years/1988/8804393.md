Selected undergraduates in the Southeast region will participate in ongoing
joint research programs in software measurement and evaluation at Clemson
University and Georgia Institute of Technology. This year- round program
provides the opportunity for participants to progress from closely supervised
tasks, such as administering tests to subjects, to more independent work, such
as designing experiments. Participation will provide students with the
motivation and skills to pursue careers involving empirical scientific research.
Students will be assigned to one of several current projects, which include: 1.
the development of a measure of the comprehensibility of programs, 2. evaluation
of the usability of software, and 3. evaluation of the influence of modular
design on maintainability of rule-based expert systems.
