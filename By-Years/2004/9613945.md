This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years for a wireless
system to connect seven school buildings in the five rural communities in the
school district to the existing wireless connection to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. An antenna is mounted on top of a grain elevator
to communicate with the schools.
