Low complexity dynamical systems include symbolic systems such as Sturmian
sequences and the Morse sequence; horocycle flows and other unipotent flows on
spaces of algebraic origin; rational polygonal billiards and related systems
such as linear flows on translation surfaces and interval exchange
transformations. In this proposal we consider questions which deal with the
relations between these different areas of low complexity dynamics. If we
consider a billiard trajectory and keep track of the sides that it hits we can
interpret the result as a symbolic system. We investigate symbolic systems that
arise this way. The study of such systems gives us a common ground in which
symbolic techniques and polygonal billiard techniques can both be applied. The
collection of translation surfaces of a fixed topological type forms a
topological space which we think of as a moduli space. This space has a natural
unipotent flow on it which is usually called the horocycle flow. We consider to
what extent does this flow behave like the unipotent flows described by Ratner's
classification theorem. In particular we consider the extent to which techniques
that work in the homogeneous case do and do not work in the moduli space case.

In physics, biology, economics and many other fields one studies the long term
behavior of mathematical models of systems that change with time. If these
systems are deterministic and autonomous, that is to say isolated from their
environment, then they fall in the domain of the field of dynamical systems. A
fundamental discovery of this field is that there are common elements of
behavior for systems that arise in different areas. There are for example common
features to "chaotic" systems. In this proposal we study a class of systems
which we call low complexity by contrast with typical dynamical systems which
are "chaotic" or "high complexity". This proposal deals with three families of
low complexity dynamical systems and the relations between them.
