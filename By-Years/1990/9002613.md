This award will provide funds to partially support a grant from the University
of South Carolina to do research on heavy, weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMP's) that might constitute the missing mass in the halo of our galaxy. For
this, they will employ cryogenic detectors that respond to the increase in
temperature caused by the energy deposition from nuclear recoil induced by
collisions with the heavy particles. The first phase of the research will be the
construction of an ultralow radioactive background liquid helium-4 cryostat and
the development of a superconducting granular detector. The detector will
consist of large arrays of superconducting sensors sensitive to the weakly
interacting particles. These developments will provide the feasibility study of
a new generation of detection techniques for weakly interacting particles in
general, e.g. solar neutrinos. This project will be a collaborative effort
between the University of South Carolina, the University of Maryland, the
University of British Columbia and Applied Research Corporation.
