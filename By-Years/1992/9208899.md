Research to extend the control of surface processes during molecular beam
epitaxy will be conducted. The approach is to use ion scattering from the growth
surface, allowing both ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), at low ion fluxes, and
controlled growth mode modification at higher fluxes. ISS provides composition
analysis of the first atomic layer of the surface providing alloy composition
control and control of layer thicknesses in the monolayer range. Glancing angle
ions, obtained using the ISS ion source, provide a unique method for tailoring
surfaces since shadowing effects can be used to focus ion energy at specific
surface sites. For example, impingement angles where energy is deposited at
surface defects, but not at perfect regions, can be used to enhance adatom
mobilities, flatten surfaces, or improve the ordering of surface steps. %%%
While molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has led to tremendous advances in solid state
physics and semiconductor devices, it is not optimum for device production. This
research seeks to better understand fundamental processes occuring during MBE at
the atomic level, and to overcome one of the major hurdles to the use of MBE on
a larger scale.
