A high performance liquid chromatography system will be used to teach principles
of HPLC to undergraduate science and engineering students at Manhattan College
and the College of Mount St. Vincent. The system will be used in four
integrated, upper-division laboratory courses. In these courses, students
develop skills and techniques in the analytical, instrumental, physical,
synthetic, and biochemical areas. Experiments are sequenced so that basic skills
are learned first, with a progression toward sophisticated, project-oriented
work in the final course. The project involves both the use of previously tested
protocols and the development of new experiments. Their object will be teaching
students the principles and applications of HPLC. Several specific
chromatographic modes will be used: normal phase, reverse phase, ion exchange,
and gel permeation. In addition, several types of detectors will be used:
UV/visible variable wavelength absorbance, refractive index, fluorescence, and
electrochemical. The curriculum is designed so that fundamental principles are
learned in the early labs, while students in the later courses use the HPLC as
an investigative tool for topics such as kinetics.
