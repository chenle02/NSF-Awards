This award, which is cofunded by three programs in the Division of Mathematical
Sciences (Analysis, Geometric Analysis, Algebra & Number Theory) and the
Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering, will
provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Fifth Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry"
that will be held from December 10-13, 2010, in Pucon, Chile. (Conference
website: http://www.geometry.cl/)

The focus of this meeting, like those of its four predecessors in this series,
is on geometric analysis, broadly construed. The special topics of emphasis for
this particular event are the following: Kleinian groups and Teichmuller theory;
the geometry of group actions; and algebraic curves and complex dynamics. The
format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to
speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities, especially
in the seven workshop-like sessions that the conference will feature.
