In this proposal support for a detector instrumentation R&D and an integrated
educational program is requested by a consortium of university groups. The work
is directed toward the design of the ATLAS detector to be in operation at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
Columbia University will administer the `umbrella` grant with subcontracts to
the other institutions. The participating groups will involve themselves with
particular subcomponents of ATLAS, chosen according to their scientific
interests and technical skills and experience. In this initial ATLAS proposal,
support is requested for a subcontract to collaborating group for construction
of part of the ATLAS tracking system.
