The goal of the proposed research is to investigate and define quantitative
mechanisms for several cause and effect relationships in the spray drying of
foods. The experiments and interpretation are directed toward identification and
quantitative modeling of the transport processes underlying the spray drying of
liquid foods. The phenomena under investigation include: changes in particle
morphology during drying; drying rate, particularly as influenced by changes in
particle morphology and by feed composition; rates of loss of volatile trace
organic substances, as influenced by the temperature/humidity field and mixing
patterns in the vicinity of the atomizer, and by changes in particle morphology
and feed composition; factors governing the temperature/humidity field and
mixing patterns near the atomizer; and mechanistic factors underlying stickiness
and agglomeration properties of the product. This work is a logical progression
toward defining the importance of the variables influencing the properties of
spray dried products: density, volatile retention and stickiness.
