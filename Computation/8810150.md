This research will consider three topics in high order and spectral methods for
the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Domain decomposition
for spectral methods will be considered. Results of this portion of the work
will make it easier to deal with complex gemetries. Techniques for using
spectral methods for shock wave calculations will be developed. The total
variation bounded spectral method will be reconstructed so as to retain spectral
accuracy away from the shock. Finally, pointwise order ENO schemes will be
generalized to two dimensional problems. Results of this work should find
immediate application in high-speed aerodynamics and other related physical
areas.
