The semantics of programs and reasoning about them are strongly influenced by
the adoption of rich type disciplines. This research concerns the relationships
between type systems on the one hand, and operational semantics, specification
logics, correctness proof systems, and denotational semantics on the other hand.
Particular attention is given to programming with limited forms of recursion
enhanced by rich type disciplines, and to automated reasoning (especially
rewriting techniques) about such programs relative to data type specifications.
Attention is also given to the problem of matching complex data models, in
particular object-oriented database models, with appropriate type systems for
data manipulation languages. The integration under a statically enforceable type
discipline, and in a uniform and perspicuous semantic framework, of class
abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, set manipulation, and persistence helps
to increase the reliability and maintainability of database software.
