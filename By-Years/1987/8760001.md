There is a need to develop a device which is simple to apply and easy to read
which will nonintrusively measure the moisture content of fresh and hardened
concrete, sand or soil. This project will investigate the feasibility of
developing the necessary device noted above using capacitance, microwave or
conductivity techniques to measure the dielectric constant which is related to
the moisture content.
