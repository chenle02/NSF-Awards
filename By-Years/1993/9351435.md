9351435 Moore Interactive, computer interfaced physics and chemistry
laboratories are being utilized for a guided inquiry and discovery approach in
the teaching of general introductory classes in physics and chemistry. The
laboratory centered approach to teaching chemistry and physics is intended to
attract students who have avoided traditional science instruction and to retain
students who would otherwise be turned off by such instruction by making
learning individualized, interactive, participatory, exploratory and visual.
This approach has been tested and proven to improve the learning, retention, and
application of physics and chemistry principles by promoting conceptual
understanding and relating the laboratory experience to the real world. At each
workstation the student determines strategies for solving a problem, chooses the
initial conditions and predicts the result of the experiment, and the
microcomputer will perform data collection, analysis, and graphing functions
and/or perform simulations of real experiments through interactive software and
videodisc technology. Because this approach is more efficient, students are
motivated to learn more by trial and error probing. ***
