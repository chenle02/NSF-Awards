This research investigates the cause of major earthquakes on the volcanic island
of Hawaii, a timely and controversial question. The seismic method is to record
on both permanent and temporary seismometers the waves from local and distant
earthquakes to outline the extent of the buried sediment layer at the volcanic
pile-ocean crust interface. If this layer coincides in depth with the low-angle-
faulting earthquakes observed in the Kaoiki Fault Zone, the results will support
the hypothesis that major earthquakes are slips along this zone. Because this
research deals directly with earthquake hazard, it is a contribution to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
