The goal of this project is to understand how hybridization and polyploidy, in
tandem, influence observed phenotypic patterns in natural populations, and how
pollinator behavior, through selection, reinforces such patterns. This study
examines 3 species of Indian Paintbrush that co-occur. In some locations,
however, hybridization has obscured morphological distinctions between the
species while in other locations species do not appear to hybridize and remain
phenotypically distinct. We hypothesize that hybridization occurs in populations
where the 3 co-occurring species have identical ploidy levels. In other plant
systems, differences in ploidy levels between species can create barriers to
reproduction. Plants from replicates of each type of population will be
genotyped with AFLP markers and ploidy level will be determined by flow
cytometry and chromosome counts. Pollination experiments in the field will
determine whether pollinators, as agents of selection, help produce or reinforce
observed patterns.

Hybridization and polyploidy have been instrumental in the evolution of most
plant lineages, yet how these processes and selection together influence
landscape patterns of phenotypic variability has rarely been studied. By
studying these two processes together, a greater understanding of their
respective roles in the evolution of diverse plant lineages will be achieved.
