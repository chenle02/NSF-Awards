To date only a few laser transitions in very short wave length of vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV) or soft X-ray region have been demonstrated. The main thrust
of the research is to establish experimentally controllable criteria to
ascertain the feasibility of XUV and VUV lasers. VUV transitions in the ionic
alkali halide excimers, with potential high output power, and XUV transitions in
doubly excited alkali atoms, promising the generation of coherent radiation
below 100 nm are being studied. For both systems pumping of the upper laser
levels by collisional energy transfer from excited metastable rare gas atoms is
being investigated. A second objective is the investigation of collisional
energy transfer processes from excited metastable rare gas atoms to inner shell
excited alkali atoms and ionic alkali halide molecules. Furthermore, the decay
of highly excited alkali atoms and alkali halide molecules is being studied.
