abstract- McCracken This applicant will investigate mechanisms involved in
signalling between organelles, specifically the ER-nuclear signal tdrasduction
pathway. This is a novel intercellular pathway that joins two topologically
distince intracellular organelles. The Em1p receptor in the membrane of the ER
functions as a senor of conditions in the ER and transduces this information to
the nucleus to activate a specific subset of genes. This proposal will test the
hypothesis that the ER-nuclear pathway serves to regulate ER-associated protein
degeradation. This will be analyzed by studying mutants defective in this
pathway and by analyzing the interaction of the ligand with the Emp1
receptor/kinase. %%% This project will investigate the mechansims of signalling
between parts of the cell, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum and the
nucleus. Results from this work will explain how a local signalling event alters
the types of genes expressed. ***
