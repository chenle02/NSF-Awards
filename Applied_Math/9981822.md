Bertram 9981822 The investigator uses mathematical models to study dynamical and
biophysical mechanisms for the multiple modes of bursting observed in pancreatic
Beta-cells. In pancreatic islets, Beta-cells burst with a period of 10-30
seconds, while isolated Beta-cells burst with periods of either 2-5 seconds or
1-2 minutes. The primary goal of this project is to answer the following
questions: (1) How does a single oscillator (the Beta-cell) produce such a wide
range of bursting behaviors? (2) What biophysical mechanisms drive the different
modes of bursting? (3) Why does the bursting behavior differ between isolated
cells and intact islets? To address these questions the investigator develops a
family of mathematical models that employ several slow variables. He studies how
well these models reproduce key electrophysiological and calcium imaging data
from isolated Beta-cells, cell clusters, and intact islets. Pancreatic Beta-
cells are the only cells in the human body that secrete insulin, a hormone
required by other cells to process sugars in the blood. If Beta-cells function
improperly then late-onset diabetes occurs, the most common form of diabetes.
Insulin is secreted from Beta-cells when the cells generate electrical impulses,
so understanding the electrical activity of Beta-cells is crucial to
understanding insulin secretion. For many years mathematical models have
provided insight into the complex electrical behavior of Beta-cells. In the
current project, the investigator develops improved mathematical models to
understand how Beta-cells produce patterns of electrical impulses that are key
to normal insulin secretion. Only when these normal patterns are understood can
abnormal electrical activity, and abnormal insulin secretion resulting in
diabetes, be understood.
