0240661 Abudayyeh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Michigan University for
research in the relatively new field of Construction Engineering and Management.
The objectives of this REU summer program include exposing participants to the
research process through independent research projects and providing insight on
the issue of ethics in the Construction Engineering and Management area. Ten
students will participate each year for ten weeks. The research in which
students will be involved will be in the following general topic areas, based on
the on-going research of faculty mentors: (1) Composite Materials; (2) Bridge
Management Systems; (3) Safety, Ergonomics, and Human Performance; and (4)
Intelligent Transportation Systems. &lt;br/&gt;
