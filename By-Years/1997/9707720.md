9707720 Erlandson This activity focuses on the expansion of the Enabling
Technologies Laboratory (ETL) at the university. The ETL is involved in the
execution of inter-disciplinary student design projects. These projects cover
many areas of engineering including robotics, computer science, and mechanical
engineering. The student projects are based on consumer/user needs for a range
of individuals with severe, multiple impairments to those with mild cognitive
impairments. The proposed projects include game packages with therapeutic or
educational content, multi-media language and mathematics assessments for pre-
school and early elementary school children, and a variety of sorting devices
and material handling systems for vocational rehabilitation. ***
