This is a proposal requesting partial funding for a series of the Current
Developments in Mathematics conferences organized by Professor Shing-Tung Yau
and other members of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The first of the three conference will be held at Harvard University
in the Science Center building in November, 2009. This series of conferences is
known for bringing together excellent speakers at the forefront of their field
as well as attracting a large audience from all over the country.

Mathematicians in the Northeast part of America benefit from such activities.
They come to participate and communicate with each other, and it is truly
interdisciplinary activity. The topics are wide-ranging, from mathematical
physics to computing to applied mathematics. People come to this conference all
the way from Europe and Asia, and it has been very fruitful for all parties
involved. The applications for funding are primarily for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows who travel from all over the country and many are female
students and minorities. Some graduate students can get enough ideas from the
talks to write their theses, and they can communicate with the speakers on their
research topics.
