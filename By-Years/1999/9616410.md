9616410 Carraher, David TERC, Inc. CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on
Learning Technologies: Visualization Research Center TERC, Inc. has been awarded
$50,000 for a 6-month period to plan a research Center for the study of
scientific and mathematical visualization. The goals of the center are: (1) to
undertake interdisciplinary empirical research on the technological development
and cognitive interpretation of visualization technologies; and , (2) to improve
K-12 math and science education by creating innovative visual curricular tools
and (3) to contribute toward a new conceptual framework on the role of
visualization in learning and understanding mathematics and science. To promote
a broad understanding of visualization as historically, culturally, and
psychologically grounded, the Visualization Research Center will draw upon
expertise not only from the natural and mathematical sciences but also from the
humanities and social sciences. Partnerships are being established with the
National Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Media Lab, the CalSpace at University of California-San Diego, Pennsylvania
State University, the Boston University Medical Center Hospital, and the
Cranbrook Institute, among others.
