9304217 Jacob This is a 3 year program of modeling and data analysis to study
the exports of ozone, reactive nitrogen oxides, non-methane hydrocarbons, and
carbon monoxide form the northern mid-latitudes continents to the global
atmosphere, and to assess the resulting anthropogenic perturbation to global
tropospheric ozone. The work will involve full-year simulations using a 3
dimensional chemical tracer model (CTM). The first stage of the project will
focus on North America and outflow regions. Specific issues to be addressed in
that stage include (1) the fate of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen oxides
emitted in the U.S., (2) the yield of ozone per unit reactive nitrogen oxides
emitted, (3) the exports of ozone and its precursors form North America to the
global atmosphere, and (4)_ the usefulness of peroxides as tracers of
photochemical activity. The second stage of the project will involve expansion
of the CTM to the scale of the extratropical northern hemisphere. Specific
issues to be addressed in that stage include: (1) the exports of ozone and its
precursors from Europe and Asia, (2) the yield of ozone per unit reactive
nitrogen oxides in the remote atmosphere, (3) the effect of human activity on
ozone levels in the extratropical northern hemisphere, and (4) the cross-
tropopause transport of ozone.
