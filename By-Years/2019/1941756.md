Establishing healthy eating habits and healthy social relationships are critical
to children’s well-being. This project tests the hypothesis that children’s own
decisions about what to eat are guided by what people from their sociocultural
in-groups endorse (rather than just by how foods taste and look). It also tests
the hypothesis that eating together can foster positive social relationships,
including between members of different sociocultural groups. Together, the
studies in this proposal will suggest interventions to improve children’s diets
as well as contribute new tools for reducing children’s
prejudice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developmental scientists have devoted little
attention to understanding children’s development in the food domain. The goals
of the present proposal are threefold: (1) to investigate how social information
provided by other people affects children’s food choices; (2) to test how eating
together impacts children's social attitudes – including toward people who are
different from themselves; (3) to analyze how children's exposure to diversity
affects their evaluations of food and people. To study these questions, the
project uses methods and theories from social cognitive development and applies
them to the food domain. Study 1 tests the effects of learning about other
people's foods preferences on children's food evaluations and behavior. Studies
2 and 3 test the effects of eating together on children's liking of other
people, including evaluations of people from different sociocultural groups.
Senior researchers will mentor women and students from underrepresented
backgrounds in research. The present proposal will include, and benefit from,
the full participation of such individuals as scientists involved in each of the
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
