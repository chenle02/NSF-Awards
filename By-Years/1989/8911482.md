This award provides funds for the construction of a greenhouse and for the
refurbishment or acquisition of other equipnment needed for the growth and
experimental manipulation of plants. The equipment will facillitate the
undertaking of long term experiments that require the growth of plants or
(plant) tissue cultures under well-defined conditions of temperature and light.
The recent development of techniques that permit studies of the structure and
regulation of genes at the molecular level has stimulated renewed interest in
studies of plant gene regulation and plant development, and has added a new
dimension to the study of plant genetics. Frequently, a crucial element in such
studies is the ability to grow large numbers of plants under highly controlled
conditions of light and temperature. Furthermore, the use of plant tissue
cultures in such studies requires not only well controlled growth facilities
but, in addition, the use of aseptic work areas that permit innoculation and
transfer of cultures without the risk of cantamination by bacteria and fungi.
The greenhouse and related equipment purchased through this award will satisfy
these requirments for a group of outstanding plant scientists at Yale
University.
