This project combines dynamical systems theory and computational topology in
constructing and utilizing rigorous numerical techniques for the study of
dynamics in model systems. The primary focus is on constructing, extending and
optimizing rigorous numerical techniques and investigating additional settings
where computational topology may be used effectively to measure dynamical
systems. When possible, the computational results are verified rigorously,
typically through the incorporation of error bounds and the use of topological
tools. The proposed projects include extending existing techniques for computer-
assisted studies and proofs for discrete time dynamical systems and forcing
theorems for braided stationary solutions. Two more sets of projects are
proposed in areas where the desired rigorous results are still out of reach,
although some initial progress has been made. These include measuring parameter
sets for systems in a specified family which exhibit chaotic behavior, and the
study of spatial and spatio-temporal pattern formation and evolution using
computational homology. There are many open research projects in these areas
(both shorter and longer term) including the study of some very interesting and
fundamental modeling questions concerning appropriate spatial and other scales
in models. This grant will fund a teacher-researcher postdoctoral position,
undergraduate research projects, and support teaching and research group
activities.

Dynamical systems models are being used throughout society. Some examples
include weather models used for hurricane prediction and population models used
to study environmental effects on population size and persistence. Currently,
many researchers study dynamical systems like these using high powered computer
simulations and statistical techniques. On the other end of the spectrum,
mathematicians have been able to decipher highly complicated dynamics in more
abstract mathematical models. The work described in this proposal aims to serve
as a bridge between these two approaches. More specifically, the investigator
and her collaborators focus on the development of computational techniques that
use sophisticated mathematical tools and yield mathematically rigorous results.
The mathematical tools come from the fields of algebraic topology, analysis,
numerical analysis, and dynamical systems theory and may be used to decipher
some of the phenomena of interest in the studied systems. Prior progress in
studying complicated dynamics in models from population ecology and heat
convection motivates these continued studies. In addition to continuing work
with existing collaborators, the investigator will mentor a postdoctoral
teacher-researcher and advise undergraduate research projects in these areas.
