The complexity of integrated circuit chips such as those used in computers is
such that it is becoming extremely difficult to interconnect the various points
with wires or even thin lines of metal evaporated onto the chip itself. One way
which has been proposed to circumvent this complexity problem is the use of
light propagating freely around the chip. To accomplish this it is necessary to
bring together optics and integrated circuits, namely to place generators of
optical beams and detectors of them at various places on the chip. This involves
materials and device problems which are to be considered by the effort proposed.
A breakthrough in this area could result in a new generation integrated circuits
with more functions integrated within the same chip. An award is recommended.
