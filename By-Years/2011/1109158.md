This award will support is an observational study of chromospheric activity in
young solar-type stars. Dr. Gray and his students will conduct long-term
spectroscopic monitoring of the chromospheric fluxes in the cores of the Ca II H
&amp; K lines, coupled with simultaneous and high-cadence multi-band photometric
observations of these stars. The principal goals are to explore the timing and
size of starspot cycles, discover correlations between activity levels and
stellar brightness, uncover the presence and character of short-term behavior
such as flare activity, and investigate the influence of Jupiter-mass planets on
stellar activity levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will to provide hands-
on research opportunities at an institution whose students are mainly from a
rural population in an under-served region of the United States. The research
will may also help improve our understanding of the Sun-earth environment at a
time 3-4 billion years ago when life was gaining a foothold on our planet, and
aid in the assessment of the possibility of life in other planetary systems
around sun-like stars.
