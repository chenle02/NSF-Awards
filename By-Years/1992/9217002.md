A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to investigate the
structure of the molecular boundary just beneath the air-sea interface and the
effects of wave and surface active films on mass exchange processes. Newly
developed chemical, optical aand image- processing technologies will be used to
make the necessary detailed observations.
