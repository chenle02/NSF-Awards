The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 requires the Interagency Arctic
Research Policy Committee to prepare a biennial revision to the Arctic Research
Plan. Integral to this revision are statements of accomplishments by federal
agencies over the past two years and their plans for the following two years.
This project provides for The Minerals Management Service to convene a meeting
of federal scientists to exchange information on recent accomplishments and
future plans. Representatives from some 12 agencies within and outside Alaska
are expected to participate. The meeting will be open to the public. Results of
the workshop will be included both in the Plan's revision and the interagency
journal, Arctic Research of the United States.
