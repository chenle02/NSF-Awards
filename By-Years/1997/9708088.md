This collaborative research project represents one of the first comprehensive
biological process studies to be carried in the Arctic Ocean over a full annual
cycle. Investigators from Oregon State University, the Canadian Dept. of
Fisheries and Oceans, and from other U.S. institutions will use a Canadian
icebreaker as home base for a 14-month period to study the seasonal cycle of
biological production and respiration, and the seasonal cycle in biomass of
algae, bacteria, protists, and zooplankton, in the central Arctic. The research
program will be organized around continuous measurement of dissolved oxygen
concentration in the upper water column. Dissolved oxygen content integrates the
sum of production and respiration in both the water column and in the overlying
sea ice. Continual monitoring of dissolved oxygen will allow detection of the
initial spring increase in primary production, and of transient algal blooms,
that may be missed by a discontinuous sampling program. Concentration of
inorganic nutrients in the upper 100 m, concentration of dissolved and
particulate organic matter in the water and in sea ice, biomass of autotrophic
and heterotrophic organisms in the water column and sea ice, uptake rates of
carbon and nitrogen by phytoplankton, and respiration rates of the planktonic
community, will be analyzed at least weekly. The seasonal study of
production/respiration processes will provide valuable information regarding: 1)
the present structure and function of central Arctic ecosystems, which can serve
as a baseline for evaluating the impact of future global change processes in
this sensitive region; and 2) the nature and timing of production and
respiration processes in a high latitude system and in particular how the
heterotrophic community survives during the dark winter months.
