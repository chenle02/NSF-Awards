Due to the eight year drought in the western United States, the water line for
Lake Powell has dropped to a record low exposing the delta developed over the
last 37 years at the upstream entrance of the Colorado River into the lake. This
provides a short term and unparalleled opportunity to study the processes of
sediment deformation caused by lake-level fall, the response of a large river to
a significant base level drop over a short period of time, how sediments are
transported from the delta to the lake, and to establish a base line of the
distribution of sediments at the delta. PIS plan to involve a multidisciplinary
group of scientists to investigate this ephemeral opportunity.
