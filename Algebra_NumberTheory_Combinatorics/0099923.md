This proposal is for research into three areas of current interest in
noncommutative algebra. First the PI plans to study the enveloping algebra of a
classical simple Lie superalgebra. Specifically he is interested in primitive
ideals and problems concerning the center of the enveloping algebra. Secondly
the PI intends to investigate differential operators on toric varieties and maps
between toric varieties arising from refinements of fans. Finally the PI
proposes the study of certain finite dimensional Hopf algebras arising from
quantized enveloping algebras of classical Lie superalgebras. The methods to be
used come from representation theory and algebraic geometry.

This research is concerned with some particular aspects of modern abstract
algebra, as an area of mathematics. In recent years a number of algebraic
constructions have been increasingly important in Physics. These include Lie
superalgebras and quantum groups, two constructions which will be investigated
in this proposal. It is a widely held belief that a better understanding of the
algebraic structure of these objects could lead to further significant advances
in Physics.
