The Engineering Leadership Pathway Scholars 2 (ELPS2) project at San Jos√© State
University (SJSU) is awarding annual renewable scholarships to academically
talented, financially needy undergraduate engineering students. The five-year
program is generating 30 to 36 future engineering leaders who can serve as role
models for other students and be leaders in the 21st century workforce.
Scholarship recipients form a cohort of students engaged in personal leadership
development activities in parallel with their academic development. With the
support faculty and peers mentors and student-led Leadership Teams, ELPS2
scholars develop their own visions of leadership and emerge with personal and
professional goals that enable them to make the best of their own talents as
well as be prepared to tackle the challenges that face the nation's technical
leaders. Intellectual merits of the program lie in the comprehensive nature of
the program.

The ELPS2 program is recruiting a diverse applicant pool (many of whom are
underrepresented in STEM or who are first generation in college), and providing
U.S. industry with engineers who have practiced leadership skills. The ELPS2
program is meant to serve as a model for leadership development throughout the
SJSU College of Engineering. The project is evaluating the effectiveness of
programs for developing leadership characteristics so that the College of
Engineering can institutionalize and sustain leadership programming. Lessons
learned are being disseminated through the California Engineering Liaison
Council, conferences, presentations, and archived articles, and used to expand
the ELPS2 program to all interested SJSU engineering students. Dissemination of
the lessons learned along with the contribution of the program to a qualified
workforce is the major broader impact of the program.
