This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Adaptive
Behavior and Evolution as Mechanisms of Population Stability" for Candace Low.
The host institutions for this research are Cornell University and Simon Fraser
University and the sponsoring scientists are Profs. Stephen Ellner and Bernard
Roitberg, respectively.

Population dynamics can be influenced by "adaptive evolution", or the process
that allows populations to become better suited to their environment. However,
the explicit incorporation of adaptive evolution is often ignored in populations
dynamics models because the timescale at which evolutionary change occurs is
considered to be beyond the scope of our lifetimes, or "ecological time". The
research combines the use of computational techniques and a long-term data set
collected on a leaf-mining moth called the Tupelo Leafminer (Antispila
nysaefoliella), which is parasitized by numerous species. The resulting models
will indicate if the Tupelo Leafminer is evolving in response to the presence of
parasitoids.

The training objectives include theoretical modeling, integration of general
principles of evolutionary and ecology theory, and application of a rich data
set from an insect population. The broader impact of the modeling will help the
general public to understand the importance of adaptation in structuring natural
communities and lead to the design of safe and effective biological control
methods for pest management. Educational impacts include training for the Fellow
who will mentor women and minority students through the NSF-funded Research
Experience for Undergraduates and local programs that focus on ecological
sustainability.
