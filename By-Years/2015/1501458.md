This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "SEAM 2015--The 31st Southeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held
March 8-9, 2015, on the campus of the University of Georgia.

This event is the latest in a thirty-year-long series that has hosted
conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of mathematical analysis and
that has become the leading venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator
theory. SEAM 2015 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring four
plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (Brett Wick),
harmonic analysis (Ciperian Demeter), geometric combinatorics (Joshua Zahl), and
harmonic analysis and number theory (Lillian Pierce). The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
