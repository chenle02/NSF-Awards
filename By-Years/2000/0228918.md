Bethune-Cookman College (B-CC), a historically black college, is an
internationally respected undergraduate liberal arts and sciences college.
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) is the world's oldest, largest, and
most prestigious university specializing in aviation and aerospace and granting
undergraduate and graduate degrees. This project is a unique collaboration
between these two diverse institutions to facilitate meritorious research by
connecting to Internet 2 in a cost effective manner. Bethune Cookman College
(B-CC) and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) will share costs for a
DS-3 (45Mbps) data circuit to Internet2. B-CC will be the aggregation point and
will then connect thru University of Central Florida to the University of South
Florida gigaPOP where the Internet2 peering will occur. The purpose of the
connection is to assist and expand current research in biology (B-CC),
meteorology and air traffic management (ERAU). The project also provides state-
of-the-art research accessibility to a traditionally underrepresented
population, i.e. scientists, students, and educators at historically black
colleges (B-CC).
