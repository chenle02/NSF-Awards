9410038 Haltiwanger This conference is organized by the National Bureau of
Economic Research, and it focuses on measurement issues in labor statistics. The
specific aim of the organizers is to bring together economists and statisticians
from a wide variety of backgrounds to address current issues in the labor
market, such as, earnings inequality, employee compensation, employment and
unemployment patterns, etc. This conference is of significant interest given the
recent attention at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in designing long-term survey
instruments to collect information on the link between workers and employers.
