The goal of the proposed research is to develop a multithreaded prototyping
environment that allows hardware and software experimentation with fine-grain
and speculative multithread chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures. This
environment will allow the analysis of single-chip fine-grain threaded systems
at full hardware speeds in a much more flexible manner than is possible today
with software simulation, and will be the first hardware implementation to
execute speculatively multithreaded applications. This environment would be used
to investigate threaded applications much more efficiently and thoroughly than
any other system existing today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototyping
environment will be built without doing any VLSI design. The key idea is that by
combining ten-year-old microprocessor chips with state-of-the-art FPGA chips it
is possible to build a single-board multiprocessor prototyping environment that
provides support for thread level speculation (TLS) and operates at hardware
speeds, yet has the latency and bandwidth characteristics equivalent to a modern
CMP architecture. Such an environment will be ideal for architecture and
software research on multithreaded microprocessors
