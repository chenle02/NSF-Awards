The nation's maintenance and rehabilitation needs have created a demand for
rapid, accurate, comprehensive, and economical methods for surveying the in-situ
condition of the streets and highway pavements. This project will investigate
the management of measurement problem in terms of the available sensory input
and desired output. The collection and assessment of the pavement data is a
critical element in highway management. The management procedure to be developed
will include knowledge representations, inference mechanisms, and data and user
interfaces. The results will be of benefit to State and Federal highway
managers.
