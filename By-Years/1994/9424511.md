This is a renewal grant from a group of condensed matter theorists who are
applying advanced theoretical techniques to investigate condensed matter systems
with strongly coupled degrees of freedom. The following areas will be studied:
quantum Hall and other strongly correlated Fermi systems; superfluids and
crystalline liquids; amorphous macromolecular and related vitreous materials;
and mesoscopic Luttinger and superconducting systems. %%% This theoretical
research deals with a wide variety of problems relating to condensed matter
physics and materials research. The work will use state-of-the-art techniques to
contribute to research ranging from a microscopic model of rubber to the
behavior of ultra-small electronic structures. The work will contribute to basic
condensed matter physics and to the understanding of real materials.
