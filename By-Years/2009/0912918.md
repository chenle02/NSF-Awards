This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the problem of
finding and analyzing information within emails and files. This problem is
particularly felt by knowledge professionals and enterprises that want to
leverage growing email archives for business or discovery. A new user interface
that works with existing search engines and databases, and enables the user to
search email more naturally will be investigated. The approach enables the user
to: search by who-when-what, receive real time feedback while constructing a
query, select which results to keep or discard from the view, and merge items
from different queries.

Email is a primary conduit for business communications and document
transmission: an increasing number of professionals and enterprises retain email
instead of deleting it, either to build new knowledge or for regulatory
compliance. Providing superior user interfaces to email search will
significantly enhance the ability of professionals and enterprises to
successfully find information, reduce time spent in searches, increase the
ability to analyze and discover archives, build new knowledge and business, and
cut costs. If successful, the technology holds the promise to apply to other
search problems databases, social networks, blogs, and the web as well.
