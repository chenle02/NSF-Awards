9418362 Hutchison This starter grant award to the University of Oregon will
support the research of Professor James E. Hutchison. The theme of the research
will be the synthesis of functional ion channel models based on polypeptide-
supported poly(crown ethers). The polypeptide serves to align stacks of crown
ethers that form the pore. The unique property of this ion-channel model is the
ease with which the model's structure can be systematically varied to probe the
dependence of ion transport through the channel with the structure of the
channel. The channel's inside diameter, the molecular composition of the
channel's lining, the length of the channel, and the separation between crown
ethers within the polymer will be varied to give structurally well-defined ion
channel models. The nature of the ion transport through these ion channels will
be tested by imbedding them in planar lipid bilayers and measuring the ion
fluxes through them as a function of ions in solution and transmembrane
potential. Ion channels selectively mediate ionic transport through cell
membranes and play a major role in shaping biological electrical impulses. This
research will advance the fundamental understanding of the structure/function
relationship.
