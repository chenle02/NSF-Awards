This work is developing Phase II of the Mesolore Project, a two-phase
educational-software effort. Phase I, completed in 2001, resulted in Mesolore:
Exploring Mesoamerican Cultures, an exemplary, multimedia resource of
interdisciplinary course materials for undergraduates. Phase II is a three-year,
dissemination effort to facilitate creative classroom adoption and to promote
Mesolore as a change agent for college pedagogy. The problems the project
addresses are centered on faculty professional development. This includes
closing the gap in social science pedagogy between the potential of multimedia
technology and its classroom adoption, and expanding the practice of
interdisciplinary teaching. Phase II consists of three parts: (1) writing and
classroom implementation of a user's guide for teaching with Mesolore; (2)
holding a series of professional development workshops and poster sessions; and
(3) building a faculty community. Collectively, these introduce faculty to new
scientific content for undergraduate teaching, promote effective educational
practices, and improve classroom teaching. The goals of this project are to
encourage the wide adoption of Mesolore, to improve the quality of college
education, and to encourage more Latinos, Native Americans, and women to see the
interconnectedness of science and humanities.
