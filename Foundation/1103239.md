We are requesting funding to support US participants, particularly graduate
students and recent Ph.D.s, to attend the international workshop Recent
Developments in Model Theory that will be held June 5-11 in Oleron France. One
of the objective of this workshop will be to bring researchers in Model Theory
and some other areas together to present and discuss problems as well as some
recent advances in these areas and thereby facilitate further interactions.
Another goal of the workshop is to provide an informal setting where graduate
students and younger researchers from US can learn about new trends and interact
with one another as well as with prominent mathematicians.
