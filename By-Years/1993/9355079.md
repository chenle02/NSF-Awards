Applicants to Arizona State University's graduate programs in Chemical
Engineering have expressed increasingly strong interest in environmental topics.
A graduate training/research program is described in the focus area of
Environmentally Friendly Technology, emphasizing Environmentally Benign Chemical
Processing. Arizona State University's existing expertise, experience, and
interest in environmental aspects of chemical engineering provide the necessary
research and teaching base from which to pursue this new area of graduate
training. A program in Environmentally Benign Chemical Processing will utilize
both traditional chemical engineering training - process engineering,
optimization and control - and newer, more specialized topics including air and
water quality measurement, recycling technologies, hazardous materials handling,
and risk assessment. Topics including point-of use abatement, sensor technology,
shared load separations, process integration for pollution prevention, and
biosynthesis will be the basis of the trainees' research experience. Local
industry will support this effort: Motorola has agreed to provide seminar
speakers, advise on coursework development, and begin planning for internships
in appropriate areas within the company. Existing and new courses and activities
will comprise the teaching component of the program. Minority recruiting
activities through the Coalition to increase Minority Degrees will include
faculty visits to schools and applicant visits to ASU. A structured program of
peer and faculty mentoring will promote student retention.
