The focus of this Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is to assess the current
state of the art and future challenges in the development and application of
quantitative methods for modeling and experimental characterization of the
dynamical evolution of metal structures over multiple length and time scales.
Invited presentations will cover topics in five main areas: 1. In-situ
measurement and modeling approaches for characterizing the evolution of
microstructures; 2. Experimental and theoretical investigations of deformation
microstructures; 3. The dynamics of phase transformations; 4. Modeling and
experimental characterization of irradiation-induced evolution of metal
structures; 5. The impact of advances in dynamical modeling and in-situ
characterization techniques on the design and optimization of advanced alloy
materials for applications ranging from energy generation to transportation. The
GRC will be preceded by a Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GRS), which will
provide a forum for fostering interactions and networking among graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows. The GRS provides a mechanism for engaging
students in the GRC meeting. NSF funds will be used in to assist graduate
students, post-doctoral researchers, young faculty and invited speakers in the
form of registration waivers and travel support. Attendees generally come from
industry, academia and government and have a variety of technical interests. The
organizers target the participation of women and underrepresented groups.
