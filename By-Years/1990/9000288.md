The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. John S.
Dahler of the University of Minnesota and Dr. Andrzej Ziabicki of the Polish
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Fundamental Technological Research is to
develop theory for various aspects of the physics of polymeric systems. Four
areas will be emphasized: 1) Statistical theories of polymeric networks, 2)
Statistical physics of liquid crystals, 3) Theoretical rheology of non-Newtonian
fluids, and 4) Dynamics and diffusion of polymers and macromolecules. Results
should yield new information on the relationships between macroscopic elastic
properties and microscopic forces that bind polymer beads. Further, insights
should be gained on the influence of factors such as electric and magnetic
fields. In the course of their work, the researchers intend to extend the theory
of rod polymers to solutions of rods equipped with permanent magnetic moments,
and they hope to improve existing theories on polymer dynamics. This project in
polymers research fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
