This project designs and implements programmable system elements to be run
within the anonymity networks, such as Tor (The Onion Routing network). The
central idea is that users can inject new code into the network that is then run
within a protected execution environment. The motivation is to enable the
creation of new and significantly enhanced anonymity services, such as content
distribution networks, of use in today's and future anonymity networks. The
project carries potential to demonstrate that an anonymity communication
network, such as today's Tor network, could deliver a much larger range of
services that could greatly enhance the potential range of offerings over
secure, anonymous networks, motivating further
developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has four main and
original thrusts: (1) Programmable Tor middleboxes,&lt;br/&gt;(2) Censorship-
resistant hidden services, (3) Hidden-services-based content distribution
network (CDN), (4) Decentralized anonymous credentials. Much thought and
development will also go into the applications that can be built upon the
proposed functionalities, and as a result, if successful, the end possibilities
are expected to be transformative. The training obtained by students during the
investigation spanning across cryptography, secure computation, and anonymized
communication networks are expected to result in a cohort with a distinctive,
important and useful set of skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
