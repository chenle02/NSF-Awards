This research focuses on developing scalable parallel file access methods for
multi-scale problem domain decompositions, such as the one presented in Adaptive
Mesh Refinement (AMR) based algorithms. Existing parallel I/O methods
concentrate on optimizing the process collaboration under a fairly evenly-
distributed request pattern. However, they are not suitable for data structures
in AMR, because the underlying data distribution is highly irregular and
dynamic. Process synchronization in the existing parallel I/O methods can
penalize the I/O parallelism if the process collaboration is not carefully
coordinated. &lt;br/&gt;This research addresses such synchronization issue by
developing scalable solutions in the Parallel netCDF library (PnetCDF),
particularly to address AMR structured data and its I/O patterns. PnetCDF is a
popular I/O library used by many computer simulation communities. A scalable
solution for storing and accessing AMR data in parallel is considered a
challenging task. This research will design a process-group based parallel I/O
approach to eliminate unrelated processes and thus avoid possible I/O
serialization. In addition, a new metadata representation will also be developed
in pnetCDF for conserving tree-structured AMR data relationship in a portable
form.
