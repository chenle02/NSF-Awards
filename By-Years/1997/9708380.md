9708380 Noakes & Jahnke This project will fund research at the Center for
Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS) to improve the state of the art for
instrumentation and techniques used to assess the environmental impacts of
sediment-associated contaminants. This research will enable rapid, large-scale
surveys of contaminated distributions to be conducted in conjunction with
detailed process studies of contaminant pore water- sediment partitioning and
seafloor-bottom water exchange. The result will be a rapid and cost-effective
approach to investigate relationships between the fate, distribution, and
bioavailability of sediment-associated contaminants that can be performed over
geographic regions having a broad areal extent. The first phase of the research
is to create an experimental model for laboratory and field testing and
evaluation. During the second year of the project, the experimental systems will
be field tested and evaluated for performance at a site in Charleston Harbor,
South Carolina.***
