The ninth in a series of Gordon Conferences on Atomic Physics will be held July
3-7, 1989 at Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. The meeting will deal
with emerging areas and major advances in existing areas, including new
developments in the field which occur in the first half of 1989. Both
theoretical and experimental programs are included. Topics may include atoms in
intense fields, laser cooling and trapping, hydrogenic systems, foundations of
quantum mechanics, tests of fundamental symmetries, negative ions and atom-
surface studies, and high resolution scattering cross sections in the KeV
region.
