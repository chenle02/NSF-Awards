Abstract CTS-9500076 Dibble This proposal is for funds to purchase new state of
the art equipment consisting of a combustion product sampling system for NOx,
CO2, CO, O2, and Total Hydrocarbons (THCs). This equipment will be used in
catalytic combustion studies, stationary gas turbine work, and appliance
combustion and porous burner projects. Although the requested equipment already
exists in the PI's laboratory it is vintage late 1970, difficult to maintain and
of lower sensitivity than the requested equipment. These programs will consist
of both an experimental and modeling components.
