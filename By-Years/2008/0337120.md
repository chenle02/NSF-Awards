The degassing behavior of a volcanic system is an integral part of the
seismicity it generates. In January 2002, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory
(MVO) installed a new gas monitoring system at Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV)
composed of two Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometers; these new sensors
allow continuous retrieval of sulfur dioxide spectra from the emitted plume, and
gas flux values every 1-6 minutes over the course of a working day. Initial
efforts will focus on calibrating the timing of SO2 degassing and seismic
activity, and correlation of changes in emitted SO2 fluxes to seismic triggers
from subsurface and near-surface motions. A magnitude scale will be developed
for SHV seismic events, based on the MVO seismic network database. This
magnitude scale will be used to constrain magnitude-frequency relationships for
SHV events (long-period and hybrid earthquakes, and rockfalls). Volcanic SO2
fluxes will be correlated to seismic event type, magnitudes, seismic amplitude
and timing by merging the SO2 and seismic data over active periods for
SHV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merging of high temporal resolution datasets will
allow better understanding of magma dynamics and evaluate current theories of
volatile and seismic characteristics, and improved eruption prediction
capabilities, by linking gas and seismic behavior to precursory activities in a
highly active volcanic system. This project will help establish baseline trends
and methodologies for most effective uses of gas flux data, as rapid SO2
measurement systems are incorporated into other volcano monitoring efforts. This
work also supports MVO's hazard mitigation infrastructure, through exploration
of the potential for a gas alert derived from automated gas flux
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
