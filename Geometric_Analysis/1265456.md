The conference "Encounters in Geometry" will take place June 3 to 7, 2013 in
Cabo Frio, Brazil. We have selected three topics that have been particularly
productive over the last few years, on which most talks will concentrate: 1)
manifolds with lower curvature bounds, including non-negative and positive
curvature; 2) Riemannian foliations, including the orbit geometry of group
actions; 3) submanifold geometry.

The grant will supply travel from the US to Rio de Janeiro for 10-15 graduate
students and 10-15 mathematicians from the US, with an emphasis on recent
Ph.D.'s. Local support is paid for by Brazilian grants. Participation by women
and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. The conference will
provide an environment for American graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s in
which they can learn about new developments in geometry, through research talks
by Brazilian and international experts. A second goal is to introduce geometers
in Brazil to subjects currently active in the US. The participants will also be
given an an opportunity to present their results through talks and poster
sessions.
