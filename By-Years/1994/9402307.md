9402307 Gee Sea surface magnetic anomaly profiles typically exhibit a short
wavelength acial high (called CAMH) over mid-oceanic ridges. In this project the
PIs will carry out a coring program to investigate the origin of this high. They
want to test the hypothesis whethr low-temperature alteration of the crust is
responsible for CAMH. Because this high is sensitive to age, the PIs argue that
a time scale may also be developed that will allow determination of ages of <30
k.y. old MORB.
